00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.870
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.147
Welcome back.

00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:10.730
So today I'd like
to look at a problem

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.070
on manipulating Fourier series.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.450
Specifically, we're
asked to find the Fourier

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.950
series of cosine 2t minus pi/4.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.310
And then the second problem
is given a square wave

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.100
function, which takes on
the value of minus 1 and 1,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.439
and it's 2pi periodic.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980
We're also told that the square
wave function has the Fourier

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.520
series 4/pi, 1/n sine n*t.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.670
And the question is to find the
Fourier series of three related

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.770
functions.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.910
So the first function takes
on the value of 0 and 4

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.960
on the intervals minus
pi to 0 and 0 to pi.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
Note that this function
is also 2pi periodic.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.870
The second problem it is
to find the Fourier series

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.590
of a function which is
minus 1 from minus 1 to 0,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.911
and 1 from 0 to 1.

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:00.410
So this is the
square wave function,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.700
but now has period two.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.319
And then lastly
we're asked to find

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.810
the Fourier series of a function
f of t, which is absolute t.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.930
And it's defined as
absolute t on the interval

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.270
from minus pi to pi.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.230
However this function
f is going to be

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.854
extended on the entire
domain with period 2pi.

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:21.520
So I'll let you think
about this problem

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.728
and I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.020
Hi everyone.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.460
Welcome back.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.210
So let's take a look
at the first problem,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.620
finding the Fourier series
of cosine 2t minus pi/4.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.370
So in this class when we say
find the Fourier series, what

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:00.990
we're really looking for are
coefficients a_0, a_n and b_n,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.110
such that, for example, we
can write our function out

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.470
as a sum of sine and cosines
with these values a_n and b_n.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.290
Now, what we could do is we
could take this function,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.040
plug it into the
integral formulas

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.100
and compute, using integrals,
the value a_0, a_n, and b_n.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.610
However, there's
a bit of a trick.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.160
And that's to realize that this
function, cosine 2t minus pi/4,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.320
is really just a
sinusoidal function

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.440
with a single frequency.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.340
And it's currently in
an amplitude-phase form.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.980
And we can always convert
an amplitude-phase form

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.230
of a sinusoidal function into
some amplitude times a sine

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.540
and some amplitude times a
cosine and add the two up.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.230
So specifically,
this can be done

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.860
by recalling the
cosine identity,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.065
cosine A minus B is
cosine A times cosine

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:14.820
B plus sine of A sine of B.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.240
And if we identify A
with 2t and B with pi/4,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.510
we obtain that f of
t is cosine 2t cosine

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.270
pi/4 plus sine 2t sine of pi/4.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.950
And now sine pi/4 and cosine
pi/4 are both 1 over root 2.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.330
So f of t becomes 1
over root 2 cosine 2t

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.450
plus 1 over root 2 sine 2t.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.960
And that's it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.040
So when we take a look at
this expression for f of t,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.410
we see that this is actually
in exactly the same form

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.130
that we were seeking in the
beginning, the Fourier series

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.730
representation for f.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.316
So this is the end
of the problem.

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:26.315
We don't have to actually
compute any integrals.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.160
So now let's take
a look at part two.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
So for part two, we're asked
to find the Fourier series

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.320
of several different functions.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.990
And I'll just take
a look at part one.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.720
So in this case, f of t
takes on the value of 0

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.560
from minus pi to zero, and
the value of 4 from 0 to pi.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:15.260
And if I were to quickly
sketch this function,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.630
it would look like a square
wave, 0, pi, minus pi.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.590
This is f of t.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.200
And we see that it's actually
related-- I can draw in dashes

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.440
just to be clear-- what
the original square wave

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.970
function might look like.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.530
So this is square wave of t.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.850
We see that if we were to
take the square wave function

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.900
and shift it up, the square
wave takes on values of plus 1

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.605
and minus 1.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:54.230
But if we take the
square wave function

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.000
and shift it up 1 unit,
and then rescale it,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.360
we'll then get the function
we're looking for, f of t.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.670
So specifically, we can
write f of t in terms

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.860
of the square wave as well.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.070
We have to shift the
square wave function up 1,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.820
and then we have to amplify
it by a factor of 2.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.750
So then when we seek the Fourier
series for f, all we have to do

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.910
is substitute the Fourier series
for the square wave function

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.410
in.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.870
So let's do this.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.650
So we have 1 plus 4/pi.

00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:35.790
So I'm writing here this Fourier
series for the square wave

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.840
function, n odd, 1/n sine n*t.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.250
So by manipulating the Fourier
series for the square wave

00:06:52.250 --> 00:07:01.990
function, we can arrive at
a Fourier series for f of t,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.380
n odd, 1/n sine n*t.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.150
So this is the first function.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.340
The second function f
of t-- I'll just rewrite

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.610
it again-- f of t takes
on the value of negative 1

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:34.030
from negative 1 to 0, and
takes on the value of plus 1

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.890
from 0 to 1.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.677
So it's somewhat useful to
draw, just to quickly sketch,

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:45.260
this function.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.875
And I'll draw in my axes here.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.040
So this is f of t.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.780
This is t.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.900
And it transitions.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.725
It makes its jumps
at the integers.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.790
So for example, it jumps
from plus 1 to minus 1 at 1,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.570
and from plus 1 to minus
1 at minus 1 as well.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.380
And if I were to just quickly
sketch the square wave function

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.929
underneath of it, the
square wave function

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:40.880
makes its transitions
at minus pi and pi.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.591
So this is the
square wave function.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:45.090
This is t.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.740
So we see that we can take
the square wave function

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.410
and squeeze it to obtain
this function f of t.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.125
And the question
now is, what factor

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:06.170
do we have to squeeze the square
wave function by to get f of t?

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.030
Well, usually what
I like to do is

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.560
take one characteristic
point in the sketch

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.630
for in this case the
square wave function.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.510
So a nice
characteristic point is

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.640
when the square wave
function has a 0,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.290
so when it goes
through the origin,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.840
and compare it to the same
point on this function f of t.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.770
So we see that the
point pi has to get

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.810
stretched to the point 1.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.460
So we basically need to take
the time axis in the square wave

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.020
function and squeeze
it by a factor of pi.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.480
So what this means
is that f of t

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.560
is going to be the square wave.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.700
And when we do what
mathematicians sometimes

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.650
called a dilatation, a
stretch or a squeeze.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.040
If we're squeezing
by some factor,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.150
that factor always appears in
the argument of the function

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.610
we're squeezing.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.440
If it's a stretch, then it would
be t over the stretch factor.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.660
And we can quickly check
here that if t equals 1,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.230
so as t goes from 0
to 1, so when t is 1,

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.680
the square wave function
is being evaluated at pi.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.390
And I'll now write out
the Fourier series.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:39.290
So this is going to be 4/pi, sum
of n odd, 1/n sine of n*pi*t.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.640
And there's another
quick check we can do.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.220
And that's this
function f we were told

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.469
is periodic with period 2.

00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:53.510
And if we just take a look
at this function here,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.690
the Fourier series
representation of it,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:02.630
we see that each sine n*pi*t is
in fact periodic with period 2.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.980
So that's just another quick,
back of the envelope check

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.650
that we've done our
calculation correctly.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.910
So this concludes part two.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.070
And then lastly than
for part three, f of t

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.340
is the absolute value of
t from minus pi to pi.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.520
And it's extended
beyond minus pi to pi

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.430
to make it 2pi periodic.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.390
And at first it might look
like this function f of t

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.620
is not related to the
square wave function.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.170
But if we look at it a
little more carefully,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.870
and analyze the
derivative of f of t,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.220
we see that this function
takes on the value plus 1

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.540
on the interval of 0 to pi and
takes on the value of minus 1

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.940
on the interval
of minus pi to 0.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.430
And this is exactly
the square wave.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.160
So what we can do
is we can write

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.545
f of t-- it's going to be an
integral of the square wave

00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:04.045
function.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:17.600
So specifically, we have
the integral of square wave,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:31.480
which is going to be the
integral of 4/pi 1/n sine n*t,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.890
summation n odd.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.310
And I'm going to leave this
as an indefinite integral.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.620
So when we integrate, we have
a constant of integration

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:57.190
c plus 4/pi sum of 1
over now n squared.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.340
And we have negative cosine n*t.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.390
And this is n odd again.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.650
And now we have one
last question to answer.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.010
What is the constant
of integration?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.000
Well, notice how the
constant of integration

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.660
can be identified with the
a_0 term of a Fourier series.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.930
So if we want the
constant of integration,

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.960
we can just
calculate it directly

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.390
by the integral formula for
the a_0 of this function.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.475
So what this means is c
is going to be 1/(2pi)--

00:13:37.475 --> 00:13:39.600
essentially it's just the
average of the function--

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:51.680
but it's pi to pi, the absolute
value of t, which is 1/pi,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.826
pi squared over 2.

00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:55.450
So we get pi/2.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.660
So just to quickly
recap, in this problem

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.080
we were given several
functions which were related

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.880
to the square wave function.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.330
And we started off
knowing what the Fourier

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.680
series for the square
wave function was.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.920
And by manipulating or
rewriting these functions

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.720
in terms of the
square wave function,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.616
we were able to compute
their Fourier series.

00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:21.240
And we were able to
do this essentially

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.600
without having to
evaluate any integrals.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.550
OK.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.090
So I hope you
enjoyed this problem,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.918
and I'll see you next time.
