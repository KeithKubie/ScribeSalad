i think when i originally began the work

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.050
i think when i originally began the work
 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.379
i think when i originally began the work
so this bodywork restarted almost 30

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389
so this bodywork restarted almost 30
 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.270
so this bodywork restarted almost 30
years ago and I'd say at that point I

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280
years ago and I'd say at that point I
 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.129
years ago and I'd say at that point I
mean I think I had a sense that there

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139
mean I think I had a sense that there
 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.599
mean I think I had a sense that there
was a a political undertone and the work

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609
was a a political undertone and the work
 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.009
was a a political undertone and the work
but it wasn't the motivating factor you

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019
but it wasn't the motivating factor you
 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.439
but it wasn't the motivating factor you
know it wasn't that you know I I wasn't

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449
know it wasn't that you know I I wasn't
 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.909
know it wasn't that you know I I wasn't
feeling that I was going to I was making

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919
feeling that I was going to I was making
 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.940
feeling that I was going to I was making
this work as a concerned photographer

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950
this work as a concerned photographer
 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.220
this work as a concerned photographer
trying to create change in this area I

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230
trying to create change in this area I
 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.380
trying to create change in this area I
was I thought chronicling a kind of

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390
was I thought chronicling a kind of
 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.340
was I thought chronicling a kind of
movement that I saw were where our

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350
movement that I saw were where our
 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.740
movement that I saw were where our
populations were growing at exponential

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
populations were growing at exponential
 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.029
populations were growing at exponential
rates and and you know I was focusing on

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039
rates and and you know I was focusing on
 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.630
rates and and you know I was focusing on
the the resource extraction industries

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
the the resource extraction industries
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.959
the the resource extraction industries
and coming to trying to understand

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969
and coming to trying to understand
 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.509
and coming to trying to understand
visually what's changed and what to me

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519
visually what's changed and what to me
 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.119
visually what's changed and what to me
was changing was that we've always taken

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129
was changing was that we've always taken
 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.670
was changing was that we've always taken
from nature so we are the ages of man go

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680
from nature so we are the ages of man go
 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.740
from nature so we are the ages of man go
back to the Stone Age and the Iron Age

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750
back to the Stone Age and the Iron Age
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.800
back to the Stone Age and the Iron Age
and the Bronze Age and the copper agent

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810
and the Bronze Age and the copper agent
 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.649
and the Bronze Age and the copper agent
these ages of man are all kind of you

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659
these ages of man are all kind of you
 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.760
these ages of man are all kind of you
know chronicled you know throughout the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770
know chronicled you know throughout the
 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.700
know chronicled you know throughout the
apology so we understand that you know

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
apology so we understand that you know
 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.289
apology so we understand that you know
we've gone through these but these ages

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299
we've gone through these but these ages
 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.060
we've gone through these but these ages
are so we still get stoned we still get

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070
are so we still get stoned we still get
 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.160
are so we still get stoned we still get
copper we still get iron but this scale

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170
copper we still get iron but this scale
 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.819
copper we still get iron but this scale
and speed of that taking has changed

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829
and speed of that taking has changed
 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.050
and speed of that taking has changed
dramatically and so I felt that the

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060
dramatically and so I felt that the
 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.999
dramatically and so I felt that the
large format camera and having worked in

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009
large format camera and having worked in
 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.649
large format camera and having worked in
those places because I did work in a

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659
those places because I did work in a
 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.499
those places because I did work in a
mining mine and I'd seen them that what

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509
mining mine and I'd seen them that what
 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.850
mining mine and I'd seen them that what
we don't see we don't see the scale of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860
we don't see we don't see the scale of
 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.050
we don't see we don't see the scale of
you know we see the scale of our cities

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
you know we see the scale of our cities
 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880
you know we see the scale of our cities
so here we are in a city new york city

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890
so here we are in a city new york city
 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.639
so here we are in a city new york city
and scale is you've never seen ever saw

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649
and scale is you've never seen ever saw
 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.770
and scale is you've never seen ever saw
a city before and you came to New York

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
a city before and you came to New York
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.870
a city before and you came to New York
could be overwhelming to see all the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
could be overwhelming to see all the
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.399
could be overwhelming to see all the
tall buildings you know just the sheer

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409
tall buildings you know just the sheer
 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.029
tall buildings you know just the sheer
volume of a built world that we've

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039
volume of a built world that we've
 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.380
volume of a built world that we've
created here but when I you know when I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
created here but when I you know when I
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.820
created here but when I you know when I
was going there and photographing that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
was going there and photographing that
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.150
was going there and photographing that
other side that to every act of creation

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
other side that to every act of creation
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.830
other side that to every act of creation
there's an equal or greater act of the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
there's an equal or greater act of the
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.589
there's an equal or greater act of the
struction and that we only take a

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
struction and that we only take a
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.009
struction and that we only take a
portion of the good stuff but there's a

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019
portion of the good stuff but there's a
 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.900
portion of the good stuff but there's a
lot of waste that's laid to you know

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
lot of waste that's laid to you know
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640
lot of waste that's laid to you know
that before we get to the good stuff

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
that before we get to the good stuff
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160
that before we get to the good stuff
whether it's the wood that we take or

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
whether it's the wood that we take or
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.259
whether it's the wood that we take or
you know if we take metals from or we're

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
you know if we take metals from or we're
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.610
you know if we take metals from or we're
only taking me be five percent of the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
only taking me be five percent of the
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070
only taking me be five percent of the
volume ninety-five percent ends up being

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
volume ninety-five percent ends up being
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.460
volume ninety-five percent ends up being
tailing so we're really disrupting much

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
tailing so we're really disrupting much
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.229
tailing so we're really disrupting much
larger grandeur scales of landscape so

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
larger grandeur scales of landscape so
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.690
larger grandeur scales of landscape so
to me that was an interesting thing to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
to me that was an interesting thing to
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.699
to me that was an interesting thing to
begin to try and find the yin to the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709
begin to try and find the yin to the
 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.460
begin to try and find the yin to the
yang you know the the destruction to the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
yang you know the the destruction to the
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.880
yang you know the the destruction to the
creation of the things that we build and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890
creation of the things that we build and
 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.380
creation of the things that we build and
but in the landscape and at a certain

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
but in the landscape and at a certain
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.190
but in the landscape and at a certain
point I began to understand it as a loss

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
point I began to understand it as a loss
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.170
point I began to understand it as a loss
for nature that as we were expanding

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
for nature that as we were expanding
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.330
for nature that as we were expanding
nature was being chewed away and then I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340
nature was being chewed away and then I
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880
nature was being chewed away and then I
began to understand the work as a kind

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
began to understand the work as a kind
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.680
began to understand the work as a kind
of uh that there was a kind of

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690
of uh that there was a kind of
 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.630
of uh that there was a kind of
melancholy or sadness to it but it was a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
melancholy or sadness to it but it was a
 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.610
melancholy or sadness to it but it was a
lament for the loss of that place that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620
lament for the loss of that place that
 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.670
lament for the loss of that place that
we've called nature that it's losing out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680
we've called nature that it's losing out
 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.199
we've called nature that it's losing out
in this battle between what we need and

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
in this battle between what we need and
 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.210
in this battle between what we need and
what's available and where it's found

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
what's available and where it's found
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.509
what's available and where it's found
and and so wherever that place is is

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519
and and so wherever that place is is
 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.680
and and so wherever that place is is
being hammered you know for for to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
being hammered you know for for to
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.050
being hammered you know for for to
supply the things that we need so and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
supply the things that we need so and
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.000
supply the things that we need so and
then I began to see nature is really

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
then I began to see nature is really
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.580
then I began to see nature is really
just an open cupboard where you know

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590
just an open cupboard where you know
 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.440
just an open cupboard where you know
we're just were raiding the cupboards

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
we're just were raiding the cupboards
 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.599
we're just were raiding the cupboards
you know and taking everything as

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609
you know and taking everything as
 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.080
you know and taking everything as
absolutely fast as we can and now you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
absolutely fast as we can and now you
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.210
absolutely fast as we can and now you
know and as I've kind of gone on to to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
know and as I've kind of gone on to to
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.039
know and as I've kind of gone on to to
begin to understand that you know I see

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049
begin to understand that you know I see
 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.559
begin to understand that you know I see
our oceans as a you know opening up the

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569
our oceans as a you know opening up the
 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.300
our oceans as a you know opening up the
covers and just attacking it you know

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310
covers and just attacking it you know
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.479
covers and just attacking it you know
with the ferociousness that is like

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489
with the ferociousness that is like
 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.920
with the ferociousness that is like
breathtaking so I think the work never

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
breathtaking so I think the work never
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.199
breathtaking so I think the work never
was intended to be political but the

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209
was intended to be political but the
 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.449
was intended to be political but the
political reading as a result of our

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
political reading as a result of our
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.849
political reading as a result of our
becoming more aware of the collective

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
becoming more aware of the collective
 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.610
becoming more aware of the collective
human impact on the planet is coalescing

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
human impact on the planet is coalescing
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.370
human impact on the planet is coalescing
to I think give the work a political

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380
to I think give the work a political
 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.449
to I think give the work a political
undertone or reading that with maybe

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
undertone or reading that with maybe
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.060
undertone or reading that with maybe
either ones more than I originally
