00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.190
is practice squaring binomials,
and this is something

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.720
that we've done in the
past, but we're gonna do it

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.900
with slightly more involved expressions.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.370
But let's just start with
a little bit of review.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.520
If I were to ask you,
what is a plus b squared,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.353
what would that be?

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:16.690
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.073
Well some of you might immediately know

00:00:18.073 --> 00:00:22.530
what a binomial like this
squared is, but I'll work it out.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.390
So this is the same thing
as a plus b times a plus b.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.720
And then we could multiply
this a times that a.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.710
So that's going to give us a squared.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.490
And then I can multiply
that a times that b,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.490
and that's going to give us ab.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.810
Then I could multiply this b times that a.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.570
I could write that as ba or ab,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.410
so I'll just write it as ab again.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.730
And then I multiply this b times that b,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.650
so plus b squared.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.020
And what I really just did

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.800
is apply the distributive property twice.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.897
We go into a lot of
detail in previous videos.

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:57.700
Some people also like to
call it the FOIL method.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.680
Either way, this should all be a review.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.900
If it's not, I encourage you to look

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.559
at those introductory videos.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.310
But this is going to simplify to a squared

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.720
plus we have an ab and another ab,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.428
so you add those together,
you get two ab plus b squared.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.587
Now why did I go through this review?

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:18.650
Well now we can use this
idea that a plus b squared

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.450
is equal to a squared
plus two ab plus b squared

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.420
to tackle things

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.960
that at least look a
little bit more involved.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.700
So if I were to ask you,
what is five x to the sixth

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.010
plus four squared,
pause this video and try

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.843
to figure it out.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:36.093
And try to keep this and this in mind.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.720
Well there is several ways
you could approach this.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.330
You could just expand this
out the way we just did,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.310
or you could recognize this pattern

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.010
that we just established.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.890
That if I have an a
plus b and I square it,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.080
it's going to be this.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.360
And so what you might notice is,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.550
the role of a is being
played by five x to the sixth

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.843
right over there, and the role
of b is being played by four

00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:01.340
right over there.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.183
So we could say, hey, this
is going to be equal to

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:08.100
a squared, we have our a squared there.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.130
So what is a squared?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.460
Well five x to the sixth squared is going

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.820
to be 25 x to the 12th power.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.520
And then it's going to be
plus two times a times b.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.060
So plus two times five x
to the sixth times four.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.150
Actually let me just write it out

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.380
just so we don't confuse ourselves.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.095
Two times five x to the,
I'll color code it too,

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:37.095
two times five x to the
sixth times four, times four,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.040
plus b squared.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.400
So plus four squared, so
that's going to be plus 16.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.750
And then we can simplify this.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.290
So this is going to be
equal to 25 x to the 12th.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.410
Two times five times four is 40.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.430
Two times five is 10 times four is 40.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.430
So plus 40 x to the sixth plus 16.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.820
Let's do another example.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.310
And I'll do this one
even a little bit faster,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.100
just because we're getting,
I think, pretty good at this.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.380
So let's say we're trying to determine

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.060
what three t squared

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.130
minus seven t to the
sixth power squared is.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.953
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:21.740
All right we're going
to do it together now.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.160
So this is our a, and
our b now we should view

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.060
as negative seven t to the sixth.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.010
Because this says plus b, so
you could view this as plus

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.870
negative seven t to the sixth.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.150
We could even write that if we wanted.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.670
We could write this plus
negative seven t to the sixth

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.540
if it helps us recognize
this whole thing as b.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.010
So this is going to be equal to a squared,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.377
which is nine t to the fourth,

00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:49.540
plus two times this times this,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.130
two times a times b.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.130
So two times three t squared
is going to be six t squared

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.790
times negative seven t to the sixth.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.860
Actually let me write this out.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.600
This is getting a little bit complicated.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.600
So this is going to be plus
two times three t squared

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.260
times negative seven t to the sixth power.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.550
And then last but not
least, we're going to square

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.070
negative seven t to the sixth.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.030
So that's going to be negative
seven squared is positive 49,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.440
and t to the sixth
squared is t to the 12th,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.950
t to the 12th power.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.470
And so this is going to be
equal to nine t to the fourth,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.450
and let's see, two times three is six

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.540
times negative seven is negative 42,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.840
and t squared times t to the
sixth, we add the exponents,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.760
we have the same base, so it's
going to be t to the eighth.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760
And then we have plus
49 t to the 12th power.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.290
So it looks like we did
something really fancy.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.810
We have this higher degree polynomial.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.910
We were squaring this binomial that has

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.320
these higher degree terms.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.770
But we're really just
applying the same idea

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.890
that we learned many many many videos ago,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.057
many many lessons ago, in terms
of just squaring binomials.
