SAL KHAN: This is Sal here
with famous Indy car driver--

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.070
smiling when I said
famous-- JR Hildebrand.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.160
And since you're
here, I thought I

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.520
would ask a question that's
always been on my mind.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.353
JR HILDEBRAND: Yeah.

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.420
SAL KHAN: We have a picture
here of the Indianapolis Motor

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.080
Speedway.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.869
And I've always
wondered how you--

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.160
it seems like turning is a
very important part of the--

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.620
JR HILDEBRAND: It's
absolutely an important part

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.160
of what we're doing.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.710
SAL KHAN: --of the race.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.400
JR HILDEBRAND:
People get fixated

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.530
on the car going straight.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.960
But the turning part
is pretty important.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.233
SAL KHAN: Turning seems
to be the part where

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.630
a lot of the skill
comes into it.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.830
And I've always wondered,
what is optimal?

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.060
Do y'all try to minimize your
distance and kind of take

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.140
the turn as quickly or as in
short of a distance as possible

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.550
by really hugging the
corner, by going like that?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.310
But when you do that,
you have to turn more.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.360
There's more g-forces.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.960
There's more kind
of centripetal force

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.190
that your tires
have to deal with,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.650
the human has to deal with.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.480
Versus taking the
outside where you

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.330
have to cover more distance, but
the centripetal acceleration,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.039
the g-forces aren't
going to be as dramatic.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.330
So how do you think about that?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.996
JR HILDEBRAND: Well,
every track ends up

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:10.450
being a little bit different.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.276
But when we take Indianapolis
here as the example,

00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:14.650
if you're already
on the inside--

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.240
it's like the 800 meter
runner's kind of path.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.370
It's the shortest distance.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.550
You can kind of get
from point A to point

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.290
B. The lap is the same every
time, so it doesn't actually

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.300
depend on you running a
specific distance or not.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.680
For us, in this example, the
car actually just won't do that.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.020
If you think about being
all the way on the inside,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.440
being all the way on the
inside through the corner,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.231
and then exiting all
the way on the inside,

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:40.070
it's having to do the most
work to follow that path.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.810
And in Indianapolis,
we're approaching

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.300
turn one at upwards
of 240 miles per hour.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.150
And that turn one is
not-- it's hardly banked.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.000
It looks quite flat in person.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.750
So as opposed to NASCAR running
at Talladega or Daytona,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.140
these big, giant
super speedways,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010
the car is having to
do quite a lot of work

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.847
to get through the corner here.

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:03.930
SAL KHAN: So how do you--?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.194
Do you take the outside or--?

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:06.860
JR HILDEBRAND: So
then you look at that.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.330
And I think if you
noted the radius--

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.980
if you drew a full circle
out of each of those arcs--

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980
SAL KHAN: Let's do that.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.188
So let's say that this is
the shortest distance path.

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.859
This is kind of a circle that
looks something like this.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.400
Let me scroll over
a little bit so we

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.670
can see a little bit better.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.310
So this would be
a circle like this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.220
if you were to keep that arc.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.400
It would be a circle that
looks something like this.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.280
JR HILDEBRAND: So that's
a pretty small circle

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.450
in the grand scheme
of things here, yeah.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.050
SAL KHAN: That's a small circle.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.466
And for the larger
one, the circle

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.430
would look something like this.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.100
So you have a larger radius,
a larger turning radius.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.560
So you would have to have
less centripetal acceleration,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.960
inward acceleration,
and fewer g-forces

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.190
on this outside one, the
larger the circle is.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.320
JR HILDEBRAND: Right.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.310
And a different
way to look at it,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.036
if you looked at the car trying
to just go around these two

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:53.410
different circles,
and it's going

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.190
to be going the same
speed on either one,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.070
it's doing a lot less work to
get around this outside circle.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.090
And therefore the speed that
you could carry around that,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.230
that sort of goes up.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.800
The car has a limited ability
to stick to the racetrack.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.040
So opening that up definitely
makes a difference.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.750
SAL KHAN: But that's
an important point.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.462
At least in Indianapolis, you're
full throttle the entire way.

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.170
I mean, obviously, if
you hit the brakes,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
the car could do a very
small turning radius.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.130
But you're at full throttle.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.530
You're not going to have any
chance if you at all let off

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.970
the gas.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.300
JR HILDEBRAND: That's right.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.674
When you qualify
at Indianapolis,

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:26.760
you've got to put in four
laps, four of your best laps

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.340
of the season, of your career
in Indianapolis to qualify.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.320
And that you are
absolutely flat trap

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.150
all the way around
the racetrack.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.941
There's no lifting.

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.930
There's no braking.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.480
SAL KHAN: And so
that's why you're

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.700
saying the car just
wouldn't do that.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.050
If you're going all
out, the car just

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.716
wouldn't even be able
to make this path.

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:40.770
JR HILDEBRAND: Exactly.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.603
That's a good point.

00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:43.180
From the driver's
perspective, you

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.347
have to stay flat out if
you're going to go fast.

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:47.430
If you're going to set a
lap time that's relevant,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.020
you have to be able
to stay flat out.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.020
And so at that point,
you're searching

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.790
for the line around
the race track

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.110
that you can do that
most efficiently.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.880
And so then, in this
example, increasing

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.620
that radius by going
from our green circle

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.724
out to the purple circle
does that rather effectively.

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:05.390
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.223
We're going for the
purple to the green back

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:08.967
to-- so you're saying like this.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.050
JR HILDEBRAND: Well, yeah.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.250
And so then to find the actual
optimal line, what we end up

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.640
doing is starting out on
the outside of the track,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.040
then bending the car into
the inside of the track,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.190
and going back to the
outside of the track,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.834
really using all of the
road that's available to us.

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:25.500
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.416
So that's interesting.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.270
So when I posed the
question, it was

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.720
kind of like my brain was just
looking at these two circles.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.060
But you realize there's a bigger
circle that you could fit here,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.800
that there's an arc like this.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.316
And this would be,
if you imagine,

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:39.940
this would be a part
of a circle that's

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.295
way huger than even that purple
circle that we're drawing.

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:47.200
So that center of that circle
is like here or something.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.670
So you have a lot less
centripetal acceleration

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.530
that you have to place,
inward acceleration

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.550
that you have to
place on the car.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.508
JR HILDEBRAND: Exactly.

00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:56.840
And therefore, the
car is able to carry

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.012
a massively increased level
of speed through the corner.

00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:01.720
And that's really what
we're looking for.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.220
And you consider, I think
it's a very interesting-- when

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.180
I think about what I'm
doing as the driver,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.200
I don't think I
really am consciously

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.000
thinking that much about
the mathematics that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.620
go into finding this
optimal racing line.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.100
You sort of instinctually
just gravitate

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.096
towards what the car
feels like it wants to do.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:23.970
But when we look at it
from this perspective,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.010
you've got the car going
down the straight away here.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.000
It's at 240 miles per hour.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.160
That's almost as fast as
the car is going to go.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.780
So it's just this sort
of terminal velocity.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.149
The drag of the
air hitting the car

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.940
won't allow it to go
much faster than that.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.750
SAL KHAN: The engine's
giving all the power it can.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.960
JR HILDEBRAND: Yeah.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.640
You're absolutely flat out.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.270
SAL KHAN: And that's just
offsetting the drag of that,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.420
so that you can't accelerate
to that top speed.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.720
JR HILDEBRAND: Exactly.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.610
It's almost like you're hitting
a wall of air at that point.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.620
You're not going to be able
to accelerate any faster.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.230
And so what you're
really trying to do

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.110
is you're trying to-- in
order to set that fastest lap

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.930
time, which ends up
equating to the highest

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.680
average speed around the
lap, that's what's the lowest

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.060
number in terms of lap time
perspective-- you're trying

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.230
to get the car to
most efficiently get

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.220
through the corners so that you
can allow it to accelerate down

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.090
the straights as
much as you can.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.750
You're getting it to diverge
from this intended course that

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.280
is going on here as
efficiently as you can.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.860
And so by creating the largest
radius around the corner,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.170
that's how we end up
finding that optimal line.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.860
SAL KHAN: That's fascinating.
