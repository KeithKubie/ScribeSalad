00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.720
So if you look at each
of these 4 by 6 grids,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.800
it's pretty clear that there's
24 of these green circle

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.150
things in each of them.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.940
But what I want to show
you is that you can get 24

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.850
as the product of three numbers
in multiple different ways.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.140
And it actually doesn't matter
which products you take first

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.760
or what order you
actually do them in.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.190
So let's think about this first.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.970
So the way that
I've colored it in,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.270
I have these three groups of 4.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.030
If you look at the
blue highlighting,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.273
this is one group of 4, two
groups of 4, three groups of 4.

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:32.189
Actually, let me make
it a little bit clearer.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
One group of 4, two groups
of 4, and three groups of 4.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.380
So these three columns you
could view as 3 times 4.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.020
Now, we have another 3
times 4 right over here.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.930
This is also 3 times 4.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.000
We have one group of
4, two groups of 4,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.220
and three groups of 4.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.630
So you could view these
combined as 2 times 3 times 4.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.840
We have one 3 times 4.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.890
And then we have
another 3 times 4.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.480
So the whole thing we could
view as-- let me give myself

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.180
some more space-- as 2 times--
let me do that in blue-- 2

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.050
times 3 times 4.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.890
That's the total
number of balls here.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.620
And you could see it based
on how it was colored.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.950
And of course, if you did 3
times 4 first, you get 12.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.540
And then you multiply
that times 2,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
you get 24, which is the total
number of these green circle

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.000
things.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.140
And I encourage you now to
look at these other two.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.310
Pause the video and
think about what

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.810
these would be the
product of, first

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.226
looking at the
blue grouping, then

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.237
looking at the purple
grouping in the same way

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:43.820
that we did right over here, and
verify that the product still

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.700
equals 24.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.560
Well, I assume that
you've paused the video.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.100
So you see here in this first, I
guess you could call it a zone,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.160
we have two groups of 4.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.410
So this is 2 times
4 right over here.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.030
We have one group of
4, another group of 4.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.540
That's 2 times 4.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.760
We have one group of
4, another group of 4.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.970
So this is also 2 times 4 if
we look in this purple zone.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.470
One group of 4,
another group of 4.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.510
So this is also 2 times 4.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.160
So we have three 2 times 4's.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.060
So if we look at each of
these, or all together,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.490
this is 3 times 2 times
4, so 3 times 2 times 4.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.920
Notice I did a different order.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.540
And here I did 3 times 4 first.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.570
Here I'm doing 2 times 4 first.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.895
But just like before,
2 times 4 is 8.

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:41.220
8 times 3 is still equal
to 24, as it needs to,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.960
because we have exactly 24
of these green circle things.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.650
Once again, pause the video
and try to do the same here.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.520
Look at the groupings
in blue, then look

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.140
at the groupings
in purple, and try

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.770
to express these 24 as some
kind of product of 2, 3, and 4.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.480
Well, you see first we
have these groupings of 3.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.810
So we have one grouping
of 3 in this purple zone,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.300
two groupings of 3
in this purple zone.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.030
So you could do
that as 2 times 3.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.860
And we have one 3 and another 3.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.970
So in this purple zone,
this is another 2 times 3.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.030
We have another 2 times 3.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.530
Whoops.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.090
I wrote 2 times 2.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.050
2 times 3.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.160
We have another 2 times 3.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.050
And then finally, we
have a fourth 2 times 3.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.530
So how many 2 times
3's do we have here?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.000
Well, we have one, two,
three, four 2 times 3's.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.430
So this whole thing could be
written as 4 times 2 times 3.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.240
Now, what's this
going to be equal to?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.130
Well, it needs to
be equal to 24.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.480
And we can verify 2 times 3
is 6 times 4 is, indeed, 24.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.860
So the whole idea of what
I'm trying to show here

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.100
is that the order in which
you multiply does not matter.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.630
Let me make this very clear.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.990
Let me pick a different example,
a completely new example.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:20.360
So let's say that I
have 4 times 5 times 6.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.570
You can do this multiplication
in multiple ways.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.960
You could do 4 times 5 first.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.740
Or you could do 4
times 5 times 6 first.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740
And you can verify that.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.156
I encourage you
to pause the video

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.262
and verify that these two
things are equivalent.

00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:37.470
And this is actually called
the associative property.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.450
It doesn't matter how you
associate these things, which

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.830
of these that you do first.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.410
Also, order does not matter.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.950
And we've seen that
multiple times.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.050
Whether you do this or
you do 5 times 4 times

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.150
6-- notice I swapped the 5
and 4-- this doesn't matter.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.220
Or whether you do this
or 6 times 5 times 4,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.970
it doesn't matter.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.320
Here I swapped the
6 and the 5 times 4.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.150
All of these are going to
get the exact same value.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.190
And I encourage you
to pause the video.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.840
So when we're talking
about which one

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.456
we do first, whether we do the 4
times 5 first or the 5 times 6,

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.080
that's called the
associative property.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.150
It's kind of fancy word for
a reasonably simple thing.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.400
And when we're saying
that order doesn't matter,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.390
when it doesn't matter whether
we do 4 times 5 or 5 times 4,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.310
that's called the
commutative property.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.670
And once again, fancy word
for a very simple thing.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.530
It's just saying it doesn't
matter what order I do it in.
