[MUSIC]

00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:04.810
JODI SCHOTTENFELD-ROAMES: MOL 350 is really 
designed to prepare students as juniors

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.420
to be able to walk into
their labs as seniors,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.850
perform their senior thesis,
already have the ability

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.040
to read primary literature.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.300
So they work with
drosophila and they're

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.391
focusing on the tracheal
system of flies.

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.890
It's incredibly analogous to
the vertebrate vascular system.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.098
They're doing what's called
amino fluorescence, where

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:21.970
they're tagging
certain proteins,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.860
and then they're using
a microscope called

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.940
a confocal microscope so that
they can visualize the stains

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.630
that they're looking at.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.900
EVELYN WU: Being exposed to these
experimental techniques

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.270
early on helps us understand not
just the steps that we're doing

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.670
but really understand why
we are doing these steps.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.720
ANNIE CHOI: By looking at the
confocal microscope,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.350
we actually know how
the results would

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.540
look like in an
actual microscope

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.470
rather than being given the
example image in a textbook.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.900
EVELYN WU: To be able to
generate that image

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.890
ourselves is really,
really exciting.
