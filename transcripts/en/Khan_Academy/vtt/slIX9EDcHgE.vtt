00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
- [Voiceover] Let's try now

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.233
to subtract some two-digit numbers.

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:06.592
Over here, we have 65 minus 23,

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.266
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.266
and see if you could figure this out.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.900
I'm assuming you've had a try at it.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.916
Let's do it together.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:19.166
The way I like to do it is
I start in the ones place,

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.909
and the numbers in the ones place

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.673
I've colored them in in yellow,

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.333
so this right over here is the ones place.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.366
This over here in purple
is the tens place.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.468
I could even do a column here,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:35.666
where everything in yellow,
this is the ones column.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.740
I guess you could think of it that way,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.500
everything there is in the ones place.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.033
They're representing a
certain number of ones,

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.787
and then everything in the second column,

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.866
everything in the second
column is in the tens place.

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.233
They represent a certain number,

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.066
a certain number of tens.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.800
65 is six 10s and five ones.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.766
23 is two 10s and three ones.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.346
One way to do it is, say,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:59.159
let's look at the ones place first.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.366
I'm taking three ones away from five ones.

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.840
Five ones minus three ones is two ones.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.833
Then, you can go to the tens place.

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:14.600
Six 10s minus two 10s, well,
that's going to be four 10s,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.900
four 10s, and there you have it.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.266
This is equal to 42, and once again,

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.666
I could have written it multiple ways.

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.458
I could have written it like this.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.113
I could have written 65

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:30.577
as 6 tens, six tens,

00:01:30.577 --> 00:01:33.981
+ 5 ones, plus 5 ones.

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.373
I didn't write over here
because when I have something

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.266
in this place, that means it's tens,

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.800
but here I can write it out, 6 tens.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.300
If I'm subtracting 23,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.100
that's the same thing
as subtracting two 10s,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.057
subtracting 2 tens,

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:52.707
and then subtracting three ones,

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:57.671
and then subtracting 3 ones,

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:01.600
subtracting 3 ones.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:03.470
What's that going to be?

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:08.923
Well, 5 ones - 3 ones is
exactly what we have over here.

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:11.624
It's going to be 2 ones,

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:15.388
and 6 tens - 2 tens,

00:02:15.388 --> 00:02:19.200
well, that's just going
to be 4 tens, 4 tens.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:22.995
6 tens + 5 ones - 2 tens - 3 ones

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:24.776
is going to be 4 tens and 2 ones,

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:28.133
four 10s and two ones, or 42.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:32.773
42 is equal to 4 tens + 2 ones.

00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:35.233
Hopefully, that makes
a little bit of sense.
