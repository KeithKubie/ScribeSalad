00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.149
- [Instructor] Robert was
asked to find where g of x,

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.198
which is equal to the cube root
of x, has inflection points.

00:00:06.198 --> 00:00:08.295
This is his solution.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:12.267
And then later we are asked,
"Is Robert's work correct?

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:14.460
"If not, what's his mistake?"

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.332
So pause this video and try
to figure it out on your own.

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:19.903
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:24.204
So our original g of x is
equal to the cube root of x,

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:26.991
which is the same thing as x to the 1/3.

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.848
So in step one it looks
like Robert's trying

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:30.777
to find the first and second derivative.

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:32.554
So the first derivative,
we just do the power rule,

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:35.089
so it'll be 1/3x to the
decrement of the exponent,

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.990
so this is looking good.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.950
Second derivative, we take
this, multiply this times 1/3,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.651
which would be negative 2/9.

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:44.385
And then decrement, negative 2/3,

00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:47.784
which would indeed by negative
5/3, so that looks right.

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:49.830
And then it looks like
Robert's trying to rewrite it.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.114
So we have the negative 2/9 still,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.955
but then he recognized
that this is the same thing

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.531
as x to 5/3 in the denominator,

00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.931
and x to the 5/3 is the same thing

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:02.954
as the cube root of x to the fifth.

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:04.107
So this is all looking good.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:06.464
Step one looks good.

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:08.503
And then step two, it
looks like he's trying

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.962
to find the solution or
he's trying to find x values

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.377
where the second derivative
is equal to zero,

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:17.215
and it is indeed true
that this has no solution,

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.680
that you can never make
this second derivative

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.558
equal to zero.

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:22.621
In order to be zero, the
numerator would have to be zero.

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.347
And, well, two is never
going to be equal to zero.

00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:27.724
So this is correct.

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:29.114
And then step three,

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.763
he says g doesn't have
any inflection points.

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:35.354
Now, this is a little bit suspect.

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:38.797
It is in many cases our
inflection point is a situation

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.861
where our second derivative
is equal to zero,

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:44.007
and even then we don't know
it's an inflection point.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.560
It would be a candidate inflection point.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.773
We would have to confirm

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.063
that our second derivative crosses signs

00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:51.980
or switches signs as
we cross that x value.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.790
But here we can't find a situation

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.767
where our second derivative
is equal to zero,

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.543
but we have to remind ourselves

00:01:57.543 --> 00:01:59.489
that other candidate inflection points

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.905
are where our second
derivative is undefined.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.868
And so he can't make this
statement without seeing

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:08.816
where our second derivative
could be undefined.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:11.347
So, for example, he could say

00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:14.847
that g prime prime is undefined when what?

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.249
Well, this is going to be undefined

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.091
when x is equal to zero.

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:24.355
Zero to the fifth, cube root
of that, that's gonna be zero.

00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:26.256
But then you're dividing by zero.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:29.746
So g prime prime undefined
when x is equal to zero.

00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:33.913
So therefore x equals,
so we could say candidate

00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:41.748
inflection point when x equals zero.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.157
And so then we would want to test it.

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.133
And we could set up a traditional table

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:52.835
that you might have seen before

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.168
where we have our interval or intervals.

00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:01.758
We could have test
values in our intervals.

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:03.091
We have to be careful with those.

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:04.829
Make sure that they are indicative.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.329
And then we would say the sign

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:11.992
of our second derivative of g prime prime.

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:15.084
And then we would have our concavity.

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:16.334
Concavity of g.

00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:20.827
And in order for x equals zero
to be an inflection point,

00:03:20.827 --> 00:03:22.877
we would have to switch signs,

00:03:22.877 --> 00:03:25.216
or our second derivative
would have to switch signs

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:27.285
as we cross x equals zero,

00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:29.905
which would mean our
concavity of g switches signs

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.393
as we cross x equals zero.

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:34.159
So let's do values less than zero,

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.910
negative infinity to zero

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.954
and then values greater
than zero, zero to infinity.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.231
I could do test values.

00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.586
Let's say, I'll use negative one and one.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.192
And you have to be careful
when you use these.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.565
You have to make sure
that we are close enough

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:53.127
that nothing unusual happens
between these test values

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:56.515
up until we get to that
candidate inflection point.

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.263
And, now, what's the sign
of our second derivative

00:03:58.263 --> 00:04:00.215
when x is equal to negative one?

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:02.032
When x equals negative one.

00:04:02.032 --> 00:04:03.556
So, let's see, negative one

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:06.150
to the fifth power is negative one.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.149
Cube root of negative one is negative one.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.590
And so we're gonna have negative 2/9

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.477
divided by negative one.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:14.269
It's gonna be positive 2/9.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.237
So our sign right over
here is gonna be positive.

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:19.556
And this is gonna be in general

00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:21.305
when we're dealing with
any negative value,

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:23.280
'cause if you take any negative
value to the fifth power,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.535
it's gonna be negative.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.055
And you take the cube root of that

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:27.263
and you're gonna have negative.

00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:28.967
But then you have a negative
value divided by that.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:30.233
You're gonna get a positive value.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:32.105
So you can feel good that
this test value's indicative

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.935
of actually this entire interval.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.934
And if you're dealing
with a positive value,

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:37.908
well, that to the fifth
power is gonna be positive.

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:40.420
Cube root of that is still
going to be positive.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.746
But then you're gonna have negative 2/9

00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:43.357
divided by that positive value,

00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:45.192
so this is going to be negative.

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:48.843
So it is indeed the case that
our concavity of g switches

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:50.285
as we cross x equals zero.

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:53.879
We're concave upwards
when x is less than zero.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.884
Our second derivative is positive.

00:04:55.884 --> 00:05:00.693
And we're concave downwards
when x is greater than zero.

00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:02.084
Let me write that a little bit.

00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:03.670
Downwards.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.087
Downwards when x is greater than zero.

00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:12.815
So we are switching concavity
as we cross x equals zero,

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.828
and so this tells us that x.

00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:18.766
So let's see, we are switching signs.

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:20.210
Switching.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.543
Let me say g prime prime switching signs

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.953
as we cross x equals zero.

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:32.967
And our function is
defined at x equals zero.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:36.384
And function defined at x equals zero.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:45.251
So we have an inflection
point at x equals zero.

00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.001
So inflection point at x is equal to zero.

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:57.276
And if you're familiar with
the graph of the cube root,

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:02.006
you would indeed see an
inflection point at that point.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:03.204
So there we go.

00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:04.299
He was wrong in step three.

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:05.634
There actually is an inflection point.

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:07.545
It's not when the second
derivative is equal to zero.

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:10.703
It's actually where the second
derivative is undefined.
