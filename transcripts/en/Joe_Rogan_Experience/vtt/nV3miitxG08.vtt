1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.360
What's up bro? How are you? Good to see you outside the store.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.060
I know that where when you're running into a comedian that you don't normally

3
00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:08.350
hang out with outside the store.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.170
I mean I would recognize you but sometimes you'll meet someone that you met at a

5
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:14.690
meeting and then it's like at a Ralph and you can't place the context that's

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.370
bad.

7
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.610
Especially if it's like an executive and they really like you remember them or

8
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:23.380
you good at faking it? Nope. Terrible. It's your tell. I just say, I don't know.

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.840
I'm sorry. I'm sorry where you go.

10
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.320
It's good seeing you instead of Nice meeting you. Nope,

11
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.350
I've done nice meeting you. And they've go, we've met five times.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.280
I don't even know shit.

13
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.490
I don't think people understand the volume of people that Comedians,

14
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.480
especially at your level like come across every day like how many shows we do.

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
People come up to you afterwards and being like, oh great, sad, blah blah blah.

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.090
And how many meetings in generals are you aware of? Dunbar's number. Oh,

17
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.650
is that like how many number of people? It's like a hundred or something.

18
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.710
So you can keep in your head, get some, I don't think it's an exact science,

19
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:56.890
but I think they think it's somewhere around 150 I believe that you got about

20
00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:01.490
150 people in your head and after that you fucked. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.340
It's tough. It makes sense, right?

22
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:06.490
There's no way you can keep them all in there. No, that doesn't make any sense.

23
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.320
It's cool. I'll tell you the store, you know, having a chat. Yeah.

24
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.170
It's like you,

25
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.890
you feel the most comradery with other comedians outside the store when you run

26
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:17.920
into them at an airport. I was just thinking about that.

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.110
Every time I go to Lex I'll bump into like someone Joe coy or last time it was

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.040
Bert Kreischer. In the case of straight over, we're going to do, I think Utah.

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.270
It's just like a hub for all of us. Yes. So you'll see so many,

30
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.590
cause we're all just transients.

31
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.350
We're here for the middle of the week and then when the weekends come for the

32
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.720
clubs, we're all going somewhere like,

33
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.730
oh we want to come to the store at Tuesday's.

34
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:42.100
Like probably the best night and people don't understand why.

35
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.880
Like it's so stacked. Like why is it you? Why is it Bert? Why is it Christ?

36
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.460
Or why is it Joey Diaz like, well we're just biding time until the weekend.

37
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.520
Right, and practicing. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.580
It's the one of the weird art forms that you can't pray.

39
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.200
You can't practice alone. You have to use an audience. Yeah, don't think,

40
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.093
oh for sure.

41
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.640
And even like I'll be telling the same joke and I won't really change the words,

42
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.130
but it'll be like an inflection. It's almost like,

43
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.060
I don't know when a jazz musician or something like plays a note just a little

44
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.340
differently. You know? You ever notice that like a job won't work?

45
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.250
Maybe cause I'm, I'm like making a meal out of this word,

46
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
but if I kind of just like throw it away. Yeah. Oh now that fixes it.

47
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.020
It's interesting to do it long enough where you realize it's like it's not the

48
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:25.030
words. Sometimes you,

49
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.600
there's like a performance nuance to it to fix the joke. Like it's on paper.

50
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.434
It's the same joke,

51
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.670
but you know what's really weird is that none of this shit is written anywhere.

52
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.600
Like what we're talking about. You know what the worst is like I did, um,

53
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.450
JFL they're doing a taping out there for TV and they're like send us your

54
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:45.160
transcript. So that means you have to sit at a computer and like it, right.

55
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.940
It takes the magic like whatever your seven minutes you want to do for the

56
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:49.774
taping,

57
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.010
they want you to sit on like automatic and open up word and be like,

58
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.440
oh you guys doing enough or whatever. Just like type it all out.

59
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.030
You need a better manager. No, but I think like I, I didn't do it.

60
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.300
I just dodged it.

61
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.760
I ask Aaliyah cause I used to do it in the past and I was like, Yo,

62
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.950
they're asking me to write this out. It's taking all the fun and organic.

63
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.070
Like I feel it wouldn't really hurt my performance if I literally wrote a

64
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.730
transcript and I'm like a robot up there. And he was like, just don't do it.

65
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.650
And I go, what happens? He's like, nothing. Nothing happens.

66
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.950
I've done it a million times that just keep, just be dodgy.

67
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.900
It's some pencil pusher that doesn't make any sense. I think they get, you know,

68
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.480
well they have power over people that don't have a name yet.

69
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.480
I think they have people above them breathing down their neck and then you know,

70
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.820
shit rolls downhill. So then they keep on asking like, where is it? Where is it?

71
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.370
Change your number. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.700
Well that's why I had like the reps going to be a buffer and very aloof and like

73
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.060
he's very busy. They can do it all. It was a direct to you thing is I would,

74
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.190
I would see them throughout the fast and they're lovely people.

75
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:52.700
I love these people, but like say where's they'd be like, yeah, and be like,

76
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.460
no, I no, I played the game a little better. I go, I'm not there yet. I'm not,

77
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.290
I'm not in your mother's pussy level yet.

78
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.050
I still got do like it's gonna go back to the hotel room.

79
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.870
Say it's a funny thing that your mother's posted. Yeah. Where's the transcript?

80
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.363
You didn't check your mother's please.

81
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.600
I swore that I affect your mom has a fax machine.

82
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:14.560
I thought it should be in there. Yeah, she should go check.

83
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.040
Check around the corner. Yeah. So it's the worst.

84
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.870
Having to type it out just for laughs is a weird situation. It's evolved,

85
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.560
right? Well yes. It's a weird way of looking at it.

86
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800
It used to be very valuable for comedians.

87
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.990
Now it's very valuable for just for laughs because they have this enormous

88
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.620
platform and you go there and everybody knows that all these great comedians are

89
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:42.130
going to be there and they make an enormous amount of money off the comedians.

90
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.650
It used to be the comedians would go there but at the end,

91
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.220
because the industry would go there and the whole key to the whole thing was

92
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.390
development deals for sitcoms and they tossed out so much money.

93
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.010
I always hear about the gold rush and the heyday of JFL deals are getting thrown

94
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.320
out left and right and like lives were made.

95
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.570
I don't know that JFL but fake lives were made to like they,

96
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.950
they ruined it. Like,

97
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.970
cause I have a theory about people who aren't convenience.

98
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.200
Like they think they see people laughing at stuff and they see something's fun.

99
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.640
They think it's funny. But a comedian go, this is just tricks. Yeah.

100
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.070
Yeah. Well cause uh, the amount,

101
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.190
the volume of comedy that we want on a regular basis is so much so we can

102
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.800
discern like, you know, we'll talk about this, we want,

103
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.570
we're students of comedy, we watch a lot of comedy.

104
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.150
People can get like a huge pop out of the room,

105
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.030
but like Ian can cut through the bullshit and you know that like oh that's a

106
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:41.020
parlor trick or yeah. So it's a different type of thing.

107
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.260
But I think a lot of times, you know, suits and everything,

108
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.960
they just here decibels or right place, right time.

109
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.040
And they believe this lightning rod moment or whatever,

110
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:56.041
this great set is an indicative of their entire comedic being instead of like a

111
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.000
lucky, yeah.

112
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 1>Do you ever hear what is that guy's name? Was his name? Chicken?</v>

113
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.800
Is that what I always hear that as an example. Like I heard you blew the roof.

114
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.830
He was the guy that ended it all like literally cause I think they gave him a

115
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.060
half a million dollars or something crazy like that.

116
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.770
I kind of want to see this chicken set.

117
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.100
Like what was the set that just blew everyone's mind?

118
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.610
He was a handsome fellow and he was young and he was very energetic and they

119
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.160
thought he was going to be the next Jim Carey. Did you see him around?

120
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:26.750
Was He an La Guy? No,

121
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:29.750
I don't know where he was from but I saw him at just for laughs.

122
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.120
I saw him quite a few times and uh, he was a nice guy. Yeah.

123
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.730
But he was terrible.

124
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.060
I mean in a way that like it was just a bunch of black but it,

125
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.290
there was no substance to it. There was no thought to it.

126
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.690
So they tried to put it together.

127
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.890
They tried to make like a development deal and he did a little touring,

128
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.340
but it all went south and it fell apart and he eventually committed suicide.

129
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.820
Do you know how many years he was doing on themself in front of a school?

130
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.330
That's cool. Yeah. Like, like that's what I had heard.

131
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:02.930
Like he hung himself on a tree in front of a school. Geez,

132
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.110
this is the last piece of performance art. I don't know if that's true.

133
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.183
See the thing is like,

134
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.580
I shouldn't even say it on a podcast and millions of people goes to, but I did,

135
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.760
but the hanging part is right, right. Yes. He definitely committed suicide.

136
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.050
It's one of those things,

137
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.550
men where like if it didn't work out and he didn't develop, it didn't,

138
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.750
he didn't, he never became like a legit comedian but thing all right over there,

139
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.820
Jamie. Yeah. I think if like if that had happened and he actually had,

140
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.511
I don't know,

141
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.630
the equity of a standup comedian and been doing it for a long enough, yes,

142
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.560
that would be like a bump in the road. But you can come back from that. Oh yeah.

143
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.330
If that's just sort of like your lotto ticket,

144
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.530
then that's why it was so drastic. I think. Well, some people are just not,

145
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.950
they're great comics, but they're not really into acting.

146
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.740
They're not the best at act, and they got kind of forced into acting.

147
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.010
I Love Mitch Hedberg joke. He's a great standup, you know, and they just like,

148
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.510
they'll come up to me and they'll be like,

149
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.290
can you act like that's like going up to a chef and being like, can you farm?

150
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.820
That's true. I mean, I'm butchering it, but there's such different things.

151
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.570
But it's a, you have an agent, right? And the agent wants to make money,

152
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:08.420
so it's an avenue for cash. And you know,

153
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:13.070
you look at Seinfeld and Tim Allen and Roseanne and Brett Butler and there was

154
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:14.390
all these comedians,

155
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:19.190
the 90s had made a ass load of money doing sitcoms.

156
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.150
Well that's the quicker pay off too. I even noticed it with my own career,

157
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:25.370
like when I was a younger comedian, I don't care.

158
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.320
In my early twenties when I moved from Seattle,

159
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:28.730
like when I first got reps and stuff,

160
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.660
I was going out on these auditions for like CW shows or just whatever.

161
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.510
They just throw you against the wall. You're an actor.

162
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.650
Comedy is this thing you do at night. This shit that you do stand up.

163
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.900
They probably don't even think you're funny, you know? Yeah.

164
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.660
It's just a cute thing you do. It's like a kid,

165
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.800
like a dance recital or something.

166
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.560
Like they don't care as long as you're going to these auditions in the daytime.

167
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.770
So they just hope that you hit on what,

168
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.920
like a series regular and then get some cashflow for the Biz. Yeah.

169
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.050
But luckily, I mean, I don't know.

170
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.600
I think you're saying your successes are carved by your failures.

171
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.190
So I'm kind of fortunate that I, I would get some acting things here and there,

172
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.550
but never anything substantial enough to take me away from stand up.

173
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We'll never anything substantial.

174
00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:12.810
The worst is when they tell you to stop doing standup because it's messing with

175
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:15.660
your acting role. Like that's, they did a Tim Allen. Oh really?

176
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.770
Cause his acting, who was, you know, he was on home improvement.

177
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:23.220
It was a gigantic kit. They were making kazillions of dollars, but he was a,

178
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.730
I don't want to say he was a blue comedian, but he,

179
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.920
some of it was a little risque. So how did tag it deal with it?

180
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.370
He stopped doing stand up. Oh, okay. So he stopped, dude.

181
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:39.030
Saget stop doing standup for ever forever.

182
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.720
He really didn't start doing it again until after that show was done.

183
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.470
I feel like it was at Shogun full house. Full House. Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.860
He stopped doing it for a long time and then kind of drifted his way back in and

185
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:56.430
now he does it regularly. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, you know,

186
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.450
maybe they did that at the time,

187
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:01.650
but it's almost detrimental to let go because stand up is your car like it's

188
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.200
your business. You're in control over it and the TD stuff,

189
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.230
it's like one hand washes the other. If you let that go,

190
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.400
you're letting go of this revenue stream so that when the acting Gig is over,

191
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.830
you're kind of fucked cause this wasn't like building along with it you want,

192
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.420
it also was a point of confidence where you understand what's funny and what it

193
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:21.480
isn't like you know how to be funny because you're funny in front of a live

194
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:25.230
audience and all the time. Yeah, you're at the store. You have to be,

195
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.100
they're all much like you're there more than someone at your level.

196
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.450
You would expect someone of your level to be at. You have to be,

197
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.740
you can't slack off.

198
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.720
Everyone knows those really famous guys that slacked off and started to suck and

199
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:40.020
the good thing is nowadays, the cycle of a comedy,

200
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:44.370
we all do a special basically every two years, pretty much all of us Berber,

201
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.860
Kreischer, Sigora, Ari kind of.

202
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:50.670
Everybody kind of does a special or tries to do a special somewhere around every

203
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:54.750
two years, so every two years you throw it all out and you're a beginner again,

204
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.270
you have no fucking act. If you're terrified,

205
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:01.710
you have to come up with new premises and scramble and that requires a lot of

206
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:02.630
performing. Yeah.

207
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.760
I like how many rows on here talking about it was cool to hear a guy like him

208
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:09.270
even talk about just the dilution of specials where he's like,

209
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.110
they're not special anymore.

210
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.490
It's just like a flyer or like a brochure brochure that I'm still around. Yes.

211
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.890
It's all it is a little bit. Yeah. I mean,

212
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.220
obviously there's different degrees of Polish with some of the specialists and

213
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.300
how great some of them are, but there's so many now. It's a weird name. Special.

214
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.730
Yeah. We'll just leftover from yesteryear.

215
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.320
It's like why our albums a certain length because of the, yeah.

216
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.220
But at least an album is like a collection of music that is all in one thing

217
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:39.360
that you get that's kind of been consistent forever. Especial.

218
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.870
It's like, what is it anymore? What is it?

219
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.530
I guess 45 minutes to an hour of jokes strung together. Yeah.

220
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.640
To let everybody know. But it's also like an album,

221
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.170
like if you go to see Fleetwood Mac,

222
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.370
I don't know why the fuck came up with Fleetwood Mac. Right? Hey,

223
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:55.570
I like Fleetwood Mac. I do too.

224
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.160
But you're expecting the hits or as a comic you're expecting the shit that's not

225
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:03.760
on the special expecting all new stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That is interesting.

226
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.820
Sometimes you'll get them where they're like, do the,

227
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.870
that's a very rare type of ACO that's like, Gaffigan gets that for sure.

228
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.720
Because he's got some classic bits. And I think that also happens with um,

229
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.840
Russell Peters. I think he gets some requests for classic bits. You we get that.

230
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.300
No, I think do, I don't know how to do them anymore.

231
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.570
I know I purge them where they barely know. Yeah.

232
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.730
Someone who's yelling out Bruce Jenner the other day I was like,

233
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.260
I can't do that bit. I don't know how to do it. I'll fuck it up. I'm like,

234
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.750
you don't want it. You don't want me to do it. Sad version of,

235
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.900
it's like what you could remember where,

236
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.600
forget the taglines and Oh let me do it again. Let me start again. Redo.

237
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.260
Do fucked up guys. How fucked up. That's fun. You were having to go back to one.

238
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.960
So you are one of the rare comedians that doesn't smoke pot. Yeah, I guess so.

239
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.710
Talked about that and it's kind of interesting,

240
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.970
especially being in this industry, not taking advantage of that cause it's all,

241
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.730
especially the store. Like you'll do a show and they're like, hey,

242
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:58.870
you want these three bags,

243
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.990
these three pillowcases of weed and CBD oil and you're like,

244
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.580
don't take the CBD oil either. I haven't done it good. Which I,

245
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.770
it's great for you. What would I use it for? It's great for anxiety.

246
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:11.830
It's great for, it really reduces inflammation.

247
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.720
It's great for a lot of people use it for a sleep.

248
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.670
It's like it's just good for you. So like it's a, it's a nutrient, you know,

249
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.640
it's healthy for you. It's hot right now. It's very hot.

250
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.760
If I was in the business I'd be like, get CBD on the phone. Loves him.

251
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.210
I love what CBD is and do love it. Biddy how are you doing?

252
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.330
Canola's out CBD. Canola is bullshit. That stuff's bad for you.

253
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.990
Can you cook a CBD? Uh, that's a good question. I bet you can't.

254
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.420
I would imagine it has a low flashpoint like it would burn quickly.

255
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.970
Yeah. I don't know. Let's find out. I think it's usually mixed with

256
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.800
coconut oil as a high flashpoint weight.

257
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.220
Doesn't a grapeseed oil have a low grape pseudo?

258
00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:00.240
I think as a high flash point too. I think it's good to cook with. Okay,

259
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.810
so it takes longer for it. Yeah. Okay.

260
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.900
It's a high temperature flat high before it smokes.

261
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.920
Some people said they've cooked with it, so yeah, fucking burnouts stoners,

262
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.390
bunch of losers, but they stink.

263
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.350
There's some people that do everything with weed and they need to just stop.

264
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.310
Where's the hemp people?

265
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.920
I feel like you don't hear from them as much of an area. Yeah,

266
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.960
there was hemp like laying in. Wait. Yeah,

267
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.020
it was that like the backdoor lengthens. Hemp is cool. Like what a bone. Well,

268
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:27.460
CBD is for grandma.

269
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.820
That's how you get people to vote for it because grandma and grandpa use it and

270
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:33.190
it helps their joints. Right. And they're like, well, I'll tell you what,

271
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.750
this CBD, I mean, it's not doing anything from a brain. You're not getting high,

272
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:42.700
but my joints never felt bad or feel amazing. The CBD,

273
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:46.190
and I'm going to vote for it and I've really want to get ahold of Trump and let

274
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.640
them know that's not bad. See Bay days,

275
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.070
it really is a region from

276
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.070
<v 2>[inaudible] guy. Yeah. It's random.</v>

277
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.710
Random old guy from the middle of nowhere.

278
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.840
CBD does revolutionize nutrition and really fucked up my life in a very positive

279
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:08.990
way. I think people use little south, maybe Maryland, maybe somewhere,

280
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.440
outskirts of Baltimore and people don't know you have that gear or you forget

281
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.290
like you do voices really well, I don't have that many though.

282
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.630
I can only do a few. I think.

283
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.210
Are you the type though where if you're doing a bit and you need this person to

284
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.850
talk or whatever, you'll you'll figure it out. Yeah, I can get a few.

285
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:25.640
There's a few voices I can get out. Yeah, yeah.

286
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.820
Cause you're Alex Jones and like you get along so well.

287
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.200
I've known Alex for like more than 20 years, so it's less easy. Yeah.

288
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.080
I've hung out with that guy. We've been hammered together so many times.

289
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.530
It's like, that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.

290
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.070
He just needs somebody next to him. That's what he needs someone to go, Alex,

291
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.160
let's slow down like you were. You had a really good point there.

292
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.370
You need a manager who's always with them. He even agreed with me.

293
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.450
We talked about it. I said,

294
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:54.620
you just need like a rational journalist who's next to you to like stop.

295
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.430
He goes, you're right. You're right. You're right. I do need that. I go just,

296
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:03.200
you need someone who's just even closes out. Look, he was right about all this.

297
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:05.990
Jeffrey Epstein, Shit. That is a fucking fact.

298
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.040
Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago,

299
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.840
he was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have

300
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:17.720
all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.

301
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:22.721
He was talking about this years ago now it is mainstream news and this human

302
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:27.530
hybrid did experiments on on, which sounded like a complete joke when he said,

303
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.400
write it up. We were like, we were like, what? Now it's fucking mainstream news.

304
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.110
This is a fact, man. We like,

305
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.440
people want to write that guy off because he'll tell you he's crazy.

306
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:38.450
He'll let you know. He's crazy. I mean,

307
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.680
on my show there was one of the finest things he ever said. He's like, look,

308
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.590
I want to be honest with you. I'm kind of retarded and I fell to the ground lap,

309
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.400
but that's who he really is, man. People just have him lumped in, you know?

310
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.660
It's like some people,

311
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.580
they don't represent the best aspects of themselves write to people and then

312
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.640
other people try to define them like people try to define you.

313
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.270
It's really one of the things that it's really kind of weird about.

314
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.470
The more famous you get,

315
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:11.471
the more people try to define you in a way that's detrimental or a way that's

316
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.310
dismissive and limiting.

317
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.220
Like I've noticed that after this Bernie Sanders thing that I did,

318
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.730
so anybody listening to this, if you're saying this,

319
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.430
I am not right wing at all. So stop saying that. It's silly. It's foolish.

320
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.030
I've interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left wing.

321
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.310
The only thing that stops me from,

322
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.300
the only things that I disagree with about left wing people is support for the

323
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:39.260
military support for police in the second amendment. That's probably it.

324
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.360
Everything else across the board,

325
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.610
I lean way left in terms of like Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I

326
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:50.760
would 100% vote for him. Tulsi Gabbert is my favorite. I mean I'm not,

327
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.400
I'm not a right wing person. So this nonsense,

328
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.500
like so many people were saying that, you know,

329
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.380
Bernie Sanders spent this time on a right wing podcast. Like what,

330
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.940
what are you saying and don't you think he weighed the pros and cons of like it

331
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:05.610
was an opportunity for him and I think everyone thought it was a win.

332
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.860
I don't think you had any idea who I was really? Yeah.

333
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.330
I think it was one of his young staff members who's friends with Kyle Kalinsky

334
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.440
who is a,

335
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:18.441
a really good left wing progressive talk show guy on youtube and Kyle hooked it

336
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:23.100
all up and um, this, this idea that,

337
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.320
you know, it's bad for someone to talk to people. It's just, it's foolish.

338
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.480
This is a weird thing that's going on right now.

339
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.090
I thought it was a great platform for him to like get his ideas out there and to

340
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:35.610
be heard and something other than just soundbites. Yes,

341
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.810
it could be taken out of context.

342
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.680
It's a great platform I think for anyone who's running for anything to have a

343
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:44.250
long form conversation. And it's good for us too,

344
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:45.870
because we get to find out who they really are.

345
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.290
You really can't hide in a long conversation. You have three hours,

346
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.860
you can't tell an hour and 10 with Bern. That's all he had.

347
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:55.650
Cause you know the guy's running for, he's legit running for PR.

348
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:58.690
Like he could be president. Right. He's not like, you know,

349
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.930
like there's some people that are running for president, like, all right bro.

350
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.010
You know, like what does that Guy Zoltan what is his name?

351
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.170
He was the guy who was running a, the transhumanist platform.

352
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.500
Ish. Davon. How'd he say his last name? Very nice guy.

353
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.400
And sorry for this coming out. It was the last one.

354
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.950
It was 2016 and we had them on, but you know,

355
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.730
it was like one of those guys where like, all right, like Ben Glee and be like,

356
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.720
alright, good luck. Do you think Ben's gonna win? Um, oh I do. Okay. Oh yeah,

357
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.150
but you gotta respect the swing. That's what's great about this country.

358
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.850
You know, I swing the swing. What are you talking about?

359
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.480
You could run for president. No, no, not,

360
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.270
that's kind of just like anybody could run for president. Yeah.

361
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.840
And it sounds far fetched, like, yeah. Okay. But I mean,

362
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.710
you've got to be crazy enough to think you can be. You well look,

363
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.150
anything can and will happen when it comes to being president.

364
00:19:51.151 --> 00:19:55.860
Like people get assassinated, people get exposed as being a criminal.

365
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.610
Like look,

366
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.020
do you remember when Michael [inaudible] was the hero of the left?

367
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:02.460
The Democratic Party was like,

368
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.970
he's the guy that's going to run against Donald Trump and he's going to take him

369
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.760
down because he's tough and he's just, and he's gotten Michael [inaudible].

370
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.940
I mean that there's a compilation of left wing pundits talking about the hero

371
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:16.200
that is Michael Avid, Nordea.

372
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:18.390
You don't hear a fucking word from that guy anymore.

373
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.740
So if you are in a time capsule, right? A year ago when everyone was Michael,

374
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.100
avid, Adi, crazy. And they just shoot. And then when they woke you up for him,

375
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.350
it's 12 months later and you'd be like looking at the news, hey, where's,

376
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.160
where's that Guy Naughty? I mean, I was, that happens. I went all in.

377
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.510
They'll have their champion and then this other shit,

378
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.870
you know drr there's always they ascend and then there's some like dark shit

379
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:42.570
from the past and then you don't see them anymore. But then there's guys that,

380
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:43.320
you know,

381
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.010
like one of the things that I was getting at during the Trump campaign,

382
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.040
he's running for president. The

383
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 0>first time I was like, this guy's not going away. Like this is not going away.</v>

384
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.990
He knows what he's doing. He knows how to fuck people. Like how, how like, uh,

385
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.760
early in the campaign did you kind of realize, I don't know man, but my also,

386
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.250
did you, do you feel like you had um, a better read on it?

387
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:05.380
Just doing stand up across the country?

388
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.420
Cause I feel like you could be in a bubble.

389
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:08.950
You could be in New York and La and just be like,

390
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.050
oh that's never going to happen. This is ridiculous. Yeah.

391
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.040
But doing stand up in some red states, you kind of, you're with the people,

392
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.270
you're doing jokes and like you get a temperature of,

393
00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:19.720
of an audience more so than someone who just has like a desk job

394
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.560
<v 2>for sure. But also I have a lot of right wing friends,</v>

395
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.170
a lot of right wing friends, especially from the hunting world.

396
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.240
I have a lot of friends that live in,

397
00:21:27.241 --> 00:21:31.980
like I have friends that live in Iowa and Oregon and they have a lot of right

398
00:21:31.981 --> 00:21:36.981
wing friends too and there's a whole part of the country that the big cities,

399
00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:41.640
New York and Los Angeles and the, the big d democratic leaning cities,

400
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.730
they were all dismissing that the Democrats thought that Hillary was the most

401
00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:51.240
experienced and Trump was a buffoon and that that grab her by the pussy tape.

402
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:54.510
That was it. We got it. It's in the bag. They all believe that,

403
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.290
but the middle of the country did not believe in her. They didn't trust her.

404
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:03.291
They thought she was some sleazy politician who's been involved in the business

405
00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:08.400
forever and she licks her finger and figures out which way the wind's blowing

406
00:22:08.401 --> 00:22:11.250
and that's what she says and that they,

407
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.460
they thought that Trump was a straight shooter and he's going to train that

408
00:22:14.461 --> 00:22:18.510
swamp and he's going to do this and bring jobs back and he's talking about clean

409
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:19.344
coal. Yeah.

410
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.250
<v 0>It's almost like, I think you're just so outside of the system like a,</v>

411
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.660
it seemed like he could have done anything just like we want someone to throw a

412
00:22:27.661 --> 00:22:28.380
wrench into it.

413
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.213
<v 2>Yes, that's it.</v>

414
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.650
There's a lot of people that just wanted a wrench thrown into it and he

415
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:35.760
definitely threw a wrench into it and I think ultimately that's going to be good

416
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:39.750
for the left as well because they're going to realize that you can't just get

417
00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:44.751
away with that same stupid old school politician style of doing it anymore.

418
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.660
<v 0>I think he's just blown up the playbook. Even even a like Bernie calling Trump,</v>

419
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.080
was it stupid or an idiot in a post or something like amazing.

420
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:56.330
This is a new paradigm. Yes. Like they're adopting.

421
00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:59.930
They're taking pages out of what worked for Trump. Yeah, look, we've got to,

422
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.380
we've got to take some bully tactics and then even a Moscow, Mitch, I'm like,

423
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.513
oh, they get it.

424
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.600
Nicknames are the only thing that stick yelling and begging the rally.

425
00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:11.690
Like Moscow, Mitch like, yeah, this is part of the playbook now.

426
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.390
Sleepy Joe Biden. Yeah. That's my favorite.

427
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.590
It's as evolved as we like to think that we get as adults.

428
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.110
When it comes to politics, it goes back to grade school.

429
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.490
The only thing that seems to be effective is yelling Moscow Mitch or you know,

430
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:28.940
sleepy Joe Biden or Pocahontas.

431
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:34.400
These are these like stand up rules. Just like Rickles. Just, yeah.

432
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:35.234
It's so interesting.

433
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.560
And W W my fear about the Pocahontas one was when people were saying that he's

434
00:23:39.561 --> 00:23:43.550
racist for calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas. It's a Disney movie.

435
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.010
You can't, you can't,

436
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.630
<v 1>you can't go that far and call me a, I'd be juice. Aladdin's cool. He is,</v>

437
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:55.550
he has a whole monkey. Keeley eats apples. Yes. Did you see the man? I did.

438
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.400
It was pretty good. Yeah. Cut Bad reviews. I didn't understand it.

439
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.410
People don't like what they did. They felt I,

440
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.600
what I read was that will Smith modernized it too much? What does that mean?

441
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.170
Like I prefer a classic genie. Oh, they used modern urban vernacular.

442
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.770
They just weren't uncomfortable with that. You remember how, um, you know,

443
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.020
the first photos came out of will Smith as a genie?

444
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.920
I love how little it takes to whip this nation into a frenzy.

445
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.840
Like I'll wake up and open up Twitter and then the will Smith genie.

446
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.540
Everyone is freaking out over that and it's crazy how,

447
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.490
how we put them on the same pedestal,

448
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:36.491
like some sort of Trump scandal or like pedophile island and then the blue genie

449
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:41.120
or sonic looks weird. Sonic the hedgehog alone. Both.

450
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.650
Both take on the same amount of fervor on the same amount of psychic energy.

451
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.690
Yeah. Yeah. One of my,

452
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.440
I think one of the biggest gaffes biggest mistakes ever was Ben Affleck thinking

453
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:54.890
he could be Batman. If Ben Affleck never ran for Batman,

454
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:59.540
he would have 50% less hate. You think some people who liked or no?

455
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:01.550
Was it no one who liked that Affleck as Batman.

456
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.080
Even Ben Affleck didn't like himself.

457
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.580
When was the last time you heard anybody talk about Ben Affleck as Batman?

458
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:09.200
Ready go? Yeah.

459
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.950
No one Christian Bale's Batman motherfucker.

460
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.130
Even Michael Keaton's Batman, but he's old. That's so hard though.

461
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:19.640
You know like you're not going to hit a home run with Batman every time.

462
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.470
Would anybody who does it and fails their career hits a ditch. Who Do you think?

463
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.430
All right. Do you think, okay, Kilmer leveled up or no, from Batman. Well,

464
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.690
Kilmer did it once and he did a good job, but then he decided to get fat.

465
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:37.070
He's like, fuck this business. What about crazy seeing the top gun movie,

466
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.350
the new one? I hope so. I hope to. That'd be great.

467
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.010
Although the lady's not in it. The girlfriend, the really hot blonde.

468
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.120
What was her name? Kelly something. Another Miguelez. Is that it? Yeah,

469
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:48.290
she was beautiful back in the day.

470
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.900
I think she might've gone the vow killer route for know what I'm saying?

471
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.280
What about the Clooney? Clooney,

472
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.650
Heh, clique. Come selling Nespresso and

473
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.090
Tequila Nespresso. He's his was like a comedic take.

474
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.600
Arnold Schwarzenegger weight made way more money than George Clooney in that

475
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:14.370
movie. Huh? Oh, me and my buddies, we have a thing.

476
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:18.230
We just say cool with Paul t like we just say it to each other no matter what

477
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:21.110
party we're at. What does that, Alicia Silverstone,

478
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.970
she was in that and Chris O'Donnell, but why did I forget about that?

479
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.000
He was Robyn. Now he's on a TV show with Elequil j.

480
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.013
What does that one is that it?

481
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.230
It's like a NCS or something that is something that the same people who talk

482
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:37.080
like that guy was making fun of, but that's what they DVR that. Oh, oh.

483
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.540
Like once you get to certain parts of the country isn't an interesting to find

484
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:43.650
out what their favorite shows are. Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.690
That's where all those NCI s shows,

486
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.620
that's where they get all their millions of views. Sure. That's wonderful show.

487
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.340
Chris does a great job and he just pairs well with ll cool J who's [inaudible].

488
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.830
He's a little aggressive to me. I mean, it's all right.

489
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:03.510
He's a good foul I guess, but I really love Chris. I wish we'd get more work.

490
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.600
We should bring them back to the movies or I thank you.

491
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.380
Be an excellent Captain Kirk. He could be captain Kirk

492
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.080
also like I lived at my aunt's house and that's just playing all the time.

493
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.410
Like burn note. I mean that's not even yours anymore,

494
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.320
but like does USA shows Jag number Jag, my God, Jan reruns of Jag,

495
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.830
my brother shows on Jag. Love it.

496
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.500
How the thing is like we can laugh about these fails, but they're like 20 seat

497
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.330
Jag was on for 20 seasons. We were just going over survivor. The other day.

498
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:40.020
Survivor was on when fear factor debuted,

499
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:44.520
it was already on the air and that fear factor came out in 2001 or two somewhere

500
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:48.000
around right after September 11th I remember that cause I remember being asked

501
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:48.541
questions like,

502
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.770
was it appropriate to have a show about fear after September 11th my dad, some,

503
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.200
some guy asked me that. I literally wanted to climb through the phone,

504
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:58.500
strangled them. I'm like, you fucking bitch. What was your answer though?

505
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.920
That's nonsense. What if he walking back stupid? You're like, I'm sorry,

506
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:04.500
I didn't know that fear would play such a factor for you.

507
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.240
Um, but so survivor's been on,

508
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.680
what do we say it was 28,000 seasons on a 39th, I believe.

509
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:17.220
39 seasons. It's still going. Yes. You didn't even know. No,

510
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.520
I think the amazing racist they'll go on to. Do you remember that shot is? Yeah,

511
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.870
CBS is killing it. That one won the award every year for the Emmy's.

512
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:27.680
Like best show up or best games show whatever reality is.

513
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.110
I don't know what it did it, but yeah. Wow. 12 times in a row or something.

514
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.710
Crazy. Did you like fear factor more than,

515
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.250
cause I remember I loved news. Radio like goes on my favorite shows.

516
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.040
So did you enjoy that more fear factor?

517
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.260
Are there different things that are definitely different things?

518
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.400
I enjoyed the paycheck from fear factor far more. Um,

519
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.570
I liked working with that actors, but I love news radio way more.

520
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.800
News radio was just a far better show, so it was a really good, well,

521
00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.330
they're different things. They're very different animals. It ruined me.

522
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.230
It would. It would.

523
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.120
It's like going from the comedy store to uncle fuck's sticks, chuckle, hut,

524
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.060
and on a Monday night, you know, it's like every other sit-com that I looked at,

525
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.220
every other sitcom that I read for or that I got scripts for, rather I was like,

526
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.260
Ooh, this is just not good stuff.

527
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.220
Isn't it interesting when you get sides like just sides.

528
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.900
It just like one scene or two scenes for a show and you could tell it's good

529
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.060
just from that. Oh yeah. That's so rare. It is rare. Yeah.

530
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.880
When someone's a good writer, good Sitcom. Writing is hard to do. Man.

531
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.060
That is a really hard gig. I mean there's a, and then,

532
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:37.410
but then some people have bad sit-com writing, but they know how to make a bad,

533
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:42.250
successful sitcom. Like there's bad successful sitcoms lasts forever.

534
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.460
They're just unoffensive enough to stay on the air and keep you watching with

535
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:51.790
your mouth. Slack, I mean formulas exist for a reason.

536
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.500
Those big bang kids, they're so, they're so clever with their riding.

537
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.240
That's what keeps me doing the, I'm waiting for the vocabulary, the labs.

538
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.010
This guy ever shut off CBS the whole time I tried it,

539
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.150
but they're too hostile. Did you know that your TV has other channels there?

540
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:10.960
Yeah, there's other channels.

541
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:14.240
Other programming you could watch when they took bill O'Reilly out the air.

542
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.130
CBS is my channel. That's my channel now. Yeah.

543
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.920
You ever been in the looking audition and it's terrible.

544
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:24.850
But everyone goes through the motions where from just like cracking up like

545
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:28.420
it's, oh look, it's the greatest show on her. Like it's def jam.

546
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:31.390
Like cause the writers and the directors on the room like the fake,

547
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.880
like get everybody excited. Yeah. The half to,

548
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.810
cause I think they need this rocket fuel to get this project off the ground and

549
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.070
they need to give the writer confidence.

550
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.420
They have to give the director confidence.

551
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:42.790
They have to give the studio people confidence that it's all good.

552
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.770
It's a fake moment. The fake laugh. It's gross. And the thing is though,

553
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.600
like it's also not only is the girl still, but it's the 30th time there.

554
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.493
There's just this,

555
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.550
there's 30 people in the waiting room and they're laughing like it's the first

556
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:02.110
time they're faking it left and right. And we know fake labs we do.

557
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.240
It's offensive. So fake laughing at you. It's almost worse than Chanel laugh.

558
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.840
It is worse than not laughing at all. If you say a joke in there like, ah, oh,

559
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:15.670
he like, get them out. You get out of here, you bad person, you, you, you,

560
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:20.670
you use the quickest way to heckle though, right? Just like, ah, ah,

561
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:25.070
no one can say anything laughing. Yeah. It's like the Fredo thing. No,

562
00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:26.600
I talked to him was freedom. That freedom,

563
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.270
the freedom thing I was talking about, but I thought that you afraid of,

564
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.060
did you see that? Yeah, of course. You see a jacket that

565
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.560
Chris Cuomo Guy Jonelle Trump had the best line today.

566
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.410
Donald Trump won the internet today with this. He said,

567
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.950
should we red flag Chris Cuomo because he seemed unhinged.

568
00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:47.590
He was using terrible language, should not have a gun.

569
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.320
He basically exposed those red flag laws. He goes like, you see a guy like that?

570
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.530
He's irrational. That guy's irrational. He goes, I'll wreck your shit.

571
00:31:56.531 --> 00:32:00.250
I'll throw you down stairs. The stairs comment. That was, I enjoyed that.

572
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.390
Like what is he talking about?

573
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.450
Cause the guy called you Fredo and he was saying that the freeness sees the n

574
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:09.070
word. I didn't know Frito was drug Tori or I may have, I'm new to it. I just,

575
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.500
I'm not that I would ever try to call someone Fredo sometimes you know,

576
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.890
it's a fucking character in a movie. It's like a Latin. Is it like a,

577
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.720
there's no like, I don't know, cultural context, Italian.

578
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.500
There's no cultural context for Fredo where people like what the fuck did you

579
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.740
tag? That doesn't exist. It does not exist.

580
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.290
Well you could say it for someone who's a trader,

581
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.170
but why that doesn't even make sense with Chris Cuomo. It's just,

582
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.430
it's just a loser in a, in a movie. Well I guess like,

583
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.170
you know what he's trying to do, I mean obviously he's trying to insult him.

584
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:46.700
Yes. Even if there is no history of this word existing for,

585
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.730
you know, I'm ignorant. I don't know if it does exist or not, but like,

586
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.610
you know, this guy is trying to take shots. It's certainly not a compliment.

587
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.650
Sure. Yeah. I mean it's a loser in a movie.

588
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.730
It's a brother that always fell short and he turned it turned on his own

589
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:02.040
brother. Who is the Godfather? What if his, he wanted to be the godfather.

590
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.030
What if he explained this insult to Chris Cuomo? That would be great.

591
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:07.640
It was Frito was a weak Italian in the movie.

592
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.620
And I feel referencing your character,

593
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.280
you are the son of a great man because you know,

594
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.840
he's Mario Cuomo son and you probably, you know, let's,

595
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:20.930
let's be honest about why you're here. You know,

596
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.760
the name is familiar and you know, it helps. Yeah, but it's,

597
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.270
it's that uh,

598
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.630
Tahlia Ian Energy that like, again, this is my people.

599
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.170
These are my full Italian, no, not three quarters though.

600
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.480
But these people that,

601
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.930
that react that way are common. It's like,

602
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:45.470
what the fuck did you say to me? What y'all fucking wrecked your shit?

603
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
But you're not supposed to be a respected political pundit and behave like that.

604
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.520
That is nonsense. That's nonsense. That's nonsense.

605
00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.470
It's a silly way to behave. It's silly. That guy needs to work out.

606
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.220
It's tough. It's tough when not too much testosterone.

607
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:08.300
So we need to take him to tell the doctor, just pair you down a little bit.

608
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.590
Take whatever you at. Just drop it by half settled down bro.

609
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.050
Or just work out really hard before you go outside. Do some yoga. Meditate.

610
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.720
I like when those, uh, cause Ellie's pretty passive town for the most part.

611
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:23.510
You'll get some of those, you'll get like an east coast guy and you're like,

612
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:26.110
oh shit. Who's this guy? You know what I mean? Yeah.

613
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.120
Like visiting from out of town. Like whoa Nolan. Hey Freido. Yeah,

614
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:33.230
we don't actually fight here. We just go get my shine box. Yeah.

615
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.200
It's um, it was a very embarrassing moment,

616
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:39.530
but I think it's a very important moment. Look at him. First of all,

617
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.010
he is Fredo for life now.

618
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.090
I hope he understands that he's frayed though for light.

619
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.830
Unless you want to get tossed down a flight of stairs.

620
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.830
You Ain't tossing anybody down a flight of stairs. That's nonsense.

621
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:53.840
He doesn't want to get sued. He's not going to do that.

622
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.810
It's not gonna touch somebody.

623
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.310
You hire someone that flight of stairs not doing shit,

624
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.460
not doing a God damn thing. That's one of the reasons why it's so funny.

625
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.220
He's not doing nothing. That is Fredo. You'll never get away from that.

626
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:09.320
Now better embrace that shit.

627
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.280
Better start selling Frito t-shirts with your face. Listen,

628
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.180
CNN is probably going to fire them. I would imagine they're standing behind him.

629
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.290
The fuck out of here. Are they really for,

630
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.260
and I think they felt like he was attacked or unprovoked. Yeah.

631
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.710
By someone calling afraid though. Yeah, man, look, I'm fighting wars, dude.

632
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.820
Someone called me Fado. I'm even an Italian. I'd snap. I go, how dare you? He,

633
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.770
he's a silly man that that's what would exposes him and said he's a silly man.

634
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.070
It wasn't like someone was

635
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.940
<v 2>being equally aggressive to him and he was defending himself. Sometimes,</v>

636
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:45.060
like if you're in a situation where someone's very aggressive to you,

637
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.090
you almost have to be aggressive back just to let them know, hey,

638
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.100
I'll go there with you. Yes we could.

639
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.180
We could go to a dark place right now and you know I'm not going to let you hit

640
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:54.510
me.

641
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.660
I'm not going to let you do something to me if you think that I'm a pushover,

642
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.370
you know I'm here to defend myself,

643
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:03.680
but that wasn't that way like someone was mocking him and he turned violence.

644
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.870
It was a little bit of a complex situation where he just wanted to get a rise

645
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:08.220
and he was recording from down low. He,

646
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:12.970
they wanted him to do something that really Chris Cuomo, this is CNN.

647
00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:14.640
CNN has lost their fucking mind.

648
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.360
Chris Cuomo defended himself when he was verbally attacked with the use of an

649
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.590
ethnic slur in an orchestrated setup. The spokesperson said,

650
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.790
we completely support him for now. Listen to me, this is not done.

651
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.050
This is not done. This is just beginning to take on a form of its own.

652
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.840
You can't, you can't say that's an ethnic slur.

653
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.690
That is a fucking character in a movie. News to me and I was like,

654
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.930
fuck decks and him saying that. That's like calling it the n word.

655
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:44.340
That is so preposterous. That is so offensively stupid.

656
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.780
Do you ever get that? Like uh,

657
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.440
people trying to take shots or get you to slip or something?

658
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.870
Most people are nice. Yeah, for the most part.

659
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.180
I've had guys say goofy shit to me and I tried to say goofy shit back to that.

660
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.460
Get shells or just on the street or what and both things. But I'm not in a,

661
00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.280
I'm not a hostile person. I look hostile,

662
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.550
but I'm not hostile. Like I'm nice for the most,

663
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.740
I've had people get dicky with me. And then what do you do?

664
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:10.880
How do you handle it? Get Dickie back. Just like, yeah,

665
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.610
you see all three on a flex day. I don't say that. It's just, it's not,

666
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.450
it never escalates to that. It's like some people get weird, you know,

667
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:23.420
it gets weird. The fucking autograph people at the airport, how do they like,

668
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.400
would you be surprised sometimes somebody off somebody when you pay somebody

669
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:28.740
off, what do you do with you sign or do you just keep on telling my son one,

670
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.530
I'll sign one and get mad at me. I've got to stock in these. I go, no,

671
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:33.780
no I'm not working for you. Not working for you.

672
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.180
Like there's people that charge people,

673
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.700
they'll go to those conventions and they'll sit at a booth.

674
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.590
They'll charge someone x amount of dollars.

675
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:44.030
Like it's like 20 bucks or more for an autograph photo. I don't do that.

676
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.700
I'm not going to do that ever. So I'm not, I'm not, I don't,

677
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.870
I don't even want you selling my picture. I don't want it to be sold.

678
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.620
I don't want my autograph to be valuable. But if, if I felt,

679
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.060
if I thought someone was really a fan and they wanted me to sign something cause

680
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.380
different, yes, I would sign something for him. It'd be happy to,

681
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:04.680
instead of like a four year old guy with a ponytail and a stack of stack of

682
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:08.100
fucking photos of me and various, you're selling those,

683
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.840
I know you're selling those. So some guy,

684
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:13.470
one guy got mad at me and he was like following me around lax. I was like, dude,

685
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:15.930
I'm not signing anymore. It's like next time I see you okay. I'm like,

686
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.320
I'm not signing, but you know my mind going one of them,

687
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.990
you're making it very valuable. If you sign the whole stack, fine.

688
00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:24.990
I tell him I'm not going to be rude, I'm not going to be rude,

689
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.010
so I'm just trying to like, look,

690
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:29.440
I'll sign one and I tell them that like I got a bunch of them in Portland this

691
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.590
weekend. They were, there was like 10 people met me at the airport,

692
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.620
so I'll sign one. I think one is good, but I ran into the guy in Philadelphia,

693
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.090
they got, he tried to get me to sign another one. I go, I'm not sign on that,

694
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.330
and then he goes, he goes, [inaudible] you fuck with, forget your friends. I go,

695
00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:43.300
you're not a fan. I go, you're selling needs. You'll see what you think.

696
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:45.350
They're worth a lot. I go up there, why you here?

697
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.510
That this is a weird mental gymnastics like just to do better.

698
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.140
You fucking autographs worth about six 45 I go and you're a MOOC. I go,

699
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.540
you're over here trying to get me to work for you. I'll go get a job.

700
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.450
And so we had this like weird conversation. Like what are you saying?

701
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.760
You want me to sign these so you could sell them,

702
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.010
but you're saying they're not worth anything. So I'm a loser.

703
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.370
But you're meeting me at the airport to try to get me to sell things.

704
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:09.100
The sign that my flight is this. It's so silly. It's so silly.

705
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.750
But I just don't like the idea of it because primarily I don't like the idea

706
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.810
that there's some weird loophole where someone can get you to work for them.

707
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.410
They're just showing up and your sign these real quick and I'm gonna sell them.

708
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.260
Cause it's you. You're asking someone to work for you.

709
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.440
Even if it only takes five minutes or they're taking some off.

710
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.450
One guy had 30 pictures hit 30 back. How many you got there? He goes 30 I go,

711
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:33.360
you out of your fucking mind. How funny would it be if you,

712
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.610
if you sat at a Starbucks and you just did them all,

713
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.830
oh you're like hold on family. I'm just going to get through these.

714
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.330
The UFC makes fighters do that. They sit down and they,

715
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.160
but they give them out the fans and they do stuff with them.

716
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.490
Promotional materials, not one guy and everybody signs,

717
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.490
I'm like all the fighters in the card sign them and you know they're valuable to

718
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:53.740
fans as a fan. Like I have,

719
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.100
I have a sign poster out there from Efrin Rayez that I purchased and Efron Reyes

720
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:01.300
is like the world's greatest pool player.

721
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.520
I love pool and he's this a Filipino wizard. They call him the wizard.

722
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.800
He's amazing pool player. So I signed,

723
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.680
I bought it like it was signed by Ephemera. It's, I got so excited,

724
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.730
but I would never ask Efrin to sign something and then salary and track them

725
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:17.480
down to the airport. Someone at the, at the,

726
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.080
at the promotion for the tournament,

727
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:21.640
they probably got them to sign a bunch of them.

728
00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:26.080
They sell them and it probably was helped offset the costs and things along

729
00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:26.680
those lines.

730
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.940
But there's this [inaudible] that the autograph collector is a different animal

731
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:34.120
than the autograph seller. So if you're a person that is just like,

732
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:36.070
I love Raheem's comedy's really funny.

733
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:38.380
I want to go to the comedy store and see if I get him to sign something for me.

734
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.350
That's a fan for sure. But if you have 30 of them,

735
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.630
you're going to go on Ebay and you gonna try to make 50 bucks.

736
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:45.700
That's what you're doing. Well, you're not going to make 50 bucks.

737
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.200
I'm going to tell you right now. They might,

738
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.070
if they hold onto to sit on the air. A funny guy. I have a lot of talent.

739
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.380
What have you seen? I'm always surprised cause like I came to the store,

740
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:55.870
I always see it, the store, you know, and you're like, oh man,

741
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.300
your videos are funny. And like I don't know what you watch,

742
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.810
you're just going to tell their level. I don't think it even reaches you.

743
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.130
Oh that's nonsense. That that other level thing is a complete total illusion.

744
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.580
I'm here to tell everyone no, cause you are a rarity.

745
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:14.290
I think of the Comedians of the store who have gotten to a certain point where

746
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:16.690
you kind of have a relationship with everyone at the comedy store,

747
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.000
from the door guy to the waitress is to like, you know,

748
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.680
stand up like me or like Santina or Ian like you,

749
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.340
you have relationship with everyone. You come through,

750
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.420
you spend time at the store,

751
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.590
you're being pulled by a lot of things like UFC and a family and all this stuff,

752
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.250
the podcast. But you will hang at the store. Well that's a community.

753
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.180
It's very important to me that that community means it means a lot.

754
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.090
It means a lot. Um, and I like,

755
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.080
I like supporting the up and coming people. I think it's very important.

756
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.100
I think, um, all the door people, the guys worked a lot.

757
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.340
Those guys are all there. We're all gonna work together someday. You know,

758
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:55.660
it's very possible they'll, they'll be, you know, I'll be at one theater,

759
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.040
there'll be at another theater, you know, I'll be at a club over here,

760
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:01.400
there'll be the club over there. We're all the same. It's just an illusion.

761
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:06.110
It's just time. And I think it comes from martial arts because in martial arts,

762
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.230
everybody trains together. You know, I'm a black belt in Jujitsu,

763
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:12.980
but I'm as friendly to the white belts as I am to other black poets.

764
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.540
We shake hands, we hug. If I roll, I'll roll with a guy who's new.

765
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:20.450
It's just starting now. Give him tips. I'll help him out. You know,

766
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.040
we're all in it together.

767
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.990
And I feel like that's the approach that I take with comedy. The same approach.

768
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:31.280
I don't believe in this elitist shit. I think it's stupid.

769
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.500
I think it's, it's bad for everybody.

770
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:38.530
It's bad for the person who becomes elite even more so than it's bad for the up

771
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:40.370
and coming. Cause the amber commerce, if you don't,

772
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:42.950
if you dismiss up and comers and you treat them like shit,

773
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.380
like you treat them like you're better than them, you're above them.

774
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:48.710
You don't need to like talk to them. You don't make eye contact with them.

775
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.090
You ignore them when they're trying to talk to you.

776
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:55.060
And I've seen that from comics and um, I think it's bad for you. It,

777
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.660
for them, it just makes them angry. You know, they can't wait until,

778
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.280
and I have been in that position before where someone's dismissed me and been

779
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:02.114
shitty to me.

780
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.830
And then I surpassed them fame wise and then passed by and then they become

781
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:10.460
friendly and weird with you. And you need to kind of remember. Yeah,

782
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:14.720
it's very strange to see the one 80 you'll be in comedy long enough to see

783
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:18.240
plenty of one eighties and it's not, I mean you'll,

784
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.200
I'll give you some names after the show. Oh really? Yeah, yeah.

785
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.780
Name some good names. And then you,

786
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.560
you act however the relationship is now at this point in time. Yeah.

787
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.210
But that's always in the back of your mind. You're like,

788
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.190
I remember when it was not this, but there's,

789
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:35.480
there's also I want to give someone an opportunity for redemption.

790
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:39.290
Like I want to believe that they've changed. So I've, it's hard.

791
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.240
I don't want to be that mean person is like that.

792
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:43.190
Fuck that guy for life for sure. For sure.

793
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.000
But I do like hopefully that they grow. Let me,

794
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.930
maybe they've grown as a person and they'd been humbled because the career kind

795
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:54.931
of like skid and came to an abrupt halt and they're trying to rebuild the,

796
00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.230
used to be someone that thought that they could. There was a time, um,

797
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.500
mostly pre-internet where comics looked forward to doing a couple things.

798
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:09.560
One for one thing they look forward to is bumping people and doing a lot of

799
00:44:09.561 --> 00:44:12.950
time. Yup. They liked, but the bumping people was the big part.

800
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:16.010
It wasn't just doing time. So like you're doing a time thing. If you,

801
00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:18.470
if like Dave Chappelle calls up and says, I want to do a half an hour,

802
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.950
nobody cares. Like he's two. He'll wait till,

803
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.440
like everyone's calling up and then he'll go home at the end of the night.

804
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.710
He's a beautiful person. I love that guy to death. He's,

805
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:31.470
he's the exception to the superstar rule cause he's a sweetheart of a guy.

806
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.830
But there are some that wanted that spot of the bumper where they could just

807
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:40.170
show up. Oh my God, Mike's here. Mike's here for him. I'm sorry.

808
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.860
Mike's going up. Mike has to go up and Mike looks at you like I'm going up.

809
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.190
You know, like there's a few of those like that fed them, feeds them,

810
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.590
feeds them to let them let you know that you're not on their level. Yeah, I,

811
00:44:51.591 --> 00:44:56.010
I've heard of like that happens way less now. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.310
Well first of all, because people like us talk about it on podcasts.

813
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.230
Like if this one guy that was like a super dick to you and you're like,

814
00:45:04.231 --> 00:45:08.490
let me tell you something Joe, there's a fucking guy, you know, it's,

815
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.720
we're all comics man. Just like when you go to a Jujitsu school,

816
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:16.200
you take a class or two classes, you're a fucking martial artist, you know,

817
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:21.120
you might suck, but you're a martial artist. If you're up on that goddamn stage,

818
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.600
your comic in my eyes, you're just like me. I'm just,

819
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.780
I've been doing it for 30 years and you've been doing it for less. Yeah. Yeah.

820
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.640
That's what it is. That's the, that's the only difference.

821
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.110
It's just a time in and if you get 30 years down in what you get out of those 30

822
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:40.320
years is that you're better than everybody and that you can act like you're

823
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:42.870
better than everybody and you're aloof and you're dismissive.

824
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.610
You've missed everything. Beautiful. Like when I come to the store I like,

825
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.673
could I get hugs?

826
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.060
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's always hard cause when you first start coming back, I'm like,</v>

827
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.150
uh, I would just think like I'd be on the wall or whatever. But you're like, Yo,

828
00:45:56.151 --> 00:45:58.330
what's up? It's up to him. I'm like, give me a hug. You know?

829
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.810
And like we haven't really like talked a ton but that something as little as

830
00:46:02.811 --> 00:46:04.940
that goes so far.

831
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.310
<v 2>Well that's nice. Yeah. I hope it does go far. I'm want,</v>

832
00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.510
I want comics to feel good about the community that we have.

833
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.350
<v 0>Yeah, I remember cause when I got past the store it was the dark ages.</v>

834
00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.320
Like I know the stories had various dark ages,

835
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:23.020
Bobby talks about like the 90s and stuff, but you are at the ice house.

836
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.690
So like you weren't even really part of the story.

837
00:46:25.691 --> 00:46:27.910
You were still just like going there a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

838
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:32.890
So it was very cool for you to come back and then Adam take over and then it

839
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:34.660
just kind of evolve into what it is now.

840
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.660
It's crazy because I remember when it was not that and there was kind of a

841
00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:41.290
beauty in it though. I'm like pretty fortunate in hindsight that it got past.

842
00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:42.490
Then what year was this?

843
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.020
I think I got passed in like 2010 that was three years into the dark ages.

844
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:50.080
The Dark Ages, sorry, 2007 uh, yeah. Yeah.

845
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:54.670
It's also crazy to like know that you know the history and see the video and

846
00:46:54.671 --> 00:46:58.270
then, oh, I exist on this timeline now. The store was just, you know,

847
00:46:58.271 --> 00:47:00.820
when I'm living in Seattle, it's this far away place.

848
00:47:00.821 --> 00:47:02.290
Even Hollywood and entertainment and all that.

849
00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:05.950
It's just this place that exists on a box. It's not real. It isn't.

850
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:08.320
It isn't right. This isn't a real thing.

851
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:12.670
And then you move to La and I'm hanging with the Improv. I'm a ghost. You know,

852
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.610
people are walking through me. You know when you first come to town,

853
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.690
I swear to God, like I'm literally, I'm like, I do comedy.

854
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:23.140
You go in there walking through me and I'm just like my hands on it and I would

855
00:47:23.141 --> 00:47:25.360
just hang out. And that's part of the deal. You just have,

856
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.050
you realize leaving your apartment is a win in itself.

857
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.980
Like you may not be getting

858
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.380
<v 1>up as much as you want to, but even just like being out,</v>

859
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.310
it's a win because I want to be like, oh, you should do my, you know,

860
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.220
cause out of sight, out of mind. Yep. So I would, as a lawyer at the Improv,

861
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:41.650
I was nobody. And then I was like,

862
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.860
it was like Sandler and someone and like maybe Kevin James,

863
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.810
I think Sandler and Kevin James. And that was like,

864
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.240
I'm sure that's very standard. I mean, I've been here so long,

865
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:51.790
it's a very standard now you see a million people like I a very,

866
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:55.210
I don't get star struck at all, but it just kind of like, oh fuck,

867
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.340
those are people in a box.

868
00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:00.970
Other people in the box that I watch and they just walked in.

869
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:05.170
So that was kind of like a little mind fucking adjustment, you know? Well,

870
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:08.140
when I was in Boston in 1988 when I started,

871
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.080
Mecca was the store man.

872
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:16.110
That was where prior performed and Sam Kinison and Hicks started out there and

873
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:20.530
Hicks, he's do stats, he was a doorman there and you know,

874
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:24.430
Letterman was there and Robin Williams was there. It was just, it was Maca.

875
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.040
And I thought when I first started doing comedy, when I first,

876
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.120
when I realized like, okay, this is what I want to do.

877
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.960
Like after the first set I ever did, I was like, okay, this is what I'm doing.

878
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:37.810
I'm doing this now I'm, I'm, I'm all in. You know,

879
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:40.120
it took me awhile to get funny,

880
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:42.820
but I mean I had it in my head that I was going to get the con,

881
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.940
the comedy store. Oh yeah. And then when I finally got there,

882
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.030
I remember thinking how surreal it was. Cause I was like,

883
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.330
I guess I was 26 25 no,

884
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.920
25 or 26 I think the first time I stepped foot in the store and I remember

885
00:48:55.921 --> 00:48:58.450
sitting in the back of the room going, Holy Shit,

886
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:02.950
I can't fucking believe I'm here. Isn't it odd? It's, it's just the place.

887
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.150
Yeah. But it isn't, it's not, it's not just a place. I know,

888
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:10.930
but like when you, I guess the manifestation of the place, like okay, the stage,

889
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.200
there's chairs, there's a table. You ever see it in the daytime. All right,

890
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:18.520
this is [inaudible]. It's odd. It feels like it's waiting.

891
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.690
Yeah. Like it's waiting, but it doesn't come alive until nighttime. Yeah.

892
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.970
It's like a, a bedded animal, like a hibernating bear.

893
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.860
And at nighttime, man, the drink start clinking and you know, the,

894
00:49:29.861 --> 00:49:32.470
the comedy starts flowing and Jeff starts playing the piano.

895
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.780
It's an interesting room too. When you first started doing it,

896
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.210
was it difficult because it's not a net, it's not, um,

897
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.060
it's not an easy room or zone. These, yeah, the alarm. I consider the alarm.

898
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.210
The comedy store. Yes. People will come through and be like, Oh yeah,

899
00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:48.610
I've been to the store. I go, I go, what, what rooms? We're like,

900
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:52.330
we'll go to the main room. Okay, cool. My name is cool,

901
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.890
but it's not the heart and soul of the comedy store. The Omar is intimate.

902
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.120
Nothing gets lost. Right. The main room, you kind of have to be,

903
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.610
it's so big and there's that second tier.

904
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.050
You know how the step goes up to like be able to have that laugh wave hit that

905
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:11.200
back row. Yeah. You're really working.

906
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.300
Your performing and the stage is so big.

907
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:17.560
You have to be more theatrical to kind of do a serviceable job in that room.

908
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:19.001
But in the Alar,

909
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:23.110
it's like literally you're just watching a man gathering or a woman, you know,

910
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:27.910
just like you can be real. You can be, you don't have to be like, right.

911
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.080
You don't have to predict as much. Yeah. Yeah.

912
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.680
Well there's different kinds of comedy, right?

913
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.020
What's the largest crowd you've ever done?

914
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.830
I've been watching your stories and stuff and that's fucking insane.

915
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.440
It's like even when you're in the green room and you just hear these murmurs,

916
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.320
it sounds like, you know,

917
00:50:44.321 --> 00:50:47.340
like an angry mom is going to kill yourself and use your honor. Ah, it's called,

918
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.030
they're all just like filtering into this giant theater.

919
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.620
Maybe 3000 or 4,000 and that was, that was a trip that's big.

920
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.880
But you notice when you do 3000 or 4,000 that there's like you have to give them

921
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:03.620
more pause. Oh yeah. More time for the set. The, the, the joke.

922
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.490
The punchline is settle the last to settle before you move on to another.

923
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:12.850
But what another great about doing it so long is stand up is this conversation

924
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:17.930
with the audience. So you know, to wait like you have inherent timing.

925
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:18.570
Yeah.

926
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.650
Another comic would just kind of know the timing of the club and just like plow

927
00:51:21.651 --> 00:51:25.220
into the next joke while they're still getting laughs from a theater. Yeah.

928
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:27.080
You can't do that. But I took,

929
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:30.730
I was talking about this yesterday with Tom Papa that one of the reasons, uh,

930
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.000
one of the best lessons that I ever had was actually sitting in the audience at

931
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:39.710
one of Richard, uh, uh, not Richard Lewis Black's not Richard Lewis in the,

932
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.150
of confusing. I mean I was confused. Yeah, for sure. The word Lewis, uh,

933
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:44.961
Lewis Black Show in New Jersey.

934
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:49.520
He was there the night before me and Joey Diaz and I sat in the audience and he

935
00:51:49.521 --> 00:51:52.390
would hit a punchline and people would laugh and then he,

936
00:51:52.391 --> 00:51:55.940
he would hit the tag and I couldn't hear the tag cause all the other people were

937
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:59.430
laughing around us and I was like, oh,

938
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.690
like you gotta be like a little more selective. Yeah.

939
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.470
You can't just hammer them like in the store at the o r you can hammer them

940
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.530
punchline, punchline, punchline, punchline,

941
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.330
and you could beat the fucking shit out of them that way.

942
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:15.560
And it's a different kind of comedy. If you have that style of comedy,

943
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.420
you might struggle a little bit with the theater and you'll definitely struggle

944
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:24.140
in an arena. Arenas and amphitheaters or another animal.

945
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.260
I feel like just having no ceiling. How does that work?

946
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:31.700
Cause I did a Saturday night. That's San Francisco. I had a great time.

947
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:35.330
We had a great time. Allie Ma, Alan Kowski killed. She had a great time.

948
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.900
Ian Killed. It was fun. It was fun. But it's definitely different yet.

949
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.040
I think it's different because I think there's such fans and obviously they're

950
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:46.130
going to be tuned in. Yeah, that helps. It's different when you're like,

951
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.780
I'll do some festivals sometimes or,

952
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:51.620
I mean back in the day you would do a college or something and it's just outside

953
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.810
and if they don't know who the fuck you are. Yeah,

954
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.070
and it's daytime and it's outside. Yeah. You flew to pick up a check.

955
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.660
All you gotta do is not lose your mind on stage and you can collect your check.

956
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.270
If you're like, like then you're not getting your money.

957
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.600
Well it's a matter of whether or not your having fun.

958
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.310
If you are having fun and you enjoy performing and you your materials good.

959
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.980
So you know it's good, you can have fun and whoever's tweeting and,

960
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:21.170
and have a good time and the absurdity of the situation is funny. Um,

961
00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:24.980
but honestly it's not going to be like a regular club set or something. Yeah.

962
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.010
Dude, I'll take you,

963
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.120
<v 2>if you want to come, I'll take you, I'll take you one of the crazy,</v>

964
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:29.790
I mean that just seems like such a mind trip.

965
00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.480
That'd be like a standup float tank, you know, Alli's only 22. Yeah,

966
00:53:34.481 --> 00:53:37.530
she's so young. Yeah. And I, I've been taking her with me,

967
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:43.250
her and Ian Kayla's weekend and the first arena she ever did.

968
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.050
Well, here's alley, right? She's done clubs with me.

969
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.170
She does Improv with me all the time. She has a store with me all the time.

970
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.830
She was the door to door beauty of the system at the store.

971
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:57.450
It's like one of the last places like that where there's a system in place and

972
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.080
Yep. Yeah.

973
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.000
She works the door of the store and she performed in front of 10,000 people on

974
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.540
Friday. And then went back to checking ids.

975
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.640
That's the mind fuck of being a young comic.

976
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.490
Do these crazy things and then you're back at your job.

977
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.930
But she's wild and hungry and she's, I don't worry about Allie. She's fine.

978
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:17.310
She's great. She's really down to two. But um, you know,

979
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:22.080
so the first big show she had done before that was the Mirage in Vegas.

980
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.110
I love that clothes. I love that club.

981
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.400
I started doing that club and then I went to bigger arenas and I came back to

982
00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:32.820
that club because it was so much fun because most of the time when I do Vegas,

983
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:36.630
I do it the night before. UFC like on Friday night. And uh,

984
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.090
I was doing these big giant places like the coffee theater,

985
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.420
which is like a hundred foot tall seat, more than a hundred feet tall ceiling.

986
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:45.630
It's a Cirque de Solei place. But it was too weird. It wasn't,

987
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:49.880
it wasn't the right setup for comedy. And the Mirage is so perfect.

988
00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:53.990
I just a Terry Fado. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So I went back to,

989
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.500
so that was the first time she'd ever done anything big and she walked out there

990
00:54:58.501 --> 00:55:02.580
like she fucking owned the place. She's like, she owned it. Yeah. She's like,

991
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:07.200
she had a bat, the best set I ever saw her have there. And then I said,

992
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:12.150
okay, you want to do an arenas? She's like, ah. So yeah,

993
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.510
that's balling. So we did this crazy place in Portland.

994
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.950
Portland wasn't the same man. God Damn owes off the charts.

995
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:24.960
Almost too big. Almost two, two powers, almost too big, but almost too powerful.

996
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:28.080
Did they do concerts in there normally or what does that space basketball.

997
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.620
Oh Shit. That's where the blazers play. Yeah, for real. Yeah. Whoa.

998
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.190
You'll be great if they just have a tee shirt cannon before you're set.

999
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:39.810
You're like, yeah. I had a, my buddy cam Hanes who lives in Eugene,

1000
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:40.740
which is real close to there,

1001
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:45.510
was in that same place a couple of weeks before that for a game and he's like,

1002
00:55:45.511 --> 00:55:47.790
dude, I can't fucking believe you're coming here to do comedy.

1003
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.920
Like what is this? Yeah, it was nuts.

1004
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.530
You would almost think as like a consumer of comedy.

1005
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:53.940
What is that experience like?

1006
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.990
And is it still like the beats I've gotta be so different than like a club?

1007
00:55:57.991 --> 00:55:59.640
Like that was fun man.

1008
00:55:59.641 --> 00:56:03.210
I was watching Ian on stage and he was murdering and I was laughing my ass off.

1009
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.910
It was great. It's all in the acoustics of the building.

1010
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:10.900
And the Moda Center in Portland is a really new theater or a new arena. It's,

1011
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:15.300
it's really well made. So the acoustics are excellent. There's nothing is lost.

1012
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.150
Cause that's my world like in a space that big that no one can hear what you're

1013
00:56:18.151 --> 00:56:22.320
saying. And it's muddled. And I've done some big places where it's not the best.

1014
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.220
I've done some big where you hear a little

1015
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.560
<v 1>echo and you're like, Ooh, this could be a problem.</v>

1016
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.530
So you have to be a little clearer with what you say.

1017
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.850
Like you almost got to take some of the spice out of your joke, you know,

1018
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.230
a spice out of your delivery because it's, um, it's a little echoey.

1019
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:43.660
The best though, the best is the ice house or the store or the Improv,

1020
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:48.190
like 200 people, 300 people, Bam, Bam.

1021
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.030
And it's like comedy clubs are a certain size [inaudible]. If it ain't broke,

1022
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:54.310
don't fix it. It's also cause that's all they could see.

1023
00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.190
I mean it's hard to sell like Prov like Joe Rogan,

1024
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:03.670
comedy clubs and they're all like 20,000 seats. They're like, yeah,

1025
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.740
I mean it sounds like when Joe comes around and we're having a tough time

1026
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:09.250
getting people to come out, it's, I mean how many,

1027
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.220
there's not that many people that are doing those places like Kevin Hart,

1028
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.180
Dave and like, oh that's so crazy too. Like you guys teaming up to do a tour.

1029
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.670
Sure. Comedy Fan. How great is that dude?

1030
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.980
We did 25,000 people in Tacoma.

1031
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.430
We broke the all, he got my brothers right. He hit up Ian and Ian was like,

1032
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.130
cause I think I was, I was in London so I was sleeping like the time is off.

1033
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.850
So then he just DMD Ian and he was like, Hey, I'm thinking brother,

1034
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.350
can I come to the show?

1035
00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:40.000
The date things are crazy though because he brings a DJ and Don l Rollins gets

1036
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:43.630
out there and gets everybody hyped up and it's the fucking Djs in between the

1037
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.290
sats charge. It's like he's getting into the next level.

1038
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:51.850
So next level it's a concert. Yeah, positive. Just you feel crazy.

1039
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:54.460
Like is this really high? Like even Dave, he was like,

1040
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:57.800
this is fucking crazy man. Like we were all like this is the game.

1041
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.190
This is crazy. We were all like, this was crazy.

1042
00:58:00.191 --> 00:58:03.820
We all realized this was something cause people were so pumped that we're doing

1043
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:06.790
it together. It was mad. It's like a,

1044
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.380
like the watch the throne tour and Kanye and Jay Z. Yeah. Yeah.

1045
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:13.990
We're going to do more. We're try to figure out where and how,

1046
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:17.590
but we had a great fucking time and why not? So rock star Shit. They,

1047
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:20.500
they show up at places and have ivs ready.

1048
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:25.620
They do intravenous vitamin infusions with glutathione and how to be 12 shots.

1049
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.270
How did you feel after like I could run through a [inaudible] ball tree out of

1050
00:58:30.271 --> 00:58:31.104
its roots.

1051
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.500
How did you feel before and then after we just like tired, you know,

1052
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:39.940
we're traveling and we're up late the night before and then you get juiced up

1053
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:44.020
with vitamins and you just, you're like, where's that tree? Yeah.

1054
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:48.850
You feel fucking excellent. This, I guess,

1055
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.900
you know they don't rock stars know what they're doing. Yeah.

1056
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:56.200
And I'm sure you're only doing a fraction of what they do.

1057
00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:00.760
They're doing coke and they have something different in IB.

1058
00:59:00.761 --> 00:59:03.560
They probably have some other bag we don't even know about. Probably. Yeah,

1059
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.330
it was probably some illegal shit. Yeah. Like they probably do an Nad.

1060
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:10.540
They're probably doing a lot of different things. Yeah. Yeah.

1061
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:15.340
But it looks insane at the end of the day though, back to the grind.

1062
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.680
Like tonight I'm doing the belly room. You know, it's so funny.

1063
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.020
You just back in the belly, back in the belly room, two in the belly room.

1064
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.120
Then I'm telling the Improv, I've got at 10 30 at the Improv tank. Double Dip.

1065
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.960
Yes. Always. You ever do? You don't do factory early? Huh? I don't do the fact.

1066
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.610
Is that cause they tape? Yes. Okay. Yeah, they taped me. They tape everybody.

1067
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:34.550
They put your shit online, but like we're not going to do it any more.

1068
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:37.130
But they still have the camera up. [inaudible] do you just not trust them?

1069
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:40.250
Because like they'll send it to me with the clips and I'll be like, I don't,

1070
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:43.730
it's not ready or I don't want to put it out there. And then they respect it.

1071
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.780
So Bill Burger said, yeah. And then I found this shit online. I'm, Oh yeah,

1072
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.300
look at that. And he's like, what the fuck? I was like, yeah man.

1073
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:54.410
Well like somebody working there that's not listening to this, you know?

1074
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:57.220
And maybe they don't do that anymore and I hope they don't, but don't.

1075
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.100
Why chance? It just doesn't feel good. It's just that,

1076
01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.890
especially the way it was handled, it was very poor.

1077
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.360
The way it was handled was like,

1078
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:07.760
you should be happy that we're putting it online. It was not good.

1079
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.370
I'll tell you all about it later. But it's just,

1080
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.300
there's plenty of room at the Improv and the store. I don't need to go there.

1081
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.270
I don't wish it, I mean, I hope it does. Well. It's a great club.

1082
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:19.630
It's fun to work at. Sure. You know. I know what you mean though.

1083
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.580
It's like I'm in Tarzana now and like someone will be like, Hey,

1084
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:26.720
do you want to do this show in Irvine? And that's just like saying,

1085
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:29.900
my shows on Mars are fine at eight o'clock.

1086
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:34.450
You might as well leave your house yesterday. Like bird, can you chop our Meta?

1087
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.540
Yeah. Termite in a chopper with car. No, you gotta go. I was working at Boeing.

1088
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:41.200
I had a coworker who was learning. Uh, well he,

1089
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.040
he had his hours up and everything, so he flew,

1090
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.160
he flew choppers and during our lunch break he's like,

1091
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:49.640
you want to go on the chopper? Jesus. I was like, sure. So then he's like,

1092
01:00:49.641 --> 01:00:53.010
let's take the doors off. What? Kill you? Nah,

1093
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.450
but like in my mind it was crazy. I figured, why not?

1094
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.400
I'm going to go on a chopper. That's true. So from my lunch break,

1095
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.420
I went into chopper with this guy. I recorded it. Wow. And then I said,

1096
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.710
then my mom saw it and she just like flipped out. She was like,

1097
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.953
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

1098
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:10.271
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:15.271
If I had a a son and I was a woman and my little boy was in a plane flying over

1100
01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:17.680
the doors, off the doors off,

1101
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:21.160
maybe you didn't surf and on the way and told her like that, it was my coworker.

1102
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.940
Yeah. Yeah. You should have said it was like a super experienced fighter pilot.

1103
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:29.140
He, he's a military guy. Yeah. He's have 20 years experience. Yeah. Yeah.

1104
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.620
It's weird when you go up in a, in a bird with like someone, you know though.

1105
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:37.290
So, well, I did at first in high school. One was in high school, my,

1106
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.120
my friend Mike, Mike wore bell who was a,

1107
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.550
taken a small plane lessons and we flew around this little small plane.

1108
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.720
We just like fucking, he was my age. Maybe he was older than me. One year,

1109
01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:53.380
I think I was 16 he was 17 maybe. Maybe. But no more than that.

1110
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:54.641
And he's got to trust him.

1111
01:01:54.641 --> 01:01:58.150
And you're like flying in a fucking plane and he had a copilot.

1112
01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.590
It was like an instructor. So he was texting better than, yeah,

1113
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:01.900
it was taking lessons him.

1114
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.480
But that was the first time I was ever in a little tiny ass plane.

1115
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.990
It was in high school. You don't want to do that. I have no desire to do that.

1116
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.740
It seems like a rough way to die. I just don't like,

1117
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.590
even with all the training and all that, just truck, I'll leave it to the pros,

1118
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.160
like if JFK couldn't do it. Well I think the JFK

1119
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.890
<v 2>story was more complicated. I think he was involved with a fee.</v>

1120
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.660
I think that that flight was like no visibility.

1121
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.710
I think you ran into fog and like a more experienced pilot would have known the

1122
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:35.910
weather conditions the best to be going up. Yes. And also you,

1123
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:40.020
you have to understand how to read the gauges because you gotta know what

1124
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:43.860
altitude you're at and the gauges have to be 100% functional. And yeah,

1125
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.900
I don't know what the whole story was with his death, but I believe Google,

1126
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.640
whether or not j f k his body had cocaine in it. Google that.

1127
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.330
No RF. K, what's his name? Jay. Jim. Joe Jr. Not RFK.

1128
01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.300
JFK Jr his body had cocaine in it.

1129
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:05.220
Cause I think there was some cocaine involved, if I'm not mistaken. It's like,

1130
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:06.900
fuck, I can fly into the clouds.

1131
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.660
I'm in the clouds pick that didn't even have any like lessons,

1132
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.890
but he's just like [inaudible] I think he knew how to fly and I think he was,

1133
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:17.610
I think he was unprepared for no, it's, you know how it is.

1134
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:19.230
Like he was off the Cape, right?

1135
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:24.270
It wasn't somewhere near Massachusetts that fucking, those clouds get thick bro.

1136
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.280
I mean, you don't see Jack Shit.

1137
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.360
So you're flying around in that like imagine just fly, right.

1138
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.690
You want 500 miles an hour and right in front of you is white.

1139
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.410
That's all you see. 500 rounds down through the white. And just knowing,

1140
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.770
kind of just knowing this isn't a good situation. Yeah.

1141
01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:44.910
You're fucked and you kind of know. Yeah, yeah. Well, when I lived in Colorado,

1142
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.820
I remember there was a time that I was driving up this hill.

1143
01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:51.060
We were pretty high up. We're about 8,000 feet above sea levels,

1144
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:54.720
3000 feet above boulder. And as we're driving through the hills,

1145
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:55.590
up to the house,

1146
01:03:56.010 --> 01:04:00.870
the fucking clouds were so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of the car.

1147
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.490
So you're driving on a mountain road that sometimes has no railings to the left

1148
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:09.180
it to the right and it's just death to the left and you're driving up this

1149
01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:11.250
mountain road and you can't see Jack Shit.

1150
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.770
So you literally have to turn the fog lights on.

1151
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.780
So the regular headlights are no good.

1152
01:04:15.781 --> 01:04:18.750
You gotta shut those off and you have to have fog lights on cause fog lights

1153
01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:22.650
just kind of light the ground and that's why they exist that like people,

1154
01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:24.840
it was like people don't even think of what a fog light is.

1155
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.430
Cause most of the time you don't really have to deal with fog.

1156
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.640
Fog light is a little light down below.

1157
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.700
You could see a little bit instead of blinding it just with that.

1158
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.230
Otherwise you just see bright white. Did he say anything about that?

1159
01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:38.160
But they were full check info wars.com I want you to go to the wrong source.

1160
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.390
Did you use Google being at Jamie eight 39 at night

1161
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:46.800
<v 4>and they were flying over a water that had no features so they were over water.</v>

1162
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:48.060
It was dark and foggy.

1163
01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:52.080
It was basically pitch black and he didn't have a flight plan either and he,

1164
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.550
he told an instructor that offered to go with him. He wanted to do it alone. Oh,

1165
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.170
but you didn't find anything about cocaine?

1166
01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:00.390
I googled that and nothing popped up,

1167
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:04.140
but it's something popped up that they might have had a past of that,

1168
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:08.710
but nothing said autopsy. Nothing said that. Okay.

1169
01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:12.610
<v 2>Maybe I made it up. It's possible. Let's put it in the Wikipedia page.</v>

1170
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.690
Just my memory varies so wildly. It's,

1171
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.020
and I'm wondering if it's old age or if it's just,

1172
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:25.060
just an overwhelming amount of data in my brain and my hard drive is just

1173
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:27.430
completely run out of space. Maybe there's some overlap,

1174
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.810
like a similar story for sure. There is because I,

1175
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:33.640
I'll have conversations with someone sometimes and uh, they'll ask me,

1176
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.080
we'll be just talking about something like, oh,

1177
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:38.360
well that's not exactly how it happened. This is what happened.

1178
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.240
And because of this, and because as they evolve,

1179
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:43.090
they develop the ability to do this and that. And I'm, I just had, I know this,

1180
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.700
I'm like, why do I know if somebody goes, what do you a fucking biologist?

1181
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:48.490
I'm like, no, I'm an idiot. Yeah, I do remember things,

1182
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.340
but I don't retain some things.

1183
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:54.190
Sometimes I forget who I was talking to or who said what or how, where,

1184
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:58.240
where this idea came from. It's weird. It's not slash selective man.

1185
01:05:58.241 --> 01:06:02.290
It's not that good. It's like, but it helps when I'm taking nootropics,

1186
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.140
which I didn't today, today, I didn't take any Alpha brain. We don't,

1187
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:08.800
why don't we have any here? How come you don't have any here? Oh, gimme no,

1188
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:14.140
thank you. Oh Man. How does this work? Well,

1189
01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.060
your brain's going to grow. Hope your head can really, it's flexible.

1190
01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.780
Just like flexible. The headphones are swell from the head a lot.

1191
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:23.010
You used to use a used to rather throw this in here. Yeah. Yeah.

1192
01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:26.300
You used to work at Boeing. Is this like an Elon Musk moment guys? No.

1193
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.990
Am I going to be a mural? I know, right? Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Mural

1194
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:35.710
crazy for me too. I mean, I didn't even think twice about giving him weed.

1195
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.470
Really? You didn't think like, oh, this will be a moment. It was just,

1196
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.270
I thought it was just hanging out.

1197
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:43.870
Me and my buddy Ilan smoking a little wheat like normal,

1198
01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:47.750
like the stockholders are like, no, all the time you see the bras,

1199
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.180
banes painting in the Green Room. We're in the cloud. It's a 6% oh no. Yeah,

1200
01:06:52.181 --> 01:06:57.040
go look at the smoke cloud again because he lost 6% of the stock gs,

1201
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:58.540
but he got it back.

1202
01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:03.130
It was up to 9% the next day went up 3% his street cred went fucking through the

1203
01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:08.050
roof. Dude, I drove his car here. That guy deserves everything he gets.

1204
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:12.100
That car is a god new time machine. I'm still a Mazda three, 2007 man myself.

1205
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:14.960
Ooh, I'm a, I'm a purists. Nice.

1206
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:19.500
Sometimes I'll get a brochure in the mail like get the 2019 Mazda three you

1207
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.440
know, I'm going to put a bullet in my head. If I get two Mazda threes in a row,

1208
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:27.550
don't get a Mazda three but getting them, Yada, Yada, Yada, hope those are dope.

1209
01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:30.790
Isn't that like a punchline? I don't give a fuck who is making that joke.

1210
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:34.930
They don't know what they're talking about. [inaudible] making fun of me.

1211
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.880
Bullshit to to Miana is a fucking fantastic car. I'm not bullshitting.

1212
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.990
It has very low horsepower, but it's super likely. This will be my like defense.

1213
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.830
Some people make fun of me. They have a lot of horsepower.

1214
01:07:46.831 --> 01:07:49.510
It's really lightweight, doesn't have a lot of route. It's very low.

1215
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:54.540
I think it's less than 200 horsepower under an 81 it's but Miatas are amazing

1216
01:07:54.941 --> 01:07:59.720
cars, but as one how many times do you hear as a punch line? Those are hacks.

1217
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:01.540
Those comedians is, they're funny.

1218
01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:05.890
There's certain words that are just like go to like Chappellet lays a great is

1219
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.860
chipotle is a great punchline card. They still make them in a, in,

1220
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.520
in a standard with a standard transmission.

1221
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:17.000
Just want to say thank you mom or your welcome Mazda for Dita fucking great car,

1222
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:21.020
man. I'm not kidding. They're really fun to drive. They handle really well.

1223
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:23.060
I like mine. I'm going very tactile,

1224
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:25.100
but a Mazda three is different than them yet. All right.

1225
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.620
How much different is it? I mean probably pretty different. What does that one?

1226
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:31.820
That one right there. The 2019 Mazda mx five Amex five Miana.

1227
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:35.710
What about the Rx to see that red one? The cool red color? Yeah, but good.

1228
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:40.040
The one above that, please look at that with the removable roof. Ooh,

1229
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.790
that's like a target. It could be on the beach with her. That is a dope car.

1230
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.740
People are crazy. They just want it. They want higher horsepower.

1231
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:52.530
If that was instead of a Miata, if that was a Tesla, Tesla made a,

1232
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:57.200
an electric Miata that goes zero to 60 in one second. Get on.

1233
01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:01.190
Everybody would want that car. Yeah. Dude, it's a great car. Drive one.

1234
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.250
All right. You don't want to do.

1235
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.780
I'm going to test drive a Mazda Miata go to and it's cheap.

1236
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:10.190
How much does it Miata? It's like 28 Grand Jew, man. Come on man.

1237
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.000
I'm not bullshitting for 28 grand. You get a great car. I'm not kidding.

1238
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:15.440
I would drive a fucking Yoda.

1239
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:18.950
I just would never think that you would have this much passion about the Muslim

1240
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:23.120
Jada and it's really refreshing. I am an automobile enthusiast.

1241
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:27.470
I love cars. So the car is here. I love engineering. I'm a fan.

1242
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:30.950
Do I know you? Oh yeah. I love mechanical things.

1243
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:36.010
I love how people design things and what they've done with the Miata is they've

1244
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:41.171
made a car that it always has a loyal fan base that continues to buy them

1245
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:43.310
because they don't break the bank.

1246
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.610
It's not something that you pull up to the club and everybody thinks you're like

1247
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:49.700
some super baller, but it's a fun car to drive.

1248
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.610
There are really fun car to drive. They're super lightweight,

1249
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.590
they're very agile to handle. Great.

1250
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:59.300
They still make them with a manual transmission line stick. Yeah, they're fine,

1251
01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:03.030
man. It's a fun car to drive. Don't be hating on me. Honest. All right,

1252
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.650
body fill up Mazda three. I want the same love for the month. Not that good.

1253
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.140
What the fuck? Kind of boring. It's like you might as well get a Prius. Yeah,

1254
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:13.880
you're in the Prius category. You know what's happened with Tesla?

1255
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:15.080
It's interesting because when you,

1256
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.410
for a while you could be driving a Prius and no one knew if you are rich or

1257
01:10:18.411 --> 01:10:20.960
poor. It was the great equalizer. Still This Day,

1258
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:24.470
Larry David drives as fuck for sure. But Tesla came along and they were like,

1259
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.360
Yo, now you can stunt and save the earth.

1260
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:32.150
Now people know you're rich and pious before you didn't know if this guy's poor

1261
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:35.150
or DiCaprio. Yeah, but now it's like,

1262
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:37.820
so all the poor guys who want to go green are kind of fucked.

1263
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.280
But a Prius is different because it's a hybrid yet,

1264
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.780
like that was the only option. Back in the day. That was the only option.

1265
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:49.430
Mercedes has a an s class Mercedes,

1266
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:54.710
top of the food chain Mercedes. That's also a plugin hybrid.

1267
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.690
It's just the new one that they just released,

1268
01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:58.370
like Jeremy Clarkson was raving about it.

1269
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.380
It's supposed to be this incredible car.

1270
01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:05.740
So Mercedes is actually making like plugin hybrids for their top of the food

1271
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:09.110
chain vehicles. That's pretty cool. It's pretty, seems like that's cool. It is.

1272
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.070
It is new, but it's also, it's like a little bit of a step back because it has

1273
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.320
<v 1>what the step up is going to be about a car that charges and it charges an</v>

1274
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.200
enormous amount of time, like an hour or two. How long get 600 forever.

1275
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.880
We have a supercharger here.

1276
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.800
We have a supercharger installed here and it still takes, I dunno,

1277
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.860
probably five hours. Five hours dead. If it's dead,

1278
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.680
it'll probably take five hours, maybe six you know,

1279
01:11:37.681 --> 01:11:42.681
but like if I come here and like full charge is,

1280
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:48.920
what is it get 300 and fucking 90 miles or something like that.

1281
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:54.870
Somewhere around that range. Are you not really,

1282
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.210
are you having to be a little better with your planning? Like all right,

1283
01:11:57.211 --> 01:12:00.660
I'm going to put it in here. I'm not going anywhere with it. I go to La.

1284
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:04.020
I go to the comedy store like I have like this weekend I'm in Anaheim for the

1285
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:08.560
UFC. I'm not driving that fucking you crazy. I'm not getting stranded.

1286
01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:12.210
I happened to get stranded batteries that have electricity. Concise.

1287
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:14.400
Anybody can sit here with me for eight hours. Yeah,

1288
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:15.840
there's not a God damn thing you can do.

1289
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:20.080
You have to call a tow truck and they have to bring it to a charging station and

1290
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.550
then you have to sit there like an asshole. It's for six hours. It's a,

1291
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:26.640
but the technology, if you can't look,

1292
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:30.300
obviously I'm kidding in some way because it's super simple. It's got,

1293
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.340
you've seen one the inside where the giant screen.

1294
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.910
I've only seen from the outside cause like the colon right here. Go sit in it.

1295
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:40.750
Cause the comedy store has turned into a Tesla dealership. It's kind of hot,

1296
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:42.790
you know? [inaudible]

1297
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:48.370
you know the store isn't a renaissance where it's like so many tests coming in

1298
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:50.760
and out of that place. Not just Tesla.

1299
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.770
It's like Russell Peters pulls up in a Ferrari SUV. Plato just got a Bentley,

1300
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:59.460
a Ferrari. Oh No. A Lamborghini Lamborghini SUV.

1301
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.390
Now must be the most trying time to be a lot guy at the comedy store.

1302
01:13:03.391 --> 01:13:08.130
Just imagine the bullets they sweat having to move because that parking lot in

1303
01:13:08.131 --> 01:13:09.840
the comedy store, it's like tetris.

1304
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.530
There's a finite amount of space and they've got to fit all the paid regulars

1305
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:17.550
cars in there. And the problem is the price tag and all these are insane.

1306
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:21.030
Now the problem is they're letting these promoters park there.

1307
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.630
Oh aren't they being better about about saying like you can't park in a lot.

1308
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.260
They should detonate their cars. They should have like,

1309
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:31.650
like instead of a tow truck that's just like a stick of dynamite to giant like

1310
01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.070
Kevlar tarp that they throw those cars and just detonate them.

1311
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.740
It's just during your set. You just do it.

1312
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.480
Like I'm just kidding promoter cause there's so many people that parked back

1313
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:44.730
there like you're not even a comic. Like what are you doing?

1314
01:13:44.731 --> 01:13:45.541
Not only that though,

1315
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:50.541
like the back bar and that sold the back area get weird cause that's like our

1316
01:13:51.211 --> 01:13:51.971
home. That's kind where,

1317
01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:55.470
where we hang out before we have to go on stage and we want to see you guys like

1318
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:57.870
you or Santana and just like chop it up before we have to go on stage.

1319
01:13:57.871 --> 01:13:59.460
And then it's like who's this?

1320
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.600
And they talk to you and they interrupt conversations and not in a snooty way,

1321
01:14:03.601 --> 01:14:07.380
but it is a bit of a way. It's like a dugout. It's like a baseball dugout.

1322
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:11.980
Adderall people go back. Yeah, they talked too much too. Yeah. You don't need

1323
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.080
<v 2>that in your life. Right. But they actually,</v>

1324
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.480
they have more confidence than me back there.

1325
01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:19.870
I'm like [inaudible] they have Adderall confidence. I've never done that at all.

1326
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:23.080
Have you done it? Isn't it big now? Like every student has taken it.

1327
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.110
A lot of people are taking it. It's a big thing amongst journalists,

1328
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.830
journalists, writers. Cause they get more work done because you're on speed.

1329
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:33.730
Like there was a guy that I had in here that was a writing a book on,

1330
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:36.520
he wrote that book on Hunter s Thompson. Um, what does that, uh,

1331
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.510
what does it, what is, what does this book

1332
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:45.430
something Gonzo something. Anyway, um,

1333
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:49.290
he was talking about how he needs it to write and he can't write without it.

1334
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.630
Is it just the deadlines and the workload is insane and that's a way to kind of

1335
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.240
cope with it. You don't need it to, right. Can you move your fingers?

1336
01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.740
You lose your shares. Yes. Are you alive? Fatigue? Yes.

1337
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:03.220
Take a break. Go for a walk. That's the natural thing to do.

1338
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:06.550
But some people want a quick fix. Well, it's not necessarily a quick fix.

1339
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.300
It's like you can get a gun. Timothy didn't Evie yet. It's nice tire.

1340
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:13.000
Very nice mental debt. If you keep on taking it.

1341
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.620
What's the name of the book? Yeah. Mental debt. Yeah.

1342
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:21.280
It's called you become a crack head freaking freak. Kingdom.

1343
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.980
You become someone who is on stimulants all the time.

1344
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.380
And I know several people that have an issue.

1345
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:31.360
I know one guy has completely lost his fucking mind.

1346
01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:33.750
Thinks everybody's against him, thinks that, uh,

1347
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:37.360
everyone's done him wrong and he's just out there cracked out in the middle of

1348
01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:37.811
nowhere.

1349
01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:41.830
On fucking Adderall every day and making youtube videos and there's a lot of

1350
01:15:41.831 --> 01:15:43.990
people like that, man. There's a lot of people like that.

1351
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:48.460
It is a meth like drug. It's very, very, very,

1352
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:49.960
very similar to meth. Yeah.

1353
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.710
It's just a different release in terms of like the how quickly your body

1354
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:56.260
processes crazy, how widespread it is for something like that.

1355
01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:58.600
Then it's fucking stimulants. Man Gets people.

1356
01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:03.460
If you can effectively do your job and you don't commit any crimes and a,

1357
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:07.270
they can sell you that stuff and make a profit and then you actually are more

1358
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:11.680
profitable when you're on that stuff than not than fucking have at it.

1359
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.290
That's how people look at things and like that. Look, when I was, uh,

1360
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.880
when pop was sort of legal, when it was medically legal,

1361
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.990
I had a bullshit prescription. Your back hurt. Oh yeah. Everything Bro.

1362
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.100
That's actually a matter of African. I used a bunch of different ones.

1363
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:29.200
You go to the hot doctor, you know, like you would see on sunset boulevard.

1364
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:32.890
It's like this, like Persian chick is like, no. Describe, you know,

1365
01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:35.890
I went to a black dude with dreadlocks. He was awesome. He,

1366
01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:38.170
this is what he looked at me and when I went in that's the best.

1367
01:16:38.171 --> 01:16:42.270
We ducked her to the blanket like, oh, this guy's good the best. He had a,

1368
01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.190
do you remember those vaporizers that are, they're a bag.

1369
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:46.330
They're called the volcano.

1370
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.110
I remember when I stayed with Ra chef here in New York and he,

1371
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:51.880
he had those and I had never seen that before.

1372
01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:53.950
Just seemed like such an odd contraption.

1373
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.110
Some of the early podcasts we vaporized with that bag and they're the dumbest

1374
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:01.660
conversations because we had no idea what we're talking about.

1375
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:05.290
I would like correct myself halfway into a sentence because I forgot what I was

1376
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:08.950
saying and then I would forget what the original correction was and then I'd be

1377
01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:11.600
what else? No, that's not what I'm saying. What am I saying?

1378
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:16.010
I was so fucked up and it would take like an hour into the podcast before,

1379
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:17.300
like the fog would settle.

1380
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:21.950
So was that just the medical marijuana delivery system? Well, no,

1381
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:23.740
it's just a delivery system. It's not meant.

1382
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.300
You can use it right now and you don't have to. I feel like, dude,

1383
01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:30.260
people use it that way. Really vaporize what those bags, what's the,

1384
01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.950
I don't know, upside of that. No smoke. You're not, you're just getting missed.

1385
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.650
You're basically getting the THC crystals.

1386
01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.530
It's turning into mist and when you vaporize,

1387
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:43.470
you're not getting the burnt plant material. Almost like harsh on a sewers.

1388
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:48.910
There's a million ways to get what you need or wine dorks or cigar dorks.

1389
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.680
It's like real similar. But anyway,

1390
01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:55.190
I walked into this guy's office and he's just the fucking coolest.

1391
01:17:55.191 --> 01:17:59.150
I wish I kept in touch with this dude who was, uh, somewhere in Hollywood.

1392
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.930
I forget where it was, but they do look to me, goes, you look sick,

1393
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.380
you're sick. He goes, you need some medicine,

1394
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.700
you need some medicine. And he had his big smile on face. I said, thank you sir.

1395
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:13.400
I feel sick and I feel like I need some medicine. He goes,

1396
01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.420
what are you here for a brother? And I said, uh, it helps you sleep. He goes,

1397
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:22.490
good enough for me. And he wrote a prescription. He gives me a prescription.

1398
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.280
Then he pulls out the biggest bag.

1399
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.310
He hit accustomed vaporizer bag for the volcano. And I'm telling you,

1400
01:18:28.311 --> 01:18:32.300
I'm not exaggerating, it was four feet long. She says is four feet long bag.

1401
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.350
He puts it on this,

1402
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:38.420
like if it pumps up like a kids bouncing house fills up with weed,

1403
01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:43.220
he does it there. Oh yeah. We were blasted. We got blasted at his place. Um,

1404
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.230
the doctor's office was connected to a grow up, right? So we, we smoke,

1405
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.270
we smoke, we vaporized, right?

1406
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.060
And then we'd go into the back where they're growing the wheat and we're

1407
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.100
barbecued, right? I'm barely in this dimension.

1408
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:58.970
And I go in there and I see all these plants and I get a feeling from these

1409
01:18:58.971 --> 01:19:01.520
things like they're alive. Like they're conscious.

1410
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:06.800
It felt so weird to this day. I missed that feeling. I go up, maybe it was that,

1411
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:08.930
was I so high I was hallucinating.

1412
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:14.050
Is it or is it possible that if you get really high on pot and then you go

1413
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:15.380
around the pot leaves,

1414
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:19.280
you pick up their frequency and you understand that they're a living organism.

1415
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:22.640
And that's one of the reasons why they make you feel so good when you get high.

1416
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:25.360
Like one of the reasons why you're interact,

1417
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:28.880
you're interacting with whatever they are with the molecules,

1418
01:19:28.881 --> 01:19:31.790
the THC and the Canab anoints, you're interacting with it.

1419
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:35.780
And then when you go around the actual potted plants and they're all super

1420
01:19:35.781 --> 01:19:38.810
healthy cause they got this crazy hydroponics set up and they're all the right

1421
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:43.811
nutrients and now these blush green plants and it's perfect environment for

1422
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:48.380
growing cause you know they're experts and I'm like these things are alive man.

1423
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.350
These things like they're, they know you're there. They're like, Huh.

1424
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:56.390
So it was that. So it was a successful trip. Oh yeah man, I was,

1425
01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:01.010
I took me hours before I knew what I was doing afterwards.

1426
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.230
It's like hours later trying to figure out,

1427
01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.850
oh I just love how he took the onus of an excuse off of you. Oh yeah.

1428
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.020
Yo look sick. That's stop

1429
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 1>moment. I walked in like you look sick,</v>

1430
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:15.470
you looks you need some medicine and crazy dreadlocks and circular glasses.

1431
01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:19.110
He was amazing. God, I wish I kept in touch with that. Good doctor.

1432
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.040
He was a great doctor. I've had a bunch of good weed doctors.

1433
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:27.330
I had one of them though. I had to stop going. He went crazy nine 11 on me.

1434
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.930
What does that mean? He, when he was trying to tell me that the,

1435
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.460
the towers were brought down by Tesla technology and I was like, what?

1436
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:39.500
He's like, concrete doesn't vaporize. I was like, what do you mean vaporized?

1437
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.840
I said try to do a bit about like how like, you know,

1438
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.200
you hear about white privilege and everything. I go,

1439
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:45.120
one of the things about white privilege people don't really think about that

1440
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:48.120
much is you're allowed to have any conspiracy theory you want.

1441
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:52.860
I can't be like nine 11 was an inside job. You know,

1442
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.650
like jet fuel can't melt steel beams. They're like whatever.

1443
01:20:55.651 --> 01:21:00.330
I'll come and sure thing. Aladdin. No, you don't understand dead's different.

1444
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.261
Yep. Yeah.

1445
01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:05.220
If you looked at the pie chart of people that are really into conspiracies and

1446
01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:08.190
like looked at race white would be overwhelming.

1447
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.790
What would it be like the pie chart of conspiracy theorists? Yeah. I Dunno.

1448
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:15.060
Like three quarters of the pie chart. White people. Yeah. Just,

1449
01:21:15.061 --> 01:21:17.220
it would sound absurd coming from me. Like I don't believe that.

1450
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:19.710
But imagine if I'm like nine 11 wasn't, you know, it was a brown guy.

1451
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:24.260
Like they're like share thing. You're not getting off that easy inside.

1452
01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:28.080
Yeah. It's a, you, you worked for Boeing's I what you do? What,

1453
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.930
what did you do over there? I was an aerospace engineer.

1454
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:34.880
Were you involved at all in nine 11? Did you have anything to do John?

1455
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:36.060
I'm Outta here. Ken.

1456
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:39.750
Tell us your lulling me into a false sense of security with like the comedy and

1457
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.680
the comedy store here is, I've been your friends anyways. Uh,

1458
01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:46.350
you were involved in nine 11. What did you train those pilots you gave me?

1459
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:50.970
What did you do? What'd you do at Boeing? I did stress analysis. Oh,

1460
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:52.040
we're the floor.

1461
01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.500
It's a very unglamorous the thing with like a kind of cool though, I guess. So.

1462
01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:58.950
Um, you're bonafide. Smart. Yeah.

1463
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.910
I mean I'm able to jump through hoops with a goal in mind.

1464
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:06.300
Like I have a high threshold for academic pain, so I took a lot of math.

1465
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.040
I took a lot of, it wasn't that hard for me. It was like, I mean,

1466
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:13.320
it's difficult to get the degree, but all right, they do these steps,

1467
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:16.080
you get this number, there's this formula, you have the tools,

1468
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:18.900
they show you how to do it. Monkey see monkey do.

1469
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.010
Interesting way to describe it.

1470
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:22.950
And you have a high threshold for academic pink cause it is like a little

1471
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:24.600
painful. Right. I think just,

1472
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.020
it seems so daunting to the average person and they just don't want to be

1473
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:31.590
bothered with that. To even get over the hump of learning something like that.

1474
01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:34.620
They're just like, I could never, that's for brainiacs.

1475
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.930
But the thing is engineering was a means to an end for me to do stand up comedy.

1476
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.370
Like my parents were gonna pay for my college, but only certain degrees.

1477
01:22:44.371 --> 01:22:47.910
So at first, because I knew I wanted to do stand up when I was like 17. Really?

1478
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:52.240
Yeah. How'd you know? Uh, I think two things happen.

1479
01:22:52.241 --> 01:22:54.690
So I didn't grow up with standup.

1480
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.210
I didn't really know it was a thing that was on my radar.

1481
01:22:57.810 --> 01:23:02.190
I grew up at the Simpsons, SNL and, and like Kona late-night Konan. Those were,

1482
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:05.680
those are my jams. I feel like that's my comedy. Um, DNA.

1483
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:09.970
<v 0>But then I'll 17 till I get my 17th birthday. We rented delirious,</v>

1484
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.980
so we watched delirious Eddie Murphy's delirious, you know, just fuck.

1485
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.330
It was like the greatest thing in the world.

1486
01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.060
And that just planted the seed of comedy.

1487
01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:24.040
So that coupled with my love for SNL and I'm like, how do I, I like,

1488
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.020
I don't know if Google was around even or maybe, I don't know.

1489
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:29.350
I just research how do people get on SNL? Maybe Google was around.

1490
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:31.960
So I saw they came from two camps.

1491
01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.160
They were either stand ups where they came from, uh, Improv.

1492
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:39.880
So like second city, UCB, Groundlings.

1493
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.610
This was like the pedigree. These are the schools they picked from.

1494
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:46.420
And then I researched those schools. They were in Chicago, La, New York.

1495
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.800
You had to pay money to take these classes. Um, you may not pass,

1496
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:52.900
you have to go back to one oh one or whatever. So it's like,

1497
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.370
it's like a school and stand up is just you just you out there.

1498
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.090
We'll take a sword, you know? Yeah. So I like, I'm like,

1499
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.870
oh I could do that and there's comedy clubs in Seattle. I can count on me.

1500
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.620
Like I don't have to rely on other people to like Zip Zap zoop with each other.

1501
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.260
Improv is a great thing, you know? I'm not like knocking or anything.

1502
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:13.180
It's just a, it's such a different,

1503
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.860
you have to dedicate your life to like one or the other.

1504
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:18.160
I think it was very hard to be great at both and there's not a lot of career

1505
01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:22.060
paths for Improv. It's like getting to a certain spot and that's it.

1506
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:23.230
There's some people who are very,

1507
01:24:23.231 --> 01:24:28.231
very talented in Groundlings in like UCB and then how do they monetize that?

1508
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:31.930
If they book a commercial, they're still beholden to a lot of other people.

1509
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:34.870
They have to be the right guy or girl, the right look.

1510
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.180
There are so many variables that are outside of your control as a talented

1511
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:42.430
improv performer, but as a standup, you could do a weekend.

1512
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:46.960
We can always make money once you get to a certain level famous like in terms of

1513
01:24:46.961 --> 01:24:49.150
going on the road as an Improv guy,

1514
01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:52.990
I guess as whose line is it anyway guys do it. Yeah, but you, you'll have to,

1515
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.500
maybe they'll, they'll start doing stand up because they've built some,

1516
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:58.540
you'll see that, right. They'll build some credibility,

1517
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:01.300
like a notoriety and they come from the Improv background,

1518
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.000
but if they want to start making some money on the road,

1519
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.500
they start doing stand up.

1520
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.940
But they're no better off than someone like a 22 year old doing standup now

1521
01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:13.330
because you got to put the hours in just because you're good at this other

1522
01:25:13.331 --> 01:25:18.140
thing. You still have to start over. Right. It's like the farm. Yeah, yeah,

1523
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:22.330
exactly. You got, you can't, um, the beauty of standards, you can't skip steps.

1524
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.700
It's so when you see a comic on stage,

1525
01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:26.920
it's like when you cut a tree open and you see all the rings,

1526
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.640
you could just tell like, oh, this guy's been doing it 20 years. Yes.

1527
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:32.530
You can't fake that. Yeah.

1528
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:36.700
So I chose to do stand up because it was just me out there and I could rely on

1529
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:40.090
me and I could do it while I do engineering school.

1530
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:43.900
So I chose engineering because like I knew I wanted to do this stuff,

1531
01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:46.690
so I thought I needed a theater degree. So I was like, can I do theater?

1532
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.730
And my dad was like, no, you can't do theater.

1533
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:51.520
And then I kept getting more and more watered down. I was like,

1534
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:55.960
can I do like directing? Like, no, you can't. Just direct things.

1535
01:25:55.961 --> 01:25:59.140
I told you what you can and can't do. Yeah. And I love it. In hindsight,

1536
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:03.290
I'm so grateful, dude. If I had an a theater degree right now,

1537
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
I'd be fucked.

1538
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.830
If anyone's watching and you have a theater degree or you're thinking about

1539
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:13.010
getting a theater degree, don't do it. You don't need it.

1540
01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.190
You're not going to be Jude law because you have a theater degree.

1541
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:17.750
You could do it on the side.

1542
01:26:17.751 --> 01:26:20.540
Think of how many people have come to la or New York. It's a different thing.

1543
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:21.051
Okay, look,

1544
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:24.770
if you're at Julliard and you're this instrument or whatever and it's like a

1545
01:26:24.771 --> 01:26:29.120
top, top, top theater school, and it's a theater to like that world.

1546
01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:34.340
Okay. Or if you're the son of like a huge actor or daughter.

1547
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:38.080
Sure. But if you're like in, I dunno,

1548
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.850
Ohio and you're going to theater to school,

1549
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:45.680
you're just lighting your parents' money on fire, that's all you're doing.

1550
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:50.000
They're letting you like go on a 20 year old jungle gym for four years.

1551
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:54.890
The thing is like you see sometimes like an actor like or rather like an athlete

1552
01:26:54.891 --> 01:26:58.970
or someone will be an actor and a movie and they'll do a fucking amazing job.

1553
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.600
Here's the thing, like Oprah, here's an example. Color purple.

1554
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:07.250
The highest paid actor is the rock. What? Theater school?

1555
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:10.850
Dwayne, the Rock Johnson. Go to the theater of hard knocks. Thank you.

1556
01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.240
So you might as well do wrestling as opposed to, so it doesn't,

1557
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.300
theater degree does not equal acting job. Right?

1558
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:21.800
But that's a different kind of acting than say like Jake Glen Allen Hall or

1559
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.320
sure. I mean, yeah. Do you think you're learning that at all? Like,

1560
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.330
here's the other thing too that I always thought was so interesting because I

1561
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:33.080
did act in class for like two months when I was here in La, you know,

1562
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:34.910
just to try it out and stuff. It wasn't for me.

1563
01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.410
And what's funny is like there'll be teaching these techniques and like Mies

1564
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:42.350
narrow tapping in and blah blah blah.

1565
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.410
And then at the end of the class there'll be like, all right,

1566
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:47.090
does anybody have any sides? They want any auditions,

1567
01:27:47.091 --> 01:27:49.760
they want to go over and it's all just CSI. Interrogation job's like,

1568
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:51.043
I don't know the guy.

1569
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:55.160
So you're like you're teaching Shakespeare class and anything anyone's ever

1570
01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:56.540
going out for is like, oh yeah,

1571
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:58.670
I used to come around here like two times a week.

1572
01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:05.630
Like how is I am big pentameter helping you with that's, that's what you're,

1573
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:08.840
and you're chomping at the bit to get this long order.

1574
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:14.180
CSI delivery guy number two, why are you learning Meisner? Right.

1575
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.780
And I know there are no bit parts, only been actors and all that. Was it true?

1576
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.220
No. That's what actor, that's what I'm acting. Teachers will love to tell you,

1577
01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:24.650
when you complain about getting a bit part, like got they go,

1578
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:29.540
there are no bit parts, only bit actors, and then you go, oh,

1579
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:31.880
I don't want to be bit actor. I'm happy to be a tree.

1580
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.900
Well, there's certain comics will tell you there are no bad crowds.

1581
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:42.260
Those people are assholes. Sure. I think we've been,

1582
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:46.460
the thing is if you're a younger comic and you're, you're like a crop sucked,

1583
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.080
you don't have the bandwidth to know what's good and bad yet. Not yet.

1584
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:52.970
So you can say that.

1585
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.660
I can say that like we've all seen bad crowds. Sure.

1586
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:58.190
And we can chalk it up for what it is.

1587
01:28:58.191 --> 01:29:00.980
But if you're a year end or a two years in, it was Mo,

1588
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:03.750
it was probably you not, um,

1589
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:07.680
audible ing or just like adjusting on the fly does every, yeah.

1590
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.940
Very good. Yeah. Maybe that too. Sure, sure. That's a,

1591
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:15.810
there's a weird thing about comics where there's certain comics where, you know,

1592
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:19.500
there's no way they're going to figure it out. I don't know though,

1593
01:29:19.501 --> 01:29:22.110
because I mean as a whole, yes. But there are, I,

1594
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:24.090
I hear there's anomalies from that.

1595
01:29:24.091 --> 01:29:25.530
Like cause I would hear stories about Sebastian,

1596
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:29.160
which is so crazy cause I wasn't there for that timeline of one.

1597
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.210
But he's killing it. He's so funny. You know? And he's like the guy now.

1598
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:37.500
Well he was never terrible. Okay. So you're talking about like, no,

1599
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:41.910
I remember Sebastian in the beginning. He was never terrible. He was learning.

1600
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.500
I see. But he was,

1601
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.670
he showed up all the time and he was always a nice guy and he's like,

1602
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:52.050
he wasn't terrible. He just didn't do great in the beginning.

1603
01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:55.230
I think people just take liberties with that story then and they make it sound

1604
01:29:55.231 --> 01:29:58.500
like, yeah, no, he was never offensively on funny. Right.

1605
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:00.720
Certain people that are offensively on funny where you're like,

1606
01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:05.700
there's not a chance you are, you're missing the DNA. Like you just can't,

1607
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:09.960
you're color blind. You're missing it. Whatever it is. You don't have it. Yeah.

1608
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.390
Can't breathe. I mean that's the beauty.

1609
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:16.770
I would hear Mitzi stories of her just telling people like, we are in tear ball.

1610
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:18.360
You've never met her, Huh? No,

1611
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:22.680
I got there when Tommy was around and it was kind of, so she was still,

1612
01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:25.170
she was like sick, you know. And he would say,

1613
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.000
Nancy saw your tay and I don't know if she, I know, I know, I know. Yeah.

1614
01:30:30.230 --> 01:30:34.290
So he would always just like have this buffer between like Mitzi and myself.

1615
01:30:34.291 --> 01:30:37.920
And I would pretend that Mitzi was, she became like a,

1616
01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.630
what's the guy's name from psycho Norman Bates. What's his legs?

1617
01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:46.050
And mom was in the fucking shower, but it was really him, you know,

1618
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.410
like his mom's dead and he would put the wig on. That was Tommy.

1619
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.750
Tommy put the Mitzi wig on and then he wouldn't,

1620
01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:53.730
he would always like do her voice and stuff.

1621
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:57.140
And like when giving and dude like,

1622
01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:01.080
cause he would expunge wisdom and cause I remember I would drive up from Boeing.

1623
01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:04.140
That was my, so I was working in Long Beach. Oh yes.

1624
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.420
I've got an engineering degree. Right. And then I just applied to jobs.

1625
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.420
I did mechanical engineering cause my best friend was doing mechanical and I was

1626
01:31:09.421 --> 01:31:11.400
like, I don't care what engineering I do. I just,

1627
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:12.780
I'll be close about it to my friend.

1628
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:17.070
And you were just doing that so you could have a job so you could make time for

1629
01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.230
myself, it was such a long con. It's like, alright,

1630
01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:24.300
I knew I wanted to do stand up. Um, in the meantime I got to go to college.

1631
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:29.280
Right. I've gotta be able to support so I can get good in Seattle.

1632
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.430
Really funny man. I guess people don't, um, do that.

1633
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.420
Life's a long time if you're lucky, you know? Yeah.

1634
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:39.920
And it's okay to have to plan this far out. It sounds Farfetch.

1635
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.550
Maybe if I told it to someone at the time,

1636
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:46.290
but in hindsight it was the most beautifully executed plan. So yeah.

1637
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:50.850
So I did stand up while I was going to college. My life was just um,

1638
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:53.310
school by day, stand up at night.

1639
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:57.130
It would actually be stand up on the weekends cause I was living at home and

1640
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:58.140
it's 40 minutes of the club,

1641
01:31:58.141 --> 01:32:01.150
so I would just do a lot of time on Friday and Saturday. Did your parents know?

1642
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.360
Yeah, they knew and it was bad. It was like a,

1643
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:07.780
I was doing heroin like they were against it. Wow. Just because I feel now,

1644
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:13.150
um, my mom has, I took her to the premiere, I had a small role in whiskey,

1645
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:14.780
tango, Foxtrot, this Tina Fey movie.

1646
01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:19.120
So I took her to the premiere in New York and so she got to be on the red carpet

1647
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:23.800
and like take pictures with Tina Fey and like, and so she, she was in,

1648
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:26.140
she was in after that and she keeps on asking me, she's like,

1649
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:30.500
when's the next premiere? Well, you know, I'm available.

1650
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:32.230
Thanks for me or that

1651
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.630
there was an after party and everyone's milling about. And then my mom's like,

1652
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:41.670
there's Tina. Tina's like, introduce me. I'm like, yeah, okay, I'll come home.

1653
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:44.260
Cause I'm like, my mom's a sweetheart, but I'm,

1654
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.780
I'm still caught in this showbiz thing. Like I'm,

1655
01:32:46.781 --> 01:32:50.020
what number 15 on the call sheet or I'm married.

1656
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.630
I wouldn't even know if she remembers me even though the movie, you know,

1657
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:56.200
so I'm like, I got to pick my spot. And then she just kind of like nudges me.

1658
01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.450
You're like a linebacker. She's like, pushes me into Tina. I'm like, oh,

1659
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.850
but it was great to have the out of my mom be like, my mom is such a huge fan.

1660
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:06.820
And she was like, Oh yeah, of course. And she was a sweetheart. So now she's in,

1661
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.630
she's in, she's like, you made it, you're, you're, you're actually, yeah,

1662
01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:12.490
she could see the light at the end of the tunnel, like, okay. And what your dad?

1663
01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:17.200
My Dad, my dad is kind of more nuts and bolts. He doesn't,

1664
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.890
he doesn't like get fooled by the gluten, the glamour, anything like that.

1665
01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:24.550
He just understands money and things. Like,

1666
01:33:24.551 --> 01:33:27.850
I've had a nice car that Mazda, if I had a Mazda Miata,

1667
01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:32.920
I mean he'd be fucking soul like you did okay. But no, get a Tesla.

1668
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.940
Yeah, I guess so. I think what, what has soften him a little bit,

1669
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:38.470
cause I just got this place in Tarzana,

1670
01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:40.630
like a house and that's like real adult shit.

1671
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:44.020
So I didn't realize that would kind of, um,

1672
01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:48.400
soften him a bit because how old do you know? 35 so you're like, wow,

1673
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:52.300
he's a real adult. I guess so. Yeah. Do you have a girlfriend? No.

1674
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.520
So when you get married, I don't know if he cares about the hell.

1675
01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.430
Like I think it adult does. I think my dad cares more about the security, like,

1676
01:34:00.431 --> 01:34:03.040
like a real career, uh,

1677
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:06.960
income and a house and stability when the comedy was never that.

1678
01:34:06.961 --> 01:34:10.030
And then also aside from just those things, you know,

1679
01:34:10.031 --> 01:34:12.490
they're from Afghanistan so it's a low,

1680
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:17.550
in my dad's opinion it's kind of a low thing is like a low thing for someone to

1681
01:34:18.401 --> 01:34:23.190
be doing. Like oh yeah, like low, like um, sub subhuman

1682
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:29.210
cause he would always say cause all you had like a giant sold-out theater.

1683
01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.740
I don't know, maybe. Yeah, who knows? But his line of people waiting to see you,

1684
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:34.930
I guess. I don't know what that thing will be, but he would,

1685
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:36.630
he would always say, cause we would, you know,

1686
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:40.480
be in shouting matches when we were younger. Oh yeah. When I was younger. Yeah.

1687
01:34:40.481 --> 01:34:42.910
I mean look, I love my parents and I know what it was grounded in.

1688
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.480
I think they just, they didn't want me to be eating out of a dumpster.

1689
01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:50.650
So they were just, they were there. I mean,

1690
01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:54.460
most of my dad's his frustration and lashing out or just like,

1691
01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.020
not like physical or anything. Just like, you know,

1692
01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.160
like you're throwing your life away, blah, blah, blah.

1693
01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:02.270
Was cause he wanted that security for me. Yeah. I understand it for what it is.

1694
01:35:02.271 --> 01:35:05.780
When I was like 17 or 18. Yeah. You know, you don't get me right.

1695
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:09.710
Like it just feels so now that I'm older, I get it.

1696
01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:14.300
I get where he's coming from. Yeah. So never had it.

1697
01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:17.000
The point was, but I think now that I have a little more stability

1698
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.140
[inaudible] say, um, he's like, they, he's like,

1699
01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.710
you're out there every night with the pimps and the prostitutes.

1700
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:30.410
I don't think my dad's ever been to a comedy club.

1701
01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.130
You see a pimp at the comedy store.

1702
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.040
I might've seen one or two prostitutes over the last 20 years out there.

1703
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:42.890
And every night, pimps and prostitutes,

1704
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.780
that was his line. You should talk about this on stage.

1705
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:50.570
He didn't like my last special I taught, I tell that story. I talk,

1706
01:35:50.571 --> 01:35:53.750
I talk about this story with my dad and he would always trot that out there.

1707
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.050
I mean he's not half wrong. He's half wrong. He's half.

1708
01:36:03.051 --> 01:36:04.670
I've seen a couple of prostitutes share,

1709
01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.440
but that sounds like as long as there's no pimps.

1710
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:10.640
I've seen maybe two or three prostitutes in the whole front rows.

1711
01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:15.340
Just like for coats. Oh, I'm like canes. Oh Oh,

1712
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:19.070
grease. Big Diamond Rings. He would say,

1713
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.510
he says people should be entertaining you. That would be the thing.

1714
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.550
Like I should be the one entertained. Cause you're intelligent I guess.

1715
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:30.200
So you're a serious person.

1716
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.040
Like I just found like if you want to make broad strokes,

1717
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:36.610
I think in the Middle Eastern community it's um,

1718
01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:42.260
like they love art but they're kids shouldn't be doing it like they should be.

1719
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:45.140
They should be consumers of art. Oh, interesting.

1720
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:49.940
But what if you were like a famous painter, classical painter, I guess. No one,

1721
01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.510
no parent really thinks best case scenario for their kid. Like ever once,

1722
01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.280
once people buy his art, it's always like, it's a pipe dream. What are the odds?

1723
01:36:58.281 --> 01:36:59.114
Blah blah, blah.

1724
01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:03.750
You're throwing your life away and I guess there is some statistically sure

1725
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.180
statistic. Sure.

1726
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.670
But I think like what I would do different when I have kids or whatever,

1727
01:37:07.671 --> 01:37:11.270
I would, I would explain the realities of how, you know,

1728
01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:13.030
the whole theater degree thing. I,

1729
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.120
I'm so glad they made me do a degree with teeth because that allowed me to have

1730
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:20.120
a legitimate job to get me out here. Like I'm not a trust fund kid.

1731
01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.000
How else would I be close to where I needed to be? I needed to be here.

1732
01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:27.650
They're in Seattle. They're still up there. They're still there. Yeah. Yeah. So,

1733
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:32.060
so I would have some practicality. I'd be like, I'll pay for your college, get,

1734
01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.360
get a legitimate degree where there's actual job outlook at the end.

1735
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:38.630
Like I'm not paying you to find yourself. When did you quit the job?

1736
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:43.310
Like 2010 2010 2009 so right when you came to this store,

1737
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.410
right around. So some things happened.

1738
01:37:45.411 --> 01:37:49.340
Like I was working at Boeing for three and a half years and I would just work by

1739
01:37:49.341 --> 01:37:50.570
day and I would drive.

1740
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:54.830
I would drive up to Hollywood and like the Valley by night I was burning the

1741
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:57.450
candle at both ends. Oh, you must have been tired all the time. I was,

1742
01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.240
well especially at first cause I didn't know the lay of the comedy land.

1743
01:38:00.330 --> 01:38:00.961
I was just going,

1744
01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:03.990
I thought everything was worth my time or you don't know until you do it.

1745
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:09.410
So I would do some really shitty open Mike drive all the banner shows that were,

1746
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.830
that wasn't a thing. That wasn't a thing yet as of late.

1747
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:17.490
You know what's so funny is like the progression of the AllSeen is that first it

1748
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:21.240
was in weird spots like a washing or to get laundromat and then it was like

1749
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:23.940
meltdown and then living rooms were a big thing.

1750
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:28.540
Living Room shows and then backyards were hot. [inaudible] the next shows,

1751
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:31.500
oh yeah I want to do is get people in the living room where it's like the

1752
01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:33.540
hottest art show. It's called crawl space. Well,

1753
01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:34.980
let me make the ones just on their belly.

1754
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.120
You do really funny one-on-one sketches that you do.

1755
01:38:39.121 --> 01:38:42.510
Like you play more than one role. Oh thanks man. On your Instagram,

1756
01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.230
like super bored during the day and you're like, no,

1757
01:38:46.231 --> 01:38:49.020
he's wanting to ask a why I do them and stuff. Yeah. All right.

1758
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:54.021
So it's almost just some of the stuff I do is just a byproduct of,

1759
01:38:55.170 --> 01:38:59.790
I don't know, being creatively backlogged. So I love standup and I love sketch.

1760
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.460
Those come to me naturally. Sometimes people will be like,

1761
01:39:02.461 --> 01:39:04.650
do you have a movie script? Or like a, you know, what's, what's,

1762
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.380
what's your sit-com and that's just more work.

1763
01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:10.800
There's a scaffolding there that if I was teamed up with someone who understands

1764
01:39:10.801 --> 01:39:12.330
that world, maybe you'd be a little more easy.

1765
01:39:12.331 --> 01:39:16.260
But I don't want to Bang my head against a wall to understand a format where

1766
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:20.640
standup and sketch just like come to me. Right. So that's why I lean into that.

1767
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:23.430
So stand up has been a thing I've been doing for like 17 years.

1768
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:27.960
I feel like I've developed, I'm good at that sketch. Um, I started doing,

1769
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:31.170
I did it like I think h I was, I grew up through it. Like thumb,

1770
01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.210
I would do funny videos in school,

1771
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.390
like video productions back in the day when you had two VCRs,

1772
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:39.720
this is before like avid, so you'd like jog shuttle,

1773
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.270
you would have two tapes you're mixing on tape and your raw tape.

1774
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.730
So you would actually like make sketches on a VHS cassette.

1775
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.940
So I was always into that cause I love that to know, you know,

1776
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:50.970
so and then you know, you stopped doing it.

1777
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:54.420
I'm doing stand up and then I moved to La and I'm not getting on stage that much

1778
01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:57.600
because it's so saturated here. It's so sad.

1779
01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:00.090
It's the biggest market here in New York,

1780
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:03.570
although I think it's easier to get on stage as a standup in New York here you

1781
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:06.780
have to deal with actors and there's a real bottleneck.

1782
01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:09.780
So I wasn't getting up a lot, but I'm a creative guy.

1783
01:40:09.781 --> 01:40:13.860
I have all these ideas and I had this idea for this video,

1784
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:18.530
I'm like, how to attend an Afghan wedding or whatever. So, and I was gonna,

1785
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.490
I was trying to get people to help me out and shoot it.

1786
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:23.400
And then you're a run to, no one really gives a fuck.

1787
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:26.130
Like if you can't do anything for anybody when you first come out here,

1788
01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.750
it's just sort of like, and not in a mean way,

1789
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:31.200
it's just the nature of the wilderness. Like why am I going to,

1790
01:40:31.201 --> 01:40:34.140
you're not a proven thing. There's really no upside. So you get a lot of like,

1791
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:35.310
yeah, I'll help you. And then flake.

1792
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:39.990
So I rewrote it to just do it all in my apartment. So I just filmed this video,

1793
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:43.200
this youtube video. It wasn't even on youtube yet though. It was, um,

1794
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:45.780
I did this video called how to attend an Afghan wedding or something,

1795
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.380
which is called African wedding. I put her on my space and it kind of does,

1796
01:40:49.381 --> 01:40:52.380
well, it kind of takes off a little bit. And then my brother was like, oh,

1797
01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:53.190
you should put it on youtube.

1798
01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:56.860
Like it wasn't ubiquitous to put stuff on youtube yet. I was like, Oh yeah,

1799
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.990
okay. I'll put it on youtube to put on Youtube.

1800
01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.180
It kind of makes the rounds on there too.

1801
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.790
And that was just kind of like the nudge I needed. Like oh I'm good at,

1802
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:09.700
I could do this and I could do this while I'm waiting to get stage time.

1803
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:14.440
So this was another avenue for me. I do stand up and then I do sketches.

1804
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:18.310
And this was in the heyday of youtube when there was an appetite for youtube

1805
01:41:18.311 --> 01:41:22.180
sketch, like Indie, youtube sketch, just funny guys.

1806
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.700
And there's just different sketch groups and everything.

1807
01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:27.310
I don't think there's an appetite for that now. Not Anymore. No. Why not?

1808
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:28.623
It's become bite-size.

1809
01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.170
No one wants to watch sketch on like standalone people wanna watch makeup blogs.

1810
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:35.150
They want to watch pranks, you know? I know cause like, you know,

1811
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:38.320
cause I've uploaded, you see the downturn. There was a time,

1812
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:42.430
is it because now it's Instagram, it's everything's more bite sized. So,

1813
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.650
so I'm a sketch.

1814
01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:48.650
I love fully formed sketch and really taking my time like and me and my buddy

1815
01:41:48.671 --> 01:41:52.150
Aristotle, like a, he's really talented filmmaker and director.

1816
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:56.440
I think I had just left Boeing and I had this idea for this American history x

1817
01:41:56.441 --> 01:41:57.640
type sketch has dominoes,

1818
01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:02.670
it's called dominoes and he and I did it and we put it out there and it was

1819
01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:05.950
beautiful. Like it's just one of my favorite sketches we've done.

1820
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.200
And so I just kept on doing sketch and there was an appetite for it and then it

1821
01:42:11.201 --> 01:42:13.750
started to drop off. Like there wasn't a lot of viewership.

1822
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:17.500
Now Youtube sketch will only work if it was on TV the night before.

1823
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.740
Like if it's a key and Peele sketch that made it look like inside Amy or like a

1824
01:42:20.741 --> 01:42:25.540
tonight show sketch or the only way it'll make the rounds is if the sketch was

1825
01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:29.290
on TV and then has the potential to do on the Internet.

1826
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:33.370
Just a a born and bred sketch on the internet doesn't take off anymore.

1827
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:35.020
Instagram does.

1828
01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:39.550
So I just have all these ideas and I always write them down on my phone and

1829
01:42:39.551 --> 01:42:40.241
Instagram. Those,

1830
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:44.380
like little one-on-ones is a way to get those ideas out in a very not precious

1831
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:48.310
way. And it's just idea driven and people respond to it, you know?

1832
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:50.800
So it's just more of like, Oh, let me get this idea out of my head.

1833
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.930
So when you write,

1834
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:57.190
do you sit down and force yourself in front of a notepad or a computer?

1835
01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.210
Back in the day, like when I was first doing stand up, I had two methods.

1836
01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:01.471
I would,

1837
01:43:01.471 --> 01:43:05.440
I would have the jokes that would just come to me and then I would like sit down

1838
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.520
and try to manufacture jokes, you know, like, all right. All right Brian,

1839
01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:14.110
let's funny what's funny about the world. And I would come up with some stuff,

1840
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:18.310
but I always found the things that always worked the best where the stuff that

1841
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:20.620
just like came out of the ether, that just came to me.

1842
01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:25.150
And then eventually I got to the point where enough I would get enough of those

1843
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:28.270
ideas, right. Didn't have to sit down and write.

1844
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:31.780
So all I had to do was just be good about capturing what I'm receiving.

1845
01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:34.480
So I have my phone with me all the time.

1846
01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:36.160
Back in the day I had a marble notebook and all that,

1847
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:39.490
but like phones have advanced so much I've ever known. We do. Yeah.

1848
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:43.060
So whenever I get an idea, regardless of what the proper medium for it is,

1849
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.220
I'll get it. I'll get an Instagram video idea, I'll get a fully,

1850
01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:48.640
fully formed sketch idea where I need like production value,

1851
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.800
a sitcom idea or a standup idea.

1852
01:43:51.801 --> 01:43:54.740
I have different notes for each of them and I've just trained myself.

1853
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:58.850
My brain is wired a certain way where I just catch the butterflies or just put

1854
01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:03.740
the bucket under the faucet. You don't sit down? No, I just, I'll get the idea.

1855
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:07.730
I'll jot down as many words as I need to capture it. Maybe, I don't know.

1856
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:11.050
Say something happens we go to, I don't know. I don't know.

1857
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:13.610
We go to the lake or something and then like I get where we go hunting.

1858
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:16.730
I get three ideas about hunting this many words to capture this,

1859
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.980
not this many words. The catcher like separate in the commas.

1860
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:22.850
So I have it be record your sets. Yeah, I'll record them.

1861
01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.430
Do listen to the recordings. I do. Well, it depends.

1862
01:44:25.431 --> 01:44:27.410
Like if I'm doing it hot night at the store,

1863
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:31.220
that's kind of like the hits and I'm not going to learn a lot from the hits.

1864
01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:35.510
Right. When I want to work on stuff, I'll tell Adam at the store, I'll, I'll,

1865
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:39.380
when I call in my veils, I go with late on Tuesday or Wednesday,

1866
01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:43.460
whichever one I get. I specifically asked to go late so that there's hardly,

1867
01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:46.820
yeah, there's no pressure. There's like 10 people trying to sober up.

1868
01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:51.920
I'm on my phone and it's not like this because they went to packed orr.

1869
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:55.760
It's kind of like a, what do you guys like? I paid this much money,

1870
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:58.100
I got a hot date with me, blah, blah, blah. It's a different show.

1871
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.920
Joey Diaz started getting angry about it.

1872
01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.620
About what you can't proud. Well, you can.

1873
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.210
You just have to choose different time slots or choose different shows to do it

1874
01:45:08.211 --> 01:45:10.880
on. There's new material nights. I love those.

1875
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:13.880
Like Neil Brennan has one at west side. That's one of my favorite shows to do.

1876
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:18.320
JF Harris has one. So you have those new material shows, but I'll just,

1877
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:20.090
if you choose to do a later time slot,

1878
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.740
it might be different for you because you're such a draw,

1879
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:25.250
but [inaudible] nobody, you know, like I'm a cusper right now,

1880
01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:27.320
so I can just do late night.

1881
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:31.700
But I just think you just sandwich those new bits in between obits you can,

1882
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:35.150
but if you just want the total mental freedom of just like throw spaghetti

1883
01:45:35.151 --> 01:45:39.690
against the wall and not end in a professional way. Cause if, uh,

1884
01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.320
if I'm doing like a hot show and I'm trying to do a sandwich,

1885
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:45.020
it can still put the brakes a little bit. Oh yeah. And you know,

1886
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:48.110
I don't need that. I'm not Joe Rogan yet. Yeah. But that's,

1887
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.450
that's where it's at. That's where it's at. I mean,

1888
01:45:50.451 --> 01:45:53.480
I find my way out of it by putting, when it hits the brakes,

1889
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:56.180
you panic and then you find a way out.

1890
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:59.360
And sometimes that's where you find a punchline sometimes.

1891
01:45:59.361 --> 01:46:00.740
Not sure to deal with.

1892
01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:05.480
The five out of ten five at a 10 are gonna eat shit out of 10 it's almost like

1893
01:46:05.481 --> 01:46:09.680
being a baseball manager. I have my, a string, my bs string.

1894
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:12.920
So if I'm doing like a hot show and I wanna work on a beat,

1895
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:15.140
so there's different levels of bits that I can Polish.

1896
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:20.000
I'm not gonna throw a d a d in there. It's the prime time baby now. Right.

1897
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:23.990
D is for 1:00 AM 1:40 AM D's got no pressure.

1898
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:27.640
He's got a lot of potential. Did you Jeremiah show? I love that show. Yeah.

1899
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.660
Doing that tonight, dude. I'll just fast.

1900
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.100
I love shows where the audience knows the expectation is like you're a fly on

1901
01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:35.030
the wall in the process.

1902
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:39.590
So it was less about prerecorded or preplanned material. Yeah.

1903
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.310
There's so much goodwill. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause you don't get that one.

1904
01:46:43.311 --> 01:46:44.180
It's just like a show show.

1905
01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:48.770
I've come up with four or five legitimate bits that have wound up on specials

1906
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.670
because Jeremiah show, yeah,

1907
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:54.900
it's almost like a let's go stand up float tank. Yeah.

1908
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.020
It's a great little quick shot. All right. What's, what's this idea?

1909
01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.880
What's that? And it's also because everybody knows that you're doing that.

1910
01:46:59.881 --> 01:47:03.660
So it's kind of more fun. And also if you hit a dead end, that's funny, right?

1911
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:06.960
Because they know they know the theme of the show.

1912
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:10.230
So let's wish you would do it more often. He's only doing it like once a month,

1913
01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.600
dude. Once a week, man. I Dunno. Maybe they know their,

1914
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:15.420
what their sweet spot is. I don't think they do.

1915
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.640
I think the sweet spots once a week. Yeah.

1916
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:21.610
It's totally possible to do that show once a week. Yeah. Yeah.

1917
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:26.190
I love those shows. When was the first time your parents saw you on stage? Um,

1918
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:28.650
Oh, you know what? This is so funny. This is kind of,

1919
01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:30.660
so this is like the last bit on my special.

1920
01:47:30.661 --> 01:47:34.980
I talk about it like they see me once, once ever. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

1921
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:39.990
Did you bomb? Oh yeah. Oh, in the worst. In the biggest way. Oh my God.

1922
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:44.970
Oh yeah. I mean, do you want to hear the story? Fuck yeah, you do. Okay.

1923
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.690
So this is just a rehash of like the last thing. So the last thing I said,

1924
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:50.220
I closed my special with this.

1925
01:47:50.221 --> 01:47:54.780
So I'm like 17 I'm like 17 or 18 I'm at college,

1926
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:59.810
there's a bulletin board and it says like Apollo amateur night on tour,

1927
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:02.010
right? So there's a flyer,

1928
01:48:02.011 --> 01:48:05.550
like the Apollo is going on tour and you can audition.

1929
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:08.620
And I have the Apollo Theater and at the Apollo theater. Yeah.

1930
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.810
So they're going to all these major cities. Right. So I'm like, interesting.

1931
01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.830
Especially I'm just getting maybe a year in or a few months into stand up.

1932
01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.170
Like this is gonna be a great opportunity. Isn't it funny?

1933
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:23.990
We loved the level of delusion you have as a young comic. Yeah. We like,

1934
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:26.790
I'm ready. Yeah. They gotta hear what I got to say.

1935
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:31.500
I've been doing this for a few months, so I take the, you know,

1936
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:37.650
take the little tab. I have it, I get all the info. I go there, it's in Seattle.

1937
01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:41.520
So I go there to audition. I forget where they're holding the audition.

1938
01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:43.350
It's this like theater or whatever. So I'm sitting,

1939
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.860
there's 342 people just like, wait, it's like American idol pretty much.

1940
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.930
And there's like a bunch of like older black ladies singing.

1941
01:48:51.931 --> 01:48:54.050
I believe I can fly under their breath. I'm like,

1942
01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.030
just cause they're mostly singers, so you just hear like,

1943
01:48:57.570 --> 01:48:59.570
hey man [inaudible]

1944
01:49:01.690 --> 01:49:04.510
and I'm just standing there like, we didn't do my jokes later. Oh my.

1945
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:09.480
Everyone's like, go ray mean. So finally it's my time to go. So I go out there,

1946
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.920
I do my standup set and it does well. Like it does genuinely, well,

1947
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:18.690
it wasn't like a, let's feed them to the sharks like I did well,

1948
01:49:18.691 --> 01:49:21.690
like I made them laugh, you know? So I find out, I get selected,

1949
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:26.280
I think I'm one of 11 one of 11 who gets selected, some like sweet.

1950
01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:32.100
And then I invite everyone. I'm like, mom, dad, everyone from school and shit.

1951
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:36.660
Oh yeah. Yeah. Everyone. It's that. It's at the paramount theater in Seattle.

1952
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:39.360
Have you been there? Yeah. What does that 4,000 it's a big place.

1953
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:42.180
Four thousand five thousand people, something like that. Maybe 3000 whatever.

1954
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.690
It's in the thousands people, big place. It's one of our nicest theaters.

1955
01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:49.630
Beautiful. Yeah. So I laid everywhere

1956
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.580
and then, oh, it's packed. Oh, oh my God.

1957
01:49:56.581 --> 01:50:00.340
So, so I do the dress rehearsal, I did the dress rehearsal, blah, blah.

1958
01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:04.670
Go through the motions. Lady comes up to me, she's like a producer.

1959
01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:05.470
That's great.

1960
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:09.490
The producer of the show thinks like you should do this bit before instead of

1961
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:11.620
your hip hop stuff, like do this bit first.

1962
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:15.790
And it was like a this bit why he's about being Afghan or something, you know?

1963
01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:20.260
So I'm like, okay, whatever. Like I'm so new, I just trust the producer.

1964
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.094
I'm like, I guess they know.

1965
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.930
So I rearranged my set just based on the producers request, come to the show,

1966
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:28.510
everyone's there, blah, blah, blah. It's my time to like,

1967
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:30.400
they introduced me a little blah, blah, blah, you know,

1968
01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.990
please welcome the humanware. I'd come out and I'm like, hey guys. I'm like,

1969
01:50:34.991 --> 01:50:36.790
man, my name is [inaudible].

1970
01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.940
It's like an Afghan name or like Middle Eastern and Afghan to be exactly what.

1971
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:44.940
He's like, Woo, Woo. I'm out that for maybe 20 seconds. They just started boom,

1972
01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:49.240
boom, boom. It's such an interesting sensation to be booed by them many people.

1973
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.790
So just like it starts cascading like boom, boom, boom. And I've seen Apollo,

1974
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.150
I know how it works. And you hear that like the

1975
01:50:57.570 --> 01:50:58.170
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1976
01:50:58.170 --> 01:50:59.910
<v 0>Oh, I'm like, all right, I don't, I don't need to get swept off.</v>

1977
01:50:59.911 --> 01:51:03.990
Like I know how this works. So I get booed off. Not The boot off,

1978
01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:06.270
just from talking about being a half can. Maybe, I don't know,

1979
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:08.160
maybe it just really sucked. Maybe it was,

1980
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:11.700
cause it was like close to nine 11 and they talked about being Afghan. Whatever.

1981
01:51:11.701 --> 01:51:14.370
I get, I get boot, you know, I mean, I'm sure it sucked balls too.

1982
01:51:14.371 --> 01:51:16.350
Whatever I was about to say I was gonna like be so bad.

1983
01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:20.370
So I was gonna get booed regardless, but I lasted maybe 15 seconds,

1984
01:51:20.371 --> 01:51:24.630
1520 seconds. So I'm just like shell shocked and then I'm just chilling.

1985
01:51:24.631 --> 01:51:27.060
In the hallway there was, there was a desk, there was like a s, you know,

1986
01:51:27.061 --> 01:51:29.790
like an old school student desk where it's like L-shape and they have the

1987
01:51:29.791 --> 01:51:33.720
basket. It's just in the stairwell for some reason. So I just sit,

1988
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:35.670
I just sit in that chair.

1989
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:39.420
I felt like I was in a video game or something cause that's not a human

1990
01:51:39.421 --> 01:51:42.240
experience really, that many people get to go through.

1991
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:47.340
So I'm just trying to make sense of what happened and the world and my wife

1992
01:51:47.370 --> 01:51:51.570
moving forward. It's a lot going on. It's a lot going on. You know.

1993
01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.520
And then you know, I get up again at myself, I go up the stairwell,

1994
01:51:56.521 --> 01:51:58.800
I get my things from, you know,

1995
01:51:58.801 --> 01:52:01.500
I have to see everyone else and the great the worst.

1996
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:05.340
See everyone in the green room area get my shit.

1997
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:09.150
I get my car and I think I like drive home. My parents, I take a separate car,

1998
01:52:09.151 --> 01:52:12.030
right? And then I hear the rest of the story from my brother.

1999
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:16.830
So they're all in the Dodge Caravan. My cousin Nilo, my brother, my dad,

2000
01:52:16.831 --> 01:52:20.700
my mom is just silent on the car ride home.

2001
01:52:20.701 --> 01:52:23.280
Like no one's talking cause I mean, you know,

2002
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:27.660
they saw what they saw so no one's saying anything. And then obviously my dad,

2003
01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.880
my dad's like with number thrilled about me doing standup to begin with. Right.

2004
01:52:29.881 --> 01:52:33.900
So he, he breaks the silence. He goes, well,

2005
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:38.430
there is no business like show business

2006
01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.413
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

2007
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:46.190
<v 0>oh right. Like I think that's why when I want them to out, I want it to be like</v>

2008
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:50.960
<v 1>such a polar opposite experience. And obviously I've come a long way from then,</v>

2009
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.310
but I'm almost grateful that it did happen because you know when comics trade

2010
01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:59.270
bomb stories, I fucking win every time. And to me,

2011
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.970
for me to be so young like 17 and come back from that,

2012
01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:06.050
that means like there's really something like a fire in me or like I was meant

2013
01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:09.530
to do this or I really love stand up cause that's not a pleasurable experience

2014
01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:12.080
to potentially think that could happen again. You know?

2015
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:16.190
Now they've seen you on television. Did they watch us? They seen me. Yeah.

2016
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:18.080
I think you're special was good. Yeah, I think so.

2017
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:21.710
I never know like my mom will tell me, but I never know what my dad catches.

2018
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:24.550
And what was the last time you worked in Seattle? Um,

2019
01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:29.720
I'm trying to do the parlor [inaudible] go under like few months ago,

2020
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:34.610
I think. Fucking a, yeah. So the pool hall part's gone to think so. Fuck yeah.

2021
01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:39.010
You like to play there? Yeah. It was a great gig. Play Pool and Oh yeah,

2022
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:43.280
that's your jam. Oh my God. It's like you designed the club.

2023
01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.960
That's how I design a club. [inaudible] yeah. Yeah. So it's weird. I mean,

2024
01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:51.470
I could have them come out to another show they have there now. What's the club?

2025
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:54.380
I don't know. I think it's mostly Thi Ah, no, they have um,

2026
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:58.370
giggles or whatever in the university district or maybe it's called laughs.

2027
01:53:58.371 --> 01:54:00.290
It's called laughs. It's where giggles used to be.

2028
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:03.920
So they'll have like one comedy club and all of this. The comma,

2029
01:54:03.921 --> 01:54:08.390
they have Tacoma, you know, that's crazy. People can, but these aren't Seattle.

2030
01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.700
Fuck man. Seattle used to be a scene. Got fucking parlor.

2031
01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:17.700
Live was a great club. How did it go under? Yeah, probably Brian Callan.

2032
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:23.180
No, just grow it. What does that be kicked through?

2033
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.890
It's the man who broke the parlor. Fucking ruined it, bro. Yeah. Yeah.

2034
01:54:27.891 --> 01:54:29.420
So when your parents come to see you,

2035
01:54:29.421 --> 01:54:32.660
will they come to see you in la or they come to see you? I haven't,

2036
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:35.120
you haven't decided I've put it on the back burner for, I mean,

2037
01:54:35.121 --> 01:54:36.380
I guess if I do the tonight show,

2038
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:39.360
I mean I've been to late nights already 20 years later, you know,

2039
01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.400
they gotta come see you live. I, yeah. Yeah. What should I do? I don't know.

2040
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.570
Invite them to a show. Yeah. I don't know what show.

2041
01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:50.030
Pretend they're at the first show and then bring them to the second show. Yeah.

2042
01:54:50.031 --> 01:54:53.290
Just to mentally prepare. Yeah. You're obviously,

2043
01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:57.200
you have a little bit of a block, you're thinking about it. Yeah. Not a block,

2044
01:54:57.201 --> 01:55:01.460
but it's a, it's a thing. Oh, for sure. Yeah. If they saw you eat shit. Yeah.

2045
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:04.400
And especially when they were so anti that and then,

2046
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:08.420
but you were right and they were wrong. This is how it works. I mean,

2047
01:55:08.421 --> 01:55:12.710
my parents never yelled at me that I can do comedy or I was wasting my life or

2048
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:15.940
that I'd be there with pimps and prostitutes. I mean, I love my parents.

2049
01:55:15.941 --> 01:55:18.320
We have a great relationship. This was just kind of like one,

2050
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:21.240
one thing that was incongruent in the relationship.

2051
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:25.010
No parents think their child is going to make it as a community.

2052
01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.660
It is the most.

2053
01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:31.910
Is the most impossible to imagine success business that you could ever think

2054
01:55:31.911 --> 01:55:34.010
your kid's going to go into? No, there's no,

2055
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:38.030
like we were talking about w stand up that none of this is written down.

2056
01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.730
I'm talking about the principles stand up. There's no course you can take.

2057
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:44.220
It doesn't exist. Any classes usually taken someone who's not

2058
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.800
<v 2>very successful at stand up for the most part. Yeah.</v>

2059
01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:50.160
I don't know of any successful it can get. Chris Rock's not out there

2060
01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.010
<v 0>teaching common class. I can give you the confidence to like jump off the cliff.</v>

2061
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:56.380
Yes. But outside of that you're not going to learn.

2062
01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.930
<v 2>But, but here's the thing. All these principles that were taught,</v>

2063
01:55:59.931 --> 01:56:01.010
I mean think about, look,

2064
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:06.070
comedy is obviously a viable art form in a large scale venue.

2065
01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:10.580
I mean I just got done doing two arenas this weekend, right?

2066
01:56:10.610 --> 01:56:15.610
So we're talking about something that is right up there with music or even with

2067
01:56:16.071 --> 01:56:19.010
sports. I mean it's large scale, enormous people.

2068
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:24.430
Yet there's no real like pathway that's written down.

2069
01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:30.940
There's no real principles of it that are universally assumed by all people who

2070
01:56:32.571 --> 01:56:36.230
participate in the art form. Whereas almost like if you learn music,

2071
01:56:36.231 --> 01:56:38.270
you learn chords and chord progression. You learn,

2072
01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.190
you learn how to use your diaphragm,

2073
01:56:40.191 --> 01:56:43.130
you learn how to sing and learn how to play instruments,

2074
01:56:43.131 --> 01:56:46.910
and you learn how to make a chorus and there's none of that for us.

2075
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:48.400
<v 0>I think it was just such a foreign,</v>

2076
01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.920
I can understand where they're coming from cause it's such a foreign concept.

2077
01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.020
If you get an engineering degree or you're a doctor, you do a B, you get C,

2078
01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:58.090
there is a blueprint for it. Yeah. Stand up is just so nebulous.

2079
01:56:58.091 --> 01:57:00.040
Or just like the arts in general is just sort of like,

2080
01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.430
you can't tell someone what your path to success is going to be different than

2081
01:57:03.431 --> 01:57:05.070
Ian's path to mine. Sure.

2082
01:57:05.410 --> 01:57:08.950
And you kind of learned that as a comic as well early on because I think there's

2083
01:57:08.951 --> 01:57:12.130
a little bit of imposter syndrome like, oh, like somebody else gets something.

2084
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:14.890
You feel like it's an attack on you, but you do it long enough,

2085
01:57:14.891 --> 01:57:17.710
you realize like, oh, everyone's journey is so different.

2086
01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.080
We're not in a hippy dippy way. Yeah.

2087
01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:22.720
But like your relationships are different than mine that are different,

2088
01:57:22.721 --> 01:57:25.810
so everyone hits at different times and it's not right or wrong.

2089
01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:29.000
It's just life and nature, you know? Yeah. You're,

2090
01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:30.250
you're different than everybody else.

2091
01:57:30.251 --> 01:57:34.570
You just got to concentrate on doing your best and figure out what you can learn

2092
01:57:34.571 --> 01:57:36.100
from other people's success and failures.

2093
01:57:36.101 --> 01:57:38.780
But don't think of it as your own success or failure. Yeah.

2094
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:40.460
And eyes on your own paper. Yeah.

2095
01:57:40.461 --> 01:57:44.860
I wouldn't want my kids to do comedy if my kids would be hilariously

2096
01:57:44.861 --> 01:57:47.860
hypocritical if one of my kids was like, I want to be a comedian. I'm like,

2097
01:57:47.861 --> 01:57:51.270
listen, you're not gonna be a fucking comedian. Stop. Yeah.

2098
01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.500
I think where I differ with me and my parents is if they want to do something in

2099
01:57:53.501 --> 01:57:57.160
the arts, I'd be like, have at it. Like I support you. I want it to work out.

2100
01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:00.190
Yeah. But kind of have a foundation work on that.

2101
01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.020
I don't want to send you to do communications for four years. Yeah.

2102
01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:07.420
Like there's no school for it. Yeah. Stand up school. Here's the school.

2103
01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:12.600
Have a shitty childhood. That's the best school. I hadn't had a shot. Yeah,

2104
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:15.130
I was well adjusted. I like that. Maybe that's why it hurt so much.

2105
01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:19.170
Maybe like I gave him everything. He still did it. Yeah. That's funny.

2106
01:58:19.210 --> 01:58:22.600
You might be one of the rare guys that didn't ever see new [inaudible] where

2107
01:58:22.601 --> 01:58:27.320
there's people obviously is what? Just well adjusted. Yeah.

2108
01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.710
I Dunno those Pete Holmes. I go even level headed. What about the Nichole? Him?

2109
01:58:32.711 --> 01:58:34.840
Well, I don't know. We've got the fuck out of here.

2110
01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:38.500
Everyone is fucked up to some degree. Yes. Yeah.

2111
01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:42.250
So that's why they're comics. Sure. Yeah.

2112
01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:47.350
<v 1>But no matter who, anybody who pluck off of earth stuffed up. Yeah. Yes.</v>

2113
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:51.940
So this is a universal truth, but usually some kind of fucked up.

2114
01:58:51.941 --> 01:58:56.020
Childhood is a prerequisite. It helps. It's like the whole fuel.

2115
01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:00.280
It's fuel. It's like there's fighters that come from good childhoods to,

2116
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.770
you know, I would have this, it's a dumb thought,

2117
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:07.000
but I would have it as a kid trying to do stand up and not have to face this

2118
01:59:07.001 --> 01:59:11.590
wall of, I don't know, you know, my parents not wanting me to do it.

2119
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:13.390
I'm like Oh man, I kind of wish I had like a,

2120
01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:18.190
like a worst childhood or like not middle-class. Cause then it wouldn't,

2121
01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.830
it wouldn't be questioned. It would just be like, yeah, of course.

2122
01:59:20.831 --> 01:59:21.664
What else going gonna do?

2123
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:25.970
Well I was really healthy when I was young because I was a martial artist on

2124
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:28.750
competing all the time and always worked out. And I always thought, man,

2125
01:59:28.751 --> 01:59:30.520
if I was a drug addict I'd probably be funnier.

2126
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:34.090
I really used to think that way cause like the guys who did drugs at Kennison

2127
01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:38.020
and prior they had drug problems. Yeah. So fun. Like, Oh,

2128
01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:40.060
I mean you've been doing it for a long time so maybe you have a better

2129
01:59:40.061 --> 01:59:40.960
perspective on this.

2130
01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:45.730
I think like back in the day with the doing drugs and all of that part of that,

2131
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.530
did that help? Like was it imaged?

2132
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:50.140
Like how in terms of just seeing the comedy for what it is,

2133
01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:53.770
was it part it being new rock star stuff, drugs.

2134
01:59:53.771 --> 01:59:57.040
So you didn't have to be as tight as say like nowadays cause there's so many

2135
01:59:57.041 --> 02:00:00.830
more comedians or no,

2136
02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:05.230
it still is tiny wildness to it. There's wildness to it.

2137
02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:07.840
Like I think the funniest guy of all times. Joey d is a,

2138
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:12.250
and w one of the reasons why he's the funniest guy of all time is the wildness.

2139
02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:17.320
Like he's truly wild. Like, and he knows the guys I'm watching him like in the,

2140
02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.540
or especially in 2019

2141
02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:26.710
the climate or in a, he don't, you can't tell. He doesn't know.

2142
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:29.920
So he came out of a time machine. He's like Encino man.

2143
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:34.090
I just thought him out and they just threw among the OLR people.

2144
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.910
They're horrified and so happy. At the same time.

2145
02:00:37.210 --> 02:00:41.140
I think even the locus people when they're watching Joey and there's just this

2146
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.900
energy and people are laughing so hard,

2147
02:00:44.710 --> 02:00:46.690
like you're all truism can't break through that.

2148
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:49.660
You can't deny what's happening right now. So it kind of makes you,

2149
02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:53.320
I guess reassess what you're supposed. Like I shouldn't be laughing at this.

2150
02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.340
It's, it's a weird time for comedy,

2151
02:00:58.030 --> 02:01:02.530
but in that weird time you're going to get some of the best stuff because it's

2152
02:01:02.531 --> 02:01:07.531
like supercharged and it's like as it was it when it does get through,

2153
02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:12.780
if you can cover all the bases and make your arguments soundly and logically and

2154
02:01:13.871 --> 02:01:16.610
also have it be funny, I'll see Birdie that all the time too.

2155
02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:20.410
And like Joey's is such a force of nature. Yeah. It's,

2156
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:24.780
you don't have time to like think about it as well or is this knee-jerk years

2157
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:26.380
rolling burr?

2158
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:31.210
We'll kind of just like throw out this crazy premise that no one,

2159
02:01:31.211 --> 02:01:34.960
no sane person would be on board. Like especially guys on dates.

2160
02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.250
Well you just hear, you know some, some of these arguments or whatever. Yeah.

2161
02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:41.240
He'll just throw it out there and he won't steamroll over it.

2162
02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:44.480
He'll just let it simmer. And that's my favorite. Yeah.

2163
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:46.430
Cause like he's methodically,

2164
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:50.090
surgically taking his time to proving the point of this argument.

2165
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:54.320
Well a lot of these arguments I would suspect that he's having at home with his

2166
02:01:54.321 --> 02:01:57.860
wife, his wife, Sharon, powerful woman, and she's a feminist.

2167
02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.060
I mean what a cool woman too. You know what I mean? Just like, yeah.

2168
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:06.140
So he has to formulate really well thought out arguments,

2169
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:09.380
I would imagine. I mean maybe he would, but he, you know,

2170
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:14.140
he's obviously thinking these through and like this is not, it's not,

2171
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:18.850
he's not flippant about these points of view and his perspectives. Yeah.

2172
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:22.030
So I just like how you just throw it like a piece of Bologna on the kitchen are

2173
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:24.620
called windows nails. When he, when he nails it, man,

2174
02:02:24.621 --> 02:02:29.150
it's like so much more satisfying even then in the past because it's like

2175
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:30.663
you're, you're,

2176
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.730
you're making your way through the rockiest stretch of the river.

2177
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:37.400
And I think those are the most rewarding bits as comedians.

2178
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:38.860
The longer you've been doing it. Like,

2179
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:42.990
I can be silly and get a joke and sure that's fun. But it's,

2180
02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:48.020
it's not that rewarding as if you have an argument like burger or something

2181
02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:52.100
where it's just countered counter-culture and you can methodically,

2182
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:56.780
it's like going through the the laser field that's way more rewarding than just

2183
02:02:56.781 --> 02:03:00.110
walking down the hallway like mission impossible and all those lasers are

2184
02:03:00.111 --> 02:03:04.850
protecting the diamond limbo through these, what kind of movie is that?

2185
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:08.030
He just walks up. Has An apple and goals. Right, exactly. And then the credits,

2186
02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:13.100
yeah it's a, it's an interesting time to get these ideas out there.

2187
02:03:13.101 --> 02:03:16.340
But you see by the reaction at the comedy store,

2188
02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:20.060
the people are looking forward to it because I think they feel the same way.

2189
02:03:20.061 --> 02:03:20.790
Like God damn,

2190
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:24.710
everything's going so far and so many people are so god damn sensitive about so

2191
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:26.570
many different things. It's not about intent.

2192
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:31.640
They're just looking at magic words and buzz words and topics that are off

2193
02:03:31.641 --> 02:03:35.080
limits. There's no such thing as context anymore or intention. Yeah.

2194
02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:38.420
And you get that at the comedy store and I think it's the last place people are

2195
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:42.830
talking this freely. Cause I used to think all right,

2196
02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:45.200
we've been in a little bit of a resurgence with stand up and like all the

2197
02:03:45.201 --> 02:03:47.960
specials and all that. I'm like, when's it going to burst? I'm like, Oh cool,

2198
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:50.810
I'm going to get to miss two comedy bubbles. Sweet.

2199
02:03:51.590 --> 02:03:56.150
But then yeah, but then it's proven wrong. Like it's getting bigger and bigger.

2200
02:03:56.210 --> 02:03:59.810
Yeah, it's good. Yeah. That's why it was a bubble when it sucked.

2201
02:03:59.811 --> 02:04:03.260
Let me tell you about the bubble of the 1980s there was a bunch of people that

2202
02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:05.660
had our kind of way of talking about things.

2203
02:04:05.661 --> 02:04:10.550
So I got a cat in my room and the mouse was like wild kingdom and my house

2204
02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.330
was a way of conquering.

2205
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:17.270
It was a comedy way of talking that these guys did.

2206
02:04:17.271 --> 02:04:22.271
There was some guys that just were not insightful and they just did comedy in a

2207
02:04:24.711 --> 02:04:27.410
way that they had heard people do comedy.

2208
02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:30.050
So they kind of just like mimic the sounds.

2209
02:04:30.051 --> 02:04:35.000
It's like you ever heard a band that sounds exactly like maybe stone temple

2210
02:04:35.001 --> 02:04:38.040
pilots or something like that, but they're not really like their clothes.

2211
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.160
<v 2>But like what's so weird is do you remember how much like soapstone brand,</v>

2212
02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.860
I don't know if you remember it. Gorilla black? No.

2213
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:47.510
What's that sounded exactly like notorious vig. No. Well yeah.

2214
02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:51.720
Fuck is that the real of black? Yeah. Really. Like when I heard it I'm like,

2215
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:56.790
are we doing this? This is so crazy. It was insane.

2216
02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:59.700
Yeah. I watched a comic one night, um,

2217
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:04.790
at in 1993 or something like that on stage in Montreal at just for laughs and he

2218
02:05:08.611 --> 02:05:12.270
was basically doing a Richard Pryor impression and I was like,

2219
02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:17.100
what in the fuck am I seeing? It's like this guy was doing prior,

2220
02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:21.210
I mean everything about his set he was doing prior. I'm like,

2221
02:05:21.211 --> 02:05:24.930
this is so strange to see that people do that well,

2222
02:05:24.931 --> 02:05:28.080
that that was a part of the bubble in the bubble.

2223
02:05:28.081 --> 02:05:32.280
There was these guys who would wear the clothes they thought a comedian would

2224
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:35.820
wear and say the things and there was so much work and there was so many,

2225
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:40.320
there was so many clubs and there was so many a evening at the Improv's and all

2226
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:42.540
these different little show, anyone to get a piece,

2227
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.760
people got t mimic the part two.

2228
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:47.430
There was a lot of people back then that were arrogant,

2229
02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:51.270
that were working and they were headliners and they were arrogant and they were

2230
02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:52.104
fucking terrible.

2231
02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:55.460
And I really enjoyed watching them fall off the face of the earth. You know,

2232
02:05:55.690 --> 02:05:56.940
I'll tell you some names afterwards,

2233
02:05:56.941 --> 02:05:59.660
but the other names I was going to tell you, yeah, but these,

2234
02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:02.870
these people were doing comedy in a UN.

2235
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.210
They weren't participating in an art form. They were mimicking.

2236
02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.330
They were mimicking the people that were participating in the online forum,

2237
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:13.230
like love him or hate him. Cherry Seinfeld's and artist. Oh, I love Seinfeld.

2238
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:17.140
Yeah, I do too. But he's an artist. His style, whether you,

2239
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:19.680
I've heard criticisms that he's not deep enough.

2240
02:06:19.681 --> 02:06:24.240
He doesn't talk about sex or anything dangerous, whatever he likes.

2241
02:06:24.241 --> 02:06:26.160
What he likes. He likes to talk about stuff.

2242
02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:29.850
He likes a certain style of comedy and he's as a master at that style,

2243
02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:33.690
but he's spawned so many babies with Teresa.

2244
02:06:33.850 --> 02:06:38.010
Nia would call babies like Patrice on neo like would say a a like a, hey man,

2245
02:06:38.011 --> 02:06:39.300
you got a lot of babies out there.

2246
02:06:39.301 --> 02:06:42.630
There's a lot of people that are imitating you, you've got babies.

2247
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:47.880
Then there was a lot of like David tell the perfect this shitload of babies.

2248
02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:50.030
There's a lot of, [inaudible] had a lot of babies. Yeah.

2249
02:06:50.190 --> 02:06:51.630
Dane had a Mitch Hedberg.

2250
02:06:51.631 --> 02:06:54.960
I remember Mitch had a lot of [inaudible] see a ton of babies. Yeah,

2251
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:56.430
there's a few people that mimic,

2252
02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.030
but during the eighties it was,

2253
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:04.020
there was a few innovative people and a lot of babies.

2254
02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:08.250
It was like there was 10 babies to everyone innovator and you had these like

2255
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:11.250
fake headliners and they would show up in town,

2256
02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:14.160
but they had those premises that everybody had.

2257
02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.880
They had those beats that everybody had. They talked in the same way.

2258
02:07:18.090 --> 02:07:19.410
They didn't take any chances.

2259
02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:23.970
They were shooting straight down in the middle and that was the bubble and that

2260
02:07:23.971 --> 02:07:26.490
all went away. That all went away. And when that went away,

2261
02:07:26.491 --> 02:07:30.150
those guys died off and there was people that were left over,

2262
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:35.390
the people that were left over where the actual comics that actual people were

2263
02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:38.590
good enough where people would repeatedly go to see them at clubs.

2264
02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:41.530
They wrote a lot. They, they practice. They were,

2265
02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:43.840
they were interested in the actual art form itself.

2266
02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:49.290
And I was really fortunate that I started out in Boston or Boston had a very

2267
02:07:49.930 --> 02:07:54.610
high standard due to Barry Crimmins really in protect document. It was great.

2268
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:58.780
He's a brilliant, he was brilliant guy arrested piece Barry. Um,

2269
02:07:58.940 --> 02:08:02.680
I loved that guy, but he, that guy, he was one of those guys when,

2270
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:07.170
when he was nice to me as I got older and you know,

2271
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:09.340
I was terrified of him. Terrified of him,

2272
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:14.080
like him seeing me when I saw it really meant so much. Well,

2273
02:08:14.081 --> 02:08:19.081
I knew what a high standard he had for comedy and he was one of the main reasons

2274
02:08:20.591 --> 02:08:24.610
why there was no hacks that were tolerated in Boston and that, that you want,

2275
02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:26.380
everybody had to be original,

2276
02:08:26.381 --> 02:08:30.010
everybody had to do good material and everybody sort of policed each other,

2277
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:32.350
you know? And when, um,

2278
02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:35.810
when you have a community like that, you,

2279
02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.250
you get to see the art form flourish in a, in a very good way. And we,

2280
02:08:40.251 --> 02:08:42.760
we had a lot of like different people,

2281
02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.790
they were different but they were all like really high level.

2282
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:48.850
So we would get these guys that would come in from out of town road,

2283
02:08:48.851 --> 02:08:50.020
guys that were babies,

2284
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:55.200
there were Seinfeld babies are different and you would see how poor they looked

2285
02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:58.600
when they were surrounded by these original murderers.

2286
02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:02.830
So you'd have like guys like Steve Sweeney and Lenny Clarke would go on stage

2287
02:09:02.831 --> 02:09:06.610
and then one of these babies would go up after him and just eat blights of shit.

2288
02:09:06.611 --> 02:09:07.450
Why are they going after?

2289
02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.070
They had a terrible system in Boston that was really mean and it was designed to

2290
02:09:12.071 --> 02:09:16.870
make new, designed to make national headliners bomb. I really,

2291
02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:17.704
yes, yes.

2292
02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:20.710
They would pay them a lot of money to book them at a club and they would book

2293
02:09:20.711 --> 02:09:25.711
them on a show with three local headliners and these local headliners would just

2294
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:30.370
fucking straight up murder and they would do all this local Boston stuff that

2295
02:09:30.371 --> 02:09:31.300
made everybody excited.

2296
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:34.990
And then they would have one of these guys who was used to going to Cleveland.

2297
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:39.730
Hey, I was just in Indianapolis, had a great time, uh, did a little comedy.

2298
02:09:40.330 --> 02:09:41.830
That's what I do. I'm a comedian.

2299
02:09:42.130 --> 02:09:46.600
And they would go up there and just eat plates of Shit and get booed off the

2300
02:09:46.601 --> 02:09:49.480
stage. And people would leave. And they were,

2301
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:52.180
they would do it on purpose just to teach them a lesson or something? No,

2302
02:09:52.181 --> 02:09:55.710
they were just mean like those guys never. First of all those comments,

2303
02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:58.480
those comics never left Boston. Okay.

2304
02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:02.020
And they would murder almost every night and they were all animals.

2305
02:10:02.021 --> 02:10:04.810
They're doing coke and they were drinking. They were fucking savages.

2306
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:07.830
They'd pay them and coke like no bullshit. Yeah. Nick's comedy.

2307
02:10:08.090 --> 02:10:11.560
Stop used to pay people in coke. Yes. It didn't pay me in coke.

2308
02:10:11.561 --> 02:10:15.790
I never did go right. But I knew of the whole deal. Everybody knew the deal.

2309
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:18.400
And so when these guys would come in from out of town,

2310
02:10:18.401 --> 02:10:21.760
they would be angry at these guys. And they're like, who is this fucking guy?

2311
02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:23.640
He's got evening at the Improv. I don't have that show.

2312
02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:27.010
He was on a fucking movie with Billy Crystal Fuck Camp.

2313
02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:30.220
And they would go on in front of those guys and light them on fire.

2314
02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.060
Light them on fire. Who's dictating this at the club club

2315
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:37.940
<v 1>comics club? They're all, oh, so one's on coke. So this is fun for them.</v>

2316
02:10:38.370 --> 02:10:40.370
That was just fun. And they would,

2317
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:42.590
they would do it on purpose and then a cool you would,

2318
02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:47.050
but some guys would survive. Like I saw Don, my rare in that environment,

2319
02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:49.910
but dom murdered, there was a thing dom murdered.

2320
02:10:50.090 --> 02:10:53.000
So he would go there and he would talk about how strong the lineup was.

2321
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:55.250
You know, as I just amazing. This is great.

2322
02:10:55.251 --> 02:10:57.890
But he would go up a murder because he was a real comic.

2323
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:02.990
So dom was there pre bubble during the bubble post bubble.

2324
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:05.180
He's a comic. I mean those are the best guys.

2325
02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.260
Funny guys who take funny guys on the road with them. Yes.

2326
02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:12.620
Because not everyone does that. But yeah, you know like a panic. They want,

2327
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:13.730
they want like the best comics.

2328
02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.180
They're like I want someone funny to Yes I want a great show.

2329
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:22.130
You know the reason why I take Ian or Santina or I always took Joey Diaz before

2330
02:11:22.131 --> 02:11:25.220
he got too big. You know Joey Dee is selling out the Chicago theater.

2331
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:30.140
He's fucking murdering it. But all those guys, Ori and Dunkin I there,

2332
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.110
I want to have fun. I want to be with comics, I want,

2333
02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:36.170
I want this show to be great. I don't want to be the only one. That's funny.

2334
02:11:36.171 --> 02:11:40.400
That's gross. Right. And I think it's a way to discover new comics as well.

2335
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:43.310
Cause like I was, I was opening for Neil for a bit for his tour,

2336
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:47.420
for most of the dates and news is so fun for me because like all headline and

2337
02:11:47.421 --> 02:11:47.691
stuff,

2338
02:11:47.691 --> 02:11:51.590
but I'm not a draw yet so I need to have a walkup for whatever the club I'm

2339
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:54.020
doing. Like they need to have the comedy on state's great, you know,

2340
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:55.870
and Madison, Wisconsin, it's just, they have walk up,

2341
02:11:55.871 --> 02:11:58.280
they just have a trust with the community. They all just come to shows

2342
02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:03.650
or like comedy works in Denver. I've just done comedy on stage and I heard it.

2343
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:06.260
That's great. That's really good. There's a theater right next door.

2344
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:09.080
You probably be doing that. Like it's be talented in theater.

2345
02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:11.600
The last time I was there there's actually a poster for that theater in the

2346
02:12:11.601 --> 02:12:16.400
bathroom out here. So it's fun to do that when they have, um, a walkup audience.

2347
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:18.830
Like the comedy works, like you said, comedy was in Denver.

2348
02:12:18.831 --> 02:12:23.360
They had some brand club. Like I'm not a draw yet, like in purgatory.

2349
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.750
But the Neal thing was cool because they're all coming for Neal, their theaters.

2350
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.710
I'm just doing 20 minutes, which is like a, like a shit that out. It's nothing,

2351
02:12:30.711 --> 02:12:33.650
you know, cause I'm like headlining. So there's no pressure.

2352
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.320
They're there for Neil. I have a great set. And they're like, Yo,

2353
02:12:36.321 --> 02:12:39.410
you were funny. So you get like fans from his fans tables. It's the best.

2354
02:12:39.411 --> 02:12:43.940
And it's a great show as a, as a whole. Like we compliment each other. So yeah,

2355
02:12:43.941 --> 02:12:47.390
you get to interview and he gets to introduce you to a funny comment. Yeah.

2356
02:12:47.391 --> 02:12:50.150
And I'm so grateful that he gets to do that. Like pull a guy up and,

2357
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:54.320
and sort of take a little credit for like, I dunno. Yeah, no, it's great.

2358
02:12:54.570 --> 02:12:58.370
That's where it's at, you know? But I don't think this bubble is popping.

2359
02:12:58.430 --> 02:13:02.120
It's too fun. It's too good. I mean, there's too many good people.

2360
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:03.950
As long as the art form is good,

2361
02:13:03.951 --> 02:13:08.300
the bubble only exists in pops when it's a fake thing.

2362
02:13:08.301 --> 02:13:11.630
Like it's a Ponzi scheme. That's not really the case right now. Yeah.

2363
02:13:11.631 --> 02:13:14.690
There's so many good comedians. Right. And everybody's working hard. You know,

2364
02:13:14.691 --> 02:13:17.960
everybody realizes that there's a lot of pressure on you. So they're all like,

2365
02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:20.390
that's what you were saying, like how many sets I do.

2366
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:23.270
That's why I do so many studies. Yeah. This is the only way to do it.

2367
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.210
I do two sets a night, three sets a night all the time.

2368
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:28.130
And there's so many outlets now too,

2369
02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:31.710
which is kind of what's helping it not pop is yes, you have Netflix,

2370
02:13:31.711 --> 02:13:36.210
you have these new streaming like a HBO Mannix on Amazon, Apple,

2371
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:40.110
Apple Password on here in a couple of days and he's got his Amazon special.

2372
02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:42.640
Yeah. And so does, um, uh,

2373
02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:47.300
Alonzo Boden is Amazon specials coming out soon. And then, um,

2374
02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:49.380
there's a bunch of other people that have Amazon specialists.

2375
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:52.320
I'm seeing people advertise them on their Instagram.

2376
02:13:52.321 --> 02:13:55.590
So Amazon is putting together a bunch of specials now,

2377
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:59.770
which to me is very, very exciting because they have the marvelous Mrs Maizel.

2378
02:13:59.870 --> 02:14:01.980
Oh yeah. One of my favorite shows.

2379
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:06.990
So I'm just psyched that there's a lot of new venues and then there's new

2380
02:14:06.991 --> 02:14:10.110
streaming things. Like who knows, maybe Hulu will get into stand up, you know,

2381
02:14:10.190 --> 02:14:12.600
what, maybe some of these other streaming services we'll get into. Stand up.

2382
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:16.110
It's great for everybody, man. It really is. There's plenty.

2383
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:18.150
Or there's guys like Andrew Schultz,

2384
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:23.420
he just went straight to as a performer and as a comedian and I think everyone

2385
02:14:23.761 --> 02:14:25.200
has varying degrees of,

2386
02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:29.160
I think anx that he had coming up and I kind of felt that way as well.

2387
02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:32.550
Like people have varying degrees of how much the industry fucks with you.

2388
02:14:33.150 --> 02:14:35.460
Sometimes I feel and sometimes I don't, I don't feel in,

2389
02:14:35.461 --> 02:14:36.540
I do for certain things and,

2390
02:14:37.110 --> 02:14:40.920
and that was just really refreshing just to take the power back and even seeing

2391
02:14:40.921 --> 02:14:44.400
it happen with, I have so many peers in the game, like I've known Theo forever,

2392
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.150
we've been puttering around town and doing shows and just, you know,

2393
02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.500
obscurity and then doing the podcast and,

2394
02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:56.860
and just seeing him take his own fan base and power back and everyone wanted to

2395
02:14:57.631 --> 02:15:02.490
fuck with him now and like they weren't, they weren't launching that guy.

2396
02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.270
You kind of learn to that. It's just monkeys picking stocks. Well,

2397
02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:07.560
a little fairness.

2398
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:12.830
Theo turned a corner like two years ago where I remember watching him before and

2399
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.370
it might, sky's kind of funny.

2400
02:15:14.371 --> 02:15:18.180
He's a unique but then two years ago me and Adam were in the back of the room.

2401
02:15:18.230 --> 02:15:21.630
I'm like this motherfuckers turned the corner. Like he was just killing it.

2402
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:25.500
Yeah, he was just really funny but like a funny in a new way.

2403
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:29.600
Like he had hit some [inaudible] some of the words he uses to describe as what

2404
02:15:29.670 --> 02:15:32.910
he hit that gear and then everything took off from there.

2405
02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:35.700
It was a lot of it was just hard work, persistence,

2406
02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.360
hard work and just eventually it really clicked.

2407
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:40.530
I think it was like a one two punch.

2408
02:15:40.531 --> 02:15:44.370
I think it was turning that corner and then also just the word of the people

2409
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:45.691
democratically,

2410
02:15:45.691 --> 02:15:49.950
just his podcast and and him doing other people's podcasts for sure.

2411
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:54.960
Cause he's really good on podcasts. He's just fucking funny and silly and funny.

2412
02:15:54.961 --> 02:15:58.740
And then his own podcast where he just looks right at the camera and it rants

2413
02:15:58.741 --> 02:16:03.410
and talks about shit and you realize like how his fucking unusual brain words.

2414
02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:03.810
Funny.

2415
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:07.290
Sometimes he's one week figure out what this algorithm is or what he's doing.

2416
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.670
And you go, no, this is him. You ain't figured that out. Yeah. No,

2417
02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:15.060
you're never gonna figure that out. How would you think to call it that? Never,

2418
02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:17.670
yeah, he's got Theo comedy for sure,

2419
02:16:17.671 --> 02:16:20.580
but it's like we were talking about earlier where no one can really teach you

2420
02:16:20.581 --> 02:16:25.110
how to do comedy. Like you're, you gotta figure it out and no one,

2421
02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:29.140
no classically trained comedian, if there ever really was one,

2422
02:16:29.141 --> 02:16:30.010
wouldn't ever teach

2423
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:34.810
<v 2>terrible to classically trained comedian. It would be those babies. Yeah.</v>

2424
02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:38.020
It would be like those guys that are like fake Seinfeld's or fake gaffigans or

2425
02:16:38.021 --> 02:16:40.390
whatever the fuck they are. It would, yeah,

2426
02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:43.940
the Shults thing was really cool to see because she just did it on his own. Yup.

2427
02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:46.570
And here's the thing, and I wanted to bring this up with you, Jamie,

2428
02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:50.680
is he shadow band on Instagram? Tell me what you think is going on.

2429
02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.670
Because I texted him when that happened because I looked it up. Yes.

2430
02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.670
And His name is shut up right at the top of my list.

2431
02:16:57.970 --> 02:17:01.600
But he said other people with me, it didn't show up.

2432
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:06.020
A mind really changed the algorithm because I've noticed if few,

2433
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.440
it could be what it could be,

2434
02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:11.740
but there you don't have to take it like a case by case scenario.

2435
02:17:11.741 --> 02:17:14.200
Was the person that first sent it to him, are they already following him?

2436
02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.200
Do they search his name a lot? Did they block anything he's ever done?

2437
02:17:17.201 --> 02:17:18.640
People have told him, hey man,

2438
02:17:18.641 --> 02:17:20.860
I'm having a hard time finding your Instagram page.

2439
02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:25.220
And so he asked me about it and I said, what do you mean? And I go, you,

2440
02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:27.730
I see you right now. You're on my feet. And he goes, no, no, no.

2441
02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:31.690
If you go to search me. So I was go, okay, let me search you. I go, whoa.

2442
02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:35.110
I searched Andrew Schultz, nothing.

2443
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:37.750
I mean a bunch of other people but not him.

2444
02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:41.500
And he's got a lot of followers like go, let's do it right now. Pull it up,

2445
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:43.780
put it up on screen. Okay, put it up on the screen.

2446
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:45.460
Let's just do it in real time.

2447
02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:48.490
Let this part of what I was saying is I follow him stuff.

2448
02:17:48.491 --> 02:17:50.650
You're not already following me, right. My shop in a different way.

2449
02:17:50.650 --> 02:17:55.510
But I do follow him. I look at feet now just right Andrew.

2450
02:17:56.020 --> 02:18:00.790
Give them some space. Right. Space. I haven't got the inch space.

2451
02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.580
Well, you should have shown up. It should have shown up already,

2452
02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:08.720
but just space and then type in his name. See it's not coming up,

2453
02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.020
right. That's what I'm saying. Now, hit search.

2454
02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:16.340
I don't think you can't search on that. Oh, on the web. But look,

2455
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:20.540
it's not showing up. You see Andrew Schulte's fans,

2456
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:23.480
even when I typed in his actual account name, it didn't show up. Oh, pick up.

2457
02:18:23.481 --> 02:18:26.330
Hold on a second. What does that Andrew Schulz fans, what does that click on?

2458
02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:31.220
That right there below it. Blow. Blow, blow. Keep going. Keep going.

2459
02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:34.550
The blind count. There it is. That's right. Click on that. I know that it's not.

2460
02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:39.440
So it's his fans have made, oh, 165 followers. That's crazy.

2461
02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:42.110
Right? No, I know. It's not him. I'm just trying to figure out what it is.

2462
02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:44.720
So just in that search,

2463
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:48.500
it's not showing up and it wouldn't show up for me on my phone either.

2464
02:18:48.501 --> 02:18:50.360
Now it doesn't make any sense because what does he have?

2465
02:18:50.361 --> 02:18:52.640
Like a half a million followers. How many followers does he have?

2466
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:58.190
That is not interesting. Like he thinks he's being shadow banned.

2467
02:18:58.250 --> 02:19:01.460
What's the, are they trying to like get some money out of no,

2468
02:19:01.670 --> 02:19:05.000
28022802000 people.

2469
02:19:05.001 --> 02:19:09.680
And he can't find his page on Instagram. Does it Schultz with a t or no,

2470
02:19:09.681 --> 02:19:12.260
just no, no. U L Z.

2471
02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.310
But it's not showing up and it's not showing up on mine. Even now,

2472
02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:21.620
we might be being paranoid here and it might be just something in the search

2473
02:19:21.621 --> 02:19:25.900
algorithm that for whatever reason his thing isn't showing up. And the,

2474
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:30.740
he used to say Hezie Schultz, I don't know why Hesi was that name.

2475
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.810
Okay. And maybe he thought that Hesi was fucking them up.

2476
02:19:35.811 --> 02:19:40.760
So he took Hesi out of his name in the it on his Instagram page.

2477
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:45.350
So it just says Andrew Schulte's now. But even though still you can't find it.

2478
02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:46.800
Yeah, that's weird. You have to type

2479
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:51.710
<v 4>Ben, Andrew shoulds all together with no space and then you'll find them.</v>

2480
02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.120
That's what I just didn't, it didn't come up with no space.

2481
02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:57.600
That's what I was just doing in front while you were asking me to type stuff and

2482
02:19:57.601 --> 02:20:00.810
I was typing, so you did it with space and no space.

2483
02:20:00.811 --> 02:20:03.840
That's when I did it to him. I was like, if you, if you're typing and no space,

2484
02:20:03.841 --> 02:20:07.140
that's where the issue is. If I'd leave that note, if I typed in all the way,

2485
02:20:07.170 --> 02:20:09.540
it's showing up right away and he said, well,

2486
02:20:09.541 --> 02:20:13.770
I'm seeing that from people both ways. So I go off if that's what you're seeing,

2487
02:20:13.771 --> 02:20:16.170
then I'll go out on a limb and sort of say,

2488
02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:19.470
does your show on is manipulating that search result because you can manipulate

2489
02:20:19.471 --> 02:20:22.370
search results. Here's the thing. They do.

2490
02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:26.900
<v 2>Shadow banned people on certain social media platforms is,</v>

2491
02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:30.950
has been revealed through hidden camera conversations with people who are

2492
02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:36.020
whatever moderators or engineers or people that work behind the scenes on

2493
02:20:36.021 --> 02:20:40.100
Twitter or Facebook and they do manipulate algorithms,

2494
02:20:40.101 --> 02:20:44.720
manipulate searches and shadow ban people. And there's a lot of people,

2495
02:20:44.721 --> 02:20:47.300
particularly conservative people, which he's not conservative,

2496
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:49.520
but what he is is, you know,

2497
02:20:49.521 --> 02:20:54.200
he's a Raunchy comedian and he might have done something that someone felt was

2498
02:20:54.201 --> 02:20:56.720
not woke or what have you.

2499
02:20:56.721 --> 02:21:00.650
And they want to slow down the broadcasting of a signal.

2500
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:03.800
That's entirely possible. I don't know if it's true though.

2501
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:08.300
I would love to have a, a logical explanation that is to lie.

2502
02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:11.510
He's not showing up. Yes. But he's, you know,

2503
02:21:11.511 --> 02:21:16.040
he's complaining about it that it's a shadow ban. Anyway, go follow Andrew.

2504
02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:18.310
Andrew Sholtz. Yeah. Uh,

2505
02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:22.910
S S H U l z. S. H. U. L. Z.

2506
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:28.510
Go follow the trail just to tell Instagram shadow bands that we can get around

2507
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:31.250
you. Bitch. He's a marketing genius. It's just great to hear him talk about,

2508
02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:34.910
you know, what he's doing and how to get around it. And it's exciting cause you,

2509
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:38.390
you forget as an artist that you have a lot of power. Like you're everything,

2510
02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:42.500
you're, you're the product. And sometimes, uh, especially in the old models,

2511
02:21:42.501 --> 02:21:45.260
you just kind of waited to be anointed. Well,

2512
02:21:45.261 --> 02:21:50.210
he's got millions and millions of views on his special on youtube.

2513
02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:53.300
And if you stop and think about if that was on comedy central,

2514
02:21:53.330 --> 02:21:55.870
which comedy central didn't want to give him a special, um,

2515
02:21:55.910 --> 02:22:00.910
he probably would get like maybe a million people would watch it when it came

2516
02:22:01.821 --> 02:22:03.650
out and that would be the end of it. I have a special,

2517
02:22:03.651 --> 02:22:06.230
and I don't think people are watching it, just youtube is accessible.

2518
02:22:07.310 --> 02:22:10.130
It can be in comedy jail. You could do a great special and no one can find it.

2519
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:13.160
Yeah, yeah. Everyone has youtube. Everyone can click on a link.

2520
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:16.310
Everyone has youtube. And this was his logic. He was like, you know what,

2521
02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:19.430
I'm just going to release the whole thing on youtube and look,

2522
02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:24.431
he went straight from not selling out clubs to selling out theaters like that

2523
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:27.630
and now he sells out everywhere internationally.

2524
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:31.710
And it's amazing from afar to watch the industry change.

2525
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:33.730
[inaudible] yes. He's realized,

2526
02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:37.590
cause I think early on you so much of your self worth is,

2527
02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:41.580
is put in these people and you just, you, you don't realize till later that, oh,

2528
02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:44.730
they're just heat seeking missiles. Yup. Yeah. They don't, you know,

2529
02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:48.210
majority of them don't have tastes, tastes. It's just whatever's happening.

2530
02:22:48.450 --> 02:22:51.840
Whatever's hot, can I get a pie of whatever this is? I mean, including hacks.

2531
02:22:51.841 --> 02:22:55.260
I mean there, there's a long history of them supporting hacks and thieves.

2532
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.440
It's just a thing where they're, what they're trying to do is make money.

2533
02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:01.200
You know, if you're an agent or a producer,

2534
02:23:01.201 --> 02:23:05.460
I mean there's no benefit in you supporting an artist that is not going to be

2535
02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.510
commercially viable. Yeah. You have to find out like, who,

2536
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:12.060
who's it gonna who's going to pop? Who's going to be the next movie star?

2537
02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:14.910
Who's gonna be in the movies? You know, you have to figure that person out.

2538
02:23:14.911 --> 02:23:18.030
And what was it like when, uh, you know, limits, see a thing went down.

2539
02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:22.920
What was the climate like for you, say professionally after that went down?

2540
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:26.160
Because he was at a different level at that time, right? Yeah.

2541
02:23:26.490 --> 02:23:29.910
Who's more popular than me with comedy? For sure. You know,

2542
02:23:29.911 --> 02:23:34.410
I was doing fear factor back then and I wasn't really working on the road that

2543
02:23:34.411 --> 02:23:37.080
much. I really couldn't, you know, I was doing

2544
02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:43.260
no 30 episodes a year plus, so 30 weeks, a year of work.

2545
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:45.990
And I wasn't really enthusiastic about traveling when I was doing that.

2546
02:23:46.170 --> 02:23:50.010
I just wanted to, I was exhausted. Um, and then I was doing the store too,

2547
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:54.430
so it was mostly just working on my act and just doing standup. And um,

2548
02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:58.440
they supported him because he was the one who was making the money. I mean,

2549
02:23:58.441 --> 02:24:01.740
in fact, I left my agency because they wanted me to apologize to him.

2550
02:24:02.430 --> 02:24:05.400
And then Louie wound up leaving them and a towel wound up leaving them and

2551
02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:06.750
Swartz and wound up leaving them.

2552
02:24:06.751 --> 02:24:10.290
Everybody left him right after that because they found out that they wanted me

2553
02:24:10.291 --> 02:24:14.040
to apologize to them, to everybody in the industry knew what was going on,

2554
02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:19.560
but they wanted to turn a blind eye and make money. So it did,

2555
02:24:19.561 --> 02:24:21.630
it hurt my career while I stopped going to the store.

2556
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:24.930
But that didn't hurt me as much as it hurt them.

2557
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:29.310
It hurt the store cause I told everybody. And then that place was a ghost town.

2558
02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:32.910
I mean it went from being packed when I was there cause I would let them put my

2559
02:24:32.911 --> 02:24:34.980
name up on the market and I was working for free.

2560
02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:39.150
That's how fucking stupid Tommy was fucking dummy.

2561
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.280
But then when you know, he got fired and I came back and made it all worth it.

2562
02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.960
You know, the whole thing was,

2563
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:51.300
it was interesting because it could show you that if there was someone who was

2564
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:56.010
doing what Mincy was doing, that you can get away with it.

2565
02:24:56.011 --> 02:24:58.410
And even with someone who was successful like me,

2566
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.070
like I got another agent like that. I mean, but,

2567
02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:05.760
but I let my agent literally said I was going to have to apologize to him.

2568
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.190
I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind. I go, listen,

2569
02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:11.250
I'm not only am I not doing this, this, we're never going to work this out.

2570
02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.820
I'll never work with you again because you're asking me to apologize to someone

2571
02:25:14.821 --> 02:25:16.680
who was literally a vampire,

2572
02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:18.780
someone who's stealing from the work of other artists.

2573
02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:23.781
It's all he does and you guys know it and you guys are profiting of this.

2574
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:28.720
<v 1>Like this is you're making a giant mistake. And I turned out it was correct.</v>

2575
02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:31.750
But it was interesting because even though it didn't hurt me financially,

2576
02:25:31.751 --> 02:25:35.650
I got to see that they were trying to, cause you know, he wanted them,

2577
02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:38.770
he wanted an apology and I was like, you're out of your fucking mind.

2578
02:25:38.771 --> 02:25:41.290
I'm not apologizing to you. And as it kept getting,

2579
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:43.960
people became more and more aware,

2580
02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:46.750
other people started finding other bits that he had,

2581
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:51.160
like the real thing that sunk him was Cosby. Really funny.

2582
02:25:51.370 --> 02:25:52.210
Now when you think about it now,

2583
02:25:52.211 --> 02:25:55.990
but he had this like such obvious theft of a Cosby bit. I mean,

2584
02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:59.860
he still all the inflections and he switched it around a little bit,

2585
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:03.580
but people who would work with him and trying to tell him to stop doing that bit

2586
02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:08.581
because there was a giant famous Cosby bit and he just insisted that he was

2587
02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:11.590
going to do it. And when that bit got on Youtube,

2588
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:15.430
that and Mexican folks finding out he wasn't really Mexican,

2589
02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:20.860
that was a fucking knife in the heart when they were like, wow, like what?

2590
02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:22.780
When they found out what his real name was, they're like,

2591
02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:24.250
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

2592
02:26:24.610 --> 02:26:29.140
There was so much going on then though that was, um, you know,

2593
02:26:29.141 --> 02:26:30.850
he was really popular.

2594
02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:35.290
He went from selling out these giant places and you know,

2595
02:26:35.291 --> 02:26:39.340
kicking ass all over the country and people knew him from the television show

2596
02:26:39.341 --> 02:26:40.510
and they thought he was hilarious.

2597
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:43.900
I guess that's Kinda cool about stand up is that of all the art forms,

2598
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:47.620
standup has the most justice and then now it does now.

2599
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:50.650
But there's a lot of people made it through the net back in the day,

2600
02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:51.970
they were just criminals.

2601
02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:54.460
I guess it was harder to know back then there was no internet.

2602
02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:57.460
There was just sort of like word of mouth or you would hear stories.

2603
02:26:57.461 --> 02:27:01.270
We all know that there's parallel thinking and then there's even cases where you

2604
02:27:01.271 --> 02:27:02.770
forget you heard something. I've done it.

2605
02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:05.920
I've definitely hash it out like a comic or something and be like, for sure.

2606
02:27:05.921 --> 02:27:09.910
Okay, yeah, you can have it. Or we're all pals. Right. It's bound to happen.

2607
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:12.160
It's going to happen. Just have the conversation. If you're a pro, you're like,

2608
02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:14.320
all right, I don't need that bit. Yeah, exactly.

2609
02:27:14.530 --> 02:27:17.500
And then there's also people that are like, you know, like you said that word,

2610
02:27:17.501 --> 02:27:19.690
and that's the word that I say in my bit. And you're like, what?

2611
02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:23.320
Like some people, some people are hypersensitive to it. Almost like delusional.

2612
02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:25.130
Yes. Yeah. Some people get delusional. That's,

2613
02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:29.350
I talk about being in a relationship, so, oh yeah. That, I appreciate it.

2614
02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:33.610
That's hilarious. With my girlfriend recently too, so yeah, I own that. Well,

2615
02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:37.480
especially things that are current events, right? It feels like something like,

2616
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:40.270
I can't believe you're talking about Trump, you know? I do that whole trumpet.

2617
02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:43.920
Yeah, like what are you crazy? I've seen these conversations.

2618
02:27:44.650 --> 02:27:45.483
Yeah.

2619
02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:52.930
That guy's never gonna live that down. I'm telling you this is just brewing.

2620
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:57.640
This is just starting. He's never living that down. That's one. You know,

2621
02:27:57.641 --> 02:27:59.980
I'll wreck your shit. I'll throw you down a flight of stairs.

2622
02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.420
Was there stairs nearby or would they have to go up?

2623
02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:08.110
They have to go find some stairs. You're not going to live like the trip down.

2624
02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:09.760
That's a weird thing to say to someone.

2625
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:12.550
Throw you down a flight of stairs so you want to hurt them,

2626
02:28:12.551 --> 02:28:14.920
but you want the gravity to do all the work. Yeah, that's true.

2627
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:16.440
So it's not that tough. Sleazy.

2628
02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.420
He has all that potential energy once it gets up there and just knock them over.

2629
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:21.560
Right. That's funny. And you're looking at it. An engineer.

2630
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:26.930
<v 0>I've got to use it somehow. My Dad's so proud that I pulled that out of the bag.</v>

2631
02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:30.740
Do Use your engineer training at all when your stand up? Is there anything else?

2632
02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:35.741
I think a one quality I can take away from all the engineering schooling,

2633
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:39.560
like I'm not doing formulas and equations and all that,

2634
02:28:39.561 --> 02:28:43.550
but I think it's just a manner of which I approach things and time management,

2635
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:48.020
I'm wired a certain way where I can be studious on my own. I don't,

2636
02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:52.970
I'm not like smoking weed on the couch and like I'm a muse or I'm a vessel.

2637
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:55.470
God's man. Like I'm okay, what do I got?

2638
02:28:55.471 --> 02:28:58.430
What's what I want to do and one of my goals for this year, let's say,

2639
02:28:58.570 --> 02:29:00.500
or how many tests do I have when I'm working on for this set.

2640
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:05.180
So I'm just a little industrious. It's taught me and also when it comes to bits,

2641
02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:09.800
like I see them in a certain way, like um, the way I get the bits,

2642
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:13.610
it's very organic and that's what I like about it is that it's not clinical or

2643
02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:17.690
anything. It's just magical how I think of something and I'm grateful for that.

2644
02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:19.870
You give yourself time to think.

2645
02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:23.790
Do you like specifically do things like go on walks or anything where you,

2646
02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:24.770
you're not specifically,

2647
02:29:24.771 --> 02:29:29.771
but what I found is one of my favorite things to do is to go to a diner,

2648
02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:34.400
sit in a booth, a breakfast, have coffee, and they'd keep on refilling it.

2649
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:38.300
And I'm on my phone and I'm on Twitter and Instagram and my mind's just kind of,

2650
02:29:38.301 --> 02:29:39.860
and I'm listening to music. I love music.

2651
02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:44.990
So I'm just scouring Spotify and hype machine just for new music hype machine.

2652
02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:48.320
I don't know what that is. Uh, so I love, so that's how I find music.

2653
02:29:48.321 --> 02:29:52.610
Like hype machine and also Spotify hype machine is this blog aggregate.

2654
02:29:52.611 --> 02:29:53.840
So there's music blogs, right?

2655
02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:56.400
There's one called like acid stag that I like a lot.

2656
02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:00.440
So you can follow a blog and they'll post songs every day.

2657
02:30:00.470 --> 02:30:02.240
Maybe they'll post six songs a day.

2658
02:30:02.930 --> 02:30:06.620
This website you can follow different blogs and it's like following someone on

2659
02:30:06.621 --> 02:30:07.454
Instagram or something.

2660
02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:12.350
So you look at your year feed and you get to hear all the songs your favorite

2661
02:30:12.351 --> 02:30:15.950
blogs have posted within the website. And there's an app on your phone too.

2662
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:18.140
And these are kind of underground songs.

2663
02:30:18.141 --> 02:30:21.650
These aren't top 40 so it's a way to hear great music that you wouldn't hear on

2664
02:30:21.651 --> 02:30:25.400
the radio and they're, they're not in a less great,

2665
02:30:25.700 --> 02:30:29.900
there's this whole sub culture and genre of music that is magnificent,

2666
02:30:29.901 --> 02:30:31.880
but it's not on top 40, so people don't really know about it.

2667
02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:33.070
So height machines,

2668
02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:36.060
a great way to get some cool tracks off the beaten path and a spot.

2669
02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.710
I've never heard of that before. That's interesting. Height machine.

2670
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:42.590
So music plays a big part with my comedy. Yeah. Machine.

2671
02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:47.060
What's popular now? How oversize. It's like their top 40.

2672
02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:49.700
So even this is a little poppy for me. Ah,

2673
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:54.260
I'll have certain blogs and I like finding, yeah, it's when, yeah. Dove. Yeah.

2674
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:57.470
I mean for this type of music. Yeah. Whatever it makes,

2675
02:30:57.471 --> 02:30:59.600
whatever it makes the popular land. Tay, hold on.

2676
02:30:59.830 --> 02:31:03.830
You're not going to scroll back up please. Duranti Maya, that's poppy.

2677
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:08.630
Fuck knows any of this music. Childish Gambino. I know that guys,

2678
02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:12.530
if you're like a teen or early twenties, you'll, you'll know this stuff. Really?

2679
02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:15.110
Yeah. Um, so I just love listening to music.

2680
02:31:15.111 --> 02:31:17.960
Drinking coffee and on my phone and I'll just get these ideas.

2681
02:31:18.440 --> 02:31:21.690
But also just living life. I'll be walking around and I'll get an idea,

2682
02:31:21.691 --> 02:31:24.960
jot it down. Well you don't have a day job, which helps. No, that's,

2683
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:27.560
that's really helps collect material, believe it or not. Yeah.

2684
02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:32.730
I think comics have to be amused and you have to be experiencing just life,

2685
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:34.350
life if you're working all,

2686
02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:38.460
it's not like it was harder when I was working at Boeing cause I had that mental

2687
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:43.350
fatigue of just working on parts and all that and computational stuff.

2688
02:31:43.351 --> 02:31:46.440
So I'm not thinking about bits when I'm them. Suck it out of you too.

2689
02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:50.640
I can see that because you think that, oh, it's just like, you know,

2690
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:53.790
I didn't really work on my act that much during the day anyway.

2691
02:31:53.791 --> 02:31:56.490
Now I have a job doing, doing, acting.

2692
02:31:56.520 --> 02:32:00.240
I'll probably get just as much material [inaudible] no, no, you won't.

2693
02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:02.910
You're going to be wrapped up in whatever the fuck you're doing and then when

2694
02:32:02.911 --> 02:32:06.570
you go to do standup, you'd be like, Oh yeah, time to do stand up now.

2695
02:32:06.570 --> 02:32:07.590
I'll think about it. Yeah.

2696
02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:11.220
But you really need that time to be just three to think. Yeah.

2697
02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:14.100
It's kind of crucial to the creative process. I didn't think about that,

2698
02:32:14.101 --> 02:32:17.820
but that's true. Cause those other jobs you, you have mental focused,

2699
02:32:17.821 --> 02:32:20.610
you're not dedicating to standing bits, right. Yeah.

2700
02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:23.910
Where I'm at a diner and yeah, my mind is just floating around.

2701
02:32:23.970 --> 02:32:27.870
It seems like you're not working like someone on the outside. We'd be like,

2702
02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:30.540
you're not even working. I might come up with a gem.

2703
02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:34.620
That might be my next closing bit. Yeah, that is worth randomly. Yeah,

2704
02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:36.540
because you gave yourself that time. Yeah.

2705
02:32:36.541 --> 02:32:41.070
Like you just are watering the grass and a mushroom pops up. Even with me,

2706
02:32:41.071 --> 02:32:44.790
I think there was a big breakthrough in just accepting that I'm an artist

2707
02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:46.470
because you know,

2708
02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:49.640
my parents didn't want me to do it for so long and it was this dirty thing and

2709
02:32:49.650 --> 02:32:52.890
it was always pimps. Some process would go to the club,

2710
02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:57.150
so stand up and comedy was, I was like a vampire feeding.

2711
02:32:57.180 --> 02:33:01.410
It was just this thing that I do over here and I want to do it.

2712
02:33:01.411 --> 02:33:04.410
But it was always different than what I'm supposed to be doing.

2713
02:33:04.770 --> 02:33:06.960
It was always on the side. It's like a hobby type where I would,

2714
02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:08.520
there was a division within my mind,

2715
02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:13.770
but once I left Boeing and I was doing it full time, what was the impetus?

2716
02:33:13.771 --> 02:33:16.590
Like what, how'd you make the decision? Ideally?

2717
02:33:16.591 --> 02:33:21.030
I always had this pie in the sky scenario that would happen for me to leave

2718
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:22.740
Boeing. I would think, all right,

2719
02:33:22.741 --> 02:33:27.000
if I got to the point where I'm doing engineering and stand up,

2720
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:31.170
I want it to a point where it's glaringly obvious that engineering is holding me

2721
02:33:31.171 --> 02:33:34.230
back from this other path and I have to make the jump.

2722
02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:37.140
So I needed that to happen. And then I,

2723
02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:40.980
I think enough things happened where I kind of had that situation. I had,

2724
02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:44.580
I booked this acting thing, I booked a roll on Chuck NBCS, Chuck.

2725
02:33:44.890 --> 02:33:46.860
I was still working at Boeing. It was like this huge guest star.

2726
02:33:46.861 --> 02:33:49.260
I forgot about chuck. Yeah. So I, I,

2727
02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:52.080
and I would do these things towards the end of my tenure at Boeing, I would,

2728
02:33:52.170 --> 02:33:54.090
I had a manager and I would get auditions.

2729
02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:58.020
So I would duck out for lunch and I'm in Long Beach and I would drive up to

2730
02:33:58.021 --> 02:34:01.830
Hollywood and do an audition and I'd be gone for a,

2731
02:34:01.831 --> 02:34:05.130
that one I would like do a combo, let's say lunch and doctor's appointment.

2732
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.570
Then I would do, or I would take off.

2733
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:11.280
I would come in early and leave early if I had an audition,

2734
02:34:11.310 --> 02:34:15.150
but I had to be very strategic about what I did. I can't be from a day job.

2735
02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.780
So this one went out for chuck and then I auditioned and then it got it as this

2736
02:34:19.781 --> 02:34:24.610
huge guest star and I'm still working at Boeing and they need me for eight days.

2737
02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.020
I have a day job. So I said I had a family emergency in Seattle,

2738
02:34:29.021 --> 02:34:31.570
I have to go back home. And they're like, oh, okay.

2739
02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:35.800
But I'll just in Burbank shooting, chuck [inaudible] just shooting.

2740
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.850
And then I go back to work and people see you on TV now.

2741
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:43.000
Luckily there was enough of a lead time where that wasn't coming out for a long

2742
02:34:43.001 --> 02:34:46.540
time. So he quit. No, not yet. So I just thought like, okay, cool.

2743
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:47.890
Like I still keep on,

2744
02:34:47.891 --> 02:34:50.800
I can keep on being an engineer and then a couple of things happen.

2745
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:53.230
I use anybody notice you on chalk.

2746
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:56.300
But the thing is that happened when I left Boeing. So,

2747
02:34:56.301 --> 02:34:59.950
so a aired after I had left. Oh, how much lead time was there?

2748
02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:03.910
Quite a quite a bit. Maybe like six months or it was towards the end. Um,

2749
02:35:05.050 --> 02:35:06.010
and so no one knew.

2750
02:35:06.011 --> 02:35:09.250
I did stand up and the beauty of it was when I entered the workforce of

2751
02:35:09.251 --> 02:35:11.470
engineering, everyone is substantially older than me.

2752
02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:15.520
They were like in 30s or they don't know about hype machine. Yeah,

2753
02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:18.010
they don't behind machine. And so it wasn't second nature to be like,

2754
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:22.110
what's your mind space? Or, cause Jake would have been up immediately. Yeah.

2755
02:35:22.170 --> 02:35:25.480
So there was no, social media was not second nature with coworkers.

2756
02:35:25.481 --> 02:35:29.050
So there was a big enough generational gap. So I was able to for three years,

2757
02:35:29.051 --> 02:35:30.040
just no one know anything.

2758
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.480
So I do the chuck thing and then I also,

2759
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:36.340
I got really far in standard,

2760
02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:41.180
NBC has the stand up for diversity initiative every year. Um,

2761
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:43.990
you do like a stand up competition thing from different cities and then they

2762
02:35:43.991 --> 02:35:47.230
have a final showcase. So I got like second on that.

2763
02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:49.890
So I got some college gigs out of it.

2764
02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.310
I got quite a few college gigs and then I booked this show on MTV called

2765
02:35:54.311 --> 02:35:57.460
disaster date, which is like boiling points for dating.

2766
02:35:58.270 --> 02:36:01.210
They had a cast and I was one of the cast members and you would just go on dates

2767
02:36:01.211 --> 02:36:04.120
with friends, would set up their friends with dates and they'd be like,

2768
02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:07.120
this is the things that she hates. And you would just be the worst date ever.

2769
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:08.500
And you see how long they laughed on the date.

2770
02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:13.270
So they needed me for eight months or no, three months. Three fuck,

2771
02:36:13.271 --> 02:36:14.770
what do I do? Yeah, three months.

2772
02:36:14.771 --> 02:36:17.570
So this was kind of that situation where I'm like, fuck, all right.

2773
02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:20.560
I just did chuck. I have some college gigs lined up.

2774
02:36:21.490 --> 02:36:26.020
This MTV show needs me for three months. I got it. I got to do this.

2775
02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:27.340
Oh I didn't do that yet.

2776
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:30.910
I tried to take a leave of absence cause I planned on coming back. I was like,

2777
02:36:30.911 --> 02:36:34.120
can I need something? Came up gonna be gone for three months and then I'll,

2778
02:36:34.390 --> 02:36:38.890
and they're like, no, you can't do that. And I'm like, um, are you sure?

2779
02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:40.720
I just kept on trying to finesse it and they wouldn't let me.

2780
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:45.640
And then I was reading about unemployment and stuff and I read that you couldn't

2781
02:36:45.641 --> 02:36:49.740
quit. You had to get fired, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, alright, um,

2782
02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:51.730
here's what I'm gonna do. So I wrote my last day there,

2783
02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:56.110
I wrote an email just like, hey guys, I'll be gone for this three months.

2784
02:36:56.111 --> 02:36:58.480
I plan on returning on this day.

2785
02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:01.030
And then I just went incommunicado like I didn't,

2786
02:37:01.530 --> 02:37:04.240
I didn't pick up any phone calls if I was going to get fired.

2787
02:37:04.241 --> 02:37:06.940
I wanted to get fired by them cause I didn't want them,

2788
02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:09.580
I didn't want to go on the books that I quit. For some reason,

2789
02:37:09.581 --> 02:37:12.610
my engineering brain is like, this is great. I'll get them on a technicality.

2790
02:37:12.611 --> 02:37:16.520
They'll fire me and I'll get my unemployment if I need to. So I leave mowing.

2791
02:37:16.521 --> 02:37:18.710
I'm shooting the show for three months and then eventually I get like a

2792
02:37:18.711 --> 02:37:22.760
termination letter in the mail from Boeing. I'm like, yes, yes.

2793
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:24.170
But then it turns out, I mean,

2794
02:37:24.171 --> 02:37:26.870
I could have collected unemployment from the MTV show,

2795
02:37:27.170 --> 02:37:30.830
so I didn't even have to go out that way. Oh really? I mean it was fine.

2796
02:37:30.831 --> 02:37:34.670
Like it wasn't, yeah, we used to collect unemployment for dude. He was,

2797
02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:38.210
he was like my guiding light in that regard. Cause early on,

2798
02:37:38.390 --> 02:37:40.940
especially when I left Boeing and the MTV thing comes and goes,

2799
02:37:40.941 --> 02:37:44.000
I do two seasons of it and then, but that's not like a fucking,

2800
02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:49.070
it's got like a rock solid thing and Ra would show me the ropes. He'd be like,

2801
02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:50.900
please collect unemployment from knocking job.

2802
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:52.850
You're good enough to jump in and you're going to unemployment.

2803
02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:54.800
Let's hope it works. Yeah.

2804
02:37:54.801 --> 02:37:57.950
He taught me how to do it and I never heard of anybody getting unemployment from

2805
02:37:57.951 --> 02:38:00.870
acting gigs. Now we would do a commercial. That's how it works.

2806
02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:03.830
Just like an employees, you pay into it and all that. It's all on the up and up.

2807
02:38:03.890 --> 02:38:08.890
It's just part of an actor's I guess requirement or necessity of an actor is

2808
02:38:09.921 --> 02:38:13.430
being available. Yes. So if you book a commercial, like a Toyota commercial,

2809
02:38:13.431 --> 02:38:17.030
let's say you make 30 grand or 20 grand, whatever, in that chunk,

2810
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:22.630
you've made enough money in that quarter tool to apply cause you're paying into

2811
02:38:23.151 --> 02:38:26.150
it. We just think, oh you have to hit a certain amount and then you're eligible.

2812
02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:28.580
There's tiers of how much money you get for unemployment,

2813
02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:32.990
then you're eligible for x amount of dollars every two weeks or whatever.

2814
02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:35.300
And that helped me keep a full for like a year.

2815
02:38:35.330 --> 02:38:37.310
And then I got to the point where I didn't need, I didn't need it.

2816
02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:40.640
I had enough steady work coming in. But that was,

2817
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:41.870
when did you tell your parents?

2818
02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.590
I thought that they would take it worse than they did,

2819
02:38:45.591 --> 02:38:50.591
but I think we had been at odds for so long that what I've noticed is you can't

2820
02:38:50.901 --> 02:38:53.930
stay at an 11 your whole life. Right? Yeah.

2821
02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:58.460
So I think they had to know this day was going to come eventually cause I would

2822
02:38:58.461 --> 02:39:00.290
talk about it. That was the plan the whole time. I guess.

2823
02:39:00.350 --> 02:39:03.920
They just never thought that it would come to fruition. Now when you quit,

2824
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:05.810
how long did you wait or when you get fired,

2825
02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:08.500
how long did you wait before you told them? Uh,

2826
02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:11.390
you don't have a day job anymore. It was, that was around Christmas.

2827
02:39:11.430 --> 02:39:14.600
It was around the holidays. So we were at my aunt's house and then I told,

2828
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:19.410
I told them I was like, it went over better than I thought. Yeah. All surprised.

2829
02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:22.910
What did you say? All the good things you're getting. Yeah, obviously, come on,

2830
02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.220
I'm not gonna be like, I quit and I'm going to figure it out.

2831
02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:28.250
I'll figure it out. But I like having us for money later.

2832
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:31.760
I'm really proud of that in this whole adventure.

2833
02:39:31.761 --> 02:39:35.300
I've never asked my parents for money and I think that's a win. Yes.

2834
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:37.700
That's a huge win. That's a huge win. Yeah.

2835
02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:41.130
And I hope that they kind of notice that through the tough times.

2836
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:43.520
I never that that means that's a sign. It's going well.

2837
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:47.240
They should figure that out. That's a giant win. Yeah, but I mean,

2838
02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:50.600
I just want to tell people if they have the similar path that you don't,

2839
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:54.020
there's this romanticized version of being an artist where you just pack up all

2840
02:39:54.021 --> 02:39:57.590
your things, come in and out of a yeah, man. Like, no,

2841
02:39:57.591 --> 02:40:02.360
I gotta be 100% of my art. Yeah, you have a plan.

2842
02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:07.160
Do you want to set yourself up for success or are you trying to draw you and

2843
02:40:07.161 --> 02:40:08.570
artists? Are you an engineer?

2844
02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:14.250
We both know there's a lot of hours in the day that you're a prime example

2845
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:16.320
<v 1>of that. It's amazing. All the things you do,</v>

2846
02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:20.280
there are so many hours in a day and it's such a cop out to be like,

2847
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:23.760
I'm going to be all in it. I'm going to live and breathe my art,

2848
02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:26.820
otherwise I'm going to be a hack. No, be methodical.

2849
02:40:26.821 --> 02:40:30.030
Set yourself up for success. Well, I think you have to be disciplined.

2850
02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:32.010
Discipline for sure. I think it's very important.

2851
02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:35.880
You can still be artistic and discipline. A contrary to popular opinion.

2852
02:40:35.881 --> 02:40:40.770
You can and you have to be careful not to lose yourself once you come to la.

2853
02:40:40.771 --> 02:40:44.370
How many people do you know who come out here with a particular plan to like be

2854
02:40:44.371 --> 02:40:47.580
an artist or a writer and they're fucking birthday parties every day?

2855
02:40:47.970 --> 02:40:49.260
Like when you come to La,

2856
02:40:49.261 --> 02:40:53.370
you can go to someone's birthday party at a bar every day. Oh yeah.

2857
02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:57.860
Yeah. There's so many. It's everyone's birthday every, every day to this town.

2858
02:40:57.861 --> 02:41:02.160
So big. Yeah, that's true. So you get sucked up into the party life.

2859
02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:04.180
You'll see it too. Some artists just get like,

2860
02:41:04.410 --> 02:41:08.910
they'll go down this networking rabbit hole and they have no tangible and they

2861
02:41:08.911 --> 02:41:10.170
never want to do a bad show.

2862
02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:14.490
They just want to do the best shows and they don't just focus on getting good at

2863
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:16.740
stand up comedy. It's just, I'm going to this party,

2864
02:41:16.741 --> 02:41:18.750
So-and-so is here and they have nothing.

2865
02:41:18.751 --> 02:41:23.340
Do you ever envision a time where one of us or maybe a collection of us writes

2866
02:41:23.341 --> 02:41:24.810
down all these things?

2867
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:29.880
What do you mean some sort of a guidebook to stand up comedy? I really think,

2868
02:41:29.881 --> 02:41:31.710
yeah, someone could benefit from it.

2869
02:41:31.711 --> 02:41:35.430
I mean this really is the only art form that, as we were saying before,

2870
02:41:35.431 --> 02:41:36.960
is a viable art form.

2871
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:41.420
A large scale that doesn't have any book or nothing. Yeah.

2872
02:41:41.930 --> 02:41:45.240
Not, I mean every fucking book about comedy, like how to do comedies.

2873
02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:49.950
Terrible worst. Yeah. You know, it's weird. You know,

2874
02:41:49.951 --> 02:41:52.110
it's scary. There's all these formulas.

2875
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.620
I think podcasting has taken some of the mistake out of it.

2876
02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:59.520
I think it's also created a bunch of fans of the process too. Sure.

2877
02:41:59.550 --> 02:42:02.790
Like I've talked to people that have like come up to me at the comedy store and

2878
02:42:02.791 --> 02:42:06.630
said, Hey, I saw you first do that bit a year ago,

2879
02:42:06.631 --> 02:42:09.840
and then I watched it change and then when it became on your Netflix specials,

2880
02:42:09.841 --> 02:42:11.550
like Holy Shit, like look at it.

2881
02:42:11.551 --> 02:42:15.030
It's kind of cool to see it grow and become viable. Yeah.

2882
02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:19.260
I think it's cool that there's an audience for that or that they value that

2883
02:42:19.261 --> 02:42:23.640
because I think it's easy to assume the end consumer just wants to see the

2884
02:42:23.641 --> 02:42:26.790
finished product, but their comedy fans are so savvy now.

2885
02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:31.140
They want to see that process and they feel like they're let in like a cool,

2886
02:42:31.470 --> 02:42:35.280
like it's not a magic trick anymore. No, no, no. It's different. Yeah. No,

2887
02:42:35.281 --> 02:42:40.110
I agree. Listen man. Uh, I'm glad I got chin here. Thanks my pleasure,

2888
02:42:40.111 --> 02:42:44.040
brother. My pleasure. And um, it's always cool seeing you at the store.

2889
02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:46.230
You're funny. Motherfucking likewise. Thanks for that. And uh,

2890
02:42:46.231 --> 02:42:50.130
I wish all the best. So tell everybody what your Instagram, what is the,

2891
02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:55.110
it's a he-man war. So just my name, uh, Twitter. Same He-man or,

2892
02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:58.530
and then I'm a special on Amazon called, there's no business like show business.

2893
02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:01.470
So I just want people to watch that. I didn't like too many shows on Amazon.

2894
02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:04.790
Yeah. But it was acquired, so it wasn't like an original idea.

2895
02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:10.170
Everyone knew that was going down. Yeah. Yeah. All right brother.

2896
02:43:10.171 --> 02:43:12.630
Thank you very much. [inaudible] bye everybody.
