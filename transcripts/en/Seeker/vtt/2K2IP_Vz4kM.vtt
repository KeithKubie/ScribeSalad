00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.330
There have been nearly 300 mass shootings
so far this year, but you've probably only

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.779
heard about a handful.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:17.820
Why are we so apathetic to these incidences
of mass murder?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.980
According to federal statutes, a "mass killing"
is when three or more people are killed in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
one incident.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.470
The stats you hear in the news get confusing
because everyone counts these things differently,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.869
but according to director of research at the
Minnesota Department of Corrections, Grant

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.790
Duwe; there were 909 mass killings from 1900
to 1999.[1] In the 90s, it averaged a little

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.610
more than 4 per year.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.850
But from 2000 to 2013, we averaged more than
11 per year.[2] And, that's using federal

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.880
definitions, if we include people who were
wounded or killed by gunfire in one incident:

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.410
we find 294 mass shootings occured in 2015
ALONE.[3]

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.110
Even though there are more mass killings now,
we're not seeing that reflected in national

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.110
attention.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.030
We just seem… meh on the whole thing.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.980
According to Pew Research Center’s Project
for Excellence in Journalism, 29% of local

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.400
news stories in 2005 were about crime, by
2012 it had dropped to 17%.[4] Why?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.020
Because people are habituating.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.110
Habituation is the act of psychological adaptation,
we're getting used to hearing mass shootings.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.220
The story doesn't change, and when it doesn't
change, we begin to ignore it.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
As President Obama intimated this week, they're
becoming "routine."

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.280
We literally cannot focus on each individual
crime, and that causes psychological numbness.[5]

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.870
Genocides, holocausts, ethnic cleanses, civil
wars, insurgencies, all of these have become

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.870
routine…

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.270
I mean, chances are you started tune out during
that LIST just now!

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.979
Media theorists and psychologists call this
the "issue attention cycle."

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.710
As described by Anthony Downs book Up and
Down with ecology -- the "issue-attention

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.100
cycle:" first, we are alarmed, "How could
this happen?!" we cry!

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.990
And then move through the stages…

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.270
As the problem becomes real, we discover the
solution isn't easy; after a period of intense

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.630
focus, and debate, public interest declines;
and, eventually, we enter the post-problem

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.630
stage.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.120
Here, quote the issue falls into a "twilight
realm of lesser attention of spasmodic recurrences

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120
of interest."

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.940
Often says Downs, by the Post-problem stage
5, we've created programs, institutions and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.920
policies to try to solve the problem at hand…
though not always[6].

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.770
In the end, the cycle can be reinvigorated
when a new iteration presents itself -- like

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.230
a massive school shooting, theater shooting,
military base shooting or the like.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.030
Each narrative is novel, and the novelty reinvigorates
attention, but otherwise, school shootings

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.959
are joining the list of things we just don't
have the psychological wherewithal to stick

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.959
to.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.290
Humans HAVE to habituate, without this biological
mandate, every tree would be a NEW tree -- we'd

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.310
never be able to discern new information from
the repeated information surrounding it.[7]

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.110
Because of habituation, MASS might be the
biggest obstacle.[8] After each tragedy, the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.180
media attempts to implement "frame changing"
to move the narrative around, pulling the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.000
novel information out of the clutter.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.750
In coverage of Columbine; the media attached
faces and names to victims; but to change

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.670
the frame, Sandy Hook's coverage was led by
gun control debates raging through the country.[9]

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.120
These two mass shootings weren't necessarily
novel situations, but they mixed personal

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.950
stories with new coverage, and thus they stood
out in our national attention.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.080
As described by a paper in 2014's Homicide
Studies, without novel ways to tell an old

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.209
story, we (and the media) pretty much ignore
tragedies.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.501
Dr. Paul Slovic, professor of psychology at
the University of Oregon writes, "When it

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:46.180
comes to eliciting compassion, the identified
individual victim, with a face and a name,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.180
has no peer.[10]"

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.890
By covering these events with numbers instead
of names, by covering them as much as we do,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.000
and by failing to create institutions and
policies to fix the problems, we're stuck.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.489
If you blame media, blame government, blame
humans; you'd be right each time.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.550
To break the cycle, we need to make a change.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.599
Ignoring it, refusing to make changes, or
acknowledge a problem and hoping the shootings

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.000
stop won't work (and hasn't), but if we actively
adopt some solution to fix the mass shooting

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.620
problem, future stories will be automatically
frame-changed.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.710
Hard science doesn't have an easy answer to
this social issue, instead we're left with

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.870
the difficult one.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.470
Look at our failings, find a solution, and
fix the problem.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.400
In Psychological Science Agenda Dr. Slovic
wrote, "The repetitiveness of such atrocities,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.629
ignored by powerful people and nations, and
by the general public, calls for explanations

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.129
that may reflect some fundamental deficiency
in our humanity -- a deficiency that, once

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.020
identified, might possibly be overcome."

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.469
Tell me about your feelings down below.

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.259
Our sister shows Seeker and TestTube News
are covering this story today also.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.189
Even though we outlined the data, we left
it to TestTube News to answer, why are there

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:12.460
so many mass shootings?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:22.699
[soundup] Thanks for watching DNews, please
subscribe, if you had a conversation with

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.099
your friends about why no one seems to care
about mass shootings, share this with them

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.520
and further the conversation.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.090
I'll see you tomorrow, thanks for watching
