00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.580
PABLO SUAREZ: At the Red
Cross/Red Crescent Climate

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.590
Center, our job is to help
others understand and address

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.140
what's going on
with climate change

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.890
and with extreme events--
hurricanes, typhoons, too

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.450
much rainfall,
peak temperatures.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.860
And these things
are complicated.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.080
This science is complex.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.240
And how to turn
science into action

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.880
is not easy if you're
too busy to learn.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.280
Most of our colleagues in
the humanitarian sector

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.680
are insanely busy.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.380
When science is communicated,
it is very often

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.290
either incomprehensible
or difficult

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.420
to link to ongoing
humanitarian processes.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.570
So about six,
seven years ago, we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.750
started with creating
playful activities

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.790
where participants in a
workshop have to make decisions

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.540
that have consequences.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.200
And that's at the core of games.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.230
Games are systems where
you have to make a decision

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.107
with limited information.

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:01.690
You're trying to
accomplish something,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.430
and you don't really know what
may happen because there's

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.010
something in the system
that you don't control--

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.840
which can be the weather.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.470
It can be what other people do.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.190
It can be just you're not
fully understanding the system.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.240
In our experience as
humanitarian workers,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.160
trying to infuse awareness
of complexity into our work,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.870
games are the most wonderful
tool to wet the appetite,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.210
to make people want to learn
more and want to do better.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.550
It has been beautiful to
work with the MIT Game Lab.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.240
We have, as Red
Cross family, access

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.050
to a lot of talent, a lot
of enthusiastic brain power

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.880
that combines
analytical competence

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.740
with creative juices.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.830
That is prevalent in
the field of game design

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.890
and among students of games.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.760
What we find at MIT is
that it's much easier

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.600
to link to other departments
that are directly

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.850
connected to what we do.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.600
It can be about
environmental engineering.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.130
It can be about climate science.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.370
It can be about
technology development.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.740
So this partnership is
the beginning of something

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.170
that is inevitably going
to grow, to grow beautiful,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.040
to grow big.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.330
It was also really nice
to see how the MIT Game

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.760
Lab is well-connected
to other partners

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.010
that we have in the game design
sector, such as the Engagement

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.890
Lab at Emerson or the
PETLab team at Parsons,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.220
and the awareness of reach in
the world of serious games.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.320
Games that are not just
as a playful activity,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.100
but with the intention to
improve the world somehow.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.780
We could always do better as
partners of the academic team

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.820
if we could allocate more time.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.480
Unfortunately, it is in the very
nature of our Red Cross work

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.310
that we have to travel insanely.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.930
I was out of the country for
at least half of the time

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.310
when the course happened.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.840
So we did bring in partners
and friends who gave a hand.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.330
But I think one of
the key challenges

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.650
for this kind of partnership
between game related academia

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.480
and humanitarian
teams is to find

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.010
ways to interact more
frequently, more deeply,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.400
to learn about each other.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.290
We just don't know
how we can do more

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.840
with the limited time we have.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.880
When students engage
with partners, clients

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.330
from the real world,
it is not easy

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.920
for them to get into the
shoes of the institution

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.430
of the organization that has
to try to accomplish things.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.540
So one of the most
important things

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.490
that we can offer as
partners in this course

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.200
was to give a flavor of the
context in which the game would

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.210
be played.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.000
So we have the team working
on cholera prevention

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.620
in West Africa.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.950
And they developed
a video game that

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.050
had the flavor of
modern wealthy homes.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.100
And in West Africa, most of
our target audience-- if you're

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.839
trying to prevent cholera--
chances are they are poor,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.680
and the aesthetics
need to resonate.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.910
It can be about a
super stellar context,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.490
or it can be about
a thatched roof,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.120
but it should be something
that can evoke engagement

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.040
on the part of the player.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.940
And that's not easy for
students to find out.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.460
They actually have
to do research

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.410
on what does a home in
West Africa look like?

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.940
The other thing we can
do is to help narrow down

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.160
and focus on what matters to us
in terms of the gain in forming

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.470
better decisions, and to
weed away and filter out

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.900
all the things
that students want

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.590
to include because they can.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.440
But that's not a
good enough reason.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.277
Just the fact that it's
technically feasible

00:05:04.277 --> 00:05:06.610
or that you like it, doesn't
mean that it should make it

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.356
into the final prototype.

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:09.730
There were many
other things that

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.410
were a lot of fun in
terms of engagement

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.700
with students that I
think were useful to them.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.490
In particular, to
see how they could

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.350
get inspired by being aware of
how their technical competence

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.110
can be useful for development
work, for humanitarian work,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.360
for actually physically
saving lives in the long term,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.710
or to help people engage with
each other in other continents,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.110
in other contexts, in fields
that they don't even know,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.020
but they can help.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.810
When an academic team is
offering student brain power

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.440
and air time during a
course for an organization--

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.170
specifically in games
but also more broadly--

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.420
it is our experience
that it takes more time

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.350
than we think to
develop the relationship

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.540
and to understand how we can
really get juice out of it.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.230
And it is always worth starting.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.030
If the client organization, if
the partner-- like in our case,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.047
the Red Cross family--
can find someone

00:06:13.047 --> 00:06:15.630
who spends a little bit of time
at the beginning, a little bit

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.210
of time reviewing
prototypes, and some feedback

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.890
along the way, it's
definitely worth it.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.750
But don't expect
magic solutions.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.370
Don't expect people to be
able to read your mind.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.560
We come from
different universes.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.380
And we have an opportunity
to bring the real world

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.540
to academia.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.310
By just showing up
and spending time,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.420
but also to bring academic
brainpower, talent,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.590
and creativity into our work.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.370
One of the things that I have
to say with enormous pride

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.000
is that one of the
prototypes that

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.810
emerged from one of the
groups in this course

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.290
was actually used in
three global events

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.730
and helped hundreds
of people in real time

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.810
learn what was
being thought about.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.740
People entered three
words as individuals.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.620
There were 100 or more
people in the room,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.750
and everyone saw a word cloud
that emerged through very fun

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.560
game play.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.840
And this can really
help, but we need

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.500
to be aware of the time
it takes to mature.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.110
We have been working
with game designers

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.290
for at least six years.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.040
And that really helped
us channel our energy

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.300
in a more narrowly defined way.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.960
Otherwise, it's very easy to go
broad and to be disappointed.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.720
Be prepared to acknowledge
your own limitations,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120
but be prepared to explore
the space of possibility.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.350
So the game Snap is
already ready to deploy--

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.390
has been deployed.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.650
I hope we can refine the user
interface to give more choices

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.170
to the facilitator and so on.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.610
But that is one
game that I predict

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.070
will be able to change the
way real-world events happen.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.450
I have that admission.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.320
I think we can do
something with it.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.870
Of the many other
games that were good

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.830
because they were more
about a subject matter that

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.170
is outside of Cambridge,
Massachusetts,

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.460
they will take more
time to refine.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.520
I'm very excited about the
Cholera game, which we now

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.650
have a partnership with UNICEF.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.490
And we anticipate the
demand from UNICEF Guinea,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.780
in particular, to try
to add digital flavors

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.360
to their relationship to
schoolchildren in prevention

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.460
of anything-- in
promotion of the things

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.330
that help-- like hand
washing with soap,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.789
which we take for granted here.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.350
But in other parts of
the world, they just

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.409
have to choose
between soap and food.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.220
It's hard to make that case.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.060
And some of the other game
prototypes have very insightful

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.640
game mechanics-- how to display
territory in a small screen.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.910
How to display quantities
for decisions in terms

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.480
of disaster preparedness.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.670
The representation on a game
on heat wave of how people

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.920
can just collapse
if they think they

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.190
can just go out and walk on
an excessively sunny, hot day.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.020
These are things that
are there, are latent,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.550
and we have opportunities
to work deeper

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.280
either with these students or
with future students of MIT

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.250
and beyond.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.670
They will need more
time to refine.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.010
And we have, as Red
Cross, more work

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:30.000
to do in terms of identifying
the potential player

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.070
and identifying what are the
decisions that can be improved,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.890
or what are the discussions
that can be enriched by engaging

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.285
in this game experience.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.070
From the Red Cross/Red
Crescent Climate Center

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.830
and from the
humanitarian family,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.110
I hereby thank profusely
the MIT Game Lab,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.160
and by extension,
game designers that

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.770
have helped us become
partners with you

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:04.360
now, for setting up a space
where we can learn how

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.260
magically powerful but
analytically clear game play

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.660
can be to help accomplish
humanitarian goals.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.590
Thank you so much.
