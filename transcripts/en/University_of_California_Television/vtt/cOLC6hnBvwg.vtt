00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:12.986
- Somebody asked me last week,

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:16.387
"You usually have themes
for these conferences."

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:19.269
Last year was realizing your potential.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.517
The year before that
we had a birthday party

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:25.600
for the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the ADA.

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.062
This year it's A to Z.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.117
Tomorrow there's more about
autism and spectrum disorders.

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.674
Now we start the Z part,

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.430
which is a panel on Zika virus,

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:55.036
and many or most of the
disabilities associated

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:59.119
with Zika infection have
to do with disabilities.

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.488
Since our planning and advisory committee,

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:04.654
and thank you to all the planning

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:08.732
and advisory committee
members who are here,

00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:12.501
recommended on behalf
of the regional centers

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.813
and parents and families
that there's a lot of concern

00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:20.313
about Zika and its various considerations.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.464
So we have gotten together a panel

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:28.464
of experts and we're starting where,

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.062
I guess we should start with obstetrics.

00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:42.725
We are pleased to have our
first member of the panel,

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.855
Dr. Kirsten Salmeen, who's
an Assistant Professor

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:50.060
of Obstetrics, Gynecology
and Reproductive Sciences

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.227
at the Division of
Maternal-Fetal Medicine at UCSF.

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:59.219
Kirsten, thank you for joining us.

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:01.733
- Thank you.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.061
Thank you very much for the opportunity

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:05.572
to talk with you all today.

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.989
It's a real honor to be here.

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:14.137
I have no financial disclosures to make.

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.168
The three take-home points that I'm hoping

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:20.497
to leave you all with in
the next 20 minutes or so

00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:22.572
are seen up on the screen there.

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:25.145
The first is that we know with the caveat

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.559
that we never really know
anything completely in medicine,

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.216
be we know that prenatal
Zika virus exposure

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:33.556
causes fetal injury.

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:35.370
We know that there are
considerable challenges

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.203
in prenatal testing and diagnosis,

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:42.094
so identifying an impact
on a fetus prenatally

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:43.844
is quite challenging.

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.760
I'm going to challenge
everybody who interacts

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.147
with pregnant patients or
future pregnant patients

00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:51.235
that our obligations for these patients

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:54.460
are to advise, screen and test, support,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.535
and advocate about the impacts
of Zika virus in pregnancy.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.127
A very brief word on background,

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:01.688
and you'll hear more about
this from the other speakers,

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:03.866
but just to get everybody
oriented to Zika.

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:06.675
If you are like me, a year and a half ago

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:10.520
you had never heard of the Zika virus.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.520
In Brazil in fall of 2015
lots of health workers

00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:20.213
in Northeast Brazil started to notice

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:22.535
increased rates of
microcephaly in newborns,

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.308
which started to get people thinking about

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.415
what the causes could
be and working backwards

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.228
people started to notice
that there was this outbreak

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:30.645
of Zika virus in May of 2015.

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:33.706
Zika virus isn't new.

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:37.391
It was first identified
in 1947 in the Zika Forest

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:41.428
in Uganda, which is why
it's called the Zika virus.

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:43.726
The first human cases were in the 1950s.

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.151
Really, since the fall
of 2015 we sort of seen

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.591
Zika virus explode on the scene.

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:51.761
As of today, we have
Zika virus transmission

00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.511
in the United States in
Texas and in Florida.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.085
The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus.

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:01.873
It is in the Flavivirus family,

00:04:01.873 --> 00:04:03.896
and it's similar to dengue, West Nile,

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:06.570
yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.469
This similarity is part of
why it can be challenging

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.442
to make a prenatal diagnosis.

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.234
The primary mode of
transmission is by mosquitoes.

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:18.905
Far and away the most
common form of transmission.

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.606
However, maternal to fetal
transmission is also an issue,

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:23.572
hence why I'm here.

00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:25.517
Sexual transmission
has also been reported,

00:04:25.517 --> 00:04:28.017
although is less of a concern.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:30.991
Then there's also the theoretic concern

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:32.757
about transmission via blood transfusion,

00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:34.770
laboratory exposures, and transplants,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.565
although there have been
vanishingly few reported

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:40.271
cases transmitted in those fashions.

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.854
As of February 1, 2017
in the United States

00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:47.314
the number of pregnant
women with laboratory

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:50.548
evidence of Zika virus infection,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.944
in the States, it's around 1,400.

00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:54.665
In U.S. Territories,
which primarily includes

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:57.497
Puerto Rico, which is the
biggest area, is about 3,000.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.277
We've seen 38 liveborn
infants in the United States

00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:04.071
with birth defects thought to
be attributed to Zika virus,

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.118
and five reported pregnancy losses,

00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:07.346
although, of course, that's very hard

00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:09.346
to track pregnancy loss.

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:14.224
Transitioning now to how we
know that prenatal Zika virus

00:05:14.224 --> 00:05:16.478
really causes fetal injury.

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:18.137
When we think about how we know

00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:19.806
that something harms a fetus,

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:21.411
in the business we sort of think about

00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:23.216
these Shepard's Criteria.

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:26.799
These are seven criteria
that were outlined

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:29.280
first published in the 1990s,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.024
but sort of evolved over time,

00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:34.207
how we know something
has an impact on a fetus.

00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:35.788
These criteria are what's required.

00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:37.847
So first, a proven exposure to an agent

00:05:37.847 --> 00:05:40.391
at a critical time during pregnancy.

00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:44.137
Consistent findings in high
quality epidemiologic studies.

00:05:44.137 --> 00:05:46.819
Careful delineation of a clinical case.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.552
Rare environmental exposure associated

00:05:48.552 --> 00:05:51.979
with a rare defect that allows
us to make that association.

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.809
Teratogenicity in an experimental model.

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.158
We like that, but it's not essential.

00:05:57.158 --> 00:05:59.910
The association has to
make sense biologically.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.592
Ideally there's proof in
an experimental system

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.829
that the agent acts in an unaltered state,

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.327
meaning that we actually see
the agent causes problems.

00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:10.125
Starting with some
epidemiological evidence

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.777
that Zika virus causes fetal injury.

00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:16.155
These are the earliest
reports out of Brazil

00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:20.646
looking at rates of microcephaly
in their population.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.892
This is sort of what
the baseline rates were,

00:06:22.892 --> 00:06:24.419
and I'll talk about
this a little bit later,

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.586
but microcephaly isn't a new finding.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.750
Many fetuses are affected by microcephaly,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.204
but these were microcephaly
rates in Brazil.

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:34.209
Up until 2014 some were in the ballpark

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:35.966
of five to six per 100,000.

00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:37.617
The first reports of autochthonous,

00:06:37.617 --> 00:06:40.439
meaning spread by mosquitoes in that area,

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.522
not acquired from travel,

00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:47.734
happened right around here
in the spring of 2015.

00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:51.751
By the end of 2015 their rates
were around 100 per 100,000.

00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:55.194
And actually were probably
closer to 250 per 100,000.

00:06:55.194 --> 00:06:58.052
So really dramatic uptick in the numbers.

00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:00.844
Even if this was just reporting bias,

00:07:00.844 --> 00:07:04.094
it still is kind of too much to ignore.

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.434
Other epidemiological evidence
has come out since that time.

00:07:07.434 --> 00:07:11.467
These are two papers that were published

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.944
in follow-up to that Zika
outbreak that happened

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:17.436
in French-Polynesia that demonstrated

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.854
significant increase in
rates of microcephaly

00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:21.604
after Zika epidemics.

00:07:23.388 --> 00:07:25.921
In that Cauchemez study,
the Zika-associated risk

00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:29.432
of microcephaly was estimated
to be around 95 per 10,000

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:32.200
versus a baseline of two per 10,000.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.897
The Besnard study demonstrated
a 14-fold increase

00:07:34.897 --> 00:07:36.933
in congenital microcephaly,

00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:40.106
and a 31-fold increase
in brainstem dysfunction.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:43.782
So mounting epidemiologic evidence.

00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:47.161
Moving on to the delineation
of clinical cases.

00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:48.676
As this evidence started to come out,

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:51.665
and people started to
publish case reports,

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:53.828
these findings were what
were pretty consistently

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:55.785
associated with women who had been exposed

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:58.294
to Zika virus during pregnancy.

00:07:58.294 --> 00:08:01.458
Microcephaly, cortical
brain malformations,

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:04.665
so abnormalities of the white matter.

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:07.986
Abnormalities of the posterior
fossa and cerebellum.

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.767
Ventriculomegaly, enlargement of those

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:12.548
fluid-filled spaces in the brain.

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:14.611
Intracranial calcifications.

00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:16.293
Ophthalmologic abnormalities,

00:08:16.293 --> 00:08:19.837
growth restriction, and fetal death.

00:08:19.837 --> 00:08:22.059
I said I'd speak for a
moment about microcephaly.

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:23.782
I think it's important
to note that microcephaly

00:08:23.782 --> 00:08:27.031
by itself is not a new diagnosis.

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:29.524
Strictly speaking it means small head,

00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:33.696
but the real problem is
the underlying small brain

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:38.462
and abnormal brain structures
that result in this smallness.

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:40.717
Even still now in the United States

00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:42.803
and countries that aren't
having a lot Zika problems,

00:08:42.803 --> 00:08:44.763
the most common causes of microcephaly

00:08:44.763 --> 00:08:47.295
are genetic abnormalities or differences,

00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:51.012
infections like CMV is a very common cause

00:08:51.012 --> 00:08:53.819
of microcephaly prenatally.

00:08:53.819 --> 00:08:57.130
Exposures to things like
alcohol and substances.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.614
It's defined as having a
newborn head circumference

00:08:59.614 --> 00:09:02.285
greater than two standard
deviations below the mean.

00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:04.269
And again, is associated
with small brain volume,

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:06.423
seizures, intellectual disabilities,

00:09:06.423 --> 00:09:08.470
cognitive differences, motor disabilities,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.543
and behavioral problems.

00:09:10.543 --> 00:09:13.089
The exact cause of microcephaly probably

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:17.292
has more impact on the outcome
than the microcephaly itself.

00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:19.599
The parts of the brain that are involved

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:22.230
are important for exactly what

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.354
the phenotypic appearance is.

00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:28.654
But this entity by itself isn't new.

00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:31.412
Continuing on with those
Shepard's Criteria,

00:09:31.412 --> 00:09:33.852
the rare exposure rare effect.

00:09:33.852 --> 00:09:36.122
We saw lots of clinical
evidence and continue to see

00:09:36.122 --> 00:09:38.914
more clinical evidence
that fetuses and newborns

00:09:38.914 --> 00:09:42.153
among mothers living in
or traveling to areas

00:09:42.153 --> 00:09:44.704
where Zika virus was being transmitted

00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:47.289
have been found to consistently
have these findings.

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:49.015
And probably most importantly,

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:52.405
Zika virus was isolated from tissue,

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:55.211
from pregnancy losses, amniotic fluid,

00:09:55.211 --> 00:10:00.077
and newborn serum and urine,
as well as CNS tissues.

00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:02.818
So that association of the
rare exposure rare effect

00:10:02.818 --> 00:10:05.151
was pretty well established.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.058
In more recent publications,
so this is from late 2016,

00:10:11.058 --> 00:10:13.465
there was a couple of
more compelling cases

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:14.918
that really sealed the
deal in the association

00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:17.594
of Zika and fetal injury.

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:20.577
This Franca study was a case
series that looked at 1,500

00:10:20.577 --> 00:10:22.587
cases of reported microcephaly.

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:25.562
In other words, a delivering
clinician reported

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:29.047
that the newborn head
measurements were not normal.

00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:32.756
And of those 1,500, 602 had
actual evidence of Zika virus.

00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:34.748
A large number of those actually ended up

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.677
not being true microcephaly.

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:40.318
But there were 600 cases that
had evidence of Zika virus.

00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:43.083
Those women who had evidence
of Zika virus exposure

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:45.738
had newborns with smaller
heads circumferences,

00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:49.122
pretty considerably higher
first-week mortalities.

00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:51.289
So 51 versus 14 per 1,000.

00:10:52.383 --> 00:10:55.245
Many more women reporting
rashes during pregnancy,

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:58.404
so 60% versus about 20%.

00:10:58.404 --> 00:11:00.108
And multiple brain abnormalities

00:11:00.108 --> 00:11:02.148
despite normal head sizes.

00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:04.101
I think this is the point that caught many

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:06.653
of our attention from
a prenatal perspective,

00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:09.400
is that these children seemed
to have brain abnormalities

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.546
even with normal head measurements,

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.252
making it seem like prenatal diagnosis

00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:15.147
got even more challenging.

00:11:15.147 --> 00:11:17.515
This study by de Araujo and colleagues

00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:18.902
was a case control study.

00:11:18.902 --> 00:11:21.114
So looking at 32 cases of microcephaly,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.868
and 62 controls with
normal head measurements.

00:11:24.868 --> 00:11:27.966
Demonstrated an odds ratio
for Zika virus exposure

00:11:27.966 --> 00:11:31.421
of about 55, with a
95% confidence interval

00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:33.589
between 8.6 and infinity.

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:36.708
Before I read this study I
had never seen an infinite

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.930
top-end of a confidence interval.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.855
Then in cases with brain abnormalities,

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:44.999
that odds ratio was
about 113, meaning there

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.477
is a very, very, very strong correlation

00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:50.931
between Zika exposure and
these newborn abnormalities.

00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:52.872
Just for reference,
the association between

00:11:52.872 --> 00:11:54.514
smoking and lung cancer,

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.275
the odds ratio is somewhere
around five or six,

00:11:56.275 --> 00:11:58.591
eight, 10 depending on
the study that you read.

00:11:58.591 --> 00:12:01.848
So this was pretty compelling.

00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:04.304
This is the final large cohort study,

00:12:04.304 --> 00:12:06.372
looking at Zika positive versus

00:12:06.372 --> 00:12:10.071
Zika negative infants and outcomes.

00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:13.378
Looking at this total
adverse infant outcome,

00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:15.712
which is a composite of
many of these things,

00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:17.596
demonstrated that Zika positive women

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:20.781
had about a 42% risk of adverse outcomes,

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:24.948
versus about 5% of unexposed
or Zika negative women.

00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:30.508
The biologic plausibility
is also very compelling.

00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:32.805
We know that this exists
from other TORCH infections,

00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:35.232
so that infectious diseases
can cause fetal injury

00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:37.565
is not a new concept for us.

00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.464
We also know that Zika virus
demonstrates neurotropism,

00:12:41.464 --> 00:12:44.060
meaning the Zika virus is able to attack

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.575
and does preferentially attack cells

00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:48.640
of the developing nervous system.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.411
So those cells that are normal
when infected by Zika virus

00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:53.769
become abnormal and we've seen this

00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:56.102
is mouse and primate models.

00:12:57.473 --> 00:12:59.536
Shepard's Criteria are really met,

00:12:59.536 --> 00:13:01.239
and as a consequence we
can feel quite confident

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:05.157
that Zika virus really
does cause fetal injury.

00:13:05.157 --> 00:13:07.640
Testing and diagnosis
is really challenging.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.609
So moving on to that
second take-home point.

00:13:10.609 --> 00:13:12.510
The clinical presentation of Zika virus

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.238
is really tricky about 20 to 40% of people

00:13:15.238 --> 00:13:17.546
remember having symptoms.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:20.570
So most are infected and don't recognize

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.378
that they have symptoms or
are totally asymptomatic.

00:13:23.378 --> 00:13:25.492
It's a mild febrile illness.

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:27.291
The maculopapular rash
doesn't affect everybody

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.576
and can go relatively unnoticed.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.240
It looks really similar to lots of other

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.839
arthopod-borne illnesses.

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:35.691
So in areas where dengue is common,

00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:37.201
it looks a lot like dengue,

00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:38.552
although less severe.

00:13:38.552 --> 00:13:40.969
So it's easy to go unnoticed.

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:43.633
The recommended testing for pregnant women

00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:45.512
is really complex.

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:48.730
Currently only IgM testing is available.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.730
There is no IgG testing.

00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:54.079
So keeping in mind that
IgG is able to tell us

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:56.836
longer term historic exposure versus IgM

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.753
which tells us this acute exposure.

00:14:00.754 --> 00:14:02.960
So testing with IgM
has to be done, really,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.286
within 12 weeks of exposure,

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:08.719
which necessitates knowing
when that exposure happened.

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:10.811
IgG testing is not available.

00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:13.279
And there's a pretty
considerable overlap with the IgM

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:16.555
testing for dengue, chikungunya,

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:20.600
other similar arthopod-borne illnesses.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.044
Women who have a positive
IgM test for Zika virus

00:14:24.044 --> 00:14:25.898
have to have confirmatory testing,

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.432
which currently is only done by the CDC,

00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:31.099
and takes quite some time to do.

00:14:32.048 --> 00:14:34.631
PCR testing, or actual
testing for the virus,

00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:37.527
is now available for urine and blood,

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:40.557
but does not stay positive indefinitely.

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:42.861
We're still really trying
to understand how long

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:47.028
it is able to stay positive
or definitely stays positive.

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:50.699
Amniocentesis, or taking
fluid from around the fetus,

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:54.115
and testing for Zika virus is an option.

00:14:54.115 --> 00:14:56.320
But we really don't have a
great sense of false-positive

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.103
and false-negative rates.

00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:00.543
False-positive is probably quite unlikely,

00:15:00.543 --> 00:15:03.963
however a positive test in a mother,

00:15:03.963 --> 00:15:08.068
or a positive test in a
fetus doesn't then guarantee

00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:11.075
translation to an affected fetus.

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.627
So an infected mother and
fetus doesn't necessarily

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:16.711
mean that that child is
affected by the Zika virus

00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:18.959
and we don't really know the conditions

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.510
under which that's the case.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.783
There are a lot of complicated algorithms.

00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:26.280
The CDC has done a good job
of keeping us up-to-date,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.108
but presently what we recommend is that

00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:30.920
symptomatic pregnant women
who have been exposed

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.500
get PCR testing up to two weeks
after their symptom onset.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.263
Asymptomatic pregnant women
who have been exposed,

00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:40.477
which means either traveling to an area

00:15:40.477 --> 00:15:43.042
where Zika virus has been transmitted,

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:46.603
or having unexposed sex
with a person who's traveled

00:15:46.603 --> 00:15:49.706
to an area where Zika
virus is transmitted,

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:53.039
are recommended to have anti-IgM testing

00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:56.643
being two and 12 weeks after the last date

00:15:56.643 --> 00:15:58.580
of possible exposure,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.673
and then PCR testing within two weeks.

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:05.840
Women who have negative PCR,
but who have a positive IgM

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.886
have to have their blood sent to the CDC

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:10.599
for confirmatory testing.

00:16:10.599 --> 00:16:13.330
So it's a process that
takes quite some time.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.049
We do use ultrasound,

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.084
especially in very highly developed areas,

00:16:17.084 --> 00:16:18.889
where we have lots of
access to ultrasound.

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:22.358
We do ultrasounds to monitor and evaluate.

00:16:22.358 --> 00:16:24.172
We do serial ultrasounds over the course

00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:27.246
of the third trimester to watch.

00:16:27.246 --> 00:16:30.178
But again, only some Zika
virus-affected fetuses

00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:32.261
have ultrasound findings.

00:16:33.277 --> 00:16:35.353
Non-Zika virus affected fetuses

00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:37.570
may have abnormal ultrasounds.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.051
So we can't be certain with ultrasound

00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.625
that what we're seeing is Zika-related.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.646
We can't be certain that a fetus
that has a normal appearing

00:16:43.646 --> 00:16:47.285
ultrasound wasn't affected by Zika virus.

00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:49.415
Ultrasound findings can be quite subtle.

00:16:49.415 --> 00:16:53.582
Microcephaly is a little bit
of a challenging diagnosis.

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:57.801
We suspect it when the
fetal head measurements

00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:59.696
are less than two standard deviations

00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:03.088
below the mean for gestational age.

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.877
We diagnosis it definitively
when the size is more

00:17:05.877 --> 00:17:08.722
than four to five standard
deviations below the mean.

00:17:08.722 --> 00:17:11.778
But fetal head measurements
are a little bit subjective.

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:13.827
They're very dependent
on maternal habitus.

00:17:13.827 --> 00:17:15.486
How well we're able to see,

00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:17.802
the position of the fetus.

00:17:17.802 --> 00:17:19.200
So although we can be quite certain when

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.606
there's profound microcephaly,

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:23.578
it's hard to be certain when
there is a small degrade.

00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:25.894
The other abnormalities there are variable

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:29.030
in terms of how easy they are to see.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.327
Fetal Brain MRI is a tool
with great potential,

00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:34.414
but is really only available
in very high-resourced places,

00:17:34.414 --> 00:17:36.753
with a very sub-specialized care.

00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:38.808
So it really isn't ubiquitously available.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.681
We do here and a couple of other centers

00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:42.376
in the United States and around the world.

00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:45.572
But it's not particularly accessible.

00:17:45.572 --> 00:17:48.513
Lastly the final point
here is that as health care

00:17:48.513 --> 00:17:50.759
providers I think our role at this point

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:54.926
are to advise, screen and test,
support, and then advocate.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:59.378
I think that we really should
be advising pregnant women

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.377
and those who are planning
a pregnancy to try

00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:04.636
and avoid areas where Zika
virus is being transmitted.

00:18:04.636 --> 00:18:08.221
If avoiding travel is not an option,

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:11.458
the recommendation is to use FDA-approved

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.480
mosquito repellents, protective clothing,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.184
staying indoors when possible.

00:18:16.184 --> 00:18:19.370
Condom use, if a partner
has traveled is recommended,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.641
really for a pregnant women throughout

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.141
the entirety of her pregnancy.

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:26.274
We strongly suggest
contraception for those

00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:27.978
who are not wanting to conceive,

00:18:27.978 --> 00:18:29.651
which is a big problem
is some of the parts

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.030
of the world where Zika virus

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.612
is being transmitted really actively.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.595
The current recommendation
is that women wait

00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:38.575
at least eight weeks
after a potential exposure

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.242
to try and conceive.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.429
Although there's a very,
very, very recent paper

00:18:43.429 --> 00:18:45.243
in the New England Journal that suggests

00:18:45.243 --> 00:18:47.735
that that may need to be
expanded a little bit longer.

00:18:47.735 --> 00:18:49.843
Then for male partners, the recommendation

00:18:49.843 --> 00:18:52.137
is to wait at least six
months before trying

00:18:52.137 --> 00:18:54.091
to conceive because Zika
virus has been identified

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:58.370
in semen for up to six
months after exposure.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.670
Yeah, that's a long time.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.410
(group laughter)

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.752
That doesn't mean you can't
have sex for six months.

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:06.325
It just means you shouldn't
get pregnant for six months.

00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:08.609
Screening and testing.

00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:10.286
So screening for exposure,

00:19:10.286 --> 00:19:12.874
and this is a big deal within
our prenatal populations.

00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:14.975
It's interesting, Zika's not
really in the paper anymore.

00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:17.362
It's not on TV, too many
other things on TV right now.

00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:19.512
(group laughter)

00:19:19.512 --> 00:19:21.123
So it's sort of fallen off the radar,

00:19:21.123 --> 00:19:22.366
and patients are becoming a lot more

00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:24.588
lackadaisical about travel.

00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:26.372
So we really feel like it's our job to

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:29.070
continue to advise women
about avoiding travel

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.987
and unprotected sex.

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:33.610
Using those testing
algorithms and considering

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.433
an electronic health
record is what we've done

00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:37.809
in our practice to trigger
questions about travel,

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.415
so we know who to screen.

00:19:40.415 --> 00:19:42.477
From a support perspective,

00:19:42.477 --> 00:19:44.112
I think we spend the
vast majority of our time

00:19:44.112 --> 00:19:46.067
reassuring the worried well.

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:47.655
Those numbers in the beginning say there's

00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:50.382
really still quite infrequent
cases in the United States,

00:19:50.382 --> 00:19:54.549
but being thoughtful about
who we're counseling how.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.468
For those women who are high
risk for fetal infections,

00:19:58.468 --> 00:20:02.635
so women who test positive,
who have ultrasound findings,

00:20:03.872 --> 00:20:06.213
providing patient-preference
centered counseling

00:20:06.213 --> 00:20:07.616
is very, very important.

00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:09.513
Talking about the lack of predictability,

00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:10.896
of the impacts of Zika,

00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:13.912
the potential for a
broad range of outcomes,

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:16.572
the challenges with knowing
how this looks in the longterm,

00:20:16.572 --> 00:20:18.336
because this is still relatively new,

00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:21.160
all need to factor into this discussion.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.060
For those who are choosing
expectant management,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.544
we recommend serial
ultrasounds, antenatal testing,

00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:28.445
and providing resources,
counseling, and support.

00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:30.119
This perhaps is an
audience that can tell me

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:32.685
a lot more about that than I can speak to.

00:20:32.685 --> 00:20:34.659
For those families who make
the decision to consider

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:37.473
pregnancy termination providing
those support services

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:40.399
and options when appropriate.

00:20:40.399 --> 00:20:42.565
Last but not least, I
think it's our obligation

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:44.430
to really advocate.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.259
Advocating for vaccine development,

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:48.087
for vector control, for education,

00:20:48.087 --> 00:20:51.924
for family planning, for
surveillance, for support.

00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:53.609
We are sort of the people
who carry the torch

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:55.229
for trying to advocate for the patients

00:20:55.229 --> 00:20:57.768
who are being affected by this.

00:20:57.768 --> 00:21:00.337
I think we're obliged to advocate
from a policy perspective.

00:21:00.337 --> 00:21:01.936
So advocating for the importance

00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:04.114
of family planning services.

00:21:04.114 --> 00:21:05.887
There's some evidence that up to half

00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:08.060
of reproductive-aged women in Brazil

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.405
are at least trying to
avoid pregnancy right now

00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:12.198
because of Zika virus.

00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:15.516
But contraceptive services in
that area are really limited.

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:17.357
Vector control strategies,

00:21:17.357 --> 00:21:20.537
then advocating for strategies
to really stay up-to-date.

00:21:20.537 --> 00:21:22.353
This is changing very quickly

00:21:22.353 --> 00:21:25.950
and staying up-to-speed
is really important.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.929
To conclude my portion here, again,

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:31.390
prenatal Zika virus exposure
causes fetal injury.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.619
We're nearly certain of that.

00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:35.992
Prenatal testing and diagnosis
is really challenging

00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:38.602
and I think our roles are
advising, testing and screening,

00:21:38.602 --> 00:21:40.906
support and advocate.

00:21:40.906 --> 00:21:41.949
I think that there's a bunch

00:21:41.949 --> 00:21:43.439
that we still really don't know,

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:45.784
so we really don't know the
probability of an affected

00:21:45.784 --> 00:21:48.517
fetus and an infected mother.

00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:51.347
That's still, we really
need to learn a lot about.

00:21:51.347 --> 00:21:53.411
We really don't know about
the long-term implications

00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.170
for these children.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.614
We don't know about ameliorating
or exacerbating factors.

00:21:57.614 --> 00:21:59.256
It still seems unusual that this is mostly

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:03.281
in Northeast Brazil where the
most significant impacts are.

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:06.407
We really don't know the
kind of economic, social,

00:22:06.407 --> 00:22:07.511
and other consequences.

00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:09.110
So I think that's more to come.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.040
So I'll wrap up with that and
pass on to my next panelist.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.945
(group applause)

00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:13.778
Thank you.
