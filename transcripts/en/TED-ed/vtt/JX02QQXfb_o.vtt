00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.802
A sky blue canvas ripped open 
by an enormous skull.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:15.650
Teeth bared through visceral slashes 
of oil and spray-paint.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.011
In 2017,

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:22.628
this untitled artwork was auctioned 
off for over 110 million dollars.

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.321
But it’s not the work of some old master.

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.522
These strokes of genius

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:31.252
belong to 21 year old 
black Brooklynite Jean-Michel Basquiat –

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:33.617
one of America’s most 
charismatic painters,

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.033
and currently, its highest sold.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.525
Born in 1960 to a Haitian father 
and a Puerto Rican mother,

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.930
Basquiat spent his childhood making art 
and mischief in Boerum Hill.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.595
While he never attended art school,

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:47.942
he learned by wandering 
through New York galleries,

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.415
and listening to the music 
his father played at home.

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:53.197
He drew inspiration from 
unexpected places,

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:57.544
scribbling his own versions of cartoons, 
comic books and biblical scenes

00:00:57.544 --> 00:01:00.302
on scrap paper from his father’s office.

00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:02.688
But it was a medical encyclopedia 
that arguably

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.198
exerted the most powerful
influence on Basquiat.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:08.621
When young Jean-Michael was hit by a car,

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:12.155
his mother brought a copy of 
"Grey’s Anatomy" to his hospital bed.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.825
It ignited a lifelong fascination 
with anatomy

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.864
that manifested in the skulls, 
sinew and guts of his later work –

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:23.698
which frequently explores both the power 
and vulnerability of marginalized bodies.

00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:29.177
By 17, he launched his first foray into 
the art world with his friend Al Diaz.

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:33.081
They spray painted cryptic statements 
and symbols all over Lower Manhattan,

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:36.180
signed with the mysterious moniker SAMO.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.299
These humorous, profound, 
and rebellious declarations

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.256
were strategically scattered 
throughout Soho’s art scene.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:44.550
And after revealing himself as the artist,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.331
Basquiat leveraged SAMO’s success 
to enter the scene himself;

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.591
selling postcards, playing clubs with
his avant-garde band,

00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:53.730
and boldly seeking out his heroes.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.361
By 21, he’d turned to painting full time.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:59.449
His process was a sort of 
calculated improvisation.

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:00.456
Like Beat writers

00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:03.919
who composed their work by shredding 
and reassembling scraps of writing,

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:07.662
Basquiat used similar cut-up techniques 
to remix his materials.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:09.266
When he couldn't afford canvases,

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:12.309
he fashioned them out of discarded 
wood he found on the street.

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.491
He used oil stick, crayons, 
spray paint and pencil

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.961
and pulled quotes from the menus, 
comic books and textbooks

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:22.179
he kept open on the studio floor.

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.697
He kept these sources open 
on his studio floor,

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:27.306
often working on multiple 
projects at once.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:31.068
Pulling in splintered anatomy, 
reimagined historical scenes,

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:34.452
and skulls transplanted from 
classical still-lives,

00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:38.874
Basquiat repurposed both present day 
experiences and art history

00:02:38.874 --> 00:02:41.393
into an inventive visual language.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:45.259
He worked as if inserting himself into 
the legacy of artists he borrowed from,

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.836
producing collages that were just as 
much in conversation with art history

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:50.628
as they were with each other.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:54.202
For instance,
"Toussaint L’Overture versus Savonarola"

00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:57.382
and "Undiscovered Genius of the 
Mississippi Delta"

00:02:57.384 --> 00:03:02.002
offer two distinct visions of Basquiat’s 
historical and contemporary concerns.

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:04.120
But they echo each other in the details,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.423
such as the reappearing head that 
also resurfaces in "PPCD."

00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:11.439
All these pieces form a network
that offers physical evidence

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.405
of Basquiat’s restless and prolific mind.

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.400
These chaotic canvases won 
rapid acclaim and attention.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.748
But despite his increasingly 
mainstream audience,

00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:22.513
Basquiat insisted on depicting 
challenging themes

00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:24.551
of identity and oppression.

00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:29.402
Marginalized figures take center stage, 
such as prisoners, cooks and janitors.

00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:32.881
His obsession with bodies, history, 
and representation

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:36.891
can be found in works evoking the 
Atlantic slave trade and African history,

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:40.880
as well as pieces focusing on 
contemporary race relations.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.075
In less than a decade,

00:03:42.075 --> 00:03:44.604
Basquiat made thousands of 
paintings and drawings-

00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:47.959
along with sculpture, fragments 
of poetry and music.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.635
His output accelerated alongside 
his meteoric rise to fame,

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:54.086
but his life and work were 
cut tragically short

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:57.706
when he died from a drug overdose 
at the age of 27.

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:01.183
After his death,
Basquiat’s work only increased in value-

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:03.238
but the energy and flair of his pieces

00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:06.073
have impacted much more than their 
financial worth.

00:04:06.073 --> 00:04:11.567
Today, his influence swirls around us in 
music, poetry, fashion and film-

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:17.347
and his art retains the power to 
shock, inspire, and get under our skin.
