Hi, I'm Chris Nesladek,

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:07.534
and I'm speaking
at Google I/O this year.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:09.901
The topic of my presentation
is entitled

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:14.501
"How to Marry Interaction and
Visual Design the Android Way."

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:17.167
We've been really busy
working on Cupcake this year,

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.501
and our UI guidelines aren't
quite ready for distribution.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:22.534
However,
if you come to this talk,

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.667
you'll learn
how to think like a designer,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.834
not to mention
learn how to use

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:28.868
the templates,
assets, and behaviors

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.534
that we built
into the new framework.

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:33.133
So how are you going
to learn to be a designer?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.167
Well, I'm going to teach you

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.400
the three pillars
of interaction design:

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.968
you're going to learn
about structure,

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.434
you're going to learn
about behavior,

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.133
and you're going to learn
a little bit about expression.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.167
Let's take a look
at an example.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.734
Here in the new Gmail,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.400
the structure
is fairly established

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.534
where you can see that you
can select a message,

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:56.067
view that message,
or star it.

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:59.200
Now, if I actually choose
to select a message,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.434
the behavior that's
associated with that

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:04.968
by tapping the check box
is a button bar.

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.300
It comes up from the bottom
and allows the user

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.167
the ability to archive,
label, or delete

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.534
the messages
they have chosen.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:13.367
What ties this all together

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.901
is the expression layer.

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.868
The expression layer
tells me

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.634
that the three zones that
I've established as a designer

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:21.467
are available
to a user

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.567
through the use
of check boxes,

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.167
a standard list view
button element,

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.934
as well as
a "Favorites" star.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.667
I hope you'll join me
May 27th and 28th

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:33.868
in San Francisco

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:35.634
where you'll learn
to be a designer,

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:37.167
just like this.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.334
 Well...at least for a day.
