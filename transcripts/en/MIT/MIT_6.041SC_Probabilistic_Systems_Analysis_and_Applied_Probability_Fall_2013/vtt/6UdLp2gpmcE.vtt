00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.390
In this video, we'll look at an
example in which we compute

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.900
the expectation and cumulative
density function of a mixed

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.730
random variable.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.500
The problem is as follows.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.480
Al arrives at some bus stand
or taxi stand at a given

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.700
time-- let's say time
t equals 0.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.500
He finds a taxi waiting for him
with probability 2/3 in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
which he takes it.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.470
Otherwise, he takes the next
arriving taxi or bus.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.080
 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.540
The time that the next taxi
arrives between 0 and 10

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.742
minutes, and it's uniformly
distributed.

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:42.111
The next bus leaves exactly
in 5 minutes.

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:46.920
So the question is, if X is Al's
waiting time, what is the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.800
CDF and expectation of X?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.010
So one way to view this problem
that's convenient is

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.170
the tree structure.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.950
So I've drawn it for you here
in which the events of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.920
interest are B1, B2, and B3,
B1 being Al catches the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.370
waiting taxi, B2 being Al
catches the next taxi, which

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.460
arrives between 0 and 5 minutes,
and B3 being Al

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.290
catches the bus at the
time t plus 5.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.850
Notice that these three
events are disjoint.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.050
So Al catching the waiting taxi
means he can't catch the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.840
bus or the next arriving taxi.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920
And it also covers the entire
set of outcomes.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.550
So, in fact, B1, B2, and
B3 are a partition.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.845
So let's look at the relevant
probabilities.

00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:43.740
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.870
Whether or not B1 happens
depends on whether or not the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.710
taxi's waiting for Al.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.680
So if the taxi is waiting for
him, which happens with 2/3

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.950
probability, B1 happens.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.450
Otherwise, with 1/3 probability,
we see whether or

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.130
not a taxi is going to arrive
between 0 and 5 minutes.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.800
If it arrives, which is going
to happen with what

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.340
probability?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.160
Well, we know that the next
taxi is going to arrive

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.030
between 0 and 10 minutes
uniform.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610
It's a uniform distribution.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.300
And so half the mass is going
to be between 0 and 5.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.930
And the other half is going
to be between 5 and 10.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.050
And so this is going
to be 1/2 and 1/2.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.190
And let's look at what
X looks like.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.720
If B1 happens, Al isn't waiting
at all, so x is going

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.436
to be equal to 0.

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:41.950
If B3 happens, which is the
other easy case, Al's going to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.360
be waiting for 5 minutes
exactly.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.985
And if B2 happens, well, it's
going to be some value

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:50.640
between 0 and 5.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.828
We can actually draw the
density, so let's see if we

00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:55.070
can do that here.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:06.570
 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.895
The original next taxi was
uniformly distributed

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:14.204
between 0 and 10.

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:17.100
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.030
But now, we're told two
pieces of information.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.690
We're told that B2 happens,
which means that there's no

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.190
taxi waiting, and the
next taxi arrives

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.300
between 0 and 5 minutes.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300
Well, the fact that there was no
taxi waiting has no bearing

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.090
on that density.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.450
But the fact that the next taxi
arrives between 0 and 5

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.300
does make a difference, because
the density then is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.925
going to be definitely 0 in any
region outside 0 and 5.

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:45.070
Now, the question is, how
is it going to look

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.930
between 0 and 5?

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.440
Well, it's not going
to look crazy.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.800
It's not going to look like
something different.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.100
It's simply going to be a scale
version of the original

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.970
density between 0 and 5.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.185
You can verify this by looking
at the actual formula for when

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:07.550
you condition events on
a random variable.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.280
Here, it's going to be 1/5
in order for this to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.530
integrate out to 1.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.340
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.610
And now we can jump right into
figuring out the expectation.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.260
Now, notice that X is actually
a mixed random variable?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.060
What does that mean?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.820
Well, X either takes on values
according to either a discrete

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.040
probability law or
a continuous one.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.607
So if B1 happens, for example, X
is going to be exactly equal

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:35.660
to 0 with probability
1, which is a

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.200
discrete probability problem.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.480
On the other hand, if B2
happens, then the value of X

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.525
depends on the density, which
is going to be continuous.

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:48.960
So X is going to
be a continuous

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.730
random variable here.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.540
So how do you define an
expectation in this case?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:04.680
Well, you can do it so that
it satisfies the total

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.350
expectation theorem, which means
that the expectation of

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:18.320
X is the probability of B1 times
the expectation given B1

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:27.220
plus the probability of B2 times
the expectation given B2

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.121
plus the probability
of B3 times the

00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.220
expectation given B3.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.340
 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.530
So this will satisfy the total
expectation theorem.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.180
 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.436
So the probability of B1 is
going to be exactly 2/3.

00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:53.390
 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.320
It's simply the probability
of a taxi waiting for Al.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.442
The expected value of X-- well,
when B1 happens, X is

00:06:03.442 --> 00:06:04.970
going to be exactly
equal to 0.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.740
So the expected value is
also going to be 0.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.600
The probability of B2 happening
is the probability

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.050
of a taxi not being there times
the probability of a

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.520
taxi arriving between 0 and 5.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.650
It's going to be
1/3 times 1/2.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:29.420
And the expected value of X
given B2 is going to be the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.780
expected value of
this density.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.173
The expected value of this
density is the midpoint

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:35.770
between 0 and 5.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.670
And so it's going to be 5/2.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.470
 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.170
And the probability of B3 is
going to be 1/3 times 1/2.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.090
 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.260
Finally, the expected
value of X given B3.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.400
Well, when B3 happens,
X is going to be

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.250
exactly equal to 5.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.810
So the expected value is
also going to be 5.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:08.820
Now we're left with 5/12
plus 5/6, which

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.770
is going to be 15/12.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.526
 

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:19.290
And we can actually fill that
in here so that we can clear

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.650
up the board to do
the other part.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.980
 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:36.520
Now we want to compute the CDF
of X. Well, what is the CDF?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.120
Well, the CDF of X is going to
be equal to the probability

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.460
that the random variable
X is less than or equal

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.235
to some little x.

00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:48.650
It's a constant [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:55.120
Before we jump right in, let's
try to understand what's the

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.226
form of the CDF.

00:07:57.226 --> 00:08:00.220
And let's consider some
interesting cases.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.790
You know that the random
variable X, the waiting time,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.400
is going to be somewhere
between 0 and 5, right?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.230
So let's consider what happens
if little x is going to be

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.690
less than 0.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.410
That's basically saying, what's
the probability of the

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.160
random variable X being
less than some number

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.010
that's less than 0?

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.070
Waiting time can't be negative,
so the probablility

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.030
of this is going to be 0.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:37.400
Now, what if X is between
equaling 0 and

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.750
strictly less than 5?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.740
 

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.640
In that case, either X can fall
between 0 and 5 according

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.000
to this case, in the case
of B2, or X can be

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.760
exactly equal to 0.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.800
It's not clear.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.461
So let's do that later.

00:08:57.461 --> 00:08:58.980
Let's fill that in later.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:05.702
What about if x is greater
than or equal to 5?

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:07.130
Little x, right?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.600
That's the probability that the
random variable X is less

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.060
than some number that's bigger
than or equal to 5.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.733
The waiting time X, the random
variable, is definitely going

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:21.812
to be less than or equal to 5,
so the probability of this is

00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:23.062
going to be 1.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:27.130
 

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.160
So now this case.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.720
How do we do it?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.940
Well, let's try to use a similar
kind of approach that

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.940
we did for the expected value
and use the total probability

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.290
theorem in this case.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.350
So let's try to review this.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:51.960
First of all, let's assume that
this is true, that little

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.500
x is between 0 and
5, including 0.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.230
 

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:04.900
And let's use the total
probability theorem, and use

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.502
the partitions B1, B2, and B3.

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:34.080
 

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.770
So what's the probability
of B1?

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.300
It's the probability that Al
catches waiting taxi, which

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.890
happens with probability 2/3.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.600
 

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.460
What's the probability that the
random variable X, which

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.560
is less than or equal to little
x under this condition,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.220
when B1 happens?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.010
Well, if B1 happens, then random
variable X is going to

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.680
be exactly equal to 0, right?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.286
So in that case, it's definitely
going to be less

00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:11.630
than or equal to any value
of x, including 0.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.010
So the probability will be 1.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:21.280
What's the probability
that B2 happens now?

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.912
The probability that B2 happens
is 1/3 times 1/2, as

00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:26.162
we did before.

00:11:26.162 --> 00:11:29.500
 

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.220
And the probability that the
random variable X is less than

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.970
or equal to little x
when B2 happens.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.800
Well, if B2 happens, this
is your density.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.430
And this is our condition.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.980
And so x is going to
be somewhere in

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.330
between these spots.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.920
And we'd like to compute what's
the probably that

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.180
random variable X is less than
or equal to little x.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.470
So we want this area.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:59.980
And that area is going to have
height of 1/5 and width of x.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.580
And so the area's going
to be 1/5 times x.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.818
And finally, the probability
that B3 happens is going to be

00:12:08.818 --> 00:12:15.840
1/3 times 1/2 again times the
probability that the random

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.500
variable X is less than or equal
to little x given B3.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.216
Well, when B3 happens, X is
going to be exactly 5 as a

00:12:23.216 --> 00:12:24.650
random variable.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.440
But little x, you know-- we're
assuming in this condition--

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.920
is going to be between 0 and 5,
but strictly less than 5.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.220
So there's no way that if the
random variable X is 5 and

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.410
this is strictly less than 5,
this is going to be true.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.380
And so that probability
will be 0.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.455
So we're now left with
2/3 plus 1/30.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:53.090
 

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.470
And now we can fill this in.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.730
2/3 plus 1/30 x.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.260
 

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.910
And this is our CDF.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:13.370
So now we've finished the
problem, computed the expected

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:18.880
value here and then the CDF
here, and this was a great

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.040
illustration of how you
would do so for a

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.290
mixed random variable.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.190
