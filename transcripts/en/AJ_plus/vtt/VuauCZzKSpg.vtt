00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.860
You might be wondering why I’m dancing like this at an Iranian nightclub in Los Angeles.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.340
“Del-e Divaaneehhhhhh…”

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.780
Let me explain.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.880
My name is Yara.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.140
No, not that Yara, the half-black, half-Iranian actress.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.660
I’m a different Yara. But like her, I’m also Iranian-American.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.460
My parents emigrated from Iran and settled in northern California, where I was born and raised.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.200
But even though I’ve been in the States pretty much my whole life, I’ve always felt sort of in-between.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.380
Meaning, both American and, well, Iranian.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.280
This is especially true now.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.960
“Iran, a terrorist nation like few others.”

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.100
As attempts have been made to ban Iranians and other Middle Easterners from entering the U.S.,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.300
“...complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States…”

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.020
I’ve been made very aware of my Iranian identity.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.860
All this got me thinking, what does it mean to be both Iranian and American?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.640
And is this the first time we’ve had to deal with something like this?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.240
To answer that, I decided to head to the world’s largest community of Iranians outside of Iran,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.260
which happens to be in Los Angeles.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.400
Or, as people here call it, Tehrangeles.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280
“And we’re stuck in traffic.”

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.620
“Hey, Siri. Where is Tehrangeles?”

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.960
“What is that?!”

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.700
Siri was useless.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.180
So I asked Iranian-American writer Porochista Khakpour, who grew up in L.A. –

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.010
“Hi, how are you?"

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.480
"Good to meet you.”

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.000
– to show me the symbolic center of the Iranian community here: Westwood Boulevard, also known as Persian Square.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.840
“So we’re basically entering Tehrangeles now. This is where the heart of it is.”

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.920
Growing up, Porochista’s parents would drive the family 40 minutes, almost every weekend, to get to Westwood.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.740
“I imagine, for my parents, must have been very hard to afford it, but they wanted to have me be in touch with the culture.”

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.240
“Oh, here we go.”

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.520
“Taste of Tehran!”

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.140
“Taste of Tehran is right here.”

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.580
“If you think they’re Iranian out here, they’re definitely Iranian.”

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.040
The whole place is like a little slice of Iran in America. Everything is written in Persian, also known as Farsi, the official language of Iran.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.820
You walk into stores and immediately start speaking Persian.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.340
There’s tons of Iranian people everywhere.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.580
And Iranian food.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.440
“I’m going to eat this tongue sandwich.”

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.320
“Oh my God, these! 
This is Iranian fruit leather.”

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.920
“Made in Iran.”

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.980
“My mom’s whole refrigerator and kitchen is all this stuff.”

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.900
There’s even a shop that sells Iranian music.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.720
It’s estimated there’s about 1 million Iranian-Americans, and about half of them live in southern California.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.060
But why did so many Iranians choose L.A.?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.460
I met up with sociologist Ali Akbar Mahdi to find out.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.620
He offered a few reasons.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.640
“The weather in Los Angeles is very much like Tehran, it's warm.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.500
California is the place where the communities that exist here -- Latinos, Asians, Arabs, Iranians –

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.620
each of them have their independent community. An immigrant could literally be who they want to be.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.300
Once a group has come, you're going to have a base,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000
and that begins to attract other people.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.460
This is now the largest community of Iranians outside of Iran.”

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.900
Walking around Tehrangeles, I realized that a lot Iranians here call themselves “Persian,” unlike Porochista and me.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.760
But why is that?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.680
“Iranians like me, when we first got to America, everybody was saying ‘Persian.’ Everything about the word ‘Iran’ was negative.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.020
It was horrible. So, out of survival, people like my parents and their generation started saying ‘Persian.’

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.360
I don’t blame them.”

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.000
“Iranians don’t even say they are Iranian, Iranians say they are Persian. I am not dangerous, I am Persian.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.180
I am Persian like the cat. Meow.”

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.080
What did that first massive wave of Iranian immigrants need to protect themselves from?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:20.700
“Iranians who confronted the stereotypes and prejudices after the hostage crisis, they needed a protective shield,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.820
and 'Persia' and 'Persian' gave them that cover.”

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.080
What was the hostage crisis? Let me give you a quick rundown.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.240
In 1979, Iranians had a revolution.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.120
They got rid of their American-backed king, the shah, and established an Islamic republic led by this guy, Ayatollah Khomeini.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.040
The shah fled his country, and at one point went to the U.S. for medical treatment.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.820
Anti-shah students wanted the United States to return him to Iran to face trial.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.660
So they broke into the American embassy in Tehran and took dozens of American diplomats hostage.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.920
52 Americans were held for 444 days.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.500
Their ordeal, known as the hostage crisis, became a fixture of American TV news.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.500
“Day 314 of the hostage crisis in Iran.”

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.020
Nightly newscasts showed the same images over and over again:

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.520
burning American flags, fist-pumping Iranians and blindfolded American hostages.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.520
As a result, anti-Iranian sentiment started to seep into the American psyche.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.860
Iranians were demonized in books, movies …

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.460
“This is a backward, primitive country!”

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.540
… and music.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.980
The hostage crisis also took a toll on public opinion.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.600
By 1980, some 60 percent of Americans had a negative view of Iran.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.520
Fast-forward to 1989, and that skyrocketed to 91 percent.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.440
This hit especially hard for Porochista, whose family fled Iran after the revolution,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.680
a time when many other Iranians left the country.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.120
When she arrived in the U.S., she was just a little kid.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.320
“This is my brother and I. He was born in the U.S., I was born in Iran.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.400
Then we were refugees in Paris.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.640
And then we got to the U.S.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.860
I can't emphasize enough how horrible [it was], when we got to the U.S. in the early ’80s.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.560
I mean, I was so young, but I remember all of it vividly.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.100
Because I was so traumatized by the atmosphere of hatred in America.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.920
I was just made fun of constantly.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.200
There was a lot of anti-Iranian sentiments, and I would get that on playgrounds.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.100
I heard ‘dune goon.’

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.920
There was ‘sand n-word.’

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.080
‘Camel jockey.’”

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.980
"What is that?"

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.480
“Do you know that slur, 'camel jockey'?"

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.320
"No."

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.960
"It just was the predominant slur used against people from Iran,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.580
and possibly the rest of the Middle East, in the ’80s.”

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.480
It was in that very political climate that Mashti Shirvani opened his ice cream shop, Mashti Malone’s.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.420
His brother, Mehdi, joined him 1988 and helped expand the business.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.940
The two are often credited with bringing Persian ice cream to L.A.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.720
“That’s our best seller, here. Saffron rosewater.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.860
That’s ginger rosewater. And then there’s orange blossom with pistachio. Bahar narenj.”

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.440
“This is the Persian faloodeh. But we mixed it with sour cherry.”

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.040
“Sour cherry, great.”

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.480
“Faloodeh is made of rosewater with rice starch noodles.”

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.800
“Oh, that one’s my favorite.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.320
I feel like I’m literally sitting in my grandma’s house right now.”

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.880
Mashti Malone’s is seen as an L.A. institution now, but when Mashti first opened his shop in 1980,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.480
during the hostage crisis, things were not so easy for Iranians.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.200
Anti-Iran protests were happening all over the country, from Washington, DC, to Beverly Hills.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.120
One of them was even organized by a California state senator.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.500
“I mean, everybody could see that the media was completely against Iranians.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.920
They kind of associated people with the government.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.940
So whatever the government did, people here got punished for it too.”

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.920
“All the Iranian students, they were afraid to say they are Iranian."

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.680
“This is a giant container of saffron.”

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.720
“We may get robbed, this is…”

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.060
“Oh my God, I don’t think I’ve ever seen this much saffron in one place.”

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.800
In spite of what happened to him during the hostage crisis years, Mashti doesn’t hold any grudges.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.400
“This is the best temperature to try ice cream.”

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.700
“You can taste the cardamom in this thing.”

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.160
What I realized from Mashti and Mehdi is that those who came before me,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.800
the people who established the Iranian-American community, they went through a lot.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.440
I didn’t have to deal with the immediate fallout from the hostage crisis.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.680
And I’m thankful for that.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.580
But me and other second-generation Iranian-Americans have had to deal with something else –

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.480
something that made us feel like “others” in our own country.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.120
Hey guys, thanks for watching the first episode of our four-part series on Iranian-Americans.
