00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.150
In procedural code, systematic variation is often dealt with

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.740
via case statements or else-if cascades. In object-oriented code,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.910
this approach is considered a bad smell. Instead, you should use parallel,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.790
factored subclasses with the choice specific code embodied in a subclass method.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.940
This approach is called the single choice principle.
