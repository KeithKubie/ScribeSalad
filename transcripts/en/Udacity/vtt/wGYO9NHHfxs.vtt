00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's get back to this idea of taking timings.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When we're taking timings we're doing measurements.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now we've changed what we're doing from having computer science

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
being a mathematical enterprise to having it be a experimental enterprise--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and experimental science. We're actually doing science.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's as if we're dealing with the messy world with some chemicals in a beaker,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we're making measurements of those rather than trying to do mathematical proofs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One thing we know about doing experimental science

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is that one measurement isn't going to be good enough.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That was clear when we got a measurement of 0.0.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We know that wasn't right. We know that there can be errors in measurements.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One way in science that we deal with that is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by repeating the measurements multiple times.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I want you to tell me why you think some reasons are that scientists,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
when they do an experiment, take more than one measurement.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Is it because we want to reduce the chance of some external event

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
effecting the result?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Because we want to reduce the natural random variation?

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or because we want to reduce errors in the measurement process? Check all that apply.
