00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.870
[inaudible].

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.380
<v 2>All right.
We're all,
here we go.
Jordan Peterson,
Ben Shapiro,</v>

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
Dave Ruben.
We got a lot to do.
We've got about two hours to do it.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.760
I thought,
how am I going to start this thing?

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.020
I could ask you guys how you're doing.
We could dive right into some deep topics,

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.390
but then I thought,
no,
let's do something else.

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.400
A lot of people don't seem to like us that that is a weird thing.

9
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:36.240
We've been bouncing around quite literally all over the world the last couple of

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.260
months and we're meeting thousands and thousands,

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.310
hundreds of thousands of people at this point.
Huh?

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Who are decent good people from every walk of life trying to find some answers

13
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.400
and meet other people that think like them or don't think like them,
but just,

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.550
but just want to find some decency in this world.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.970
And yet the online world just seems relentlessly hateful and you probably get

16
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.450
more hate than anyone else.

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.300
So I thought that would just be an interesting way to start this like just as

18
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.300
three people that I think we're basically trying to put some decency out there.

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.880
Just sort of the level of anger and hate that we get.
I'll,

20
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.620
I'll go to you first year.
Does it bother you anymore?

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.040
<v 1>Oh yeah,
it did.</v>

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
I mean I try to shield myself to it from it to some degree.

23
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.120
I mean I'm certainly decreased the amount of time that I'm spending reading

24
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.470
Twitter comments to pretty much zero.
Yeah.
Um,
the,

25
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.000
I find the,
uh,

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
the contentious interchanges with journalists I would say are the most stressful

27
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.280
things that I do.
And they usually rattled me up for a day or two afterwards.

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
Um,
even though I would say they're still worth doing.
Um,
but

29
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.720
the,
the here,
here's the thing.
Okay.
So a couple of observations.

30
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.721
The first is a lot of the pejorative comments that have been aimed at me,

31
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:58.530
for example,
have been that my followers are a bunch of angry young white men.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.480
And so I'd like to take that apart a little bit.

33
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.940
The first thing I've learned in the last month or so thought through is that I'm

34
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.870
done making any sort of apologies whatsoever for the fact that most of the

35
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.590
people who are watching my youtube videos are,
are men.

36
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.510
There's nothing wrong with talking to men.

37
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.230
And if man happened to be benefiting from what I'm discussing,

38
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:22.020
then so much the better women have to live with men.

39
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.390
And so that's of great benefit to women.

40
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:27.840
And there are plenty of women writing me telling me that and also meeting me at

41
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.500
these talks saying exactly the same thing.
And then they're not angry.

42
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.740
So in how do I know that?
Well,
as you just pointed out,

43
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.460
we have spoken to 250,000 people in seven months.

44
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.570
How many incidents of anger have we had?
I mean,
what I tell you,
literally none.

45
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.160
Zero,
zero,
zero [inaudible] the shows have been loved that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

46
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:48.990
They're very,
very positive.
Yeah.
So,

47
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:52.800
and we had one heckler who was obviously not a fan in one venue.

48
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.330
I wasn't even at that show that it wasn't your fault.
Oh God,
you land.
Exactly.

49
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:57.811
Exactly.

50
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.811
So the the couldn't possibly be more peaceful or positive as far as I'm

51
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.880
concerned.
And so,
and then the people there aren't particularly young.

52
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.080
I would say the average ages is somewhere between 30 and 40 and there's plenty

53
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:15.130
of older people and especially in the u s now it's at least a third women for

54
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:18.130
what that's worth.
And I think that's because women are buying more of the books.

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.400
In Europe it was still more men,
but that's because in many of those countries,

56
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.380
the book had only come out recently.
Yeah.

57
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.860
<v 2>And you have to,
it's definitely not the way the media portrays it.</v>

58
00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:27.810
They're making it seem like it's 90 10 I mean,

59
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.780
I always say at the beginning of the show when I reference something about that,

60
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.430
I usually say it's 60 40 and yet be,

61
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.110
sometimes it's a little more one way or the other,

62
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.580
but it's certainly not the way.

63
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.920
<v 1>Well,
I think a lot of the vitriol is,
see I was,</v>

64
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.320
I just finished reading another book on postmodernism and Oxford Book on

65
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.020
postmodernism and on Dera Dha in particular.

66
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:50.021
And like there really was an attempt on the part of the postmodernists and this

67
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:50.781
is allied,

68
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:55.781
I think with their fundamental Marxism to demolish the idea of the autonomous

69
00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:57.920
individual.
So for example,

70
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.340
one of the things that's really interesting about the current free speech debate

71
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.020
is that it really isn't a debate because you have to be in the Judeo Christian

72
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.500
slash enlightenment tradition to believe in free speech.

73
00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:11.030
Because to believe in free speech,

74
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:14.600
you have to believe that they're autonomous individuals who have their own

75
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:15.470
viewpoints,

76
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.740
who can spontaneously generate creative ideas and then who can engage in an

77
00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:25.560
active dialogue in a,
in a,
in a manner that that is,

78
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.930
that consists of fundamental goodwill and truth and that you can change each

79
00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:32.840
other's opinions and that you couldn't come to a negotiated agreement.

80
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.160
You have to believe all of that,

81
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.940
including the autonomous individual in that concept,
the logos,

82
00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:41.120
which is what Derrida was.
So,
so,
uh,

83
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.510
what he criticized so heavily that idea of low logo centrism,

84
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.280
you have to believe in the autonomous individual and the postmodernist and the

85
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.821
Neo Marxists,
they don't,

86
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:54.560
they believe that the individual is a mouthpiece for a power assembly.

87
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.400
And if there is no such thing as free speech,
which is why they know platform,

88
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.860
right?
It's not,
well it is,
it's,

89
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:04.730
so the debate about free speech is way deeper than who should be allowed to
talk.

90
00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:08.900
The debate about free speech is whether or not there is such a thing as free

91
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.890
speech outside the power game that neo colonial Europeans are playing.

92
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.350
And so what I'm doing and what you're doing with me,

93
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:21.020
and I think what everybody in the IDW is doing to some degree is speaking to

94
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:26.021
people as if they are autonomous individuals who are the bedrock of civilization

95
00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:31.970
and sovereignty.
And that is absolute and neath Emma to the radical left.

96
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.020
And so they,
they,
they see that as a fundamental challenge,
which it is

97
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.290
<v 2>the individual is the fundamental challenge.</v>

98
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.700
I think that's perfect for you because it's like you as an individual,

99
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:46.480
Ben Shapiro,
you get more hate online than pretty much anyone.

100
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.160
And it's not just that you get hate,

101
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.120
it's the nature of the hate where that you're a white supremacist.

102
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.530
You happen to be wearing a Yamaka,
which is a little confusing.

103
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.160
You know that you are,
that you're a Nazi or the rest of it.
And it's like,

104
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.520
I know you're okay with criticism,
but it's not criticism that they're leveling.

105
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.770
It's just endless hate.
It's endless over the top eight.
And that,

106
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.420
that's the weird,
you know,
if you're

107
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.020
<v 3>a good person,
you try to be a good person.</v>

108
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.080
Every time you receive a piece of criticism as a good person,

109
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.430
your first response should be,
did I do something wrong?
Was it make right?

110
00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:14.810
And yeah,

111
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.080
and as somebody who's trying to get better at being a human and also just at

112
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:18.914
what I do,

113
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.100
I spend an awful lot of time trying to look at those criticisms and say,
okay,

114
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.700
is that reasonable?
And usually it's something from 10 years ago it was like,

115
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.830
okay,
yeah,
I should have done that better.
That was those stupid,

116
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.770
I shouldn't have said that.
Right.
Yeah.

117
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.240
<v 2>It isn't always 10 years ago for you because you even had that nice moment in</v>

118
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.780
this studio where you had said that you have a sort of public and private

119
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:39.290
position on addressing trans people by pronouns that they want.
Right.

120
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.990
100% you don't want to be bludgeoned into doing it,

121
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.470
but privately if you knew someone who was trans and respected them,

122
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.660
of course you would use the pronouns.

123
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.780
<v 3>Right and then in the same way that I would do that with,</v>

124
00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:50.390
with anybody about anything.
Generally,

125
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:52.640
if I'm been in private conversation with somebody and I don't,

126
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.850
when I want the conversation to progress beyond something that's unrelated,

127
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:57.980
then I'm not going to go out of my way to offend them because it's,

128
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.120
it's pointless.
But in a public conversation where the,

129
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.580
the express topic being discussed is human biology,

130
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.750
then I'm not going to give into the argument that I have now given up my

131
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:12.950
argument by using the Pronoun of your choice because that is undercutting my own

132
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:15.480
argument.
We're now in a public debate.
That's a different forum.
Um,

133
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.340
but that idea is that you are unsympathetic and I think this goes to the

134
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.110
fundamental conceit of folks on the left,

135
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:23.780
which is that they are more sympathetic human beings and people who opposed him

136
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.710
politically or unsympathetic human beings in this goes back to the individual

137
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:30.560
versus communitarian distinction for the left.
If you're an individual,

138
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:33.710
this means that you are inherently unsympathetic to others because your

139
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:36.970
individuality stands against the collective.
Yeah.
If you are,
you're,

140
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.060
you're a member of the collective,
then you can show that by your,

141
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.880
the amount of sympathy that you have to have her have her other people.

142
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.290
And so I think,
but also so for

143
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.920
<v 1>the collective and for the whole,
for a very weird form of sympathy,
right?</v>

144
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.300
Because the collective doesn't suffer,
individuals suffer.
Right.
You know,
and,

145
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.930
and that's,
uh,
and then the other thing that's interesting about that reflects of

146
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.931
identification of sympathy with virtue is that it's actually extraordinarily

147
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:03.680
immature as far as I'm concerned,

148
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.030
because most complex problems aren't,
uh,

149
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.680
aren't solvable by reflects of sympathy and reflects of sympathy is more like,

150
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.060
it's more like an instinct.

151
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:18.110
It's more like anger or it's more like jealousy or rage or love for that matter.

152
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.730
It doesn't have that cognitive component that enables you to take apart complex

153
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.500
systems and to analyze them and determine what the problem is and what a

154
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:28.700
solution might look like.

155
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:33.170
And then to lay that out in a cold and calculated manner toward some positive

156
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:37.520
end.
It's this automatic assumption that because you're overwhelmed with pity,

157
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.280
let's say that that somehow makes you morally virtuous.

158
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.070
And it not only does it not make you morally virtuous,

159
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.760
it's often the case that that,
and this is the big Friday observation,

160
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.080
that that all encompassing pity actually has a devouring component.

161
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.230
And that's that overprotectiveness that while the Jonathan Height and Lucan off

162
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:56.100
have been writing about,

163
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.990
<v 3>for example,
and it's very,
it's,</v>

164
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.050
it's that interferes with the development of people's autonomy.

165
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.130
And so the reflexive idea that because you're a sympathetic person,
you're good,

166
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.510
right?
Is,
is bad enough in addition to the fact that,
well,

167
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.390
all the sympathy is on the radical left,
which is certainly isn't,

168
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.670
I think one of the things that height talks about,

169
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.250
and this is where I think the left has taken advantage in so many areas.

170
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.650
And I'd say the left,
and I don't mean people who are liberal,

171
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.240
I always make this distinction.
There are people who are on the left,
are liberal,

172
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.710
appreciating it,
right?
And this is Dave's point all the time.

173
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.080
If you are for free speech,
but you disagree with me about tax rates,

174
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.711
you're liberal.

175
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.380
If you're somebody who's on the left and you want to shut down debate because

176
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:34.260
you fundamentally believe that free speech is a conceit of the power structure,

177
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.620
right then then you are on the left.
But what height says,

178
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:38.520
and he's correct about this,

179
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.120
is that in any conversation you have with anybody there sort of an entry gateway

180
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.030
to the conversation.
And that is showing that you have goodwill.

181
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.820
So showing sympathy is one form of doing that.

182
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.300
So what the left likes to do is prevent the conversation from happening by

183
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.320
preventing you from appearing as a sympathetic human being.
Meaning that,

184
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.980
so for example,
when I talk about transgenderism,

185
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.110
the first thing that gets thrown at me is you don't care about transgender

186
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:04.110
people.
Why are we even having this conversation?
You're trying to be mean.

187
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.570
You're trying to create violence against transgender folks.

188
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.340
And this is why this language is constantly used.

189
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.970
Because if we accept that I have tremendous empathy for people who are suffering

190
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.520
from what is by any measure a disorder.

191
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.560
And if I say that we have to look at sympathy for these people and try and find

192
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:22.950
the best scientific solutions and try and figure out what's best for society

193
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.490
generally,
not just for transgender folks,
but for kids who were teaching,

194
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:29.820
who can be easily confused about gender or if we're looking at what's the best

195
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:32.160
solution for doctors who,
there was an article in the New York Times,

196
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.790
like last week with a person suggesting the doctor should be forced to perform

197
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.330
transgender surgery simply based on one's not even based on an assessment of

198
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:39.750
need.

199
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.420
The doctor should not be able to assess whether somebody needs the transgender

200
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:46.440
surgery or whether alerts basically the situation in Ontario already in Canada.

201
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.490
Yeah,
I mean it's on demand.
It's just like any other optional surgery now.
I mean,

202
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.510
this sort of stuff has real societal consequences and to be,

203
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.910
and so what the left will do is they don't want to talk about the societal

204
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:58.410
consequences.
Instead what they do is they say,

205
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:00.990
you're not welcome in the conversation because you're unsympathetic.

206
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:02.910
And so this is usually what's thrown at me.

207
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:07.080
And you know fairly enough in the sense that my slogan is facts don't care about

208
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:07.590
your feelings,

209
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.900
but what I mean by that is not that you shouldn't care about other people.

210
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:13.590
It's that in the end the solutions that are going to lead to better lives are

211
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:16.520
not going to be feelings based.
They're going to be facts,
space.
This is not me.

212
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.690
I have to be an unsympathetic human being.
So for example,

213
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.320
is a story that I really haven't told publicly because I don't like to tell

214
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:26.190
these stories publicly because my monities has a basic principle of charity,

215
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:27.300
which is the best form of charities,

216
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.540
anonymous charity because then you don't get credit for it.
It's all right.

217
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.940
I don't want to make it seem like this happened simply because I was trying to

218
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:33.774
take credit for it,

219
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.260
but several weeks ago I was speaking at a university which will remain unnamed

220
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:41.250
for anonymous for anonymity reasons and I was,
and this topic came up,

221
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.610
a transgender person got up at the microphone and asked a question and the

222
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:46.590
conversation kind of went sideways.

223
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:49.950
The person suggested and started talking about their personal story and I

224
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.830
started kind of picking holes in the personal story a little bit and it's

225
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:56.470
probably an exchange that I could have handled better.
But in any case,

226
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.550
the person got very upset and started to cry and then left and this is all on

227
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:03.880
tape and it was one of those situations where,
because I give speeches in,

228
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:07.000
in Q and a forums and because there are a lot of videos of me destroying people,

229
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.740
it's one of those situations where if the tape comes out,

230
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:11.840
it gets 5 million views and it Shapiro destroys transgender,
right?

231
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.310
And I don't want that to be what happens at my lecturers.

232
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:18.030
If there's going to be a Shapiro destroys video,
which we don't even cut,

233
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.950
then I would like it to be like just a rational exchange where everybody leaves

234
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:23.860
feeling good about the exchange and somebody lost in somebody's one fine,

235
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.430
this was something different.
The person got visibly,
emotionally upset,

236
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:28.310
very upset I,

237
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.480
and the people who are running the event happened to know who this person was.

238
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.120
So I called the person up on the phone and I said,

239
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.700
that really didn't go how I want it to go.
You know,
I have my public position,

240
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:39.340
but that's,
that doesn't mean I don't have sympathy for you.

241
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.990
I went to the organizers of the event.

242
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.630
I had them cut that part out of the tape because there's no reason this person

243
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.950
should be exposed to ridicule.

244
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.440
And then I had coffee with the person next morning to ensure that the person was

245
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:48.880
doing okay emotionally.
Okay.

246
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:51.370
That's not coming from a place of I don't care about people.

247
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.320
This is coming from a place of these are important,

248
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:57.400
vital public conversations and shutting down those conversations by saying that

249
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.790
I don't care about a human being that I don't care about what happens to people

250
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.580
is the nastiest form of no platforming because it's not just saying,
you know,

251
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.030
this is a replatform of your views because your views are so terrible and so

252
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:10.670
awful.
It's saying that your views are inherently evil.
Yeah,

253
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.350
they're inherently sociopath and you are too.
And you are too.
And that's,

254
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:18.760
and that's something that I think is actually a form of assholery beyond

255
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:20.220
comprehension.
Also don't think that

256
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.420
<v 1>you can care for people.
I think that you can care for individuals.</v>

257
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.870
And I mean one of the things that's been characterizing the tour that we've been

258
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:30.150
doing is that like when I'm lecturing,

259
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.470
I don't lecture to the audience or lecture do individuals and I'm not lecturing

260
00:13:34.471 --> 00:13:35.011
to them either.

261
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:38.340
That's that's the wrong way because I always include myself in the discussion.

262
00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:42.700
So if we're talking about ethical principles and how they might be,
um,
uh,

263
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.190
what would you call it?
Put forward or,
or founded more,

264
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.660
more solidly than,

265
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.620
I'm always including myself in the list of perpetrators who need some

266
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:56.580
improvement.
Right?
So it's just discussing with people one at a time,

267
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:58.860
even though they happen to be very large audiences.

268
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.080
And then when I see people afterwards,

269
00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.750
cause I meet about 150 people after each talk,

270
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.840
then I get not a huge amount of time,

271
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:09.420
but enough time to make personal contact with each person.

272
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.810
And I'm very careful to do that extremely carefully because I'm very happy

273
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:16.740
through there.
And they often tell me a story about,
you know,

274
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.470
how they were suffering in some way or things,

275
00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:22.950
words set right in their life and that they've been trying to develop a vision

276
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:25.410
to aim high at something that's worth aiming at,

277
00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:28.050
which is part of the advantage of hierarchies,
right?
Which though,

278
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.710
which is something we should talk about because you can't aim at something

279
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:34.140
without privileging it over something else.

280
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.500
And if you don't have any of the day math and you don't have any purpose in your

281
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:40.120
life,
and that's a bloody catastrophe.
So anyways,

282
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.020
they come up with a vision and they're trying to be more responsible.

283
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.630
And then there's the individualism aspect of this is,
you know,
I've,

284
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.750
I've outlined to people that there are take responsibility for themselves,

285
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.680
which is not the same thing as to be individually selfish and to do that in a

286
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.670
way that also makes them responsible for their family and to do that in a way

287
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.890
that also makes them responsible for the community.

288
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.960
So the individualism isn't the selfish individualism that the leftists or

289
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:11.780
criticism criticizing by any stretch of the imagination.

290
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.860
It's the individual positioned in an iterated game,
right?

291
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:19.070
That includes them as individual stretched across time.

292
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.770
So there's already a collective in that in some sense.

293
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.860
And then them in relationship to family and the community,

294
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:26.810
but they're stemming from the individual,

295
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.880
which I think is part and parcel of the Judeo Christian enlightenment
philosophy.

296
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.690
Anyways,

297
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.260
these people come and tell me this story and they say they were in a bad place

298
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:39.770
and that things have improved a lot and they're kind of sad about the bad place

299
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.410
part of visual,
visibly upset often.

300
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.210
And then they tell me how things are improved,

301
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.280
improved and they're really happy about that.

302
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.940
And it's very touching and emotional and that's where the,

303
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.230
that's where caring takes place.
That's right.
At the level of the individual.

304
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.900
I went into a whole foods yesterday and this happens quite often.

305
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.090
So I was there and two of the guys from behind the meat counter came out

306
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.030
separately and they said that they had been watching my lectures and one of them

307
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:06.650
talked about the fact that you know,

308
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:09.650
he has a seven year old son and that he wants to do right by him.

309
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:12.830
Then he's been looking really hard for ethical and moral guidance and that he's

310
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:16.850
been reading and listening to my book and concentrating on the parts about

311
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.350
telling the truth and not lying.

312
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:23.210
And I'm having these conversations with people one at a time about them striving

313
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.790
hard to develop an ethical,

314
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.790
philosophically grounded ethical perspective.
You know,

315
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:32.650
and it's so interesting to see this happening and to see who's doing

316
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.650
<v 3>well.
This is,
this is,
this is,</v>

317
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:37.790
I think an important point is that I get asked a lot because I do get so much

318
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:39.350
criticism and flack.
I get asked a lot,

319
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.170
have I ever been confronted in public cause I got in public,
you know,

320
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:43.470
with my family to Disneyland,

321
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.520
went on Thanksgiving to Disneyland and I got go see accosted,

322
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.550
not not Costa,

323
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.490
but people came up to me because they like my stuff or they enjoy it and they

324
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:55.430
want to take pictures.
Probably happen 35 to 40 times over the course of the day.

325
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.380
And they asked me have I ever,

326
00:16:57.381 --> 00:17:00.140
has there ever been a situation where somebody came up to you and said something

327
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.660
mean or nasty?
Yeah,
I can't think of one.
Yeah.

328
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.350
I can't think of one time this has ever happened now online.
That's all I get.

329
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.520
And so the point here is that when it comes to individuals who are affected and

330
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:14.180
who actually,
and who actually feel good or bad about you.
Yeah,

331
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.490
it's a collective mob mentality that allows people to protest you and then

332
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.650
protest me.
And then that is picked up.

333
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.110
The mob mentality is picked up by individual journalists who are,

334
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.580
who see themselves as sort of champions of the people broadly but not champions

335
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.330
of individuals.

336
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.760
Because there you still can't find the individual who's been victimized by

337
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:32.594
Jordan Peterson.

338
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.120
You still can't find the individual who's been victimized by Dave Rubin or the

339
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:38.120
individual who's been victimized by Ben Shapiro.
You can't find those people.

340
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.900
So instead what it becomes is,
oh,
it's a broader group that's victimized,

341
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.440
but none of those people have ever come to me personally and said,

342
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:47.150
you victimize me.
You hurt me.

343
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:50.250
Because they can't name a situation in which this has happened.
I always love,

344
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 2>I always love when they say that were radicalizing people and it's like if I</v>

345
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:56.640
open up my inbox,
I'm getting emails from all sorts of people,

346
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:59.860
usually on the right who say that they were a little more extreme on the right

347
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:04.320
and that because they see a decent liberal who will treat them with respect.

348
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:06.000
They've modified some of their opinions.

349
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.420
But what do you think about this just at a,
at a psychological level,

350
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.430
the disconnect between what seems to be happening in the real world on a day to

351
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:18.270
day basis and the way a huge amount of people are behaving online.

352
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.520
What do you think is psychologically?

353
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.440
<v 1>Boy,
that's a tough one.
I mean,</v>

354
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:26.820
it could easily be like if you think of of venues like Twitter,

355
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.360
let's take Twitter as an example.
We don't understand.

356
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.100
We don't really understand much about how people communicate periods

357
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:34.934
psychologically.

358
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.240
One of the things that psychologists do know is that if there's any distancing

359
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:42.150
between you and a person.
So for example,
if you're inside a car,

360
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.020
you're much more likely to act in an impulsive,
in hostile manner.
And that,

361
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.310
because one of the things that seems to mitigate against that impulsive

362
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:54.780
hostility is whatever mechanisms kick in when you're face to face with someone.

363
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.930
So those might be mechanisms that are associated with the Nate sympathy,

364
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:00.390
for example.
And so that regulates your behavior.

365
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:03.810
And because most of the time in our evolutionary history,

366
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:07.740
you were interacting directly one on one with someone that seemed to work out

367
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:12.030
quite well.
Caveman were doing it with they,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
They had to,

368
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:15.010
they had to carve in,
in salts into the,
into walls.
And that,

369
00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:19.860
that took a lot of time.
And so,
but on Twitter like it could easily be,

370
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.750
I read this little article here at Wabash showing what words needed to be in

371
00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:28.800
content for those to be most likely retweeted and they were almost all high

372
00:19:28.801 --> 00:19:32.010
level negative emotion words.
And so we could be,

373
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:37.011
you have this huge pool of people and then it might be that only the person

374
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:41.910
who's in a bad mood and is irritated that day or a sort of chronically like that

375
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.980
or dispositionally like that,
let's say,

376
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.870
and who is specifically angry about something that they saw right then is likely

377
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:53.420
to tweet.
And so that gives you this tremendously skewed view of,
of,

378
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.470
of the,
of the consensus because you assume like if you is,

379
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.060
if there's a hundred people that show up in a mall outside your door,

380
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.620
you assume that there's more than a hundred people mad at you right there.

381
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.130
There are representative of a much larger group on,
on Twitter.

382
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.160
You can't tell if the 30 people who say snarky things,

383
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:13.380
especially anonymously to you,

384
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.610
you can't tell if they're representative at all and they're likely not.

385
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.310
And you know that that very narrow bandwidth,

386
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:25.311
that 140 or 280 characters might also be something that really facilitates

387
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.360
angry,
impulsive responding.

388
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.380
And so we don't understand any of this psychological and I think there's

389
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:34.200
something else happening too.
And that is that both Twitter and Facebook,

390
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.560
all social media is basically something different in human history in the sense

391
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:40.680
that it's just a crowd without a purpose.
So it's a crowd looking for a purpose,

392
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.710
meaning that throughout human history we actually had to have face to face

393
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:44.610
interactions with people.

394
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.100
The only reason you would show up in a crowd is the crowd had a purpose.

395
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.560
<v 3>So where were you typically doing this as you were going to a church,
right?</v>

396
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:54.010
Everybody was there to worship.
Everybody was there with a common goal in mind,

397
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.710
right?
You were a member of the army until the,

398
00:20:55.711 --> 00:20:58.240
there's a common goal in mind anytime you were getting together was because

399
00:20:58.241 --> 00:20:59.920
there was a party.
So everybody was there for the party.

400
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.540
Twitter is legitimately people waking up and just I want to interact with other

401
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:05.950
humans.
There are no other humans around.

402
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.370
And so I'm here and you're here and we're all here and look,

403
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.280
somebody just sends something odd.
There's a common purpose.
Let's jump on that.

404
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.390
And then there's this backslapping effect of the person said something and I

405
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:17.201
mean we all use Twitter,

406
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:20.890
so we all know that if you are the most dangerous thing about Twitter,

407
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.690
the most eight,
if I could do anything with Twitter,

408
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.560
I would get rid of the mentions tab.
The reason being,

409
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:31.090
because if you are a,
if you're just a human behavior,
it encourages bad behavior,

410
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:33.910
especially because it encourages you to be looking and seeing how people are

411
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:35.290
responding to you.
Because as human beings,

412
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.660
we're constantly looking to see how people are responding to us.

413
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.000
And so this is just generally a good thing,
right?

414
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.290
It's generally a good thing except that it's,
it's an ego machine.
Yeah.

415
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.310
That's the down side because the key,

416
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:47.980
one of the keys to being a good person is to recognize most people aren't

417
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:52.300
thinking about you 95% of the time,
right?
You're not that important as a human.

418
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.570
And so in order for you to be important,
actually do something important.

419
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.530
But because Twitter functions in such a way that all you get is that feedback

420
00:21:59.531 --> 00:21:59.980
loop,

421
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.580
it encourages you more and more to look for more of that feedback makes you feel

422
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:04.160
good.
I mean,

423
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.030
you get a little endorphin rush every time there's a nice comment about you,

424
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.450
you refresh,
you refresh for more nice comments.
That doesn't happen in real life.

425
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:13.120
There's never a situation,
real life in which that happens.
And when it does,

426
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.980
it's a major life event.
It's a wedding,
it's Bar Mitzvah,
right?

427
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.000
Something where people are collectively celebrating you.
But on Twitter,

428
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:21.100
everybody is collectively celebrating everybody else.

429
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:24.100
And the people who issued the strongest opinions are the people who receive both

430
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:25.680
the most condemnation and most celebrations

431
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.700
<v 2>we weird way,
not that we want people to go into their bubbles,</v>

432
00:22:28.701 --> 00:22:31.610
but are these town squares almost?

433
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.510
They're almost too big to actually ever function properly.

434
00:22:35.511 --> 00:22:37.490
So every week there's another story where Jack says,

435
00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:40.580
I'm going to get rid of the likes,
or I'm going to get rid of follower accounts.

436
00:22:40.581 --> 00:22:44.420
And they're always trying to float these ideas to manipulate how we all behave

437
00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:46.280
with each other.
But in an odd way,

438
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:51.310
having everyone from everywhere on these platforms really doesn't make sense in

439
00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:52.281
some bizarre way.

440
00:22:52.281 --> 00:22:55.580
I'm not saying that we should be in separate places where there is no community.

441
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.130
Yeah,
Ben's right.

442
00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.860
So it's like we need something that has community I think.

443
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.230
But then the danger is that we ended up in our little echo,

444
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.160
<v 3>right.
I mean the,
the,
they're the need.</v>

445
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.440
It's fascinating because if you're looking at other places on the Internet,

446
00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:10.860
just structurally,
the way that the community works is a little bit different.

447
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.850
The way that it works or it used to work 10 years ago,
uh,

448
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.250
when people actually visited websites directly was that you'd have something

449
00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:20.130
like at national review the corner.
And it was a bunch of people,
you know,

450
00:23:20.131 --> 00:23:22.900
like us sitting around and discussing ideas back and forth and back and forth,

451
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:23.830
like a group blog.
Yeah.

452
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.510
And it was restricted to the people who were discussing the ideas and then below

453
00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:29.460
that video game board or anything.
Yeah,
exactly.

454
00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:31.260
And then below that you'd have the comment section,

455
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.340
which was all about those particular conversations because Twitter is
fragmented.

456
00:23:35.341 --> 00:23:37.500
There's no actual conversation taking place on Twitter.

457
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.260
There's me saying something and you responding to it and me not responding to

458
00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:43.140
you mostly and then be tweeting another thought and then you responding to it

459
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.940
and the idea of having a long form every time it happens on Twitter,

460
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.280
at the end of the conversation you find someone saying,

461
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.370
this isn't the appropriate place to have a long form conversation for,

462
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.100
we're going to do that.
We'd be on a podcast with wait.
Right?

463
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:57.290
We'd be writing each other letters like that.
This isn't,

464
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.190
this isn't the way to do that and even when I'm discussing with my peers,

465
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:03.860
even when I'm talking with people on the left who I talk with on the phone,

466
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.050
instead of having a conversation on Twitter about the topic,
I will call,

467
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.800
pick up the phone and call them and have the conversation because he can't have

468
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:12.130
a good conversation on Twitter.
You just can't.
How much

469
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.190
<v 2>is connected to one of the things that you've brought up in many of the
lectures,</v>

470
00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:19.420
which is that we're just getting information so much faster.
Right now.

471
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.410
We can not only just open up our phone and have basically the world right there,

472
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.690
but we can listen to podcasts in double speed,

473
00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:27.330
which would be listening to Shapiro in double speed.

474
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.660
<v 3>You go back in time actually.
But yeah,</v>

475
00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:32.720
I listen to you at half speed a little faster.

476
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.560
<v 2>Um,
but that the,
the,
just the,
the nature of the technology,</v>

477
00:24:37.561 --> 00:24:41.820
how it's just speeding up our ability to take in information that maybe we

478
00:24:41.821 --> 00:24:43.380
haven't evolved fast.

479
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.340
<v 1>Well,
it's also more taking in kind of pseudo information because it looks like</v>

480
00:24:48.341 --> 00:24:52.060
information,
but it's really low resolution.
And so you get a lot of it,

481
00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:55.630
but it's not,
it's not real knowledge.
It's like,
well,

482
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.810
there was a funny New Yorker cartoon where wife asked her husband,

483
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.530
do you know that or do you just Google?
No.
It.
Right.
Right.

484
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.970
And so,
and the,
but the,
the,

485
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.170
the thing about those,
those,
those shallow media,
um,

486
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.720
interactions is that you also don't have to take any responsibility for them,

487
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.670
you know,
especially if you're anonymous.

488
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.590
And that also brings out the worst in people,
you know,
and,
and,
and the,

489
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.450
the trolling phenomena in,

490
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:28.540
one of the things you notice about children for example,

491
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:30.490
is if children don't get enough good attention,

492
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:34.450
they'll certainly go after bad attention because the fundamental human currency

493
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:37.960
is attention.
And it's,
it's one thing to be hated,

494
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:40.060
but it's another thing entirely to be ignored.

495
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.950
And I would say generally speaking,

496
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:45.490
if you put people in a corner and you made them choose,
you know,
if they were,

497
00:25:45.491 --> 00:25:48.550
if they had knowledge that was transparent to themselves,
he said,

498
00:25:48.551 --> 00:25:50.190
what would you rather be ignored or hated?

499
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.710
They'd take hate it because at least then you exist because you exist,

500
00:25:53.711 --> 00:25:56.470
at least in some part in your relationship to other people.

501
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.260
And so some of the bad behavior is,

502
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.040
is rewarded precisely for that reason is that it does draw attention.

503
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:05.440
And that does make you signify,
I mean,

504
00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:09.610
you think about the people who do highness crimes,
like the,
the school shooters,

505
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.520
people like that who do these things that are almost inconceivable,

506
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.680
a huge part of the drive for that.
His fantasies about notoriety and,
and,

507
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.600
and,
and,
Yup.
And the emergence from obscurity and anonymity.
Even though it's,

508
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.120
it's notorious,
it's hatred.

509
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.630
The idea is I'd rather be dead and infamous then alive and anonymous.

510
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:31.220
Yeah.

511
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:31.791
<v 2>By the way,
you,</v>

512
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.810
I think we're one of the first websites to say we're not going to publish in

513
00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:35.330
these people.

514
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.450
<v 3>Yeah.
And then we're giving them exactly what they want.
Exactly.
Like the,</v>

515
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.580
there've been,
I don't want to take credit as like the first,

516
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:42.950
because there were several,
I'm trying their names escape me,

517
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.510
but there are other people who have been promoting this for awhile.
But yeah,

518
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:47.680
I was late to it.
We should've done it earlier.
And I told him

519
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.000
<v 1>the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about that about 10 years ago,</v>

520
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:55.830
about the idea that publicizing the names of these killers is precisely one of

521
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:58.410
the mechanisms that ensures that it will continue to happen.

522
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:02.130
And there's no doubt about that.
Now,
how to,
how to mitigate against that

523
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.303
<v 3>complicated.
I mean,</v>

524
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.520
and then that does tie to a deeper conversation that did you see this?

525
00:27:06.521 --> 00:27:10.210
This study is from the CDC that came out of that again for the second straight

526
00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:12.010
year.
Life expectancy in the United States dropped.

527
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.690
So he had consistent life expectancy increases in the United States for 150

528
00:27:16.691 --> 00:27:20.920
years.
And now for the first time in American modern American history,

529
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.200
life expectancy is now dropped for two years in a row.

530
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.480
And that's specifically due to two phenomena.

531
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.780
One is the increase in heroin overdoses and the other is suicide,

532
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.900
both as suicide is now at record rates in the modern era.

533
00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.860
And we had 70,000 heroin overdoses,
LPO,

534
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.760
Oprah overdoses last year.
Uh,
I think it was 50,000 the year before.

535
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.650
And so you're starting to see life expectancy decline.

536
00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.410
There's a crisis of meaning and that's why,

537
00:27:44.411 --> 00:27:48.100
and I think that part of the resistance to particularly I think Jordan,

538
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.970
but I think also to me and to anyone else in the IDW cause at least searching

539
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.330
for meaning is that the left has been saying for a long time that we found the

540
00:27:55.331 --> 00:27:57.940
meaning,
right?
The meaning was do what you want to do,

541
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.360
meaning was no responsibility.
Do what you want to do.
That's the meaning.

542
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.310
The meaning is rebelling against the system.

543
00:28:03.311 --> 00:28:05.650
And when it turns out that a lot of people don't find meaning in that,

544
00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:07.180
that there is,
in my perspective,

545
00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:09.880
a God shaped hole in people's heart that is being filled by hatred and

546
00:28:09.881 --> 00:28:12.400
polarization and tribalism.
Or that you just can't do it forever.

547
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:16.540
No one can maintain that,
that level forever of trying to tear everything down.

548
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.520
And it's also,
there's also,

549
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.930
<v 1>there's,
there's,
there's,
there's nothing in it,</v>

550
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:24.930
especially as your opponent weakens,
you know,
this is,
we,

551
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.220
we thought maybe we'd talk a little bit over what hierarchy.
So you know,

552
00:28:28.221 --> 00:28:32.210
the thing about,
one of the things a hierarchy does is,

553
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.320
is fundamentally is put some things above other things.
When you think,

554
00:28:36.321 --> 00:28:41.321
well the left criticize the left criticism of that,

555
00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:44.660
which is a valid criticism is that if you were wrecked a hierarchy,
well let,

556
00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:47.470
let me,
let me step one step back.
We'll,
we'll walk through this in,

557
00:28:47.471 --> 00:28:48.830
in a bit of a sequence.
Okay.

558
00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:53.831
So the first proposition would be we do have real problems because people suffer

559
00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:55.880
and like we have real problems.

560
00:28:55.881 --> 00:29:00.380
Then we would also like to solve them and that solutions do exist.

561
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.730
And that if you have a solution and then you implemented socially and so you

562
00:29:04.731 --> 00:29:07.580
have to get people to cooperate and compete around the solution,

563
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:08.750
you're going to produce a hierarchy.

564
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.530
And if the hierarchies valid than the people who are the best at producing those

565
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.440
solution to the problem,
we're going to lead the hierarchy.
Okay.

566
00:29:15.441 --> 00:29:18.080
So that would be a conservative right wing position.

567
00:29:18.081 --> 00:29:20.190
It's like we need hierarchies.
They,

568
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:24.200
they privilege values and they're necessary to solve problems.

569
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.710
And there is a relationship between the ability to solve the problem.

570
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:29.670
And the structure of the hierarchy.
Okay.
So the,

571
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.540
when we'd say that's true in hierarchies are functioning well.
Okay.

572
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.450
So that's the right wing viewpoint.
And then the left wingers would say,

573
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.680
wait a second,
your hierarchy gets rigid over time.

574
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:43.690
And also fi's and can be by people who use power instead of competence to

575
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:44.261
dominate it.

576
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.140
And they do that unfairly and they work the structure of the hierarchy.

577
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.640
And that makes it difficult for people to gain entry,
including talented people.

578
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.780
And then the hierarchy itself as a structure has a problem because dispossessed

579
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:59.890
people tend to stack up at the bottom and that all seems relevant and true.

580
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.840
Right?
So,
so then,
then you could say,

581
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:04.860
well you need the right because you need the hierarchies and,
and,

582
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.350
and they need to be implemented.
And that's what managers and administrators do.

583
00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.770
That's what conscientious people do cause they're hierarchically oriented and

584
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:13.330
it's a very efficient way of operating.

585
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:15.910
And people are actually happier within hierarchies because there's an

586
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.750
identifiable chain of command.
But then the left has its position,
which is,
yeah,

587
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:23.680
but you got to watch out for the dispossessed because they're the majority and

588
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.260
you have to make sure the thing doesn't degenerate towards tyranny.

589
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.730
So then I think the political discussion is the left and the right constantly

590
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.170
eyeing each other to make sure that the hierarchical structures maintain their

591
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.670
good health and so,
and that's why freedom of speech is necessary.
Okay.

592
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:43.990
So the,
now the,
the issue with that,

593
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.680
let's see if I can get back to where I was.
I was going with this to begin with.

594
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:53.230
Oh yes.
The issue with that is that if you are just a rebel,
you say,

595
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:56.140
well we're going to criticize the system,
whatever that is.

596
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:57.820
So that's a very vague thing to begin with.

597
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.730
You demolish that value hierarchy and,

598
00:31:00.731 --> 00:31:03.250
and the idea of value hierarchies as such.

599
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.110
But then that puts you in a terrible conundrum.

600
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.020
And this is what I've been focusing on in my public lectures,

601
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:12.970
is that if you accept the essential idea that life is suffering and life is

602
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.560
suffering tainted by malevolence,

603
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:16.810
which I think is an even more accurate formulation,

604
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.500
you have a fundamental existential problem and that's the suffering.

605
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.030
And then you need a meaning to set against that to,
to,
to,

606
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.270
to fortify you against the catastrophe.
So,

607
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.570
and if you demolish the hierarchies,
then you have no meaning.

608
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.710
There's nothing to strive for.

609
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:36.040
And without that meaning you're anxious and overwhelmed by definition.

610
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.350
We know that neuropsychologically because purpose boxes you in right at the,

611
00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:45.160
it gives you a game to play and rules to follow and then purpose gives you

612
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:47.020
something to aim at and positive emotion.

613
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.180
And so the problem with what the left is offering,

614
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:52.150
and I think this is actually the kind of problem that Sam Harris and the atheist

615
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:55.750
types of running into too,
is it's like,
well,
okay,

616
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.590
where's the purpose?
Well,
we don't have one.

617
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.500
It's just rebellion against the unfair hierarchy.
It's like,
yeah,

618
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:05.590
but the hierarchy also provides you with value.
Well that's okay.

619
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.230
It's cost is so high,
we're going to demolish the hierarchy.

620
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.290
Well then you're left with nothing.
Well,
but no,

621
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:13.420
you're not left with nothing because your left,

622
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:18.310
what you're left with is an inalienable suffering.
So nothing that's the suicide.

623
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.950
And I think that the,
the left solution to that has been intersectionality main.

624
00:32:22.951 --> 00:32:24.460
What they've done is they've just taken that higher,

625
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.060
they've taken the hierarchy and they've said the hierarchy is bad because it's

626
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:30.850
ossified and it's terrible and it's not just that they've destroyed the

627
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:35.080
hierarchy and then we are all leveled is that they've inverted the hierarchy in

628
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:35.890
certain ways.

629
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.160
That merit itself has become a sign that you are an exploiter.

630
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.860
<v 3>Yes,
right.
That if you are that you feel are on the top of the hierarchy,</v>

631
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.120
then it's because you did something wrong to get there and you hurt someone to

632
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:47.790
get there.

633
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.080
And therefore the last shall be first we're going to just take this triangle.

634
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:52.190
I'm going to flip it upside down.

635
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.110
So that way the people who are at the bottom or at the top.

636
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.300
<v 1>So I think that,
I think there's something absolutely fundamental there too,</v>

637
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.420
because I'd been trying to understand what the core issue is that drives the

638
00:33:01.421 --> 00:33:02.890
pathological left.

639
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.000
And I think it is the story of Cain and Abel fundamentally is that it's,

640
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.380
it's jealousy of the successful and,

641
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.420
and the worst kind of successful person as it turns out,

642
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:17.140
it from a jealousy perspective,
think speaking psychologically,

643
00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:19.720
it's like if you got your power arbitrarily,

644
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.560
if you inherited it or you got it unfairly,
well you're kind of annoying,

645
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.660
but you're not that annoying because you're not that good.

646
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.850
You're just lucky break.

647
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.040
And so I can be jealous of you because you're lucky and that's unfair,

648
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.370
but you're just as reprehensible as me.
Right?

649
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.740
But then let's take the alternative position.

650
00:33:35.741 --> 00:33:39.100
Let's say that I'm not taking responsibility for my life in any sense,

651
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:40.630
and I'm not bearing any more load.

652
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.500
And it turns out that not only are you successful,
but you're competent and good.

653
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.090
Well then you're a real enemy because you're a judge under those circumstances.

654
00:33:49.091 --> 00:33:51.820
Right?
Because it's,
it's your goodness in some sense,

655
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:55.690
your competence and your goodness,
that's really showing me in a negative light.

656
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.960
And instead of wanting to contend with that and to see myself reflected badly in

657
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.164
your mirror,

658
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.500
then I'm going to make the accusation that everything you've done is merely a

659
00:34:05.501 --> 00:34:09.640
consequence of power.
And,
and even deep,
more deeply,

660
00:34:09.641 --> 00:34:13.260
I'm going to criticize the idea of merit and competence itself.
Yep.

661
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.630
Because that gets me out of my self loathing,
say,
well,

662
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.930
there's none of that's real.
None of that merit.
None of that competence is real.

663
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.010
And none of the failure that I'm experiencing is a consequence of my own

664
00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:24.610
inaction.
Yep.

665
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:28.840
It's all someone and then saw someone else's fault and then I get to be

666
00:34:28.841 --> 00:34:32.440
justified in going after them as well.
Yeah.
So that's,
that's icing on the cake.

667
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.770
They can enable stories.

668
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:36.520
<v 3>I mean,
it's explicit about this.
I mean,
this isn't even buried in the text,
right.</v>

669
00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:39.940
That's explicit.
I mean,
God specifically says to Cain,
Tim Shell,
right.

670
00:34:39.941 --> 00:34:43.010
You have the capacity to overcome.
Yes.
Right.
And cater towards that.

671
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:45.440
And then he goes and kills ego.
Yup.
And that's the whole idea.
That

672
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:50.530
<v 1>crux of that story is that,
and because cane complaints to God,
right?
Says what?</v>

673
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.380
He basically says something along the life's not fair.
What happened?

674
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.190
That's right.

675
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.810
How dare you set up a universe like this where I'm breaking myself in half,

676
00:34:58.811 --> 00:35:00.220
attempting to,
you know,

677
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.960
to thrive and everything's going against me and I have my brother who,

678
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.900
who everything that he touches turns to gold.
And that's right.
God says to him,

679
00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:09.820
directly,
look to yourself.
It's,

680
00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:13.210
it's your inadequacy that's driving this and it's the last thing that came,

681
00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:13.640
wants to hear,

682
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.550
<v 3>and they tie in.
That's what makes a murderer.</v>

683
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:18.250
And I think that that is the last thing that most people want to hear.

684
00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:20.860
That's what's so attractive about a leftist ideology that doesn't actually

685
00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:24.220
provide any sense of meaning outside of the victim hood called is it this

686
00:35:24.221 --> 00:35:28.270
feeling that the last thing that people want to hear generally is look to your

687
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.570
look to yourself first.
It's a lot easier to,
I mean,
but you,

688
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.150
but it's also bad parenting,
right?
It's funny

689
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.380
<v 1>because one of the things that's happening in my lectures is because I'd doing</v>

690
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:40.530
something different,
you know,
instead of saying,
see,

691
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:43.860
I think one of the things that the conservative types do wrong with regards to

692
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:45.930
responsibility is that they,
they,

693
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.140
they conceptualize it too rigidly into terms of duty and should,

694
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.440
and that that's,
uh,
that's true.

695
00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:00.270
But it's also a mistake because what I've been suggesting to people is that no,

696
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:01.290
you don't understand,

697
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:05.340
is that all the meaning in your life is going to come as a consequence of

698
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:07.860
accepting responsibility.
It's not merely a matter of duty.

699
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:11.220
It's that you need this sustaining meaning because otherwise you,

700
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.300
you suffer stupidly and you get bitter and you get resentful and you get cruel

701
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.050
and you get homicidal and you get genocidal.
That's the whole pathway.

702
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.870
And so that's,
that's a catastrophe.
That's hell.

703
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.670
And so if you don't have something meaningful to pursue,
to,
to set against that,

704
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:31.140
that's,
that's your,
that's the degeneration of nihilism.
Okay.

705
00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:34.080
So where do you find the response?
Where do you find the meeting say,
well,

706
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:37.480
you look at people that you admire and almost all the people you admire,

707
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.870
people who take on a heavy burden of responsibility.

708
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.380
And if the responsibility is associated with the value hierarchy,

709
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.170
so you're trying to pursue something of ultimate value.

710
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.990
So that's the responsibility that gives you meaning.

711
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.890
And so you can talk to people about taking responsibility for their,
um,

712
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.940
inadequacy if you point out to them that who they could be as much better than

713
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:01.200
who they are so that there's a trajectory.

714
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:06.470
And so that the idea of taking on responsibility even for their own inadequacies

715
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:10.410
and errors is all of a sudden associated with hope and not with only

716
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.890
condemnation.
And that works.
And that like when,

717
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.820
when I lay out that line of argument in the lectures and Dave's seen this

718
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:18.654
multiple times,

719
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.860
it's always the case that the Lecture Hall School Silent People are absolutely

720
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:25.350
riveted on that idea.
And this is interesting,

721
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:27.690
I did an interview at Tucker Carlson hydrolase inherit.
He also,

722
00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:29.430
and one of the things that we talked about was,

723
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.340
and what people should do in dying towns,

724
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.500
they're in areas where the industry has left.
What should they do?

725
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:35.820
They're experiencing difficulty.

726
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.780
And I was saying that telling people that the jobs are coming back falsely is

727
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:41.250
not going to actually do anything for them.

728
00:37:41.251 --> 00:37:45.210
That the only thing that you're guaranteed in America or in a free country is

729
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.010
the adventure,
right?
That's what you're guaranteed.

730
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:50.340
And that's also what makes life meaningful is that sense of adventure.

731
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:53.310
That's what America was built on,
right?
That's the fundamental command.

732
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:55.710
The very first command that Abraham has ever given is get up,

733
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:59.410
leave the land of your fathers,
were it,
and go someplace where you,

734
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.440
I'm not going to tell you where you're going.
You're just going to go there.

735
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.050
And then when you get there,
maybe you'll know.
Right?
And that's,
and that's that.

736
00:38:04.051 --> 00:38:07.530
But I,
I think that one of the areas,
Jordan,
where you and I,
uh,

737
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:11.490
I think it'd be interesting to drill down is when it comes to directing toward

738
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.170
the purpose,
how do we define what the purpose is?

739
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:15.540
Because I think one of the things that's been difficult in the west,

740
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.920
at least since the death of the Judeo Christian value system in many ways,

741
00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:23.190
or at least the the sort of we're running on the fumes of the Judaeo Christian

742
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:24.660
value system is the truth,
but since the,

743
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.230
since the decline of the importance in many people's minds of that value system,

744
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:30.300
the decline of Biblical living has been this idea,

745
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:32.730
you can create your own meaning.
Yeah.
Right.
You just did that.

746
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.830
If you find something that you truly care about and then you pursue that thing

747
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:36.040
that you

748
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.671
<v 3>truly care about,</v>

749
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:39.790
this will bring you happiness and that may be true for a certain number of

750
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:40.330
people,

751
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.360
but the vast majority of people are incredibly crappy at coming up with their

752
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:44.170
own meetings.
Yeah.

753
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.110
There has to be something that is out there that is discoverable in order for it

754
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:49.150
to be discussed with the psychoanalysts.

755
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:51.560
That's why y'all like young so much because that was,

756
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.210
that's what made him such an astute critic of nature because nature believed we

757
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:56.440
had to create our own values.

758
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.610
But the psychoanalyst starting with Freud started to note that the values were

759
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:04.210
actually built in.
And Freud saw that first of all in dreams,
right?

760
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:07.450
And then young young took that apart in associated the dreams with the myths and

761
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:10.750
said,
no,
no,
you don't understand is that the values are built in.

762
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.360
You don't create them,
you can rediscover them.

763
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.360
And that's the resurrection of the father from the,
from,
from the,

764
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.030
from the belly of the beast.
This raise a question as to a,

765
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:20.530
and w and I have discussed this before,

766
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.610
is where exactly that moral system comes from.

767
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:27.940
So cons obviously talks about the idea that uh,
you know,
he,

768
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.820
he believes in God because of the starry sky above and the moral law with it.

769
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.410
Yeah,
you can write,
you can discover all this within.

770
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.300
I am not convinced the human beings can actually discover meaning within,

771
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.830
because if that were true,

772
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:44.070
then the prosperity and liberalism and human rights and value for individuals

773
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.110
and all the things that we associate with the good stuff in the west,

774
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.100
that would have been universal.
And it is not in fact universal.

775
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:54.190
It arose at a certain time at a particular place associated with a particular

776
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:55.024
value system.

777
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.940
This is why when people ask me about why I think the revelation is necessary,

778
00:39:57.941 --> 00:40:00.780
why it's important is because I think that without you,

779
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.370
you're going to have to make these fundamental assumption to get from point a to

780
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:06.400
point B,
you're going to have to make fundamental assumptions at point day.

781
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.850
Now you can either get that from revelation or he can just assume it and then

782
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.040
try to explain where those assumptions came from.

783
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.110
Or you can just pretend those assumptions don't exist,

784
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.740
which is I think actually what Sam sort of does.
Uh,
and I,

785
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.430
I hate to criticize him in his absence,

786
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:21.070
but I think the Tam sort of just assumed that when he says things like,

787
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.500
we're here for the greater flourishing of human beings.
Yeah.

788
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.630
You actually have to define every one of those terms that are a bunch of

789
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:28.660
assumptions baked into what all of that means that he's making.

790
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.200
And I'm not sure that Sam will acknowledge she's making them.
Um,
but the,

791
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:37.000
that's why to me,
and this is sort of thesis of my book next year,
the,

792
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.590
the West is built on the,
the basic revelations of Jerusalem.

793
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.690
Meaning you,

794
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.810
human beings are made in God's image with individual value and with individual

795
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:50.740
purpose and with a collective purpose where we get together and we pursue living

796
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.260
in a more virtuous way.
And that's one pole.

797
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.100
And the other pole is the reason of Greece where we have the capacity to look at

798
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:59.560
the world around us and draw conclusions from that world.

799
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:01.870
And on those Poles are built all of modern science,

800
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.640
our bill to all of economics are built the free speech and free and free lives

801
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:07.720
that we live right now.

802
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.280
And I think that we have been gradually over the last 200 years chipping away at

803
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:13.570
both of those polls,

804
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:16.840
Jerusalem in terms of revelation and Athens in terms of reason which we've

805
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:19.480
abandoned for postmodernism.
And that's just private support

806
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.600
<v 2>in a weird way is this the failure of the enlightenment liberals,</v>

807
00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:26.540
all the people that I grew up loving and caring about and the people that I

808
00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:30.470
still admire that and this,
this little sliver of liberals that still remained,

809
00:41:30.471 --> 00:41:34.700
that haven't bought into leftist dogma,
but that aren't necessarily

810
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.330
<v 3>religious per say or believe in these stories,
but really they,</v>

811
00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:41.600
they believe it comes from the enlightenment period.

812
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.380
I think that's a good observation that this is sort of their failure.

813
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.230
I don't mean I don't want to,
I'm not blaming their arrogance,
I would say,

814
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:50.680
because even people,
there's not enough,

815
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.440
there's not enough in the secular world to fight to fight this new release.

816
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.100
That's where I'm sort of finding myself right now,

817
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:00.230
which is an incredibly uncomfortable place.

818
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:04.610
I come from a much more atheist perspective obviously than you and certainly

819
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:09.611
where you are and yet I can see what the future is now and it's like there's

820
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.740
nothing left over there and we do need some fundamental to you because that's

821
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.890
just the position [inaudible] without the mythos underneath it.
Exactly.
You see?

822
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.750
Is that you and Sam,
while it's where I disagree with people like and Pancakes,

823
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:26.800
I mean I'm an enlightenment guy,
but the thing is is that when,

824
00:42:26.801 --> 00:42:30.110
not when I look backwards in time,
you know what,
what,

825
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.260
what people like Harrison pinker attribute to the enlightenment.

826
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.680
I see as the enlightenment being the latest flowering of a process that was

827
00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.510
indescribably older than that is exactly right.
And in the,

828
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.260
and in the historical sense,
certainly grounded in the religious traditions,

829
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.950
but and then from my perspective grounded in something that's biological,

830
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:53.270
that's far deeper than that.
Like,

831
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.340
like our true proclivity towards admiration for competence and reciprocity.

832
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.180
And I do think that has to be socialized back to your point.
So I want,

833
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:07.040
one of the things Dave mentioned before we started this was that we could have a

834
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:10.970
bit of a conversation about the difference between Judaism and Christianity in

835
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:13.500
terms of,
I'd love to get to that.
I do want to make one comment on the,

836
00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:14.990
on the neo enlightenment stuff.
So,
I mean,

837
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.140
I will say that there is a full chapter in my book that is specifically about

838
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:19.710
the views of a lot of people who I love.
You know,

839
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.080
Sam and Michael Shermer and Hank are and the whole Neil enlightenment strain of

840
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:26.990
thought that I think kind of includes general boulevard on the conservative
side.

841
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:27.290
Yeah.

842
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:31.220
And I love these guys and I feel intellectually I feel more comfortable with

843
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:35.450
that position,
but I realize I'm just being whittled away.
You can't hold much.

844
00:43:35.451 --> 00:43:39.110
So here's my basic view and my basic thesis is that there are two views of the

845
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.570
enlightenment.
One is that in general Goldberg's words,

846
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:44.810
it was the miracle that dependent as head of sprang from nowhere suddenly reason

847
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.840
dominated over revelation and it crushed revelation.

848
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.710
And in the wake of that crushing came the full flowering of economics and

849
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:55.580
humanity and freedom and liberalism and that those things were opposed reason

850
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:59.810
and revelation.
This where that these words,
and not only they weren't intention,

851
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.880
they weren't full,
simply opposed because there's truth,

852
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:03.440
that reason and revelation our intention.

853
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.190
But it is also true that certain assumptions undergird the assumptions of
reason.

854
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.240
In order for you to believe that reason exists and isn't just ate and

855
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.860
evolutionarily favorable firing of neurons,
then you have to,
if you have,

856
00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:16.820
if you like,
I think that Sam's position,

857
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:21.821
that objective truth exists in the absence of anything remotely approaching a,

858
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.420
uh,
a system of,
of assumptions is unsupportable.
It's completely unsupportable.

859
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:34.380
I think that,
I think because you are built to create more little copies of you,

860
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.230
right?
I mean this is evolutionarily speaking,
what you are created to do,

861
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.930
how that has to do with discovering objective truth is I don't really beyond me.

862
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.080
Uh,
so,
and,
and what has to do with the existence of objective truth in any,

863
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.750
in any case,
the enlightenment is based on certain fundamental assumptions.

864
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:49.950
It's based on the idea that you can act as an individual freely by making

865
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:54.210
rational decisions in a predictable world of laws,
right?
All,
all of,

866
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:56.990
every one of those assumptions is ungrounded in,

867
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.620
in a world of pure scientific determinism.
It just doesn't,

868
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:05.940
it doesn't exist.
So the [inaudible] eight itself,
what happened?
And so there is,

869
00:45:05.941 --> 00:45:08.490
what I'm seeing is that the enlightenment,
the enlightenment was,

870
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.460
and I think that you see this in college,
who's d count sees all of this.

871
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:15.930
He sees that this struggle is coming and so he attempts to reinject religion and

872
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:20.540
spirituality and God back into a moral system without actually saying so.
Right.

873
00:45:20.541 --> 00:45:21.690
Cons is not actually an atheist.

874
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:26.691
Cons is actually trying to create a rational basis for Christian revelation and

875
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:31.851
Christian reasoning so that he can avoid the trap of having to cite the Bible,

876
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.800
but he can say that all of this makes sense anyway.

877
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.021
<v 1>Well,</v>

878
00:45:35.021 --> 00:45:38.770
that's why I see this as the failure of the modern liberals because it's like

879
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.800
even with some of some of our IDW crew that most of these people,

880
00:45:41.801 --> 00:45:46.120
most of us come from the left originally and it's like,
well,

881
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:49.450
the position we're at now is there's no one on the left that will talk to any of

882
00:45:49.451 --> 00:45:51.940
us without attacking us or doing any of the usual tricks.

883
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.900
Now we've got all of these people like you and Prager and the rest of them that

884
00:45:55.901 --> 00:45:59.080
are willing to talk to us,
willing to debate all,
you know,
all of this.

885
00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.620
And I still see a hesitancy because people,
it's so,

886
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.580
it's so sort of built into people that conservatives are evil or that even

887
00:46:06.581 --> 00:46:10.300
thinking about the world through a religious lens or anything like that is

888
00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:13.720
somehow evil or dumb or,
or something like that.
And it's like,

889
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.720
I just can't play by that.
You mean?
I think that the psychoanalysts and,

890
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.860
and some of the neuroscientists that I knew to,

891
00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:22.780
the ones that were more informed about,

892
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:27.820
about emotion and motivation and also interested in dreams and instincts.

893
00:46:27.821 --> 00:46:30.580
So those would be the neuroscientists who are more concerned with emotion a

894
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.930
rather than the cognitive types.

895
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:35.200
The cognitive types are like the rationalist in the psychology field.

896
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.010
They're very,
um,
open to the two.

897
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.500
They were surprisingly open to union ideas.
You know,
the idea that,
you know,
our,

898
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:48.250
our rationality is embedded inside our emotions and that's all embedded inside

899
00:46:48.251 --> 00:46:51.520
of our motivations.
And now it's all embedded inside our bodies by,

900
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.840
so rationality isn't this,
this,
what would you call it?

901
00:46:55.841 --> 00:46:58.460
Free Floating,
uh,
uh,

902
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.890
soul in some sense that's capable of contemplating the objective world,

903
00:47:02.891 --> 00:47:07.210
but something that's deeply embedded inside all sorts of other structures on

904
00:47:07.211 --> 00:47:09.640
which its validity as dependent.

905
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.600
One of the things the psychoanalysts were so good at pointing out and that I

906
00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:15.910
think is in accordance with the neuropsychological evidence,

907
00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:19.120
is that your rationality is bounded by the dream.

908
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.470
And it's literally that way because if you are deprived of dreaming,

909
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.140
which kind of puts you in the mythic world,
then you go,

910
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.730
you literally lose your mind.

911
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:32.740
There has to be continual dialogue between revelation that would be associated

912
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:36.610
with the dreamworld and rationality or rationality cannot sustain itself.

913
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.340
And the reason for that is that as far as I can tell,

914
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:42.640
is that the assumptions of rationality are in the myth in the mythos,

915
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.380
which was the argument that I was trying to make continually with Sam.

916
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.600
And so then the question is what constitutes the myth goes?
And so you,

917
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:50.800
one of your points was,

918
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.490
well there's this idea that human beings are made in the image of God.

919
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.440
And so I've been thinking about that a lot.

920
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:59.170
And so my sense is something like this is that,

921
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.390
and you tell me what you think about this.
Okay,

922
00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:05.860
so you wake up in the morning and your consciousness emerges from nothing in

923
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:08.320
some sense.
And what you see in front of you,

924
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.970
you aren't determined like a clock in what you're going to do that day.

925
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.930
In fact,

926
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:18.340
your consciousness is in fact that part of you that deals with what is not yet

927
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:22.150
determined because all the things that you do that are fundamentally habitual

928
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.130
and deterministic are unconscious.

929
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.040
They turn into habit and you don't have conscious control over them.

930
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.030
So consciousness seems to be that element that deals with what has not yet been

931
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:32.080
determined.
Okay,

932
00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:35.440
so you wake up in the morning and what you confront as far as I'm concerned,

933
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:37.030
he has potential.
There's a,

934
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:41.020
there's a field of potential in front of you and that that's the future.

935
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:45.190
Whatever that is,
that potential,
it's,
it's what couldn't be.
And what is not yet.

936
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.570
And then as a consequence of the choices that you make guided by your ethical

937
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:53.140
aims,
then you transform that potential into actuality.

938
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.360
And you literally do that with your consciousness.

939
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.320
And I think that's the reflection of the image of God in Matt.

940
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.070
And I think that's what's put forward in the earliest sections of genesis

941
00:49:03.071 --> 00:49:04.870
because that's what God does,
right?

942
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:07.870
God is a structure he confronts nothingness with,

943
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.120
with something approximating consciousness,

944
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:13.330
the logos and the extracts out order from potential.

945
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.200
And then one of the things that's interesting about that,
there's,

946
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:19.200
there's repetition of the idea in,

947
00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.950
in genesis that if you confront potential with truth,

948
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.620
so that's the logos,
let's say with truth,

949
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:29.710
then the order that you produce is good.
So there's a,

950
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:33.220
so which is a really interesting ethical claim,
right?
You take this potential,

951
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.070
you interact with it morally,

952
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.600
the consequences of interacting and morally is that you produce reality and the

953
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:44.440
reality that you produce is good.
And then human beings are a microcosm of that,

954
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.440
that that Sienna,
that,
that's exactly right.
I mean,
I think that the,

955
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:50.560
this is the kind of philosophy in philosophy terms.

956
00:49:50.561 --> 00:49:53.530
This is basically the argument about the amenities and Thomas Aquinas who are

957
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:57.150
making this Ireland basically at the same time is that,
you know,

958
00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.630
at the beginning when it says [inaudible] she came at such a mind bad hire.

959
00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:03.040
It's that,
that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

960
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.760
What makes human beings in the image of God is our creative capacity.

961
00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:10.540
And the creative capacity is the ability to transform through an act of will.

962
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.000
Something that was not into something that is,

963
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.360
and that's what the beginning chapters of genesis are.

964
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:18.250
It's God taking things and just making them.

965
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.770
And then what makes them good is that these things are,

966
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:22.420
this is the Aristotelian part,
is the,

967
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:25.790
is that these things are directed to our purpose toward a purpose.
So what the,

968
00:50:25.791 --> 00:50:28.130
the idea of Greek rationality,
what distinguishes

969
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.610
<v 3>it from other ideas of rationality is that Greek rationality is based on a</v>

970
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:32.331
fundamental premise,

971
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:35.570
which is that you can look at a thing and the thing was made for something,

972
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.000
right?
So if you look at,
if you look at a glass,

973
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:40.640
the glass was made to hold liquid and you can tell that because that's the

974
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:41.421
nature of the glass.

975
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:44.760
So there's nothing in science is a glass was made to hold liquid is just a piece

976
00:50:44.761 --> 00:50:48.080
of of glass that is made in a certain particular shape.

977
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:53.150
But we as human beings know that this glass was made to hold liquid and that we

978
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.070
can look at the universe in the same way that we can.

979
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:57.650
We can say what was the purpose of this thing?

980
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.910
And that's why when God says that something is good,
the,

981
00:50:59.911 --> 00:51:04.370
the use of the word good in,
in Eras Tutelian thought is good,

982
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.400
is fit for the purpose.
What makes you a good pilot,
for example,

983
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:10.900
is your capacity to land a plane.
What makes this a good glass?

984
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.110
Its capacity to hold liquid.

985
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.340
And what makes you a good person is your capacity to use rationality in pursuit

986
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:19.040
of virtue and to transform the world around you and doing so.

987
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:20.240
That's what makes you a good person.

988
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.990
And so when it says in the beginning of genesis that God has the tree of good

989
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:27.620
and evil and that you are the knowledge of good and evil and it's a sin to eat

990
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:28.880
from the knowledge of good and evil.

991
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:34.300
My understanding of that is that what human beings did is instead of trying to

992
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.530
function according to figuring out what God's purpose for things was,

993
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.320
trying to figure out what the universe was to be used for in accordance with

994
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:43.010
reality,

995
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.630
we decided to super impose our own vision of what reality should be in a moral

996
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:50.480
sense and that there's a fundamental disconnect or,
and it leads to suffering.

997
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.850
<v 2>All right,
so let's,</v>

998
00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:56.020
let's dumb this down for just one second because I want to ask a question that I

999
00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:58.210
know you don't like getting when we get in the Q and A's,

1000
00:51:58.211 --> 00:52:00.820
but I think it would be interesting for the three of us to sort of kick it

1001
00:52:00.821 --> 00:52:05.590
around here,
which is for the average person that that's listening to this,

1002
00:52:05.591 --> 00:52:08.920
they can only take in so many of these ideas and so much of this right,

1003
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:12.070
and I think that actually is most people that are just living their lives.

1004
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.130
I think a certain set of people are listening to both of you and going,

1005
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.670
all right,
these two guys think that some guys talking to them from the sky,

1006
00:52:18.671 --> 00:52:20.960
I mean,
I know this is,
this is the most,
I know why this,

1007
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.010
you don't love this question because it's so ridiculous.
We oversimplified,

1008
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.300
but how,
how do you get to those people then for the people that think,
well,

1009
00:52:28.301 --> 00:52:29.740
wait a minute,
what do you,
what are you talking about?

1010
00:52:29.741 --> 00:52:31.210
Shapiro loves facts over feelings,

1011
00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:35.080
but he's talking about this imaginary sky guy that wrote this book and Blah,

1012
00:52:35.081 --> 00:52:36.700
blah,
blah.
What do you think is the,

1013
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.960
is there a psychological trick to sort of get people over that Hump if you

1014
00:52:40.961 --> 00:52:44.260
wanted them to start exploring stem of this?
Well,
you know what I mean,
we can,

1015
00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.380
we can do the high level stuff for hours and hours,
but,

1016
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:51.160
but eventually it just keeps getting to a sort of smaller and smaller place that

1017
00:52:51.161 --> 00:52:52.930
people can,
can get to.

1018
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:56.820
<v 1>All right.
So that's,
so that's so hard question and so I'll,</v>

1019
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:58.360
I'll try to address it this way.

1020
00:52:58.361 --> 00:53:01.960
So there's a line in the New Testament where Christ says that no one comes to

1021
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:06.310
the father except through him,
which is a hell of a thing for anyone to say.

1022
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.570
I mean there's a lot of statements in the New Testament that are strikingly

1023
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.380
strange in that manner.
I am the way and the truth and the life,

1024
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.120
that's another one.
It's associated with the same idea.
Yeah.

1025
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:21.580
And we'll get to some of the,
yeah.
Okay.
So,
so here's,
here's the idea and,

1026
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.940
and it,
it bears on your question,

1027
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.550
although I don't exactly know how it's as if there's a spirit at the bottom of

1028
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.880
things that is,
that is involved in the,
in the,

1029
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.360
in the bringing to being of everything.
So like,

1030
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.130
so for example,

1031
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.370
people talk about evolution as a random process,
but that's not true.

1032
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:49.260
It's not true.
The mutations are random,
but there's also a lot of sources,

1033
00:53:49.261 --> 00:53:51.510
other sources of genetic variant variation.

1034
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.850
But the selection mechanisms are not random.

1035
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.870
So now then the question is what are the selection mechanisms?

1036
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.510
So I'm going to have to go a bunch of places.
Well,

1037
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.960
well here's one selection mechanism.
It's like,

1038
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.530
so human females are very sexually selective.

1039
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.790
That's why you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestor.

1040
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:16.030
So the male failure rate for reproduction is twice that of the females.
Okay.

1041
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:20.580
So the question is,
well,
how is it that males succeed differentially?

1042
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.170
And the first answer is,
well,
females reject.
If human females reject,

1043
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.640
but then the question might be,

1044
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.360
well they reject on the basis of what and the answer is,

1045
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.060
well it's something like competence.
And then the question is,
well,

1046
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:35.550
how is competence defined?
And then the answer to that is,

1047
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:39.540
well men put themselves in hierarchies and they vote on each other's competence.

1048
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.620
And it's really counterintuitive in some sense from an evolutionary perspective

1049
00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:45.510
because you'd have to ask yourself,

1050
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:50.130
why would men put the selves in positions where they elevate some men in status

1051
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:54.150
and then give them a huge reproductive advantage given that that's to their

1052
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:58.440
reproductive disadvantage in in some sense.
Okay.
And there are reasons.

1053
00:54:59.040 --> 00:54:59.910
Part of that might be,

1054
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.240
let's say you decided to follow the best leader in a battle.

1055
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.430
Well then you don't die.
Like he might get all the women but you don't die it.

1056
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.610
So at least you're still in the game.

1057
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:11.370
And it might be the same if you're following the greatest hunter and the

1058
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:14.460
greatest hunter wouldn't be the person who is best at bringing down the game.

1059
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:18.000
It would be the person who is best at bringing down the game and sharing it.

1060
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:20.310
And organizing the next hunt and all of that,
right?

1061
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:24.090
And so men will organize themselves into groups and privileged certain men,

1062
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.790
and that puts them ahead in the reproductive hierarchy.

1063
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:31.791
And so what that means to some degree is that there's a a spirit of masculinity

1064
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:37.620
that's shaping the entire structure of human evolutionary history.

1065
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.110
That's what that means.
And then I think,
okay,

1066
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:43.560
well that might just be a biological epi phenomenon.

1067
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:48.090
And so it would be a spirit that meant it's the spirit of positive masculinity

1068
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:51.870
that manifests itself across [inaudible] ages,

1069
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:56.190
millions of years perhaps.
And it actually has shaped our consciousness actually.

1070
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.380
And so you can think about that as a figure,

1071
00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:03.570
and it would be the figure that emerges.
It's like,
it's like the,
it's like this.

1072
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.140
It's like the essential spirit of all the great men who defined what greatness

1073
00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:11.620
constituted.
That's a spirit.
Okay?
Now that's a purely biological explanation.

1074
00:56:11.621 --> 00:56:13.890
You can say,
well,
that's God.
For all intents and purposes,

1075
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.050
you might have an image of that build right into you.

1076
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.760
Even the sense that you can experience something divine and paternal might be

1077
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:23.130
merely a reflection of that evolutionary process.

1078
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:27.100
So that would be a biologically reductive argument for the existence of what we

1079
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:30.220
experience as God.
But then there's another possibility too,

1080
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:34.720
which is that that's actually reflective of a deeper metaphysical reality that

1081
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:36.760
has to do with the nature of consciousness itself.

1082
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.810
And I would say that I think that's true is I believe the biological case,

1083
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.530
and I believe the biologically reductive case,
but I don't think that exhausted.

1084
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:49.510
I think that there's a metaphysical layer underneath that,
that the bylaws,

1085
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.000
that the biology is a genuine reflection of,

1086
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.930
and that's the sort of the macrocosm above in the microcosm below that we,

1087
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.970
that we are really reflective,

1088
00:56:57.971 --> 00:57:01.510
including in our consciousness of something about the structure of reality

1089
00:57:01.511 --> 00:57:06.220
itself.
And that might involve whatever,
whatever it is that God is,

1090
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:06.821
<v 3>we'll see that.</v>

1091
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:09.220
That's why I think this is so interesting because what you're doing there,

1092
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.160
especially at the end as you're,
you're giving it a little room to say,

1093
00:57:12.161 --> 00:57:14.530
I don't know.
Right.
But you have to.
Yeah.

1094
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.830
But I think that that's what people don't want to grant,
you know,
this is fine.

1095
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:23.210
<v 1>Then God,
it's like,
well that's like,
it's,
to me that question is always like,</v>

1096
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:27.380
well,
what makes you so sure that you know that God exists?
Right?
It's like,
well,

1097
00:57:27.381 --> 00:57:31.520
I'm not sure.
I'm not willing to claim that certainty,
you know,

1098
00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.910
but well,
but I laid out target.
I know,
right?

1099
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:35.410
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:38.740
So what do you think about when he takes it all the way to that end and then

1101
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:40.600
there's that little space at the,
I mean,
again,

1102
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:43.840
I don't think that that's severely problematic in terms of just general

1103
00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:46.780
religious thought.
I mean the general religious circling back thousands of years,

1104
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:49.480
and this is why when you look at Aquinas is proofs of God.

1105
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.930
When he comes to his he,
he says basically what you say,

1106
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:54.790
which is if you go down deep enough,

1107
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.820
then you get to something and that something is what we call God.

1108
00:57:57.821 --> 00:57:59.850
So he doesn't say,
God,
he doesn't.

1109
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.230
The Bible starts from the premise God exists and he created the universe.

1110
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:06.370
Aquinas starts from we have a universe,
what's has god is there.
And he says,
what?

1111
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:07.780
When you go all the way down deep enough,

1112
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.190
there has to be a force that lies behind the combined logic of the universe.

1113
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.890
And that thing is what we call God.
Right?

1114
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:17.470
And so he's trying to reason his way back to first principles.

1115
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.110
And I think that the,
the case for God,

1116
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.830
not in the way that we think of him as like a jolly bearded guy in the sky who

1117
00:58:23.831 --> 00:58:25.480
like takes care of all of our problems or anything,

1118
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:29.110
but the idea that there is a logos,
right?
This is,
there's a structure,

1119
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:32.610
a fundamental structure to the way life is and that there was a reason and the

1120
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:37.000
fundamental purpose to why life is and what lies below that you can call God and

1121
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.893
that without,

1122
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:42.190
without some association with it well and that well your consciousness reflects

1123
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:44.620
God.
Again,
this is the,
this is one of the fundamental,

1124
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.150
this is sort of light and it says proof of God.

1125
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:48.070
Is that the principle of sufficient reason,

1126
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.460
the idea that you are capable of understanding the universe if you actually

1127
00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:55.360
believe you're capable of understanding the universe in any way.
In any way,

1128
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:58.900
then your mind has to in some if you believe in objective reality as Sam does

1129
00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:02.620
and you believe that your mind is capable of grasping and objective reality,

1130
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:06.190
not evolutionarily beneficial reality,
but an objective reality,

1131
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.770
your mind is reflecting a greater mind,
right?

1132
00:59:08.771 --> 00:59:10.360
Your mind is reflecting a greater logic.

1133
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:14.380
Well what stands behind that greater logic?
It must be something,
right?

1134
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:16.780
And so this is the idea that there is a guy that stands behind that.

1135
00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.620
So the proof for God I think honestly is,
is not supremely difficult.

1136
00:59:20.621 --> 00:59:21.710
And I think that we all do have,

1137
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:26.660
whether it's biologically sourced or in my view logically sourced a belief that

1138
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.480
there is a structure to the universe of predictable structure to the universe

1139
00:59:29.481 --> 00:59:33.170
that didn't emerge out of simple randomness and there is a reason that things

1140
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:34.430
are the way that they are.

1141
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.850
And that from that we can draw the fact that we are capable of acting within

1142
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:40.610
that logical universe of everything were sheer chaos.
You could not act,

1143
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:42.170
you'd be paralyzed by the caseloads around you.

1144
00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.670
So would you both argue them that at a micro level and at the individual level,

1145
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:48.650
you could live a perfectly good,

1146
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:53.450
decent life with whatever moral subset you create your thoughts with that.

1147
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:57.110
But I think ultimately you're both making the argument that at a macro level of

1148
00:59:57.111 --> 00:59:59.690
society just can't,
can't function without

1149
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.000
<v 1>the mythos.
No,
you're embedded in that.
And so,
well,</v>

1150
01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.530
and I was talking about this Christian idea too.
So,

1151
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.730
so I've been thinking about that statement about um,

1152
01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:12.550
no one comes to the father except through me and thought,
okay,

1153
01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:15.020
well what does that mean exactly?
And I've worked a lot,

1154
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.800
a lot of this out over these lectures that you know,

1155
01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:19.840
that you and I have been participating in.
Well,

1156
01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:24.841
so there is this notion and that that height and Luke and offer also pursuing

1157
01:00:25.031 --> 01:00:27.970
in,
in the coddling of the American mind that,
you know,

1158
01:00:27.971 --> 01:00:32.170
one of the ways that you in noble people and encourage them is by having them

1159
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:36.280
confront things that are,
um,
frightening to them that are beyond them.

1160
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:37.121
So what do you,

1161
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:39.550
what you really want to do is you want to optimally challenge people.

1162
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.570
And what that does is make them braver and stronger,
not less afraid.

1163
01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.060
It makes them more courageous and more competent.
Okay.

1164
01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:49.060
And I would say the clinical evidence for that is overwhelming.
If you,

1165
01:00:49.061 --> 01:00:53.200
if you pull a hundred educated clinicians and use,
and you say to them,
well,

1166
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:57.730
is there utility in having people get their ethical story straight and face the

1167
01:00:57.731 --> 01:01:00.460
things that they're avoiding?
They're all going to say yes,

1168
01:01:00.461 --> 01:01:02.500
those are fundamental fundamentally curative.

1169
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.320
And this is quite literally what we're doing.
The reverse side of that college.

1170
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:08.170
Yes,
exactly.
It's quite literally the reverse of that.
Okay,
so now here,

1171
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.210
here's the idea.
Here's the idea.

1172
01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:15.211
So imagine that you are in some sense the embodiment of that paternal spirit

1173
01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:20.410
that has characterized mankind since the dawn of time.
It's locked in you,

1174
01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:23.430
it's part of your potential.
And maybe that's coated,

1175
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.960
that's coded at least in part biologically,

1176
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:30.880
but it's also caught coated sociologically.
It's,
it's in the air,
so to speak,

1177
01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:34.060
around you in,
in the Ms. Olsen,
in the stories we tell each other.
Okay.

1178
01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:36.250
So now what you decide to do,
and this is,

1179
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.190
this is where I think we could have an interesting conversation about the

1180
01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:42.640
relationship between Judaism,
Christianity.
So there's an idea in Christianity,

1181
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.020
which is I think the central idea,

1182
01:01:44.021 --> 01:01:49.021
which is that you need to face the potential for malevolence that exists within

1183
01:01:49.601 --> 01:01:50.434
you and in the world.

1184
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:53.860
So that's Christ confrontation with the devil in the desert with Satan in the

1185
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:54.430
desert.

1186
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:57.370
You have to come to terms with that malevolence that's part of the existence.

1187
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:01.210
And you have to voluntarily accept the burden of suffering.

1188
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.990
And so that's the acceptance of the cross.
Okay?
So you take on that,

1189
01:02:04.991 --> 01:02:05.920
you say the suffering.

1190
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:09.310
So there's an idea that Christ is a messianic figure because he took the

1191
01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:10.810
suffering of the world onto himself.

1192
01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.420
And what that means to me is that he was someone speaking,
um,

1193
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:19.030
conceptually who decided that the suffering of the world,

1194
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.010
his responsibility,
and that that's what you're supposed to do.

1195
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.710
You're supposed to decide that that's your responsibility.

1196
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.370
You take that on bar as a burden.
You do the same with the malevolence.

1197
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.180
So when you read history,
you read history as a perpetrator,
right?

1198
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.680
Maybe you also read it as a victim,

1199
01:02:34.681 --> 01:02:38.400
but you certainly read it as a perpetrator and then that's on you.
Okay,

1200
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.980
so then the question is what happens when you do that?

1201
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.730
And I would say the answer is two things,
is that first of all,

1202
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.220
it starts to force you to develop,

1203
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.750
like to learn what you need to learn in the world and to absorb the information

1204
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:55.620
that would enable you to start to face the suffering and to rectify it.

1205
01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:58.050
So that forces you to become a more competent person.

1206
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.290
And that's the socialization part that you thought of is so important.

1207
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.510
But then there's a secondary thing that happens too,

1208
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:08.511
which is that taking on that additional stress and demand voluntarily transforms

1209
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:14.100
you buy a logically,
because within your genetic structure,

1210
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:18.720
let's say there's all sorts of potential,
but that won't be unlocked and lasts.

1211
01:03:18.721 --> 01:03:22.130
You place yourself in a position where the demands necessitated.

1212
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.810
And so by following that pathway,
truth,

1213
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.370
let's say the acceptance of suffering and the confrontation with malevolence,

1214
01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.330
so that's the heaviest load that you could take on.

1215
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:35.570
Then you actually produce a psychophysiological slash spiritual transformation

1216
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:40.611
in yourself that matures you into like the representation of the father on

1217
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:43.020
earth.
That's why that,
that's how that

1218
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.900
<v 2>lays itself.
So I'm glad.</v>

1219
01:03:44.901 --> 01:03:47.300
I'm glad he got us here because the question that I sent you,
I,

1220
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:48.320
there was only one thing I said,

1221
01:03:48.321 --> 01:03:51.980
do you guys know when we started that I wanted to get to something about most of

1222
01:03:51.981 --> 01:03:54.290
the lectures that you are when we're doing these things,

1223
01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.600
you're usually talking about the old testament now,

1224
01:03:56.601 --> 01:03:58.860
obviously you're an old testament guy.
Couldn't find my,

1225
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:03.890
my question was do you think that Ben or or just people that believe in the old

1226
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.490
testament exclusively are missing something?

1227
01:04:07.491 --> 01:04:11.000
So you just laid out a case of something that potentially is missing there.

1228
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.790
Do you use them that is aimed at fair oaks?

1229
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:13.241
<v 3>Well,</v>

1230
01:04:13.241 --> 01:04:18.241
what I'm going to argue is that what you just said is fundamentally Unchristian

1231
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:22.120
in the sense that you're saying that everyone is supposed to imitate Jesus.

1232
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.130
And the basic conceit of,
from what I understand,
uh,

1233
01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.580
speaking with Christian theologians,

1234
01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.670
is that we are fundamentally and capable of taking on our own sin.

1235
01:04:30.671 --> 01:04:34.390
And so we have to have somebody who comes in the form of Christ on earth in

1236
01:04:34.391 --> 01:04:36.400
order to accept that suffering for us.

1237
01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.750
And that that is the purpose of God actually embodying himself in Christ is to

1238
01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.260
provide human beings the capacity to withdraw from original sin.

1239
01:04:44.261 --> 01:04:47.440
That we don't actually have the capacity beyond a certain point to overcome.

1240
01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.140
And that's why Jesus as a singular figure is necessary.

1241
01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:53.380
I actually agree from a Judaic point of view with everything that you say,

1242
01:04:53.381 --> 01:04:57.730
because for me it's about accepting the responsibility for my own sins on
myself.

1243
01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.660
And I don't have the ability to say that there is the,
the suffering servant,

1244
01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:06.100
the suffering lamb of God who sacrificed himself to relieve me of my sins and

1245
01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:07.630
therefore gives me a fair shot at life.

1246
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.630
<v 1>Yeah,
we'll see.
We'll cute.
That's a,
that's a really good objection I think.</v>

1247
01:05:10.631 --> 01:05:14.390
And I think that there's a fair bit of confusion about that in the Christian

1248
01:05:14.391 --> 01:05:15.650
community,
for example.

1249
01:05:15.651 --> 01:05:20.651
So I would say that perspective is more explicitly Protestant and then then I

1250
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:22.690
would put the Catholics next to that,

1251
01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:25.810
but then I would put the orthodox types fairly far away from that,

1252
01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.930
which is why so many Orthodox Christians I think have been interested in what

1253
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:31.480
I'm saying because their sense,

1254
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.900
and this is where my knowledge of Christian theology starts to run out because

1255
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:38.760
if like I'm not an expert on,
you know,
in the,
in the doctrinal differences,
right.

1256
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.733
Um,

1257
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.440
their sense is that it's the invitation that's of primary importance.
Now it's,

1258
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.410
it's a weird thing because even in classical Christianity you have let,

1259
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.550
let's say,
Protestant Christianity,
you have this idea that,
well,

1260
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.130
Christ died to save us all from our sins.
And so we're already redeemed.

1261
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.690
But that doesn't alleviate the moral burden weirdly enough because you'd think

1262
01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:01.990
it should.
So there's this paradox,
and I think it's,

1263
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:06.280
I think part of the reason for that,
this is,

1264
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:10.300
this is an extraordinarily complicated thing,
but in the brothers,

1265
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:14.530
Karamazov Christ comes back to Earth,
right?
And,
um,
in Seville,

1266
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.790
during the Spanish inquisition,

1267
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:19.420
and so he's doing his miracles and raising people from the dad and like being

1268
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.820
all my messianic,
and first thing that happens is the inquisitor rests,
right?

1269
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.840
Throws him in prison,
and then comes to visit them and basically says,
look,
um,

1270
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.880
the last thing we need after setting up this church for 2000 years is you,

1271
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.150
you're a lot of trouble.
You've put a moral burden on human beings,

1272
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:39.010
that's too much for them to bear.

1273
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.420
And so what we've done is watered it down and put some intermediaries in place

1274
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:48.540
so that the moral demand that your example required doesn't just crush people

1275
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:52.810
into nothingness,
right?
So every ideals a judge,
right?

1276
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:55.870
So then you have the ultimate ideal.
That's the ultimate judge.

1277
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:59.260
And from the inquisitor's point of view,
that judge was too much.

1278
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.990
It was too demanding.
And so I think there's an,
and so,
so anyways,

1279
01:07:03.991 --> 01:07:07.000
so the inquisitor goes through all this argument says we're going to have to,

1280
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.020
you know,
get rid of you again because you're just too much to bear.

1281
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:15.250
And so Christ lessons and doesn't says any,
doesn't say anything.

1282
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:18.160
And then just when the inquisitor stands to leave,

1283
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.120
Christ kisses him on the lips and the inquisitive turns white in shock and then

1284
01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.090
leaves.
But he leaves the door open.
And that's the brilliant,

1285
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.070
that's a brilliant ending of,
of Dostoyevsky's pacesetter yeah.
Yeah.

1286
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.090
What makes him such a genius?
Because he basically says something like,
well,
look,

1287
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:38.740
the,
the Catholic Church did reduce the burden and it is corrupt in the way that

1288
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:43.210
earthly organizations are likely to be corrupt.
And it does allow an out,

1289
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.250
which is why you can put your sins on Christ,

1290
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:47.110
let's say in that alleviates your moral burden.

1291
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:50.470
But it still keeps the damn door open.
Well,
the tabs,

1292
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.030
<v 3>so this is why I think it's really fascinating having,</v>

1293
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.060
having spent a lot of time with Christian theologians in the past couple of

1294
01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:00.710
years writing this book.
Is that the original conceit?
I think when,
when,

1295
01:08:00.711 --> 01:08:03.470
when you talk with people who are Christian and Jewish and you have sort of

1296
01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:04.840
interfaith conversations,
uh,

1297
01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.800
the original one sentence can see the difference between them is that will

1298
01:08:07.801 --> 01:08:10.910
you'll hear from Jews is Judaism's acts based in Christianity is faith based.

1299
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.090
G Christianity's about the acceptance of Christ.
When you accept Christ,

1300
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:17.640
then you've accepted,
you need to accept and everything flows they're from.

1301
01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.380
And Judaism says it's not just about accepting God,

1302
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:22.760
it's all these myths vote right there.

1303
01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:25.640
All these commandments that you have to do and these are what perfect you as a

1304
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:26.530
human being.
It's,

1305
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.300
it's the performance of these commandments accepting God's sovereignty because

1306
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:30.410
he's the one who gave the commandments,

1307
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.380
but you actually have to act in the world.
And if you don't act in the world,

1308
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.410
then you haven't fulfilled your responsibility in the world.

1309
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:38.390
And it could also be an argument where you could have,

1310
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.100
although I know you wouldn't be thrilled per say,

1311
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:44.480
you could have Jewish atheist in that they believe that it's just their actions

1312
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:48.550
here.
Yes,
100% certain.
So this is why,
you know,
Jews have had VR,

1313
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.450
and I think most Christians believe this too.

1314
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.810
The idea of having a moral atheist is not really a difficult idea.

1315
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.230
It's the idea of having a system built on atheism that's completely immoral and

1316
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.240
will fall apart almost immediately.

1317
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:02.840
And the idea of having a moral system builds on atheism.

1318
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:05.600
If you examine your atheism closely enough,
I think falls apart.

1319
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:09.380
I think that moral atheism is basically you separating your morality from your

1320
01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:11.750
atheism and then ignoring your atheism in pursuit of the morality,

1321
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:13.670
which is what you can live fine that way,
that's fine.

1322
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.550
But I don't think that that's psychologically sustainable.
Um,

1323
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.300
if you actually examine the core of your ideas.
But with that said,

1324
01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:25.220
I think that Christianity after its original millenarian viewpoint,
when,

1325
01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:29.120
when Christianity first came about the idea of Christ on earth was that he had

1326
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:33.680
ushered in the Messianic era because this was,
it was,
it was a new era.

1327
01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:36.290
It was a new day.
And then it turns out that people have around,
they went,
well,

1328
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:38.840
this looks a lot like the old day.
Right?
And I'm not that much has changed.

1329
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.330
And so what changed?
What changed was our spiritual status.

1330
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:45.110
That was the new redefinition of the Messianic era is that the,

1331
01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:48.140
the what Christ had brought to earth was a new spirit right here.

1332
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.490
He brought a new spirit into the earth and he cleansed people of their sins and

1333
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:55.880
giving them a fresh shot at life basically.
Uh,
and that in doing so,

1334
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:59.360
he changed the nature of,
of how things work.
Well,
Judaism basically said,
well,

1335
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.950
we never thought that that nature change in the first place.
Right?
That's,
that's,

1336
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.330
that's something different.
And so,
ironically enough,

1337
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:09.170
I think one of the sources of Christian antisemitism over time is an attempt to

1338
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:13.550
distinguish what makes Christianity different from Judaism other than Christ.

1339
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:18.790
Because Christianity and Judaism in most of their main philosophies have an

1340
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:22.550
awful lot in common.
It's interesting.
I just interviewed,
um,
a,
uh,

1341
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:26.060
a fellow named John Macarthur,
who's a major pastor,
major Christian theologian.

1342
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:29.780
I interviewed him a couple of days ago for our Sunday special and this came up.

1343
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:30.350
I asked him,

1344
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.110
so where do you think the differences are between Christianity and Judaism?

1345
01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.560
And he basically said,
Jesus,
right?
That's the difference.

1346
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:40.070
And I think that that is the mostly honest answer because when I hear Christian

1347
01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:42.830
theologians tried to distinguish Judaism from Christianity,

1348
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.510
what they say about Judaism,

1349
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:49.250
I find to be not accurate as to what Judaism actually says.

1350
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.280
And when I hear Jews tried to distinguish Christianity from Judaism,

1351
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.640
I think that,
and I'm not saying they're the same thing because they're not,

1352
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:56.840
obviously they're different belief systems,

1353
01:10:56.841 --> 01:10:58.430
but in terms of the underlying value system,

1354
01:10:58.431 --> 01:11:02.000
the reason that we say Judeo Christian value system is because in terms of the

1355
01:11:02.001 --> 01:11:06.710
value system itself,
the commonalities are overwhelming.
They're overwhelming.

1356
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:10.820
The differences are mostly doctrinal and historical.

1357
01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.120
And in terms of what you think God,

1358
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 1>I think the Christians read back in and ask based version of their own lives</v>

1359
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:21.210
through a variety of mechanisms.
Whether they say,
well,
predestination exists,

1360
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.150
but in order to show that if I really elect,
I would be acting this way,
right?

1361
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:27.240
That is an ax based version.
It's just retroactive from the end.

1362
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.580
And so this is why if you say to a Christian,

1363
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:32.850
so you really believe that you can lead a terribly dissolute awful,

1364
01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:35.760
terrible life.
But if you believe in Christ with the full fiber of your being,

1365
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:39.090
you're going to heaven.
And they'll say,
and many of them will say yes,

1366
01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:41.700
but then you say,
but what makes a good person?
And they'll say right now,

1367
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.430
but what they will always add.
But if you believe in Christ,

1368
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:47.040
you wouldn't do all of those things.
Well that's,
that's the thing.
Well not,

1369
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:49.230
and that's why people are always criticizing me.

1370
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:52.350
When I give an answer to the question that you just asked because my,

1371
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:57.570
my answer has been,
well,
I act as if God exists.
Well that's kind of weaselly.

1372
01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:01.170
It's like,
no,
it's not because it gets to the,
to the core of this.

1373
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.890
What do you mean by belief?
Well,
do you believe in Christ?
Well,

1374
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.190
does that mean you utter the words that he existed?
Well,

1375
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.440
that's a pretty shallow form of belief.
In fact,

1376
01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:13.830
I think that's no form of belief at all.
In fact,
it says in the New Testament,

1377
01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:18.210
Christ himself says something along the lines of not all those who uttered the

1378
01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:21.960
words,
Lord,
Lord,
will be saved.
Right?
And so,
and niches,

1379
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.340
criticism of Christianity,

1380
01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:28.230
doctrinal Christianity was basically based on the idea that Christianity had

1381
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:32.610
taken the easy route out by insisting upon the statement of faith rather than

1382
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:36.840
the embodiment of the belief in action,
which would be the imitation of Christ.

1383
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.690
Which by the way,
is Jesus' original criticism of Judaism.
Right?

1384
01:12:39.691 --> 01:12:42.390
Is that everybody takes the the commandments extraordinarily seriously,

1385
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.760
but they don't take the spirit of the commandments.
Yes,
exactly.
That's right.

1386
01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:49.170
That's exactly right.
It is the same.
It's the same thing.
And so you know,
niches,

1387
01:12:49.171 --> 01:12:52.410
criticism of Christianity was that there were very few real Christians because

1388
01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:54.930
they didn't take on the burden of the action.

1389
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.180
And I would say it's the belief has actually manifested in the burden of the

1390
01:12:59.181 --> 01:13:01.140
action.
Now,
you might want to say,

1391
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.290
you might want to be in a position if you are Christian,
to say,
well,

1392
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.310
my explicit statements of belief match what I act out,

1393
01:13:08.311 --> 01:13:10.020
because maybe there'd be a unity in that.

1394
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.810
But the fundamental issue is what you is,

1395
01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:15.510
what the belief is manifested in what you do,

1396
01:13:15.511 --> 01:13:19.170
because that's what you state for me.
Belief is what you stake your life on.

1397
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.920
That's belief and you stake your life on what you act out.

1398
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:26.340
And so you're trying to act out the idea that while that you take,

1399
01:13:26.341 --> 01:13:29.490
I think that you take on the suffering of the world and the malevolence of the

1400
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:32.350
world as your responsibility.
You know,
and let's really fascinating,

1401
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.020
and I think that what this comes down to,

1402
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:38.340
a lot of this debate comes down to which from which end you're teaching.

1403
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.530
I think that it's almost two sides of one coin.

1404
01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.660
And if you're talking to a bunch of people who are not religious,

1405
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:43.650
you don't believe in the Bible,
right?

1406
01:13:43.651 --> 01:13:45.660
You're talking to an adult who looks at the Bible.
It says,

1407
01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:47.790
I don't believe all of these ridiculous miracles happen.

1408
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.300
Why should I bother engaging?
Why,
why should I believe all this stuff?

1409
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.750
And my argument has always been because you do believe all this stuff,

1410
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.930
you're just pretending that you don't in the sense that you don't care about the

1411
01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:00.540
historical circumstance,
but all the things that you're acting out in daily life.

1412
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.140
I sent this to Sam right on stage,
uh,
is,
is that,
you know,

1413
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.650
you and I hold 95% same valleys.
Where do you think those came from?
And Sam said,

1414
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:09.200
well,
you know,
I've done a lot of studying,
a lot of videos said,

1415
01:14:09.201 --> 01:14:12.340
but that doesn't explain why you and I hold 95% of the same values

1416
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.660
<v 3>because I haven't done any of those things.
Right.</v>

1417
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:16.870
I didn't spend any time studying the,
the philosophies of the east,

1418
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.320
the reason we hold 95% the same values because you grew up in a Judaeo Christian

1419
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:22.300
civilization with 3000 years of common history.

1420
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:25.900
That's why we share the same value system.
Most rooms on a,
on a river in Brazil.

1421
01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:26.610
Exactly.
And,

1422
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:30.010
and somehow we end up in pretty much the same place about what we think is

1423
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:33.130
actually important in life,
in which liberties are important in all this stuff.

1424
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.920
And we have disagreements around the edges.
But this is the west,
right?
This is,

1425
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:38.950
the West is different.
It is not the same as other philosophies.

1426
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.050
And so when I'm talking to people about that,

1427
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:43.330
the case that I'm making is you are part of this great river of history.

1428
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:44.920
You can pretend you're not part of that great river.

1429
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.710
You can pretend you're not living off the fumes of that river you are living.

1430
01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.100
You can pretend that the gas tank is running on its own.
It ain't okay you,

1431
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:55.330
there's a,
there's a deposit of fuel and you are still living off that.

1432
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:58.810
That's but,
but that is a different thing than what you see to child.

1433
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:02.800
And this is where I think that that things become different because I think that

1434
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:04.600
your philosophy,
Jordan,

1435
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.840
is self-sustaining to a group of people who are looking at re at the values they

1436
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:15.430
live and saying,
where did these come from and how do I justify these values?

1437
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:19.480
But I think that it'd be very difficult to teach child values before you teach

1438
01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.840
the math.
So I think that you're coming at people and saying to them,

1439
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.650
your values can be justified by the myth.
Yeah.

1440
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:29.340
But when you're teaching a child values,
it's a myth you have to teach.

1441
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:31.540
You don't have to keep teaching the kids the story first of course,

1442
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:34.120
and then come the values.
And so the,
and so there's a difference between,

1443
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:36.540
and this is why even listen,
unless you teach the storage.
Firstly,

1444
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.200
and this is why as a religious person,

1445
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:43.180
I teach my kids the stories first because the values are embedded in the stories

1446
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.030
and what I do.
I have questions about stories.

1447
01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:47.980
What rational person wouldn't have questions about the stories.

1448
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:51.070
Of course you have questions about the reality or the historicity of the stories

1449
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.710
that doesn't undercut,
number one,
the importance of the stories.
And number two,

1450
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:57.550
the point is that you have to believe the fundamental assumptions embedded in

1451
01:15:57.551 --> 01:16:01.940
the stories,
whether or a in order for the values to in order [inaudible].

1452
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.350
That's exactly why you said before that the enlightenment couldn't have just

1453
01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:07.030
sprung out of nothing.
Right?
I mean that's,

1454
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.030
that's exactly what you were saying that it needed all of the bedrock would

1455
01:16:10.031 --> 01:16:13.210
think that for people who are fundamental evolutionary biologists,

1456
01:16:13.211 --> 01:16:14.650
and I kept trying to make this case to,

1457
01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.190
while you can make a case like that to pinker in the psychologist,

1458
01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:19.240
but also the Harris,
it's like what do you get?

1459
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.390
Where do you guys get off thinking that this is a consequence of the last 300

1460
01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:26.050
400 years?
Right?
It's like we're,
we're looking at time spans.

1461
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:28.360
Even the enlightenment figures,

1462
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:31.840
they lived in a world that was like 6,000 years old.
We're living in a world,

1463
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:33.430
there's three and a half billion years old.

1464
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.580
You have to extend your thinking about the origins of phenomena,

1465
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:42.040
like like morality,
way past,
way back past the enlightenment.

1466
01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.160
And so this adventure thing,
this is a good example of,

1467
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:49.210
of the wisdom that's embedded in those myths.
So I didn't know that.

1468
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.130
I will say sorry to just pause for a second.

1469
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:54.810
And I would say in that history specifically because as a point of belief,

1470
01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:57.220
I do believe that this is a historical circumstance.
Uh,

1471
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.020
and whether you call it myth or history,

1472
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.960
as long as you believe the reality of myth and you and I believe in reality in

1473
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:05.140
different ways and this is part of the fundamental distinction because my

1474
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:09.560
understanding is that your understanding of what is true and what is real is an

1475
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:10.280
almost

1476
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.420
<v 1>a quasi utilitarian channels purse view of it because you recommended me to</v>

1477
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:18.070
books,
but my view is much more like Samson,

1478
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.140
the sense that most religious people believe the objective truth about

1479
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:24.980
historical myth,
but when it comes to getting beyond that question,

1480
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:26.690
then I think we're almost completed agreement.

1481
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.370
The strange thing is too with these mythological stories is that like there are

1482
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:36.170
forms of abstraction that are more true than then what they're abstracted from.

1483
01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:36.430
Right.

1484
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:40.040
My mathematics is like that and I'm going to do a bunch of lectures on exodus

1485
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:43.130
and I think the mosaic story is a really interesting example of that is like

1486
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:48.740
what a good piece of here's a kind of truth.
This is literary truth.

1487
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.520
And it's true is that while this happened,

1488
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.640
then this happened and this happened and this happened and there was a pattern

1489
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:58.460
about what happened.
And let's call that the heroic pattern,

1490
01:17:58.461 --> 01:18:02.330
for lack of a better word.
And so the question is,
well,
what's the reality?

1491
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:07.070
Is the reality of the specifics of what happened in each person's individual

1492
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:11.690
life or is it the general pattern that manifested itself across all those
people?

1493
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.790
And I would say if you want to extract out guidelines for proper living than the

1494
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.420
reality is the abstraction that's that's,

1495
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:21.530
that's pulled out of the multiple stories.

1496
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.220
And so even if the story of Moses is a composite story,
in some sense,

1497
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:28.210
that doesn't mean it's not true.
It's true the way,

1498
01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.420
and this is something that I could never make headway with,
with regards to Sam.

1499
01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:36.230
It's like,
well,
is there literary truth?
Well,

1500
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.820
there better be because otherwise,

1501
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:41.720
what is the use of literature and how do you rank order literature in terms of

1502
01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:44.960
quality,
if there's no standard of truth?
Well,
what's the truth?

1503
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:49.730
While it's an abstraction.
And if you don't think that abstractions are true,

1504
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:53.570
then you're not thinking because you can easily make a case that a proper

1505
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:56.930
abstraction is more real than the thing from which it's abstracted.

1506
01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:00.410
You certainly make that case with mathematics.
And so these stories,

1507
01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:02.930
it's not only that they have pragmatic utility,

1508
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.870
although I tried to explain things biologically when I can do that,

1509
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.890
it's that that utility is true in the broader sense,

1510
01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:12.320
that we've been describing truth.
And so this,

1511
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:16.460
the Abrahamic story with the call to adventure is very interesting.
So,
um,

1512
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.670
and it's something else that I've been lecturing to my audiences about.
It's,

1513
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:23.720
well,
what's the purpose of life?
What's an adventure?
Well,
where do you see that?

1514
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:26.450
Well,
you see that in the Abrahamic story in particular because Abraham's,

1515
01:19:26.451 --> 01:19:28.640
this guy who's fit,
who fails to launch,
right?

1516
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:32.390
He's 80 and he's still in his father's Tanton.
God says,
you don't get that.
Yeah.

1517
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:36.170
Well,
and that's the call,
right?
What is that you think?
Well,

1518
01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.480
there's a call to adventure while there is a call to adventure.

1519
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.360
Young Men die without that call to adventure.

1520
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:44.840
That's what attracts them to Isis for God's sake,
is the call to adventure,
right?

1521
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:46.220
And you can say,
well,

1522
01:19:46.221 --> 01:19:51.221
that's warped and twisted in those individuals because the society hasn't cat

1523
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.530
catalyze that into the proper channels,
right?

1524
01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:58.670
It hasn't given them a moral equivalent to war in William James terms,

1525
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.730
it hasn't called them out properly,
but God calls out Abraham.

1526
01:20:01.731 --> 01:20:05.240
And all that happens to Abraham to begin with is that he encounters a famine and

1527
01:20:05.241 --> 01:20:09.330
a tyranny and a conspiracy to steal his wife.
Like it's a bloody catastrophe.

1528
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.160
And you think,
oh,
I see.
Well,

1529
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.640
it isn't that God is calling you out to happiness.

1530
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.150
He's calling you out to the great adventure of your life.
Right?

1531
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:21.690
And that comes along with the suffering and the burden and the malevolence and

1532
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:25.080
all of that.
And so it's something grand and noble,
like a,

1533
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.610
like a seafaring expedition on the high seas.
It's not,
it's not

1534
01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.690
<v 3>that impulsive,</v>

1535
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:36.220
self-gratifying immediate happiness that seems to be,
what would you say,

1536
01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:40.010
the obsession of our current culture.
So I'm ready to call too.

1537
01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.850
It's called the physical adventure that I think people are lacking right now.

1538
01:20:42.851 --> 01:20:45.940
But I think it's also called the spiritual adventure in the sense that you are

1539
01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:50.740
supposed to see how your values stack up against reality.

1540
01:20:50.741 --> 01:20:53.530
I mean this is the most famous story of Abraham and said,
well,

1541
01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.880
the most famous story is the,
is the sacrifice of Isaac.
And in that story,

1542
01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.300
my view of that story is that I've never found that story particularly puzzling.

1543
01:21:01.301 --> 01:21:03.520
A lot of people find that story particularly puzzling because it's God's saying,

1544
01:21:03.521 --> 01:21:04.660
you know,
go sacrifice your son.

1545
01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.950
But to me what he's actually saying is the fundamental truth.

1546
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.550
That story is the fundamental truth of raising a child and committing to

1547
01:21:12.551 --> 01:21:13.120
something.

1548
01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.380
Because what God is actually saying to Abraham is you have to put your child at

1549
01:21:17.381 --> 01:21:19.720
risk of death to live for a certain set of values.

1550
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:23.020
And then Abraham has another say,
has enough faith to say,

1551
01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.180
and I trust that God is not actually going to kill my child.

1552
01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:27.580
But by committing to the set of values,

1553
01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:30.730
I am in fact putting my child at risk of putting your child in the world.

1554
01:21:30.731 --> 01:21:35.170
And yes,
that's right.
And not only that you're doing so on behalf of your family,

1555
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:39.790
you're doing so on behalf of,
of the,
of your God you're doing so on behalf of a,

1556
01:21:39.791 --> 01:21:42.100
of a broader purpose.
And by the way,
this is what it means to be,

1557
01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:46.630
I think an emissary,
a fighter,
and a soldier and an emissary for the west.

1558
01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:48.640
I think this is true particularly,
you know,
as a Jew,

1559
01:21:48.641 --> 01:21:51.100
I think there's always been true of Jews.
Because here's the reality.

1560
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:55.420
Every time I see some,
my son is born,
eight days later we circumcise him,

1561
01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:58.840
we take a baby and we pre commit him and we say,
this is going to be your life.

1562
01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.180
Now your life is,
I am pre committing you.
This is me doing,

1563
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.860
you know what Abraham did?
Isaac,

1564
01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:06.370
I am putting my child in more danger by circumcising him and making him a Jew

1565
01:22:06.371 --> 01:22:08.930
than I would otherwise be because Jews are a lot more danger in the,

1566
01:22:08.931 --> 01:22:12.060
in the world than other people.
And,
and,

1567
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.350
but that's the point is that I'm saying to my child,

1568
01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.840
I pre commit you to this struggle.

1569
01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:20.800
I pre commit you to the set of values and that does put you at additional risk,

1570
01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:23.770
but that's also what gives you meaning and throughout your history,

1571
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:26.090
sometimes God doesn't find the ram in the thicket.
Right?

1572
01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:29.410
Sometimes there is no ram in the thicket.
Sometimes the kids die.
Right?
Okay.

1573
01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:29.851
That is it.

1574
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:32.830
That is the reality of life and it's also the reality of committing to any value

1575
01:22:32.831 --> 01:22:33.540
system worth committing to.

1576
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.190
It's so interesting because I don't know that I've heard you talk about this in

1577
01:22:36.191 --> 01:22:39.580
the lectures,
the specific issue through the biblical Lens,

1578
01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:42.640
but this is so consistent with everything else you talk about,

1579
01:22:42.641 --> 01:22:45.850
about how to be a good parent,
that you've got to let them.

1580
01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:50.500
<v 1>Well you see danger all you,
when you were,
when you were talking about that,</v>

1581
01:22:50.501 --> 01:22:54.490
the image that came to my mind was Michelangelo's Pieta because what happens

1582
01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:59.320
with Mary is that she has foreknowledge that her son will be broken by the

1583
01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:03.610
world.
And yet she offers,
she offers him up to the world.
And then you think,

1584
01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:06.760
well if,
if a parent doing this in a moral manner,

1585
01:23:06.761 --> 01:23:11.680
then you are offering up your children to be broken by the world in the service

1586
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:13.810
of God.
That's a sacrifice to God.

1587
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.330
And if you're the proper parent than you do sacrifice,

1588
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.220
you do sacrifice your children to God because what you want from them for them

1589
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:25.870
is to serve the highest possible value.
If you love them,
that's what you want.

1590
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.650
And,
and that's a mortal burden for them.
And while that's perfect,

1591
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.380
perfectly illustrate it,
cause I think that have the,

1592
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.070
that is the sort of the female equivalent of the crucifixion,
right?

1593
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:41.070
Because of course Mary is his integrity bound up with her son and yet,

1594
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.820
and he's broken sort of at the peak of his power and beauty,
all of that.

1595
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:50.710
And she has to accept that as part of the precondition of property existence.

1596
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:54.190
And so there's a real sacrificial element there and that is reflected in that

1597
01:23:54.191 --> 01:23:57.040
story and so and and,
and it's,
and it's,

1598
01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.430
and it's correct in that manner and it's a very rough story.

1599
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:04.570
So that teaching your children values is in effect sacrificing to the worlds in

1600
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:06.460
a way that they wouldn't if you are teaching them the values.

1601
01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:09.820
But it's also what allows them to live a fulfilling life in doing that in pre

1602
01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:10.720
committing your child's values.

1603
01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:14.260
This is one of the major problems that I have with the way that the left has,

1604
01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:18.040
has rewritten parenting is idea of parenting is that you're just supposed to let

1605
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:20.200
your kid rush out into the world of that.

1606
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.790
Any preparation at all without any pre committed set of values and discover the

1607
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.500
world on their own without anything.

1608
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.780
That's one thing to say you should encounter danger.

1609
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.320
It's another thing to make everything inherently more dangerous by not preparing

1610
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:35.380
your child for the possibility of a world that requires values and meaning.

1611
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:39.040
Oh by the way,
we saw this at hand in Sweden where we were,

1612
01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:42.310
we weren't sure why there was so much support for everything you're doing in

1613
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:46.120
Sweden.
And when we do this Q and a after where people are submitting questions,

1614
01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:46.721
you know,
online.

1615
01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:48.900
And then I look through them as Jordan's doing his talk and then we answer

1616
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:49.540
questions.

1617
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:53.530
And 90% of the questions had to do with gender issues and a ton of them were

1618
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:57.400
about genderless kindergartens and the emasculation of the father and all of

1619
01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:59.640
this stuff.
And it's like,
that's exactly what you're saying.

1620
01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.360
You've given these kids well.
It's also,
well,

1621
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:06.310
it's also extremely interesting following up on your line of reasoning that,

1622
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:07.720
well let's say you do decide,

1623
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:10.510
well I'm going to launch my children out into the world to let them discover

1624
01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:12.190
everything by themselves.
Well,

1625
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.890
so what happens is while the world becomes so terrifying that you have to

1626
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:17.260
protect them from everything because they don't have any,

1627
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.440
they don't have any autonomy.
They don't have no,
exactly.

1628
01:25:20.441 --> 01:25:23.770
They don't have any discipline.
They don't have any inbuilt values,
all of that.

1629
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:27.100
And so the,
the counter consequence of that maximum freedom,

1630
01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:29.050
and I've seen this with people,

1631
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.990
they have two year old kids and they've put no restraints on them whatsoever.

1632
01:25:31.991 --> 01:25:34.010
They haven't taught the kid what no means.
Like can,

1633
01:25:34.011 --> 01:25:36.070
you can teach a kid what no means very rapidly.

1634
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:39.430
So if you have a child that's learning to crawl,
for example,
and you know,

1635
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:41.590
maybe they're going to go pull something heavy off the shelf,

1636
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.970
all you have to do is grab them by the leg and hold them and say no over and

1637
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:50.260
over until they stop doing what they're doing.
And they'll usually cry.
And so,

1638
01:25:50.261 --> 01:25:52.550
you know,
that's cruel.
Okay.
So you stopped them.

1639
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.740
And then if you do that for a week,
then all you have to say no,

1640
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:59.920
and they'll cry and stop and then two weeks later they won't cry.

1641
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.520
They'll just stop.
Now knows a big deal.
Right?
Because no is the imposition

1642
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:09.320
<v 3>of the patriarchy against that,
against that instinctive explore.</v>

1643
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:12.200
Noble savage.
Yeah,
that's right.
Against the noble savage.
Right.

1644
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.930
So it's a big deal.
No.
So,
but then,
okay,

1645
01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:19.931
but then now once your child has got that you can leave them be cause they can

1646
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:24.740
explore like mad yet first of all you can stop them by saying no and so that's

1647
01:26:24.741 --> 01:26:28.130
really helpful because if they're going to do something dangerous award we'll do

1648
01:26:28.131 --> 01:26:32.510
it.
But second kids are really smart and what I learned with my kids was once you

1649
01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:36.080
taught them that there were five things in the house they couldn't do,

1650
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.700
then they generalize from that and they figured out the pattern of the things

1651
01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:42.770
they couldn't do and then they wouldn't do them.

1652
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.600
And then you could leave them alone.

1653
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:48.110
They could be autonomous and then parents would come over who didn't teach their

1654
01:26:48.111 --> 01:26:53.111
kids know and they would follow their two year old around like totalitarian is

1655
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:57.830
100% of the time because they couldn't trust them to have any autonomy at all.

1656
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.690
Yup.
So the consequence of that absolute lack of discipline is the necessity for

1657
01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:04.170
constant supervision.
And this is,

1658
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:08.530
it's also one of the reasons why I have so much trouble with the way that he's

1659
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.410
speaking of the genderless parenting aspect is one of the reasons I have so much

1660
01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:14.510
trouble with all of this,
this idea that kids,

1661
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:18.200
that everything is biologically prewritten and biologically determined and that

1662
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:22.520
how you raise your children has no impact on how their future life goes is such

1663
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.490
asinine bullshit.
I mean,
sorry to put it that way,
but it just is,

1664
01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:28.220
I have two kids under five.
It is absolute nonsense.

1665
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.870
So I told the story the other day on the radio or on my show on podcast about my

1666
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:33.071
son.

1667
01:27:33.071 --> 01:27:36.350
So my son is two and a half years old and he has just a delightful human being,

1668
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:37.820
which means that if you are an adult,

1669
01:27:37.821 --> 01:27:40.630
he'd be the worst person because he has two year olds are savages.

1670
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:41.740
This is what they are.
Uh,

1671
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:45.320
anybody who tells you that children are naturally good is totally full of it.

1672
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.990
Children are naturally innocent.
Children are naturally not good.

1673
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.350
Children are naturally selfish and mean and brutal to each other.

1674
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.630
And then they're joyous.
And then their home joy right there.

1675
01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:56.140
This is what they are.
And so my son was,

1676
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:58.610
he has an older sister and his older sister love sparkly things.

1677
01:27:58.611 --> 01:28:00.500
It's just her thing.
She's a,
she's a girl,
right?

1678
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:03.470
And she's very girly and so she has all of these sparkly shoes laying around.

1679
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:07.430
And so my son decided that he wanted to go and put on his history sparkly shoes.

1680
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:11.690
And I went to him and I said,
no,
those,
those are girls' shoes.
Oh.
I said,
no,

1681
01:28:11.691 --> 01:28:14.270
those are girls' shoes.
We don't wear those.
And he said,
and he started to fuss.

1682
01:28:14.271 --> 01:28:17.000
He said,
no.
He said,
I want,
I want the,
I won't,
I won't say her name,

1683
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.690
I want her shoes,
I want her shoes.
And I said,
those are girl things.

1684
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.090
And then I took him to the out,

1685
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.230
the western outfitters over here and then eyes and I got him a pair of cowboy

1686
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:30.230
boots and he will not take off his cowboy boots.

1687
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:35.270
Now the way the left would see that is that is me cruelly crushing his spirit.

1688
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.520
Perhaps he just wants to be a girl.

1689
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.730
Perhaps he wants to be raised in a feminine manner.
Yeah,

1690
01:28:40.731 --> 01:28:43.250
except that by me giving him the choice by going and getting them cowboy boots

1691
01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.370
and then saying,
here,
here's some cowboy boots and as more gender appropriate,

1692
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:48.710
it turns out that that's what he likes and you know what?

1693
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.850
Even if he didn't like that,
he's two and a half years old.
The year man,

1694
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.770
I get to decide for him the amount of hate that I'm going to get just for

1695
01:28:54.771 --> 01:28:59.050
sitting here listening to you tell that story of how you parent and I didn't

1696
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:03.060
push back on Shapiro son to wear sparkly shoes.
Robin,

1697
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.270
he's not an adult when he's 17 if he makes eight an affirmative case,

1698
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:10.470
why he should wear a sparkly shoes.
Yeah,
go for it.
Yeah.
When he's two and a half,

1699
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.770
I'm the guy who gets to instill these system that I think will lead to his

1700
01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:16.290
greatest happiness.
I am the totalitarian in my own house.

1701
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.230
I am the king of my own house and I get to determine whether I think my child

1702
01:29:19.231 --> 01:29:20.130
will live a happier life,

1703
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:23.520
struggling with the desire to wear sparkly shoes at age 25 or whether it might

1704
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:27.690
be better for him to be brought up in a situation where it's easier to choose in

1705
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:30.900
line with gender stereotyping.
That by the way,

1706
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:32.520
is reflected over every human culture.

1707
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:35.370
The idea that gender stereotyping is unique to the West is absolute nonsense.

1708
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.680
There are differentiations between how we treat men and how we treat women in

1709
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:39.660
every culture in the history of humanity.
Yeah.

1710
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:41.830
Well that again is why the Sweden thing was,
yeah.
Well,

1711
01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.820
I mean because we found out basically as,

1712
01:29:43.821 --> 01:29:45.760
as you laid out and feel free to clean this up.
Yep.

1713
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.180
Was that they've done egalitarianism,
right.

1714
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:51.660
Men and women have been equal for quite some time and yet still what has

1715
01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:55.240
happened there is that more men are engineers and more women are nurses.
Yeah.

1716
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:58.500
And that men and women are more different.
There's still different and more new.

1717
01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:02.550
More.
Yeah,
that's right.
The social justice warriors or,
or whatever this thing is.

1718
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.490
They won't let them have the win.
So they,
yeah.

1719
01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.410
<v 1>Well you experiment.
Well the other,
the other issue here too is,</v>

1720
01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:11.250
well imagine that just hypothetically imagine that you were going to try to

1721
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:13.290
raise your children gender neutral.
Okay.

1722
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:17.610
So there was actually studies done on this back 30 years ago where they looked

1723
01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:22.050
at self professed feminist parents and self professed on feminist president

1724
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:27.650
parents and then coded their interactions blindly for a gender stereotypical

1725
01:30:28.261 --> 01:30:30.840
behavior and found no difference between the two groups.
Huh?

1726
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:33.480
Well and the reason for that is,
you know,

1727
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.400
you think that you socialize your children entirely.

1728
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.310
If you're a social constructionist,
it's all top down,
right?

1729
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.650
Because your child is a blank slate,
but your child isn't,

1730
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:46.740
your child is manifesting to a greater or lesser degree,

1731
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:50.850
all sorts of gendered behaviors and powerfully and a lot of what you're doing,

1732
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:52.200
especially if you're a good parent,

1733
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:56.970
is you're reacting to what your child is manifesting as an individual.

1734
01:30:56.970 --> 01:31:01.620
And so a lot of the socialization that show called the socialization,

1735
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:06.300
which sounds like top down is actually the establishment of an of a singular

1736
01:31:06.301 --> 01:31:10.470
relationship between you as the parent and that individual child with their

1737
01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:12.180
nature and this is,

1738
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.540
this is also reflected in the behavioral genetics literature because what you

1739
01:31:15.541 --> 01:31:19.830
see is that imagine there's three sources of variation in children's behavior.

1740
01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.470
There's biological,
there's shared environment,
so this would be the sibling,

1741
01:31:23.471 --> 01:31:27.630
so this would be what was the same in the family for the siblings and then what

1742
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:31.890
was different and then you look at the behavioral outcome and you calculate how

1743
01:31:31.891 --> 01:31:32.880
much was biological,

1744
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:35.520
how much was shared environment and how much was non shared environment.

1745
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:39.780
What you find is it's almost all biology in non shared environment and so people

1746
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:42.630
have read that to say while parents don't matter because there's no shared

1747
01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:43.201
environment,

1748
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:47.040
but it's not the case because what happens is if you're a good parent is the

1749
01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:51.600
relationship you have with child one is significantly different than the

1750
01:31:51.601 --> 01:31:53.310
relationship that you have with child too.

1751
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:57.990
Even though there may be moral presumptions that are organizing your families in

1752
01:31:57.991 --> 01:32:00.530
your,
truly,
your children identically are almost never right.

1753
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:04.300
It's never to Cain and Abel,
right?
I mean,
but that's a,
that's right.

1754
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.820
I mean like if God is the parent figure in that story,

1755
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.450
treating your children's differentially is a way of being a good parent for your

1756
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:11.201
kids.
Exactly the same.

1757
01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:14.860
You are not being responsive to your kids and you're teaching them that,

1758
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:18.890
that essentially there are no consequences to actions because your kids taking

1759
01:32:18.891 --> 01:32:20.710
their luncheons,
right,
no matter what.
It's the same outcome.
Well,

1760
01:32:20.711 --> 01:32:23.180
that's just good parenting,
right?
No,
no,
no.
That's,

1761
01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.960
that's almost the definition of totalitarian parenting.

1762
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:29.050
And it is exactly the kind of relationship that you don't want to have with

1763
01:32:29.051 --> 01:32:30.250
anyone,
right?

1764
01:32:30.251 --> 01:32:33.250
You want all of your relationships to be individualized in particular.

1765
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:37.730
Rised and so and so.
Um,
so the,
so we,
we,

1766
01:32:37.731 --> 01:32:42.250
we radically underestimate the degree to which the gendered interactions between

1767
01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:46.750
children and parents are driven by the children.
So here's a funny experiment.

1768
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:52.870
There's some evidence that parents who drink more are more likely to have

1769
01:32:52.871 --> 01:32:56.650
children with Adhd.
Now,
I'm not a big fan of ADHD diagnosis,

1770
01:32:56.651 --> 01:32:58.630
but we'll leave that aside.
Okay.
So,

1771
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:02.260
so then there was some suggestion that may be,
well,

1772
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:07.540
ADHD is part of a genetic complex that involves alcoholism and antisocial

1773
01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:09.520
personality cause those things also clumped together.

1774
01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:13.060
And so there's various experiments done to see if that is the case.

1775
01:33:13.061 --> 01:33:16.510
And there's a fair bit of diagnostic overlap between childhood conduct disorder

1776
01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:19.990
and Adhd.
So it's kind of messy,
irrelevant.

1777
01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:21.700
Here's the experiment.

1778
01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:27.140
You bring parents in to interact with children who aren't their own and you,

1779
01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:30.640
you have them do an alcohol taste test.
And so the taste test is,

1780
01:33:30.641 --> 01:33:33.430
well here's rum and coke and here's vodka and orange juice and here's the orange

1781
01:33:33.431 --> 01:33:34.420
juice and here's water.

1782
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:39.750
And what we want you to do is to just rate the taste of each of these beverages.

1783
01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.370
Okay.
And so then we expose you to some children.

1784
01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:47.530
And one of the children is a child with a diagnosis of Adhd and one of the child

1785
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:48.940
children is one that doesn't.

1786
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.240
And then so you do that with a bunch of parents and then you have them do the

1787
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:55.660
taste test.
Okay,
well you don't care what they rate the damage drinks,

1788
01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:56.950
you just care how much they drink.

1789
01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:00.970
And it turns out that parents that were exposed to the kids that have attention

1790
01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:04.960
deficit disorder drank far more so.
But that's a good,

1791
01:34:04.961 --> 01:34:08.860
it's a good example of the idea of Bi directionality and socialization.

1792
01:34:08.861 --> 01:34:13.060
It's like you're not,
you have a relationship with your child.

1793
01:34:13.061 --> 01:34:18.061
Now you obviously enforce a certain degree of social norm if you're sensible

1794
01:34:18.551 --> 01:34:21.670
because you want your child to be socialized and desirable to other people.

1795
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:25.060
You want them to be able to play reciprocally and you want them to be attentive

1796
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:28.390
enough to adults so that adults treat them well.
So the world opens up to them.

1797
01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:30.520
Right?
So that's what you're doing.
But other than that,

1798
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:35.970
your particular Ising like mad because even to get that child to that end state

1799
01:34:36.011 --> 01:34:38.350
requires a particular eyes path.
You know,

1800
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:43.240
my daughter was intrinsically very cooperative and my son was intrinsically very

1801
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:44.074
competitive.

1802
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.460
And so the pathway to getting them both to be reciprocal players was

1803
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:52.070
substantially different even though the desired outcome.

1804
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.830
And they became reciprocal players.
Like they,
you know,
they were pop,

1805
01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:59.300
they were popular kids who in constant demand as playmates,

1806
01:34:59.301 --> 01:35:02.060
which I think is the hallmark of successful parenting,
by the way,

1807
01:35:02.061 --> 01:35:07.061
by the time if your kids are four and other kids really want to play with them,

1808
01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:10.550
it's like you did it,
you got it right.
And if they're not,

1809
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:14.180
then something's gone seriously wrong.
But there's multiple pathways to that.

1810
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:17.370
<v 2>So I'm glad we got this to the current day because one of the things that I</v>

1811
01:35:17.371 --> 01:35:22.140
wanted to ask you guys about is what we're basically talking about here is

1812
01:35:22.141 --> 01:35:25.250
living life with a certain set of rules and we can whittle away

1813
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:30.470
<v 1>12,
12,
12 of them,
although I hear there's going to be a couple more coming.</v>

1814
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.710
That's the rumor that had 10,
12,
whatever.
Um,

1815
01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:37.570
<v 2>but we,
it seems to me,
we live in a time where,</v>

1816
01:35:37.571 --> 01:35:42.130
where the energy is just around the people that have no rules.
So,
you know,

1817
01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:43.480
sort of as the Trump thing grew,

1818
01:35:43.481 --> 01:35:47.530
it was this sort of destructive force that break all the things.
Right.

1819
01:35:47.531 --> 01:35:50.080
And Eric and I talked about how Eric would have wanted,

1820
01:35:50.081 --> 01:35:53.170
Eric Weinstein would have wanted a panther in a China shop,
but I said,

1821
01:35:53.171 --> 01:35:56.080
you just don't get that.
You get the bull in the checkout.
That's how it is now.

1822
01:35:56.081 --> 01:36:01.081
I see the energy behind sorta the SJW left and the new s that socialism is cool

1823
01:36:01.721 --> 01:36:04.240
and let and that it's much easier to destroy than create.

1824
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.710
Do you think that the rules that you lay out in your book and the rules that you

1825
01:36:08.711 --> 01:36:11.560
talk about from a biblical perspective and everything else that people with

1826
01:36:11.561 --> 01:36:16.561
rules can sort of survive in in a crazy time like we're in now where information

1827
01:36:17.381 --> 01:36:22.381
travels that much faster and there's that much sort of entropy behind chaos that

1828
01:36:22.421 --> 01:36:26.560
maybe there wasn't before because we couldn't transmit information so quickly?

1829
01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.670
Do you think there's enough enough

1830
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.810
<v 1>juice behind this basically disagree slightly with the premise of your question.</v>

1831
01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.630
I don't actually think that the left doesn't have rules.

1832
01:36:34.631 --> 01:36:36.760
I think they have more rules than we do.
I think the,

1833
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:40.870
that we have a certain basic set of rules and then an immense amounts of freedom

1834
01:36:40.871 --> 01:36:42.370
within these guard rails.

1835
01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:46.270
I think the left in getting rid of the guard rails head who because human beings

1836
01:36:46.271 --> 01:36:50.320
cannot live without rules,
the left [inaudible],

1837
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:51.580
this is actually an important point.

1838
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:54.910
They reversed engineered a set of extraordinarily complex rules that are

1839
01:36:54.911 --> 01:36:55.930
arbitrarily applied.

1840
01:36:55.931 --> 01:36:58.540
So you don't even know you violated rule until after you've tripped over the

1841
01:36:58.541 --> 01:37:01.990
rule.
Right?
Know if they replaced rules with taboos.
Right,
exactly,
exactly.

1842
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.610
And that is extraordinarily dangerous so that the energy is behind seeking a new

1843
01:37:06.611 --> 01:37:07.780
set of rules.
The question is,

1844
01:37:07.781 --> 01:37:12.370
can we defend our rules in such a way that it is attractive to people?

1845
01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.970
Except I'll,
except I think you do that.

1846
01:37:15.971 --> 01:37:19.690
I think you do that fundamentally by pointing out the relationship between rules

1847
01:37:19.691 --> 01:37:20.524
and aspiration.

1848
01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:24.460
It's like the rules define a value hierarchy and then that gives you something

1849
01:37:24.461 --> 01:37:28.960
noble to do.
That's your call to adventure.
Exactly.
So the rules don't constrain.

1850
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:31.020
They do constrained.
You obviously rose constraint,

1851
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:32.490
but at the same time they constrain,

1852
01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.740
they provide an organizing framework and a direction and that's,
and you need,

1853
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:40.720
and that,
that direction isn't optional because the other thing,
you know,

1854
01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:44.650
rules like pants.
Okay,
you put them on and they're fundamentally constraining,

1855
01:37:44.651 --> 01:37:48.880
but they lied to walk through brambles.
Right?
Well that's,
well,

1856
01:37:48.881 --> 01:37:51.600
that's also why when you see that,

1857
01:37:51.670 --> 01:37:53.830
one of the first things that happens in the garden of Eden,

1858
01:37:53.831 --> 01:37:57.360
when Adam and eve become self conscious as they put on clothes.
Exactly right.

1859
01:37:57.361 --> 01:38:00.090
It's a constraint and a protection at the same time.
And again,

1860
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.690
culture is always that it's constrained in protection at the same time.
And the,

1861
01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.210
the radical types are always going,
oh,
you know,
oh,

1862
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:08.490
the constraint or the constraint.
And Fair enough,
right?

1863
01:38:08.491 --> 01:38:10.520
Because there's that tyrannical aspect,
but the,

1864
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.910
the protection and the aspiration are absolutely critical importance.

1865
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.710
And I don't think there is a more,

1866
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:21.860
I don't think that we've laid out anywhere a more noble orientation with regards

1867
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:28.521
to disciplined aspiration then that that's encoded inside the Judaeo Christian

1868
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:31.740
ethic and that that is the core of the enlightenment.
And that is right.
Okay.

1869
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:34.110
So I had another question about Judaism.
Okay,
sure.
Okay.

1870
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:38.820
So one of the things that I would then,
I've always wondered about is,

1871
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:43.620
I think one of the things that distinguishes Christianity from Judaism is that

1872
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:48.630
Judaism has an implicit emphasis on the salvation on the cell,

1873
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.240
on the salvific properties of the state.

1874
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.100
And I don't think you see that in Christianity to the same degree.
So I mean,

1875
01:38:56.101 --> 01:38:59.730
because there's,
well,
while there's not,
there's the idea of Israel's,

1876
01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:04.110
that's part of it.
And,
and there's the idea of the Jewish nation as a people,

1877
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:08.180
right?
Whereas Christianity has this universalism that's built into it.

1878
01:39:08.181 --> 01:39:12.780
This is right.
And so,
and this,
this is a fundamental distinction.
Okay.
So,
okay,
so,

1879
01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:13.620
so on,
this is,

1880
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:16.950
I've never been able to have this conversation with anyone because it's an

1881
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:19.950
unbelievably dangerous conversation.
But it seems to me that,

1882
01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:24.900
it seems to me that the advantage of Christianity is that it places the

1883
01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:28.580
fundamental locale for salvation within the individual.
I mean,

1884
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:33.610
independently of whether it's like pushed off for reasons of mercy onto Christ.

1885
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:37.740
Something else we didn't finish discussing is one of Young's points with regards

1886
01:39:37.741 --> 01:39:42.360
to Christianity and Catholicism was that there was a merciful element to it

1887
01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:46.980
because the burden that was placed on each person being the locus of,

1888
01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.480
of redemption,
let's say,

1889
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:51.930
was so heavy that it was unbearable and so that you needed an intermediary

1890
01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:55.680
structure to like lift the load off of you from time to time,

1891
01:39:55.681 --> 01:39:57.480
which is what the Catholics do.
It's like,
well,

1892
01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.290
here's all the ways that I've failed.
That's okay.
You're fallible.

1893
01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:02.610
You're a fallible human being.

1894
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:06.630
You don't have to be crushed into absolute dust by the fact that you're not

1895
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:09.420
everything you should be.
So all right,
but anyways,

1896
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.760
I think that's where Jewish guilt kicks in if I'm not well,

1897
01:40:11.761 --> 01:40:15.570
and it's also I think to some degree where Protestant guilt kicks in because the

1898
01:40:15.571 --> 01:40:19.170
Catholics have that out.
And you can be cynical about that,
right?
Say,
well,

1899
01:40:19.171 --> 01:40:22.020
you sit in your whole life and then on your deathbed you're converted.
It's like,

1900
01:40:22.021 --> 01:40:25.290
well,
that's all nonsense because you actually have to repent.

1901
01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:29.150
And so if you have a lifetime of sin,
there's going to be a hell associate.

1902
01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:32.730
That's right.
That's right.
But you can see the mercy in that,
in that,

1903
01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:37.410
in the Catholic approach,
because it gives you like a reset in some sense,
right?

1904
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:38.520
You get to be washed.

1905
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.790
The fact that you're not everything you could be is a terrible burden,
right?

1906
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.740
And if you're carrying that all the time,

1907
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:48.420
it can just crush you into nothingness that's present in its earlier iteration

1908
01:40:48.421 --> 01:40:52.200
in the,
in these sacrificial system in the temple among Jews,
uh,

1909
01:40:52.201 --> 01:40:53.890
or among the vending,
like I say,
in

1910
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:58.660
<v 3>three times a day,
you say a portion in the Montessori and the silent prayer,
uh,</v>

1911
01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:01.330
in which you repent your sentence and then we have a full day.
Right?

1912
01:41:01.331 --> 01:41:01.811
You don't get bored.

1913
01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:04.560
It's deliberately designed to do that and to try and wipe the slate clean and be

1914
01:41:04.570 --> 01:41:06.480
a fresh start.
But as far as the,

1915
01:41:06.481 --> 01:41:09.340
the other question that you're asking about the individual,
right?

1916
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:11.680
So to me it's less about the state per se,

1917
01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:14.620
because when we're talking about the nation of Israel,
Ami,
Sir Alan,

1918
01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:16.810
the in the actual biblical parlance,

1919
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:21.640
it's not talking about like a border state and corporate salvation within that,

1920
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:24.670
it's about the special responsibility of this group of people to,

1921
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:28.630
to spread light to the world,
right?
That you're supposed to be in the,
again,

1922
01:41:28.631 --> 01:41:30.870
Hebrew phrase from you losing a lot of Hebrew today,
but we're talking bibles,

1923
01:41:30.871 --> 01:41:34.480
we'll be okay,
is that you're supposed to be on my MCAT Cohan and midway condos,

1924
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:39.510
meaning that you're supposed to be a nation of priests and a holy nation.

1925
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.941
Uh,

1926
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:44.941
and so that idea was expanded by Christianity to all of Cuba,

1927
01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:48.140
all of humanity corporately that basically this,

1928
01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:49.360
this applies equally to all humans.

1929
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:52.390
Now what's interesting about Judaism is the Judaism actually has almost a two

1930
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:56.650
track approach.
So if you are a Jew,
then you have these responsibilities,

1931
01:41:56.651 --> 01:41:58.000
the 613 minutes vote,

1932
01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:03.190
you are not barred from the afterlife or from decency if you're not a Jew.

1933
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.420
So Judaism is only half exclusive in the sense that if you're a junior Jew and

1934
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.820
if you're not a Jew,
we try to actually dissuade you from becoming one.

1935
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:13.150
But if you are a,
but if you are outside the Jewish nation,

1936
01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:16.120
you have a share in the afterlife as long as you fulfill seven basic

1937
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:17.890
commandments,
the commandments of Noah,
right?

1938
01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:19.870
So there's a set of seven commandments that were given to Noah.

1939
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.440
These are basic basic things.
Don't steal,
don't murder,
don't commit adultery,

1940
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:25.190
don't eat the flesh of living animal a,

1941
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.900
don't you have to create courts of justice.
Uh,
the,
these are like all very,

1942
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:29.734
very basic loss.

1943
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:34.270
And so what that means is that Judaism posits that you're on his own.

1944
01:42:34.271 --> 01:42:36.550
He has really interesting philosopher from Israel.

1945
01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:39.460
He has a new book out called the case for nationalism,
essentially.
Yeah.

1946
01:42:39.461 --> 01:42:40.470
It's really,
it's really interesting.

1947
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.480
And basically the case that he makes is that the biblical Jewish view of where

1948
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.040
values should be embedded at the maximum level is a safe review.

1949
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:55.030
Then the universalistic conception because the universalists conception that you

1950
01:42:55.031 --> 01:42:57.850
have a set of values that applies equally to everyone across all times and

1951
01:42:57.851 --> 01:43:01.390
cultures actually leads to tyranny and cram downs.

1952
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:05.440
Meaning that his argument is that the threat of the 20th century was not a bunch

1953
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:08.110
of nationalism that we're embedding particular values.

1954
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.170
It was certain nationalism that wanted to become universalisms.

1955
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:16.210
It was Germany wanting to be the rife that ruled the entire world or the USSR

1956
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.260
wanting to be a country that was able to apply communism across all times in all

1957
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:25.150
places.
So a certain level of particular prism in how we apply basic rules.

1958
01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.270
The seven laws of Noah in the biblical case or the 10 Commandments,

1959
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.310
you can have certain cultural differentiations and that allows for group

1960
01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.810
cohesion and in a way that you can't with them.

1961
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.790
Great mass of humanity because how many tower of Babel problem,
right?

1962
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:44.170
Things expand the,
if you expand the does exactly right to be too large,

1963
01:43:44.171 --> 01:43:48.010
then it starts to become too complex and they structure and to totalitarian

1964
01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:52.400
exactly it.
So the Jewish critique of,
of the universalistic principle would be,

1965
01:43:52.401 --> 01:43:52.641
yes,

1966
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:55.130
there are certain fundamental universal principles that we should all hold buy

1967
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:58.490
and those we hold a have to get by Jews and non Jews alike,

1968
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:00.440
but how those are iterated,

1969
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:04.580
they have to be iterated within a specific cultural structure.
Otherwise,

1970
01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:08.870
what you end up with is people trying to cram down cultural hallmarks of those

1971
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:13.610
structures on everybody else and totalitarianism springs from the idea that I'm

1972
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:18.440
going to take my culture,
which is different,
not actually better,
right?

1973
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:21.890
Like we don't actually say that the 613 commandments are necessary for everyone

1974
01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:24.170
there.
They're not necessarily for people who are not Jewish,

1975
01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.240
and to take that and say,
okay,

1976
01:44:26.241 --> 01:44:29.480
now everyone has to abide by those things would be a form of totalitarianism in

1977
01:44:29.481 --> 01:44:30.710
a way that that is not,

1978
01:44:30.711 --> 01:44:33.290
when you say we have this particular set of values that is iterated to us in a

1979
01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:37.430
particular way.
Okay,
but maybe we could,
maybe we could think about it this way.

1980
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:42.830
Maybe that would include both sides is that there is a danger to claims of

1981
01:44:42.831 --> 01:44:46.520
universalism and that's that large scale totalitarian utopianism.

1982
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.840
And maybe you could,

1983
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:52.340
you could criticize the universalism of Christianity as contributing to that

1984
01:44:52.341 --> 01:44:53.630
from a conceptual perspective,

1985
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:57.350
but maybe you could say the same thing about the concentration on the
particular,

1986
01:44:57.530 --> 01:45:01.970
on the side of the,
of the Jewish emphasis on,
on the state,

1987
01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:06.770
and that because there are obviously pathologies of ethno nationalism and

1988
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.750
localization that also manifest themselves as another kind of danger.

1989
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:16.640
Right?
It would be the danger of too much exclusion and the danger of not enough

1990
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.720
exclusion.
Right.

1991
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.770
And so the issue is how you get the relationship between the individual and the

1992
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:23.630
crap.
Correct.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1993
01:45:23.631 --> 01:45:26.660
this is one of the things that I think the EU is really struggling with is

1994
01:45:26.661 --> 01:45:31.550
because,
you know,
I'm kind of oddly enough for someone who's a universalist.

1995
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.310
Let's say I'm somewhat,

1996
01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:39.170
I'm sympathetic to the claims of the nationalists in the European Union because

1997
01:45:39.171 --> 01:45:43.310
it seems to me that what they're complaining about is that as sovereign

1998
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:44.144
individuals,

1999
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:47.960
there have been levels of bureaucracy laid out in this huge overarching

2000
01:45:47.961 --> 01:45:52.790
structure,
the EU that divorce them as individuals from their masters.

2001
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:53.570
Right.

2002
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:57.800
And they want a local structure so that they have some relationship with the

2003
01:45:57.801 --> 01:46:01.370
structure.
Right.
And maybe you see in a place and localism,
by the way,

2004
01:46:01.371 --> 01:46:03.730
with other human beings,
I mean the fact is that you,

2005
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:07.940
if you didn't value your own child more than you value the child of a stranger,

2006
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:10.130
this would probably make you a bad person.
Right?
Right.

2007
01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:12.770
Like we would actually consider you a bad person.
Like if different,

2008
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:14.120
definitely you had the choice between saving.

2009
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:17.570
If I'd trust me and saving my son and saving a random kid of the same age,

2010
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:19.940
and I said,
you know,
I don't see any difference between these two things,
right?

2011
01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.870
This would make me a bad person.

2012
01:46:20.871 --> 01:46:25.070
So the idea of having societal bonds that are local in nature is one of the

2013
01:46:25.071 --> 01:46:28.100
things that America got right in in some regional federal structure is the idea

2014
01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:28.671
of localism.

2015
01:46:28.671 --> 01:46:31.820
Localism is very important as opposed to one set of rules for everybody because

2016
01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:35.360
we do have these variations and those variations allow us to have the social

2017
01:46:35.361 --> 01:46:37.550
fabric that's necessary.
You can't tell.
This is actually where,

2018
01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.160
I mean to bring it full circle back to the online stuff.

2019
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:44.150
The online world is a giant Savannah.

2020
01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:47.810
It is just one huge plane,
right?
There is no hierarchy in the online world,

2021
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:51.120
and not only that,
there are no pockets in the online world on Twitter.

2022
01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:54.330
It's just one huge plane that doesn't generate any feeling of community.

2023
01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:56.790
What generates a feeling of community is people who you actually have social

2024
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:58.710
ties with,
and those social ties are necessary.

2025
01:46:58.711 --> 01:47:01.590
Social fabric cannot exist for 6 billion or 7 billion human beings.

2026
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.650
Social Fabric exist in your community.
Right.

2027
01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:07.830
And as large as that community can grow and there are limits to the growth of

2028
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:08.281
that community.

2029
01:47:08.281 --> 01:47:11.250
And maybe this is what both Christianity and Judaism have in common when it

2030
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:14.910
talks about the messianic era is there will be a time when that social fabric

2031
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:19.050
can in fact encompass everybody.
But that's not something that happens naturally.

2032
01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:23.010
Might also still be that it's still full of particularities.
Exactly right.

2033
01:47:23.011 --> 01:47:25.080
It's just at the particular,
they just have to be,

2034
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:28.800
have to be properly within a cone within a context.
Right.

2035
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:31.890
We like the EU in the sense that they have a certain set of social values and as

2036
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:33.600
the social values disappeared,
we'd like the EU less,

2037
01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:36.180
but those social values have to be in common.
Right.

2038
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:38.720
So we all have to have those in common.
Yes.
The French don't want to be English.

2039
01:47:38.721 --> 01:47:40.710
The English don't want to be French and that's perfectly okay.

2040
01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:41.910
They don't have to be French.
Whoa.

2041
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:44.920
It's kind of Nice that there are French and English like that.

2042
01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:47.640
That's part of the upside of diversity,
let's say,

2043
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:50.760
is that there is some genuine diversity in that localism preserves that

2044
01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:52.470
diversity.
And this is what's so funny about the left,
right?

2045
01:47:52.471 --> 01:47:55.230
The left will say that diversity is our,
is our greatest benefit.

2046
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:59.130
And then they immediately tried to wash away every thing that is diverse about

2047
01:47:59.131 --> 01:48:03.200
how people behave except for [inaudible].

2048
01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.720
<v 2>Right.
Well that's no fun.
At the same time,
they'll also say,</v>

2049
01:48:06.721 --> 01:48:10.320
well we should be more like countries like Sweden and Norway and Finland.

2050
01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:13.690
<v 3>Some of them are quite dangerous countries on planet earth,
right?
I mean like,</v>

2051
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.030
<v 2>yeah.
And by the way,</v>

2052
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:18.450
there were plenty of people there who are very worried about the directions that

2053
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:21.900
their countries are going.
Oh,
sweet.
All these lefties in America thing.
Oh,

2054
01:48:21.901 --> 01:48:24.510
it's so great over there in the amount of people that we met there that are

2055
01:48:24.511 --> 01:48:25.470
completely

2056
01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.210
<v 3>afraid of saying any,
the Sweden,
Sweden,</v>

2057
01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:31.670
Norway and Denmark are immigration restrictionist countries.
It's so funny,

2058
01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:34.220
the left,
we'll talk about the wonders of Sweden is now,
right?

2059
01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.510
But because of the backlash,
right?

2060
01:48:35.511 --> 01:48:39.110
Because of the backlash to massive Islamic immigration into Sweden and they,

2061
01:48:39.111 --> 01:48:41.450
and the fracturing of society in areas like Momo,

2062
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:45.170
right is why all the Jews are leaving Sweden and Sweden has elected a central

2063
01:48:45.171 --> 01:48:48.840
rate government specifically on the immigration issue.
So yeah,
I mean to,

2064
01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:53.690
to ignore him for me individually and collectively.

2065
01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:58.280
Um,
the biggest source of unhappiness for people is pretending that reality isn't

2066
01:48:58.281 --> 01:49:00.770
reality.
When people fight reality,
they lose.

2067
01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.470
And recognizing that reality is reality is,

2068
01:49:03.471 --> 01:49:06.410
is necessarily whether you're a nation like Sweden or whether you are an

2069
01:49:06.411 --> 01:49:08.750
individual who's struggling with certain realities,

2070
01:49:08.751 --> 01:49:12.680
like people's unhappiness springs from thinking that reality is mutable but they

2071
01:49:12.681 --> 01:49:16.610
are immutable.
Mostly your immutable in reality is not mutable.

2072
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:19.460
<v 2>Yeah.
All right.
I got,
I got one more for you guys cause we,</v>

2073
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:20.480
you got about 10 minutes.

2074
01:49:20.481 --> 01:49:23.450
So let's go deep and personal with the theme that we've run with here.

2075
01:49:24.170 --> 01:49:26.900
I want to know a little bit about the adventure.
You are both non,
we've,
we've,

2076
01:49:26.901 --> 01:49:30.290
I've been on this adventure with you at least for the last couple of months.
Um,

2077
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:31.130
but we,

2078
01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:34.130
I've asked you this before a couple of times and you always give me a slightly

2079
01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:38.750
different answer.
Where does it come from within you that you can do this?

2080
01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:42.100
And that's what I want to ask you too.
Like where does it come from that you,

2081
01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.690
you sure you can know all these things.
You can say all these things.

2082
01:49:44.691 --> 01:49:48.040
You can read about all these things with bet you Jordan Peterson can

2083
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.390
<v 1>get out there every day.
Put your ass on the line,
take all the hate,
keep going.</v>

2084
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:56.230
What is it about you?
Well,
the first thing that we should point out is that,

2085
01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.760
you know,
I have the same experience that Ben has in public.

2086
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:05.140
It's like I've had one negative interaction in public and it was minor and it

2087
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:10.141
was in Dublin with a woman who was really drunk [inaudible] and it wasn't even

2088
01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:14.650
that bad,
you know?
But,

2089
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.670
but I've had thousands of personal interactions with people and they're all

2090
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:20.560
unbelievably positive.

2091
01:50:20.561 --> 01:50:24.160
They're not just positive like there people approach me and they're very polite

2092
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:28.840
and they're often apologetic because they think they're interrupting me.
And,
um,

2093
01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:29.291
you know,

2094
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:32.950
then we have a brief personal conversation and they talk about how while they'd

2095
01:50:32.951 --> 01:50:35.740
been reading or listening or whatever and that their lives are up straightening

2096
01:50:35.741 --> 01:50:38.930
out and that that's really good and that they've recommended the book and,

2097
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.780
and so I'm very happy about that.
And,

2098
01:50:40.781 --> 01:50:44.200
but it's just a hundred percent positive and so,
and that,

2099
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:48.850
and it's an amazing and uplifting thing to be able to go all over the world.

2100
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:53.800
Like I was in Slovenia a week ago.
I think the effect of Youtube,
by the way,

2101
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:58.090
I think they effect of Youtube and podcasts is even bigger in places where the

2102
01:50:58.091 --> 01:51:01.300
media isn't as reliable or well developed as it is in the west.

2103
01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:06.070
It's hard to say how,
how huge a in effect it has,
but it's unbelievably big.

2104
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.470
And so people were stopping me all over and,

2105
01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:13.360
and it's a remarkable thing to go into a new city and have complete strangers

2106
01:51:13.361 --> 01:51:15.430
approach you in the most positive possible way.

2107
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:19.000
And then to tell you something private about their lives and then to share with

2108
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:21.610
you some triumph they've had.
It's like that.

2109
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:25.810
There's nothing that can be better than that.
And then when we do these lectures,

2110
01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.430
it's that on Mohs,
right?

2111
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:30.520
We have like 1,002 thousand people come to the auditoriums.

2112
01:51:30.521 --> 01:51:34.120
And very little of what we've been discussing is being political,
except,

2113
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:37.570
except the way we've been discussing politics.
You know,

2114
01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:43.100
the general level three [inaudible] is a variant of philosophical orientation

2115
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:47.380
set,
but it's almost all centered on individual development.
And so it's,

2116
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:50.230
it provides a kind of energy like in that,

2117
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:53.950
and then I've been in the more and more fortunate position over the last nine

2118
01:51:53.951 --> 01:51:58.420
months because although I still find it very stressful to have contentious

2119
01:51:58.421 --> 01:52:02.350
interviews with journalists like the Gq interview for example,
um,

2120
01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:05.500
they have their advantages,
you know,
it's,
it's,

2121
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:10.420
it's not like they're a net loss in terms of promoting what I'm trying to do,

2122
01:52:10.421 --> 01:52:13.060
which is try to help individuals fortify themselves.

2123
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:18.390
And then so all of the elements of this that are positive is enough to sustain

2124
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:21.361
this and,

2125
01:52:21.361 --> 01:52:25.630
and to enable it to continue and to also make me think that there isn't anything

2126
01:52:25.631 --> 01:52:29.980
more relevant or meaningful or adventurous that I could possibly be doing.

2127
01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:31.390
Feeding the meaning at the same time.

2128
01:52:31.450 --> 01:52:35.950
Cause that's an absolute through this is like every night that were out there,

2129
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:41.260
there's this like renewed sense of,
wow,
this is real.

2130
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.800
Not just putting it up and let it go to the university.

2131
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:46.580
It's like we're seeing these people.

2132
01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:49.700
<v 2>When that guy,
we almost took off late for one flight,</v>

2133
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:52.580
when that guy that was working at the airline came up to you right in the front

2134
01:52:52.581 --> 01:52:56.300
row and was going on and on and he could barely speak.
And it was like,
holy

2135
01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.270
<v 1>people,
you know,
they say,
well,
my,
my girlfriend and I decided to get married.</v>

2136
01:53:00.271 --> 01:53:03.480
Now we're having a baby because we've listened to your lectures.
Or here's here,

2137
01:53:03.481 --> 01:53:06.440
I'm here with my father.
And we put our relationship that happened,

2138
01:53:06.450 --> 01:53:09.030
<v 2>the father and son who had,
who literally hadn't seen each other,</v>

2139
01:53:09.031 --> 01:53:10.210
I think they said seven years.

2140
01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.390
<v 1>Yep,
Yep,
Yep.
And they were all smiling way and like,</v>

2141
01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:17.320
it's just endless stories like that.
And I believe,
while I believe two things,

2142
01:53:17.321 --> 01:53:21.730
I believe that the individual is the fundamental locus locus of salvation and

2143
01:53:21.731 --> 01:53:23.320
redemption.
I truly believe that.

2144
01:53:23.321 --> 01:53:25.270
I don't think there's anything that's more true than that.

2145
01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.800
And then every time I see someone who's put themselves together,

2146
01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:33.990
I think that's one more major victory.
Not Minor.
You know,

2147
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.640
which is also why I'm always talking to the individuals in the audience.

2148
01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:39.340
And when we do these meet and greets afterwards,

2149
01:53:39.341 --> 01:53:42.040
which kind of have this commercial cheesiness about them,
you know,
but,

2150
01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:46.210
but I don't care about that because that's how it's,
that's how it has to be.

2151
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.180
That's how it has to be.
It says,
and it's set up so that it works.

2152
01:53:49.181 --> 01:53:54.040
I meet 150 people and I'm very careful with every single person that I interact

2153
01:53:54.041 --> 01:53:57.820
with.
And the reason for that is because I'm absolutely thrilled that they're,

2154
01:53:57.821 --> 01:53:59.320
they're,
you know,
they're there,

2155
01:53:59.321 --> 01:54:04.321
they're there because they are trying to not make things worse minimally.

2156
01:54:05.590 --> 01:54:06.610
Right.
And so,
you know,

2157
01:54:06.611 --> 01:54:09.730
one of the themes that we've been discussing in these lectures continually is

2158
01:54:09.731 --> 01:54:13.510
that not only do you have a moral obligation to aim up and be good,

2159
01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:18.100
like to pick the highest value that you can conceive of and pursue that
honestly,

2160
01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:21.160
but that if you don't do that to the degree that you fail,

2161
01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.170
something that's hellish takes that space.
And I really believe that.

2162
01:54:26.171 --> 01:54:30.550
Like I believe that since 1987 when I was studying totalitarianism,

2163
01:54:30.551 --> 01:54:35.350
I realized that it was the abdication of individual responsibility in the final

2164
01:54:35.351 --> 01:54:40.351
analysis that led to the horrors of Nazi Germany and the totalitarian Communist

2165
01:54:40.691 --> 01:54:44.650
states.
It was on us,
each of us.
And so I thought,

2166
01:54:44.651 --> 01:54:47.440
well then the thing to do about that is to do whatever you can to strengthen

2167
01:54:47.441 --> 01:54:52.390
individuals and to make them more,
more like appropriate moral agents.
Not Rights,

2168
01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.750
not the individual rights,
but the individual responsibility.
And I,

2169
01:54:56.050 --> 01:55:00.580
I truly believe that that's how you keep hell at bay.
And so there's a look,

2170
01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.400
cause I really believe that there's a lot of energy in that.

2171
01:55:03.401 --> 01:55:07.600
It's like I'm not interested in having a replication of what happened in the

2172
01:55:07.601 --> 01:55:11.320
20th century,
like enough of that enough.

2173
01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:13.000
And so if,

2174
01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:18.120
if with each person that's on a better path that that probability decreases by

2175
01:55:19.541 --> 01:55:22.330
one 7 billion,
then so be it.

2176
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:25.900
And I think the effect is much larger than that because I think it's a network

2177
01:55:25.901 --> 01:55:26.734
effect.
I

2178
01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.800
<v 2>don't think,
I mean this is what I was saying to you right before we started,</v>

2179
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:32.220
I don't think we can really understand how big it is because now there's

2180
01:55:32.221 --> 01:55:35.580
lectures,
you're doing your show live,
I'm doing standup Rogan's doing his thing,

2181
01:55:35.581 --> 01:55:37.650
Sam's doing all these things and it's not just about us.

2182
01:55:37.651 --> 01:55:41.110
I don't want to make it just about us,
but that there is some other energy.

2183
01:55:41.111 --> 01:55:44.610
So when I talk about the energy of destruction

2184
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:45.443
<v 3>that's out there,</v>

2185
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.090
I think there is a great energy creation and I think we're part of it.

2186
01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.300
I don't know how you're going to top that answer.
I'm just going to a short form,

2187
01:55:51.301 --> 01:55:54.900
which is I,
it's,
it's fascinating.
So I go out in public as I say,

2188
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:58.010
and a lot of people want to take pictures and I'm sure Jordan gets it as much or

2189
01:55:58.010 --> 01:56:02.040
more night.
Uh,
and when you do that,
it's you always hear from people.
Yeah,

2190
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:04.530
you know,
I met this celebrity on the street and they were just such a jerk,

2191
01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:05.820
right?
Like a women,
an actor.

2192
01:56:05.821 --> 01:56:08.310
And the actor was like miffed that they had to get up from dinner.

2193
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:11.700
I have never felt the experience where somebody wanted to take a picture and I

2194
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:13.650
was not delighted that they wanted to take a picture.

2195
01:56:13.651 --> 01:56:16.740
And I think the reason for that is not because like old look at me,

2196
01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:19.170
I get to be in this random person's picture that he puts on as well.

2197
01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:22.200
But because if you actually believe that what you're doing is a reflection of

2198
01:56:22.201 --> 01:56:25.270
values that matter,
it's not that they're engaging with me,
right?

2199
01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.050
So they're engaging with the ideas that I am,
that I am stating.

2200
01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.180
And that's unbelievably exciting that I made in my entire life to espousing a

2201
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:37.200
certain set of values.
And now millions of people are engaging with those values.

2202
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:39.800
And finding those values meaningful.
This is why I,

2203
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:42.870
it's hard for all of us not to sound arrogant because we take our values so

2204
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:43.531
seriously.

2205
01:56:43.531 --> 01:56:46.080
So when we say that maybe the hope for the country lies in the fact that there

2206
01:56:46.081 --> 01:56:47.790
are so many people who actually watch stuff like this.

2207
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:50.850
I don't mean that because I care if people,

2208
01:56:50.851 --> 01:56:53.160
if people were watching me face paint,
you know,

2209
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:55.320
then I don't think that that would have any meaning for me.

2210
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:59.040
But the fact that people watch my show and that they're getting some semblance

2211
01:56:59.041 --> 01:57:03.630
of truth and values out of it.
And what's it,
I will say it is weirder for me.

2212
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.520
I think it's probably better for me than it is for you Jordan,

2213
01:57:05.521 --> 01:57:08.460
because you talk so much about self help and about individual help and all this

2214
01:57:08.461 --> 01:57:09.294
kind of stuff.

2215
01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:12.600
Because I'm a plot a politics guy and I spend most of my day breaking down

2216
01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:13.350
current events.

2217
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:16.320
The fact that I get so many people who email me and I send them to my wife,

2218
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:17.880
I send them to my,
my parents cause I,

2219
01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:21.030
this is the stuff I'm actually the proudest of is when I get emails from people

2220
01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:24.330
and I got one today from some guy who said,
yeah,

2221
01:57:24.331 --> 01:57:27.180
I knocked at my girlfriend and I didn't know what to do about it.

2222
01:57:27.181 --> 01:57:29.340
And then I started listening to your show and I realized that for me to be a

2223
01:57:29.341 --> 01:57:32.250
better and more responsible human being,
I needed to marry my girlfriend.

2224
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:34.150
And we've been married now for three years and my,

2225
01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.030
she was thinking about getting an abortion.
I listened to your show,

2226
01:57:36.031 --> 01:57:38.430
she didn't get an abortion.
Now we have a kid and it's just an amazing,

2227
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:42.060
amazing thing.
Like that's the stuff that I care about.
I think politics,

2228
01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:44.520
what I do for living the politics,

2229
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:46.470
that's the stuff that's existing on top of the iceberg.

2230
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.090
And what I hope I'm doing is talking about this in a sense that allows people to

2231
01:57:51.091 --> 01:57:53.160
draw a straight line down to the bottom of the iceberg and said,
okay,

2232
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:55.440
well the real important stuff is not what's happened in the Mueller

2233
01:57:55.441 --> 01:57:56.370
investigation up here.

2234
01:57:56.430 --> 01:58:00.300
It's what's happening in terms of truth and decency and waiting for available

2235
01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:02.040
evidence down here to take one example.

2236
01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:06.840
And so every news story is supposed to tie down into the rootedness of a value

2237
01:58:06.841 --> 01:58:09.750
system and the fact that people are hungry for those values.

2238
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.210
That is what I'm really excited about.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's absolutely,
well,

2239
01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:15.150
you know,

2240
01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:19.170
I mentioned earlier that the tendency of the audiences to go silent when I talk

2241
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:21.930
about the relationship between meaning and responsibility,
and that's,

2242
01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.840
well that's a sustaining thing.
It's like,
look,

2243
01:58:24.841 --> 01:58:29.040
there's all these thousands of people and what are they starving for our heavy

2244
01:58:29.041 --> 01:58:33.420
moral burden.
This is right.
So amazing.
It's like,
hey,
money opinion,

2245
01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:37.800
sometimes 150 bucks a ticket,
one of the best look,
I hear someone say,

2246
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:41.980
fix yourself and buy my shit.
Don't,
I'm not anything,

2247
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.020
<v 2>you know,
there's a book,
but yeah,
but it's like,</v>

2248
01:58:44.210 --> 01:58:46.680
<v 3>it's on you.
It's on you bolt on you.
This is,</v>

2249
01:58:47.110 --> 01:58:51.860
this is the reality of the backlash because for thousands of years it was the

2250
01:58:51.861 --> 01:58:54.760
religious community saying you have responsibility,
you have duty,

2251
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:57.500
you have responsibility of duty.
And then over the last hundred and 50 years,

2252
01:58:57.501 --> 01:59:00.920
people like,
no,
we're not gonna do any of that stuff.
You know what,
forget it.

2253
01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:03.680
And now people are going,
well,
you know,

2254
01:59:03.710 --> 01:59:07.250
that has some upside but also has an awful lot of downside.
And we,

2255
01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:08.660
none of us are theocrats in the room.

2256
01:59:08.661 --> 01:59:12.500
I don't want a religiously oriented society where there's some king up top who's

2257
01:59:12.501 --> 01:59:14.000
telling everybody what to do apart from it.

2258
01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:17.360
But people are hungry for a set of eternal values.
Yeah.

2259
01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:19.280
And if they don't get those eternal values,

2260
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:22.220
they will find something else to fill the hole.

2261
01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:26.060
And we'll be anger or will be drugs or will be hedonism or will be selfishness.

2262
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:29.920
And it'd be ideology or ideology and all of these things.
And,

2263
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:32.870
and I am an ideolog because my ideology is my values.

2264
01:59:32.871 --> 01:59:35.480
But it will be political ideology.
It will be political tribalism.

2265
01:59:35.481 --> 01:59:39.620
It'll be race based stuff.
It'll be ethnic and no centricity.
We all those things.

2266
01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:45.280
What we're doing by promoting a set of of values that that matter is we are

2267
01:59:45.741 --> 01:59:48.140
allowing people to,
to not only keep the cas at bay,

2268
01:59:48.141 --> 01:59:50.880
but but find a path amidst the chaos you,

2269
01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:54.200
Viktor Frankl says in man's search for meaning that in the middle of the

2270
01:59:54.201 --> 01:59:56.630
Holocaust,
what kept certain people alive and why did certain people die.
He said,

2271
01:59:56.631 --> 01:59:58.970
because if you were in the middle of the Holocaust living in the death camp,

2272
01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:02.840
it was the people who found some sense of purpose in the death camp who actually

2273
02:00:02.841 --> 02:00:05.930
got to live and how can you find purpose in the most purposeless place in the

2274
02:00:05.931 --> 02:00:08.150
history of humankind.
He said,
it didn't matter.

2275
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:12.860
If human beings can find meaning living in a living in a concentration camp

2276
02:00:12.861 --> 02:00:14.300
where people are getting gassed to death every day,

2277
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:16.670
then you certainly should be able to find meaning in the freest,
most rich,

2278
02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:18.910
most prosperous human society in the history of humanity.
Right?

2279
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:22.640
<v 2>Right,
right.
That Shapiro is how you ended.
I will add that the,</v>

2280
02:00:22.641 --> 02:00:25.220
I like when people come up to me to,
of course,
Ben knows this,

2281
02:00:25.221 --> 02:00:28.550
there is a girl who works at the hardware store that's only a few blocks away

2282
02:00:28.551 --> 02:00:31.160
from here,
who always says to me,
Dave,
I'm a big fan of yours,

2283
02:00:31.161 --> 02:00:35.060
but I really liked that bench or bureau.
All right guys,

2284
02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.450
I will be with thanks to both of you.

2285
02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.630
[inaudible] you're the religious guy now,
right?

2286
02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:45.500
Um,
I will be at the Orpheum with Jordan on.
There can't be any tickets left,

2287
02:00:45.501 --> 02:00:46.820
right?
For the La show Saturday,

2288
02:00:46.821 --> 02:00:50.230
but you maybe can get them on stubhub or something like that and perhaps a

2289
02:00:50.231 --> 02:00:54.020
certain orthodox Jew will show up because it's after Shabbat.
You never know.

2290
02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.080
My wife thing is possible.
All right.
Thank you guys for watching.

2291
02:00:59.850 --> 02:00:59.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>
