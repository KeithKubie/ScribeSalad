1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.770
Okay.
So last time we started talking about conjugation,

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
the special properties that a functional groups have when they're adjacent to

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.790
one another in particular,
uh,
die.

4
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:17.610
Enes we talked last time about the Al Il system.
Uh,

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.420
the question is when does conjugation make a difference?
That is,

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.700
when is it simple enough and accurate enough to think in terms of isolated

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.030
functional groups with Payer Wise Adam interactions.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.330
So we started with giving last time with giving experimental evidence that Al

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.960
Cad,
ion and ion and radical or all stabilized by something of the order of 13

10
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.270
kilocalories per mole.
And in fact,

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.870
the transition states when they're alloy lake are also stabilized.

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.150
And then right at the end,
last time you guessed for me and did the,

13
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.200
did the right thing to show that the dying at the bottom is special because it's

14
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.480
conjugated as opposed to the other deans.

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.070
So the heat that's involved in removing the double bonds is,

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.800
is less because it started out more stable.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.030
But here conjugation is worth only about four kilocalories per mole,

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:14.031
evidently compared to 13 kilocalories and Al Lilly situations.

19
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.050
Another way of measuring it is to look at how difficult it is to rotate about

20
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:22.680
the single bond between the two double bonds in beauty dying.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.250
So for confirmations we can have sin or sort of like eclipsed and Auntie.

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
And in between those there's a twisted form where the two ends are perpendicular

23
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:38.070
to one another.
And of course there's then no overlap across the middle.

24
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.490
The Pi says the two Pi Systems on the ends are orthogonal.

25
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.410
So you might expect that to the extent that conjugation is worth something,

26
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.150
the interaction of these pie things,

27
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.110
you'd lose it in this twisted form because they don't overlap.

28
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.920
So you might expect that the energy curve would look like that as we,
uh,

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.640
twist it.
In fact,
it's more or less like that.

30
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.760
But there's another factor which is up at the top left there,

31
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:07.590
you can see there's going to be repulsion between the groups when their sins.

32
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.560
So that's going to raise the left end of this plot.

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800
So that's what it actually looks like as determined by Raman spectroscopy.

34
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.840
Uh,
okay.
So,
but the important thing is to look at how big the barrier is.

35
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.880
You can see the barriers about six kilocalories per mole in this case versus

36
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.881
about 60 kilocalories per mole for twisting the interaction between two p

37
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:36.660
orbitals across a single,
across the normal double bond and isolated double bond.

38
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.080
So the one between the two double bonds is 10 times easier to rotate than the

39
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:47.790
one that's involved in genuine double bond.
Even though when you look at it,

40
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.800
they're just four P orbitals in a row.

41
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
It's not immediately obvious that there's anything special about the one in the

42
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.480
middle that would make it easier to rotate than the ones at the ends,
which are,

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.760
we know to be hard to rotate.
Okay,

44
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.450
so why is conjugation worth more in Allah Lake Intermediate?

45
00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.940
So the order of 13 kilocalories per mole than it is in dying where it's only a

46
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.630
handful,
you know,
a three to six kilocalories per mole,

47
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.490
uh,
one would be tempted to say it's because we can draw a reasonable resonance

48
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.610
structures.
In the case of an alcoholic intermediate,

49
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.840
those two at the top there are good.
They're equivalent to one another.

50
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.080
The one at the bottom is bad because we have to separate charge.

51
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.640
But that's not really a physical theory.
As we know the residents theory,

52
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.520
it is a very handy thing to,
to uh,

53
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.650
to remind us of what really happens,
but it's not what really happens.

54
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.860
We have to look at how the orbitals interact with one another.

55
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
So we're going to now having looked at some experimental evidence for the,
uh,

56
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.440
extent of stabilization due to conjugation,

57
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.610
we're going to look at the theory behind it.
Okay.

58
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.800
And we're going to work in terms of simple huckle ammos the,
the,

59
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.180
uh,

60
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.900
PowerPoint chooses that particular color to give links.

61
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:12.700
If you link there,
you can get,
uh,
a simple minded,
uh,

62
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.600
uh,

63
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
program to run on your computer that will let you make simple Hickle mos.

64
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.480
So,
uh,
Eric [inaudible] was a physicist,
the theorist,

65
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.050
and not long after Schrodinger develop quantum mechanics,

66
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:30.190
he began to apply it to some organic type molecules.
In particular,

67
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.100
the interaction of p orbitals with one another.

68
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.350
His brother was an organic chemist,

69
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.180
wrote a very influential textbook of advanced organic chemistry and no doubt

70
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.210
influenced him some in this interest.
Uh,

71
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.900
but it's a very simple minded theory as you might've expected from,

72
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.230
from being so soon after the,
um,

73
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.400
after shredding or developed a wave mechanics.

74
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.710
But anyhow,
uh,
uh,
these results are due to that.

75
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:03.400
And I don't think it's appropriate to take the time to go into the limitations

76
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.830
of the theory,
but let's just take it as a,

77
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.750
as a qualitative guide to the way things work in quantum mechanics.
Okay.

78
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.970
So suppose we have four P orbitals in a row.

79
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:15.220
There's the energy of an isolated p orbital.

80
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.430
Now there are two ways to look at beauty dying.

81
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.670
You can look at it as a whole or you can look at it as two double bonds and see

82
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.240
how they interact with one another.
And let's compare those two ways of doing it.

83
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.310
So first,
let's look at it as a whole.

84
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:34.330
You take those four P orbitals in a row and you combine them to make the best

85
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.950
possible,
uh,
molecular orbital psy one,
then the next best.

86
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.510
Then the next best,
then the next best,
right?
So that's what they look like.

87
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.200
And they have the what you would anticipate in terms of nodal structure.

88
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:50.470
The lowest one has no nodes except the note of the p orbital.

89
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.120
The next one has one node,
two nodes,
three nodes,
right?
But it's not,

90
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.260
there's a little bit more to it than that.

91
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.950
You notice that the best one is big in the middle.
Why?

92
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.120
Why are the P orbitals big in the middle rather than all of them being the same

93
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.630
size to get the best overall overlap?

94
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.290
<v 1>Elissa,
what do you say?</v>

95
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.170
<v 0>Right?
The ones in the middle have to overlaps.
And in fact,</v>

96
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.200
you can write a simple equation that will maximize the product of adjacent

97
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:29.930
orbitals.
That is the overlap subject to the sum of their squares.
Big One.

98
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.810
And you get that shape,
right?

99
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.510
So to maximize the bonding orbital overlap,

100
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.780
the central atomic orbitals are large inside one,

101
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.880
and for the same reason,
they're small inside to why should they be small?

102
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.770
Right?
Because the overlap in the middle is hurting you now.
So make it small,

103
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.620
get the overlap on the ends.
Okay.

104
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.830
Notice incidentally that three and four turn out,

105
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:03.280
they're not as good as they could be,
as as they could possibly be,

106
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.130
but as bad as they could possibly be here.

107
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:09.790
Or the one that's in the middle where it's favorable is small here.

108
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:12.250
The one where it's unfavorable is large,

109
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.400
that that turns out to be the flip side of,

110
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.590
do people know what flip side is?

111
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.850
It occurs to me that that's something that people might not know anymore.

112
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.920
When you had vinyl records,
you'd buy it,
buy a song.
That would be,

113
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.700
and there would be some other song on the back that wasn't very good.
Right?

114
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.500
So you'd play this side of the record.

115
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:35.830
That was the real what venue had the flip side,
right?
Which wasn't so great.

116
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.600
So the flip side of having these be as good as possible is those have to be as

117
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:44.650
bad as possible.
The bonding of the anti-bonding once.
Okay.
Anyhow,

118
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.620
there's a little cultural history for you.
So we have,

119
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.330
so we have four P electrons and they go into those two orbitals and get

120
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:55.990
stabilized.
And that's the energy.
Then the pie energy of the,

121
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.830
of the Buda dying,
that a four p orbitals in a row.

122
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.570
Now let's look at the other way.

123
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.700
Let's see if we just look at localized Pi bonds on each end.
How different is it?

124
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.250
Okay,
so we get two Pi orbitals,
one on each end,
two Pi Stars,

125
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:13.120
one on each end,

126
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.990
and the four electrons go down into the two Pi orbitals.
Right?

127
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.600
And what we want to do is see how that compares with the deal localized orbitals

128
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:26.590
on the left.
How different are they an overall stability?
Well,

129
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.930
let's analyze it this way.
We know that in fact,

130
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.730
we could mix these two with one another.

131
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:33.940
This is Pi plus Pi and Pi minus Pi.

132
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.280
So we're getting things that look a little bit like this,

133
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.510
but they're not distorted to optimize the overlap.
Okay?

134
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.610
And if we the ABS,
then these,
this goes down and this goes up the same amount.

135
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.160
That's part of the,
you know,
in truth,

136
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.100
that one that goes up goes up a little more than the one that goes down and goes

137
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:52.810
down.
Right.
But that's part of the hook.

138
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.940
All approximation is that they go up and down in the same amount.
Okay?

139
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.060
So the average is the same as where it started,
right?

140
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.300
But it's a little worse than it was on the left when we optimize things.

141
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.420
Now you can optimize things on the right too and see why it's not very important

142
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.550
to do this change in size.
Okay,

143
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.120
so here are the Pi Star orbitals that we got just by adding the two ends,

144
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.440
but now we can mix among these,
right?

145
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.230
So look what happens if we mix this one,

146
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.620
the two nodes with the no nodes,
right?

147
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.840
We can make it so it reinforces in the middle and cancels on the end and get a

148
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:38.841
thing that looks like that and that will make it a little bit lower in energy to

149
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:42.570
do that.
To mix this one with this one,
right?

150
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.470
We started with just isolated p orbitals and now we're letting them interact

151
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:50.990
with one another.
Okay.
To see how much difference it makes.
But this secondary,

152
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.440
the secondary mixing,
the first mixing was making these from here,

153
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.630
right?
The secondary mixing is minor because the energy matches so bad.

154
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.790
You don't mix very much of this into this one to get that or of this into this

155
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.870
one to get that.
Okay.
At the same time,

156
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.830
this one can mix with this one and that one will go down just a little bit,

157
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.050
but notice that the amount by which they went down is very small because of the

158
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.440
bad energy match.
Right?
Okay.

159
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.490
But then the ones on the far right or the same as the ones on the left.

160
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.630
If we let these interact with one another right into stages,

161
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.370
but that second stage,

162
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:37.050
the one that made it big in the middle and small on the ends here didn't account

163
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:42.051
for much energy because the energy match was so bad of the things we were mixing

164
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.280
and the same here.
Now you might say that that's it's,

165
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.170
it's only about three kilocalories per mole Max.

166
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.270
That's only the barrier to rotation of ethane,
right?
It's not very much.

167
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.220
Okay.
Now why did we ignore this mixing?
Because they're,

168
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.930
the energy matches pretty good.

169
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.080
Can anybody see why we didn't consider that mixing

170
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.870
there?
It might've been more important.

171
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.863
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.420
<v 0>What's the overlap of this with this?
Notice that there,</v>

173
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.700
despite the better energy match,

174
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.530
it doesn't lower the energy because these are orthogonal to one another.

175
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:27.390
They won't mix.
Right.

176
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.550
What is gained at two of the positions is lost that the other positions that is

177
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.570
if you adjusted on the left to be big in the middle and small on the outside on

178
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.410
the right,
it'll be just the opposite.
So you won't gain anything.
Okay.

179
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.490
So you,
you consider only this would mixing with that one.

180
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:46.800
This one makes me with that one and that doesn't count for much.

181
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.430
That's why you don't get much out of a dying.
Okay.

182
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.970
So although the total energies are nearly the same with and without conjugation,

183
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.650
that is the total energy that we calculate here is almost the same as the total

184
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:03.970
energy.
We calculate their,
there's just that few kilocalories difference.
Right?

185
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.100
But the energy of the homo and the energy of the Lumo are quite different here

186
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:13.090
from what they are here.
So if you're interested in reactivity,

187
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.870
then the conjugation makes a difference.
Right.

188
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.240
If you're interested actually what's not the total energy,

189
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720
but the energy of the homo and the energy of the Lumo.

190
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.170
And also if you're interested in color,
right?

191
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.860
Because if you want to take one of these electrons with light and put it up into

192
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:34.600
the anti-bonding orbital,
it's a much bigger jump here when it's not conjugated,

193
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:35.980
that here when it's conjugated,

194
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.610
so you'll get the very different color and we'll talk about that later.

195
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.060
For example,
carotene,
the stuff that makes carrots,

196
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:45.250
orange is a bunch of double bonds in a row.

197
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.330
Okay?
Now,
so we see that when we mix these,
they go up and down,

198
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.250
right?
Is there a limit?

199
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:59.170
If we put a whole bunch of these Pi orbitals in a row as in carotene or

200
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.960
something even longer than that?
Can we do,

201
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:05.890
we just keep getting lower and lower and lower and lower energies for the lowest

202
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:09.310
energy?
So let's consider a few of these and just think about it.

203
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.090
The sort of approximately quantitatively.
So they're,

204
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.210
the chain length is too for ethylene,
right?

205
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.070
And the normalized atomic orbital size is one over the square root of two.

206
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:24.610
So when we square and some we get one.
Okay,

207
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.150
so the overlap when you have this one Pi bond is one half,

208
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.960
it's one over the square root of two here,
one over the square root of two here.

209
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.760
Multiply them together to see how,
how much they overlap,
right?

210
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.790
And you get one half in some units.

211
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.390
Now notice we're ignoring the small,

212
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.080
smallish inner influence of overlap on normalization.

213
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.210
Because remember when we take overlap into account,

214
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:53.650
we have to make them a little bit smaller,

215
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:56.140
a little less than one greater than one kind of thing.

216
00:13:56.141 --> 00:14:00.340
We're ignoring that just to get an idea of what's going on.
Okay,

217
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:04.420
so the overlap is a half.
There's only one Pi bond in that case,

218
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.380
so we get a half times one.
The total overlap.

219
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:12.490
State stabilization is a half in these sort of weird units.

220
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.880
And notice that if you'd compare this with a textbook,

221
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.950
you'll see they use a unit called Beta,

222
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.750
which turns out to be half as big as this unit is.
But anyhow,

223
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:25.810
I think it's easy to go through it this way.
Okay.

224
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:27.610
Now suppose we have four in a row.

225
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.980
Now the chain length is for the normalized size is one over the square root of

226
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:36.010
four so that you could square in,
sum them up and get one.

227
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.080
And now the overlap between each pair of neighbors is one of the square root of

228
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:45.430
four times one over the square root of four,
right?
So it's one fourth.

229
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.530
Okay.
And there are three such bond interactions here,
here,
here.

230
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.730
So there are three times a fourth or three fourths.
So indeed it's more stable.

231
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.360
Okay,
that lowest energy orbital,

232
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.060
the one that's approximated like this.
Now suppose we have eight in a row.

233
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.960
Now the normalized atomic orbitals size is one over the square root of eight.

234
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.950
One eight is the overlap per bond.
And there are seven bonds.

235
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.870
So we get seven eighths is the amount of stabilization.
So it's going down,
down,

236
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:21.650
down,
down,
and obviously each time we add one it's add a pair.

237
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.610
It's going to go down more and more.
Is there a limit?

238
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.160
Is it chief?
Just that just keep going.

239
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.440
Obviously it'll get a little bit better,
a little bit better.

240
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:41.030
But does it approach a limit?
Can you see what it would be if n were infinite,

241
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.520
if the number that chain links were infinite?
Yeah,

242
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.130
it approaches one,
right?
Cause if you have n,

243
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:53.710
it's one over the square root of n and there one over n is the overlap and there

244
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.770
n minus one of these payers,
right?

245
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:01.730
So it's n minus one over n which approaches one is in gets very large.

246
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.290
So there's a limit to how good it can get,
right?
And incidentally,

247
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.000
that limit is twice what it started out here.
Here,
right?

248
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.010
It was a half and it approaches one.

249
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.510
And incidentally we also get bad combinations.
The Anti Bond,

250
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.100
right?
But it's exactly the opposite of this.
So the,

251
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:26.510
the worst anti-bonding combination,
right is,

252
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.980
is the destabilization is twice that of Pi Star,
right?

253
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.980
So these approach a limit,
and that suggests,

254
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:38.810
although it doesn't prove this construction that allows you to view what the

255
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:43.811
energies of the orbital will be in this simple approximation for any length of

256
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.550
chain.
So you draw a semicircle.

257
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.450
The vertical axis is the energy zero is a p orbital.

258
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.470
Here's plus one minus one.
Those are the limits if you have a very long chain.

259
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.920
But it turns out there's this geometrical analogy that if what you do is draw

260
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:05.171
this circle whose radius is twice the stabilization of the Po of the two P

261
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:09.350
orbitals in the Pi bond and has that limit,

262
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.720
and then you put points along this circle along the circumference,

263
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.650
evenly spaced along the circumference,
right?

264
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.360
It turns out that the height of the intersection of those points is the energy

265
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.550
that the energy of the various orbitals you can have.

266
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.460
So if you have just one p orbital,
you put it here,

267
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:35.690
equal distance between top and bottom and has the energy zero,
right?

268
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.370
So that's the energy of an isolated p orbital.
That was definition actually.

269
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.620
Okay,
now we take ethylene.

270
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:47.621
So we put two evenly spaced points along here to divide it into three along the

271
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:52.230
circumference,
right?
And now we can put two electrons in ethylene,

272
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.920
and that's the energy they'll have in a Pi orbital.
Okay?

273
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.550
It's a half halfway down here,
okay?

274
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.740
And now we take an equals three that's the Allina system,

275
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.320
but three equally spaced dots,
right?

276
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.310
And there are the energies in the alley or radical too,
in the two.

277
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.570
Two of the three p orbitals of the electrons in the P orbitals are in the lowest

278
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:19.680
energy molecular orbital and one is up here.
Now,

279
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.640
what's the stabilization compared to what?
Right?

280
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.500
Compared to what you had if you had just the Pi bond and a p orbital,

281
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:29.334
a radical,

282
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.930
how much better is it to have them next to one another and overlapping and an

283
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.290
hour they'll system?
Well,

284
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.500
you can see that if you had just a p orbital and a Pi Bond,

285
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:41.070
you'd have these energies in Allah.
You have these energies,

286
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.173
<v 1>okay,</v>

287
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.920
<v 0>so that's the allelic stabilization.
Notice the,
the orbitals,</v>

288
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.270
the electrons that got stabilized,

289
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.010
we're the ones in the lowest orbital in the difference between having them

290
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:57.720
separate and having them together.

291
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.190
And what that means is that it doesn't make any difference whether you have this

292
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:06.660
electron there or not.
If that electron is not there,
you have a cad I ion.

293
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.980
If the electron is there,
you have a radical,
if there are two electrons there,

294
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:14.820
you have the Alpha like an ion.
But in each of those cases,

295
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.210
the amount of stabilization you get is the same,
right?

296
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.810
So you get the same two electron stabilization,
whether you have cad,

297
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:23.130
I and radical or anti,

298
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.793
<v 1>okay?</v>

299
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.270
<v 0>Now let's,
uh,
and incidentally,
uh,
when we look at this one,</v>

300
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.960
remember that's just an isolated p orbital.
But in the alley,
all case,

301
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.680
it'll look like this.
It's the one with one node,
right?

302
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.870
Plus on one side,
minus on the other.
But that's going to be generally true,

303
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:47.010
however long the chain is,
right?
If you have an odd number,

304
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:51.750
odd chain here,
we had n equals three.
But if you had any equals five five,

305
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:56.280
you'd have blue,
nothing red,
nothing blue,

306
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.060
right?
And notice that in this orbital,

307
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:04.650
there's no overlap between the adjacent between occupied atomic orbitals,

308
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.570
right?
They're far apart,
so there's no interaction between them.
Therefore,

309
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:13.530
their energy will be the same as an isolated p orbital in this crude

310
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:17.970
approximation,
okay?
So every odd,

311
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
every odd chain is going to have at an orbital that has the same energy as an

312
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:27.570
isolated p orbital,
and it's going to have a node at every other carbon,
every,

313
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.150
every second carbon.
Okay.

314
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.690
Now suppose you have n equals four right now you have these energies for the

315
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:41.700
four electrons compared to this that you'd have if you had two Pi orbitals,

316
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.870
right?

317
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:47.710
So the favorable orbital is favored compared to the electrons in the orbitals

318
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:51.640
when they were isolated.
But this one is less stable.

319
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.280
It's the one that's anti-bonding in the middle,
remember?

320
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.540
But this one remember was big in the middle and this one we made,

321
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.730
and this one we made small than the middle.

322
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:03.370
So this one went down more than this one went up.

323
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.180
And the difference is the resonance stabilization,
right?

324
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.710
But it's not as big.

325
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.420
The difference between these two is not as big as how much those lowest two got

326
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:18.240
stabilized in Alley Hill.
So that's why conjugation is worth more in these aloe,

327
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:23.200
like intermediate,
like 13 kilocalories per mole than it is in a dying.

328
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.810
Because in the dying,
some go up in some go down.

329
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

330
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.140
<v 0>So as the conjugated chain lengthens,</v>

331
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.830
more and more levels get crowded between minus wants.

332
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:37.900
Here's the limit of the lowest one.

333
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.600
There's the highest one and we're putting dots along here.

334
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.060
But as we put more and more,
longer and longer chain,

335
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:47.980
we're going to crowd more and more energy levels between those two limits.

336
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.990
So what that means,
the Homo Lumo gap is going to decrease.

337
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.100
So as we make it longer and longer,
you'll have this gap and then this gap,

338
00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:00.520
this gap,
this gap,
this gap,
this gap.
Why did I draw it like this?

339
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.220
Why don't I use those colors?

340
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

341
00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.040
<v 0>Has is the energy gets smaller.
It absorbs longer and longer wavelengths,</v>

342
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.881
right?

343
00:22:13.881 --> 00:22:18.350
So you can too in the color of a conjugated die in by how long are conjugated

344
00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:20.600
Pauline,
by how long you make the chain.

345
00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:25.040
And we'll see examples of that too is a good thing to talk about now because

346
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.840
very soon the spring migrant birds will be coming back to east rock park and

347
00:22:29.841 --> 00:22:32.210
these beautiful tropical colors they've acquired.

348
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.680
And most of them have to do with that,
as you'll see.
Okay,

349
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.040
now let's look at heats of hydrogenation and conjugation.

350
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.400
So here's cyclohexane.
Here's cyclohexene.

351
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.910
The heat of hydrogenation to change this to that is 28 kilocalories per mole

352
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.090
gives off heat.
Okay?
Now let's take,

353
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.520
let's take two double bonds,
right?
And they're conjugated,

354
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.223
right?

355
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.230
That turns out to remove both of those would go down here is 54 right?

356
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.020
That is the second double bond was taught worth 26 does everybody with me on

357
00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:14.750
that?
Okay,
so 26 isn't as bad,

358
00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.460
isn't as big as 28 that means this was a little bit lower than we would have

359
00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:24.140
expected.
Why?
As it's conjugated,
right?

360
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.070
It's better than just to isolate a double bonds because they're conjugated.

361
00:23:28.071 --> 00:23:32.180
The the lowest orbital went down a little more than the next one went up.

362
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.380
That's what we just talked about.
So of,

363
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.130
but that's not very much to write home about.

364
00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.030
It says that conjugation is worth about two kilocalories per mole by this

365
00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:46.031
measure right now let's put another double bond in the ring and tell me what you

366
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:51.920
think.
That's going to be,
what do you think the gap is going to be here?

367
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.240
Any ideas?
Let's get a couple of hypotheses out there.

368
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.640
Cassie,
what do you say?

369
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.220
Why do you say 24 why not 26

370
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.080
yeah,
it was,
it was a little bit less,
maybe a little less.
Again,

371
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:21.550
another reason it could be less again is this last double bond interacts on two

372
00:24:21.551 --> 00:24:26.110
ends,
not just on one end.
So it might get to have those interactions,
right?

373
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.330
So maybe 24 maybe,
maybe.
Uh,
22 if,
if it,

374
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.190
if it depended on how we calculate that,

375
00:24:33.191 --> 00:24:38.191
that would predict that we'd get about 78 the heat of hydrogenation of benzene

376
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.340
to give cyclohexane should be about 78 all together.

377
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.570
You know what it is experimentally?
49

378
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.053
<v 1>right?</v>

379
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.590
<v 0>So this conjugation in a ring in benzene is really worth a lot.</v>

380
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.370
Not just a little bit more because it,
you get the same thing on two ends,

381
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.150
but a lot more.
It's worth about 30 kilocalories per mole.

382
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.660
Here we were talking about two kilocalories per mole.
This is 30.

383
00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:14.430
So this is a big deal and this is such a big deal that it has a special name

384
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:16.980
associated with it.
It's called Arrow Medicity.

385
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.710
The name originally had to do with the odor.

386
00:25:19.711 --> 00:25:23.450
Benzene has a characteristic odor and other things that have benzene and um,

387
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.420
that,
that are volatile,
have a characteristic odor.
They were called aromatic.

388
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.920
But now the idea of [inaudible] is much more associated with this special

389
00:25:31.921 --> 00:25:35.070
stability when you have a bunch of double bonds in a ring.

390
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.303
<v 1>Okay?</v>

391
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.530
<v 0>Now,</v>

392
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.530
so bringing the ends of a conjugated chain together to form a ring gives a

393
00:25:44.441 --> 00:25:46.870
lowest,
uh,
uh,

394
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.670
lowest occupied orbital with another bond,
right?
We've got,

395
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:54.260
we've got all these P orbitals in a row.
Remember we made the,

396
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:57.220
the little bit bigger in the middle of little smaller on the end to optimize the

397
00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:58.054
overlap.

398
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.890
But if we bring them around and touch the ends for no additional charge,

399
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.990
we get an extra bond here,
a whole new Pi bond.

400
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.640
So that's much more effective than just these little changes that are made by

401
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:17.500
adjusting the sizes.
So the lowest molecular orbital.

402
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:22.501
Now we'll have an of these overlaps rather than n minus one are you with me on

403
00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:27.030
that?
Right when we had a chain,

404
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.240
the number of payers as down the chain was one less than the number of atoms.

405
00:26:32.611 --> 00:26:35.520
But if we bring them to the leather together and let the ends touch,

406
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.140
then we get another one.

407
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.550
So it's an over and so it goes to minus one the lowest possible energy.

408
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.340
So a conjugated,
a conjugated ring,

409
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.290
the nodes as you go around the ring must come in and even number.

410
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.440
Let's look for example at the three membered ring.

411
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:56.310
So here are three p orbitals viewed from the top.
All right,

412
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.650
so there are no nodes obviously,

413
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.270
and the energy of that is going to be minus one on the scale.

414
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.950
The scale we were talking about,
right?

415
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:07.440
Each of these is one over the square root of three.

416
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.310
The overlap here is one third,
one third,
one third,

417
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:15.420
one third totals to one minus one and energy,
okay?

418
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.660
And there are no nodes,
but now let's suppose we want to make a node,

419
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.120
but now here,
here we have an energy that's a half.

420
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:28.110
It's the same as ethylene.
Right?
But notice we have a note we have,

421
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.790
we can't have just one note as you go around.
Cause if we go red to blue,

422
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.330
we have to go back and some place we're going to have to have another node as we

423
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:38.820
go around there to get back to the pink again,

424
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:44.390
you can't just have one node unless just to look ahead a little bit,

425
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:47.310
you twist it and make a mobius strip.

426
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.860
But that's quite a job.
We'll see that it has been done but it's quite a job.

427
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.600
Okay.
So anyhow,
the nodes come in pairs.
So there are two like that.
But the,

428
00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.760
the other aspect of that,

429
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:04.680
I was going to say the flip side is that you get another way of doing the same

430
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:07.320
thing.
So you,
you could get two nodes here.

431
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.720
You can also get two nodes that way.

432
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.370
So there are two different ways to get two nodes,
right?
So you,

433
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.140
you have a lowest one and then you have a pair that have the,

434
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:23.880
there's one with no nodes,
then there's a pear with two nodes,
right?

435
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.610
And they have the same energy,
right?

436
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:31.910
So now we can look at the energy shift that happens when you form one of these

437
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:36.860
rings.
That is how much is the era materiality worth?
Okay,

438
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.900
so there was Buda dying,
which we did already.

439
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.440
Now suppose we bring the ends together that were there was the lowest one and

440
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:48.090
now we have an end to end interaction.

441
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.320
So those interact with one another and obviously that's favorable and it will go

442
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:56.730
down and energy,
right?
Also they'll become of the same size.

443
00:28:56.731 --> 00:29:00.210
Once you do that because it's no longer advantageous to have it big in the

444
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:03.690
middle and small on the ends because there isn't an end anymore.

445
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.121
How about that one?

446
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:10.350
When you bring the two ends together and let them touch what will happen to its

447
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:12.330
energy?
Ellen,
what do you say?

448
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.393
<v 2>Pardon me?</v>

449
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.630
<v 0>What?
What do you mean decrease?
Well,
the energy go up or down.</v>

450
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.070
<v 2>When you touch the two ends.
Why do you say so?</v>

451
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.020
<v 0>There's another interaction,
but look at the interaction.
Look at the colors.</v>

452
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.320
When you touch the two ends together.
When you bring,
when you bend it around.

453
00:29:36.321 --> 00:29:41.300
So this touches that.
That's anti-bonding.

454
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.870
That's cute,
Huh?
Okay.
So that one's going to go up in energy.

455
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.240
Now how about the next one?
That one's going to be favorable,

456
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.210
that'll go down in energy and end up the same place.
This was,

457
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:59.350
remember there was a lowest one and then two pairs,

458
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.460
right?
Two which had a pair of nodes,
right?

459
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.410
And the next one that's going to be unfavorable again.
Right?

460
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.400
So the structure when you bring the ends together is going to be different.

461
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.000
And fortunately there's a mnemonic device,

462
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:19.420
a geometric one just like this that works in that case as well.

463
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:26.130
<v 0>And notice that the shifts alternate down,
up,
down,
up,</v>

465
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.310
and they must do that because of the number of nodes.

466
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.620
If you have an even number of nodes,

467
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:34.770
it'll be favorable because you'll have the same sign on the two hands.

468
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.470
If you have an odd number of nodes,
it'll be unfavorable.

469
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:39.360
So it has to be that down,
up,
down,

470
00:30:39.361 --> 00:30:42.510
up as you go up the scale of Mos,

471
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:45.510
and then curled them to touch their end.

472
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.540
So when you bring the ends of the chain together,

473
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.400
the odd numbered Mos,
one,
three,
five,
decrease in energy,

474
00:30:53.401 --> 00:30:57.870
those are the ones with an even odd,
an odd number of Cha,
uh,
uh,

475
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.830
odd numbers.
Therefore an even number of nodes because the very lowest one,

476
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.720
one has no nodes,
right?
Sorry for the confusion.
Okay?

477
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.340
While the even numbered ones increase in energy.
Thus,

478
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.990
if you have an odd number of occupied mos,

479
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.380
there'll be more going down than going up.

480
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:26.210
Is that clear?
If you have an even number of electron pairs,

481
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.520
there'll be down than up.

482
00:31:28.521 --> 00:31:32.060
That'll canceled down than up that okay on sold down that up,
that'll cancel.

483
00:31:32.061 --> 00:31:35.480
But if you have an odd number you have down then up then down,

484
00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.650
there'll be more downs than up.
If you have an odd number of pairs of electrons,

485
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.950
so they're going to get overall stabilization,

486
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:46.640
special stabilization due to this Arrow materiality.

487
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.120
If you have an odd number of electron pairs,

488
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.633
of course,

489
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.000
you also have to take into account the sigma bonds because when you've been

490
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:58.370
things into a ring,
you may introduce rings strain,

491
00:31:58.371 --> 00:32:00.680
like in the three member growing.
There's obviously that,

492
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.230
but as far as the Pi electrons go,

493
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.980
there's going to be special stability if you have an odd number of electron

494
00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:11.720
pairs.
And this,
this gives rise to hook holes rule as it's called,

495
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.860
which is if we have four n plus two Pi electrons,

496
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.760
that's going to be unusually favorable in a conjugated ring compared to what?

497
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.520
Compared to a chain that's not touching the ends,
right?

498
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.330
Linear versus ring is going to be a specially stable.

499
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:37.090
If you have four n plus two Pi electrons,
uh,

500
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.100
that means an odd number of pairs.

501
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.490
So more of these going down than up when you bring the ends together.

502
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.380
And as I said,
there's a circle demonic.
Now remember we had for a chain,

503
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:52.430
we had a semicircle mnemonic for a ring,

504
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:56.630
you have a circle.
It's the same radius minus one to one is the limit,

505
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.190
right?

506
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:03.020
And now you inscribe a regular polygon with a point down,

507
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.950
because remember that lowest one is always going to have minus one is its
energy.

508
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.890
So the point's gotta be at the bottom like that.

509
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:14.900
Now we put dots on there for the energies we're going to have and notice they're

510
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.250
going to come after the first one.
They're going to come in pairs.
Okay?

511
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.970
So if you have [inaudible],
those are the energies you're going to have.

512
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.440
If you have two electrons.

513
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.000
So the cyclo pro penal catye in just two electrons,

514
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.870
that's the energy you're going to have had you had the alley ill,

515
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.920
the three or the three p orbitals in a chain rather than an a ring.

516
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.140
Then we already saw you'd have that.

517
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.510
So now we've got strong stabilization of two electrons coming down from here to

518
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:46.460
here.
Okay,

519
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.030
so there's a lot of aromatics stabilization of the cycle of propane.
Oh,

520
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.890
I right now,
suppose you had the radical,

521
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:59.290
the cycle of pro penal radical versus here's the alley or radical in the cycle

522
00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:01.640
of pro radical.
Two of the electrons will be there,

523
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:06.200
but one has to be up there in one with two nodes,
right?

524
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.920
So this one is going up more than those who are going down,

525
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.090
but there are two going down here and one going up,
right?

526
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.480
If you have the anti and they're going to be two going up and that's bad,

527
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.100
okay?
You lose more here than you gain here.

528
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.860
Now remember,
there's always an emo at minus one.
So what Apps,

529
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:31.850
if we have Cyclo Buda dying for p orbitals,
right,

530
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:36.830
and four electrons.
Now there are energies,
there are the energy levels.

531
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.180
We put two,

532
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.680
we're going to put two electrons down here and one in each of those like that,

533
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.820
right?

534
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.350
And we're going to compare it with normal beauty die in which we saw before.

535
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:50.120
Has a pair here and a pair here.

536
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.280
Notice that these go up more than these go down.
So it's bad.

537
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.830
That's auntie aromatic.

538
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.710
This stabilization that we saw in benzene,

539
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.560
aromatic stabilization is the opposite here.

540
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:06.170
It's bad overall to put the ends together,

541
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.590
although it's good for the best orbital,
okay?

542
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.010
And notice also that these will be singly occupied orbitals.

543
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:15.530
So there'll be a little bit like free radicals,
right?

544
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:19.550
So this is going to be a very reactive species cycle of you to dying,

545
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.100
okay?
Now if you have benzene,
you have six and they look like that,

546
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.623
right?

547
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.720
And now we have six electrons to put in and we compare it with pexa trying as a

548
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:36.020
chain,
which has that.
And now you notice these went down a little.

549
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.870
These went down lot.
These wet up,
but not very much.

550
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.910
So this is where we got that 30 kilocalories of special stabilization had

551
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:48.660
benzene,
right?
A really good example of aromatic,
right?

552
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.620
So four n plus two is the number of electrons in a ring that will give special

553
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:58.050
stability because there'll be more going down than going up.

554
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.380
Now that's interesting.
And it prompted organic chemists when this became,

555
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.010
although HOCAL did it in the,
in the early 1930s,

556
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.280
it didn't reach the consciousness of most organic chemists,

557
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:16.200
even though his brother was an organic chemist until the late 1950 [inaudible]

558
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.160
or 1960s.

559
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:20.970
And then people started trying to make all kinds of rings with P orbitals with

560
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.580
different numbers of electrons and see which ones would they,

561
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:27.810
could they confirm this rule?
And indeed they did confirm it.
Okay.

562
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:32.811
But much more interesting was how this same concept of cyclic conjugation,

563
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:34.470
uh,

564
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:39.470
applies to reactions and to transition states to make reactions faster or

565
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:43.110
slower.
And in that context,

566
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:47.790
we're going to talk about cyclo additions and about electro electro cyclic

567
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.624
reactions.

568
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.310
But first I want to mention also hetero aromatic compounds.

569
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.570
So you can have aromatic compounds that aren't just carbons in the ring.

570
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.860
Like for example,
nitrogen here.
Now,
think of the electrons on nitrogen.

571
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.770
It's forming sigma bonds to carbon on either side.

572
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.080
It has an unshared pair of electrons,

573
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.970
but that's not part of the Pi system that's in the,
in the plane,
right?

574
00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:14.940
It's not part of the P orbitals,
which is what we're talking about.

575
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:19.410
It's an sp squared orbital,
but there is an electron in the p orbital.

576
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.980
That's incidentally,
this is redundant.
I drew a double bond here.

577
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.520
I'm also counting that electron.
Uh,
but that's,

578
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.670
it's actually participating in that double bond,

579
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:34.560
but I'm just showing it there to so that we can keep track of what Hetero atoms

580
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:35.394
are doing.

581
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.930
So there's a p orbital from a p electron from each of the five carbons apy

582
00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.170
electron from nitrogen,
six Pi electrons,

583
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.910
four n plus two where n equals one on that stable.
That's aromatic.

584
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.450
Okay,
now few ran a five membered ring with oxygen.

585
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.640
Oxygen has two unshared pairs,

586
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:57.780
so it has two that are in the sigma system that are irrelevant for our purposes,

587
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.060
but it also has to in the Pi System.

588
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.600
So now you have one from each of the carbons in the Pi system too,

589
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:08.010
from the oxygen six all together.
Great Aromatic,
okay.

590
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.173
Parole.

591
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.860
Now the nitrogen has an unshared pair in that one.

592
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.740
So it's got one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
Good.

593
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.460
That's aromatic to unusually stable,
emit as soul.

594
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.040
This is a tougher one to count.
Okay?

595
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:26.760
One of the nitrogens has an unshared pair that's in the plane.

596
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:29.010
Don't count that one,
but it has.

597
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.490
The other one has a unshared pair that's coming in and out of the plane.

598
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:34.740
That's part of the Pi System,
right?

599
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.590
And there's a single electron on this nitrogen as there was over here.

600
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.420
So now we have one on each of three carbons,
four,
five,
six.

601
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.950
That's aromatic to admit as all.
Incidentally,
that structure is very,

602
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.130
it occurs in the amino acid histidine,
and that,

603
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.790
that's really interesting in that it is involved in long range proton transfer

604
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.600
and enzymes.
Suppose you have a proton here,

605
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.090
but where you need it is way over here.

606
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.920
<v 1>All right?</v>

607
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.400
<v 0>What you can do is this,</v>

608
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.120
<v 1>right?</v>

609
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.860
<v 0>So this hydrogen goes up,</v>

610
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:19.210
this hydrogen goes onto the ring and the ring sort of looks like it's turned

611
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.910
over,
right?

612
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.480
But a hydrogen has gotten up where you want it without actually having to move

613
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:27.760
the proton all that way.
Okay?

614
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:31.930
So these are all what are called Hetero aromatic compounds because they have

615
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.000
Adam's other than carbon in the ring,
but they're stable for the same reason.

616
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.720
We can look at the orbitals of fear and the one with an oxygen in it,

617
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.600
there's the lowest energy orbital.
It's what you expect.

618
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.210
P orbitals all overlapping favorably all around the periphery.
Uh,

619
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.080
no anti-bonding nodes.

620
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:54.040
But then there are two that have anti-bonding nodes,
right?

621
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.660
There's one that has an anti note at the back and in the front here.

622
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:01.570
So it's plus on one side,
minus on the other.

623
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.260
And there's another one that has an anti-bonding node that goes across.

624
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.140
So it intersects the rig both here and here.

625
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.750
So it's plus in back minus in front.

626
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:12.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

627
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.200
<v 0>And then you have the,
uh,
November.
There are,
uh,</v>

628
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.260
there are six electrons in this.
So the two here,
two here,
two here.

629
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.920
These are the anti bonding orbitals and they,
as you can see,

630
00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:30.390
have for each of them has four nodes as you go around the periphery.

631
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.740
So for example,
here,

632
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:34.980
there's a note on the oxygen and node between the carbons and node between the

633
00:40:34.981 --> 00:40:39.090
carbons I'd noted between the carbons four nodes as you go around the ring.

634
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.520
And so these are a pair of the same energy.
Now if you want,

635
00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:49.140
you can go to that,
uh,
that program you'd get on the web and,

636
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.480
and,
uh,
and draw crude calculations to,

637
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.960
to see this kind of thing.
So here's,
here's benzene,
right?

638
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.040
And here are the energies.

639
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:01.980
We're talking about a lowest energy orbital with a pair of electrons,

640
00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:05.880
and then the next two right?
Degenerate as they're called pair,

641
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:09.390
and then anti-bonding and the worst.
Okay?

642
00:41:09.391 --> 00:41:11.550
Now what happens if you put a nitrogen in the ring?

643
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.470
Now the lowest energy orbital is bigger on nitrogen.
Then on the other items,
why

644
00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.910
anybody got an idea why it should be bigger on nitrogen?
Amy,
you've got an idea.

645
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.050
Yeah,
it has a bigger nuclear charge.
It's a better place for the electrons to be.

646
00:41:30.051 --> 00:41:33.140
It's more electronegative as you say.
Okay?

647
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.020
And so it's lower in energy sea than it was here.

648
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.270
It's larger on the end and it's lower in energy.
Okay?

649
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.350
Now if we look at this,
the next orbital here,

650
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.420
what has two nodes here and here?
Right here was here.
It was in benzene.

651
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.530
Here it is in the nitrogen analog.

652
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.560
And notice it's the same energy here in here because it's the same orbital.

653
00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.400
In fact,
what it is,
this is a Pi bond.

654
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.940
Here's a Pi Bond.
They don't interact with one another.

655
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.480
So the energy is minus one.
It's the energy of a Pi Bond,

656
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.070
right?
And it's the same here in nitrogen,
doesn't have anything to do with it.

657
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.850
But the other one,
there was another one here,
okay.

658
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:19.310
So those were identical in shape and an energy.

659
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.420
But there's another one that has the two nodes across the middle here and across

660
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:26.390
here.
And now it does involve nitrogen,
right?

661
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.730
So this one is high electron density on nitrogen and therefore a little bit

662
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:32.690
lower energy.

663
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.260
So these two orbitals that we just looked at that had two nodes where the same

664
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:41.660
energy here,
but different energy in purity.

665
00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:48.300
One with nitrogen.
Now suppose you have 10 atoms in a ring.
Cyclo,
Deca,

666
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:53.060
[inaudible].
Here are the structures,
here are the,
uh,
the,

667
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.750
uh,
energies.
And now here's the lowest one.

668
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.860
Same as you go all around.
The next ones have a node here,

669
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.860
right?
That is two nodes as you go around the,
the periphery.

670
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.910
But notice these,
the right and left don't interact.
There's no orbital here.

671
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.170
So this is just like beauty dying.
And it's the same energy as Buda dying.

672
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.680
And same for this one,
which has the horizontal node.

673
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:21.770
Same energy here as they would have been in Buda dying.

674
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.660
Now the next one has four nodes as you go around and four nodes as you go around

675
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.150
right now,

676
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.860
Naphthalene is to benzene rings next to one another.

677
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.440
How can you go from this to Naphthalene to two six membered rings.

678
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.530
What you could do is take the atom that's in the middle on the top and the

679
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:47.360
middle on the bottom and pull them together.
So they overlap like this.

680
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.130
So then you have to benzine race together.

681
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:57.131
That's naphthalene right now let's look at the energies of that and see why they

682
00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:00.410
come out to be the way they do.
So the very lowest one,

683
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.730
we brought this one to touch that one.
So we introduced the new bond.

684
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.250
Okay,
so it got lower in energy.

685
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

686
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.700
<v 0>And it's big in the middle as you expect because it has more interactions.</v>

687
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.500
Now the next one,

688
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.520
if we take this one and draw the top and bottom together,

689
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.810
like that makes no difference because there are no orbital there.
It's on a node,

690
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.850
right?
So that has the same energy here,
here and here.
Right.

691
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.070
But if we bring the top to bottom together,
what's going to happen?

692
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.043
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

693
00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.620
<v 0>no.
What'd you say?
If I touch this to this,</v>

694
00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:46.330
is that favorable or unfavorable?

695
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.560
It's unfavorable.
So the other one will go up in energy to there.

696
00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.853
<v 1>Hi.</v>

697
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.760
<v 0>And now how about this one up at the top?
If we bring this to touch,</v>

698
00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:07.230
that makes no difference.
There's no orbital there when you have a node.
Right?

699
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:11.280
So that comes straight across.
But how about if we touch this to this?
No,

700
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.160
that's gotta be favorable.
So that one goes,

701
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.730
although that one goes straight across,
the next one goes down in energy.

702
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:23.150
So we can understand the special stability of naphthalene compared the Cyclo

703
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.323
deco pen.

704
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:26.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

705
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.240
<v 0>And notice not only that,
but this,</v>

706
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:36.270
this one which has nodes here and here has just isolated pairs of overlapping p

707
00:45:36.821 --> 00:45:37.271
orbitals.

708
00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:42.040
So it's the same energy as ethylene would be cause it's the same interaction.

709
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

710
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.360
<v 0>Okay.
Now can you make that pub Cyclo deck of Pantene?</v>

711
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.510
I'm going to quit with this one.
Okay.
And in fact,

712
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:55.830
it was made by Hyde street or wrote who was a postdoc here later,

713
00:45:55.831 --> 00:45:59.940
but he did this in Germany with the module Fogel.
So they,
if you,

714
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.470
you can't make a ring that's that big without heavy,
enormous carbon,

715
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:06.630
carbon carbon angles and have it be flat.

716
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.700
But you could bend it in like this except for the fact that those two hydrogens

717
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:13.920
touch one another,
that's not good.

718
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.040
So one thing you could do is just make that a bond.

719
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.680
And we've already talked about that.
That's naphthalene.

720
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.050
That was the previous slide,
right?

721
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:27.350
But another way is to put a bridge across like as like ch two from this carbon

722
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:31.140
and this carbon so that those two atoms don't run into one another.

723
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.160
That will distort the periphery a little bit.
But it's,

724
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:38.010
we'll leave all the p orbitals around the edge.

725
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:42.750
So the way they made it was the first ad die chloro carby into a double bond in

726
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:43.800
the middle,
right.

727
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.100
Then remove the chlorine and now this thing could open that central bond to give

728
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:54.410
this and it does that.
Right?

729
00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:56.310
And here's a picture of what it looks like.

730
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.720
So here's the ch two bridge across the middle,
but all around the periphery,

731
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.620
you have 10 atoms with P orbitals,
right?

732
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.240
And there's one of the orbitals,

733
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:10.380
and you'll see that's the one that has two nodes here and here.
So you have four,

734
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:14.460
five p orbitals here at five p orbitals here.
All right,

735
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:18.240
so now there's another criterion for aromatic city,

736
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:23.250
which is the chemical shift in Proton magnetic resonance.
And we'll see that,
uh,

737
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.380
uh,
next week.
Uh,
okay,

738
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:32.380
so that's,
uh,
there's actually a little more here.
I was hoping I'd get it,

739
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:36.520
but there's going to be like five minutes in the next lecture that will also be

740
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.640
on this exam,
but the next stuff will not be on the exam.

741
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.400
We're meeting this evening.
I haven't checked what the room is,

742
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.070
but I'll email you.
Okay,
thanks.
