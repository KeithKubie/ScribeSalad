00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.050
If we waned to emphasize long term trends in our data,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.790
rather than year to year variability we might plot a loess curve

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.910
over our data points. Loess is a form of weighted regression.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.990
We won't go into it too much in this course, but you

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.030
can see here that it captures the overall trends in our

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.630
Red Sox data rather than the year to year effects. So we

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.370
see that the themes were getting better up until the 80s,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.530
got a bit worse in the 90s, and have continued to improve

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.440
in the 2000s. Adding this line makes it easier to take a quick

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.549
look at our chart and come away with an understanding of the big

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.600
picture. Where as if we just had the points or have the lines

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.240
connecting each point, it requires a little more heavy lifting by the viewer.
