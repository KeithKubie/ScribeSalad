00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first answer can't be true because the units of measurement are wrong.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This would be tons divided by tons which would leave us with a measurement unit of 1

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and years per ton won't work either--we had to have tons per year,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the rate of change of a number of tons, so this doesn't work.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This expression would not more the growth but the decay of fish minus the constant

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
times the number of fish and this would be something like immigration not harvesting.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Some constant is being edit to the rate of change.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have an immigration of 4 times 10⁵ tons per year, so these two can't be the answer,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we are left with the third one--0.5 per year times the number of fish.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The positive growth rate as is appropriate for exponential growth

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then there is a loss with a minus sign, which models harvesting.
