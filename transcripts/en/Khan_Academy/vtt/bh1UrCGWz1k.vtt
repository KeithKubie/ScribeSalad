00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:03.245
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we have an infinite series S

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:06.312
so that's the sum from n = 1

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:09.356
to infinity of a sub n.

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:13.011
We could write it out a sub 1 plus a sub 2

00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:16.303
and we're just going to go on
and on and on for infinity.

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:19.179
We're going to go on
and on and on forever.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.629
So, let's say, and I've written
it in very general terms

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.740
let's say we have a formula
for the partial sums of S.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.604
We know that S sub n is equal

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:32.411
to 2n to the third

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:35.609
over n plus 1

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.290
times n plus 2.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.617
Now, my question to you is,
based on what I've just told you

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.711
S is the sum in a very general way written

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.364
this infinite series but
I have the partial sum.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:49.807
The sum of the first n terms of S is given

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:52.667
by this formula right over here does

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.002
this series converge or diverge?

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.942
Does this thing converge
to some finite value

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:02.780
or is it unbounded and does it diverge?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.546
Well, one way to think about this is

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:11.374
the idea that our infinite series S

00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:15.015
is just the limit as n approaches

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.413
infinity of our partial sums.

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:19.742
So, what do we mean by that?

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:22.977
Well, you could a sequence
of partial sums here.

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:27.644
You have S sub 1, S sub 2, S sub 3

00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:28.667
and you keep going so this

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.408
would be the sum of the first term.

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:31.981
This would be the sum
of the first 2 terms.

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.040
This would be the sum of the first 3 terms

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.396
and just think about what
happens to this sequence

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:40.635
as n right over here

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.340
approaches infinity

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.812
because that's what this series is.

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:47.107
It's the sum of the first, I guess

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.575
you could say the first, infinite terms.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:51.574
It's the sum of all, you have

00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:54.461
an infinite number of terms here.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:56.067
Well, let's think about what this.

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:59.910
The limit is n approaches
infinity of S sub n.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.109
That's just going to be

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.244
the limit as n approaches

00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:10.206
infinity of this business right over here.

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:15.206
2n to the third power over n plus 1

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.735
times n plus 2 and there's

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.777
several ways you could evaluate this.

00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:23.942
One way is you could just realize,

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.470
"Hey, look in the bottom this is going

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.108
"to be a second degree polynomial."

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:30.637
On up here, you have a third degree

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:32.338
so the numerator is gonna grow faster

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:34.933
than the denominator so this
is going to be unbounded.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.311
So that will immediately tell you

00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:38.135
well this is gonna approach infinity

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:41.513
so S is going to

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:44.029
diverge

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.864
but if you wanna do it a little bit

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.539
less hand wavy than that we can

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.004
actually do a little bit more algebra.

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:54.737
Limit as n approaches infinity, 2n

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.484
to the third power

00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:58.797
over, let's multiply this out,

00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:02.493
n squared plus 3n

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:04.049
plus 2

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.746
and, let's see, we can
divide the numerator

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.981
and the denominator by n squared.

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.643
So, this is going to be the limit

00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:14.802
as n approaches infinity of, if we divide

00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:17.040
the numerator by n squared, you're going

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.611
to have, actually, let's
divide the numerator

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:23.478
and, well yeah let's
divide it by n squared

00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:25.705
so, if we divide the
numerator by n squared,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.080
we're gonna have 2n and
then the denominator

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.437
divided by n squared you're gonna have

00:03:29.437 --> 00:03:33.208
1 plus 3 over n

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:36.545
plus 2 over n squared.

00:03:37.537 --> 00:03:39.341
Now, when you look at it like this,

00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:41.212
it becomes pretty clear this thing

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:43.239
as n approaches infinity,
this thing is gonna

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.847
towards infinity but this thing down here

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:49.106
the denominator this
is gonna go towards 0.

00:03:49.106 --> 00:03:50.766
This is gonna go towards 0

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.876
so the denominator's gonna go towards 1.

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:56.275
So, this whole thing, is the limit

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:59.705
is gonna go to infinity
and since the limit

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:02.914
of the partial sums goes to infinity

00:04:02.914 --> 00:04:05.252
that mean that this infinite series

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.044
is not going to be a finite value.

00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:09.276
It's just going to diverge.

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:12.700
So, this character right over here

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.177
is going

00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:18.003
to diverge.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.866
In order for it to have converged,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.410
this thing should have come, this limit

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.107
should have been some finite value.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:26.901
So, hopefully, that makes sense.

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.211
All we say is, "Look, infinite series,

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:31.738
"we had a formula for the partial sum

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.033
"of the first n terms
and then we said oh look

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.511
"the series itself, the infinite series,

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:39.335
"you could view it as a limit of,

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.412
"as n approaches infinity,
of the partial sum

00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:43.905
"S sub n and we said hey,
that approach infinity

00:04:43.905 --> 00:04:45.846
"this thing is diverging."
