00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:11.774
[piano music]

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:13.241
We're here in the Imaging Studios

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:16.745
After installing Nam June Paik's "Untitled"

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:21.234
piano work from 1993, and we're celebrating

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:26.524
the moment of completion of a two-year conservation project

00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:29.602
This work is either a conservation nightmare

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:33.338
or a conservation dream that has every problem

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:36.596
it could possibly have for a video sculpture

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:39.021
Some of the elements are either not functioning

00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.896
or wouldn't be functioning soon in the future

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.147
The sculpture consists of an upright piano

00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:48.104
modified with a player piano unit

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:49.927
I looked at the piano and realized

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:52.671
the piano itself is in need of repair

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.755
They recommended a firm that they authorize

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.436
He took one look at it and said

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:00.733
This piano is in terrible shape

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.785
The keys are peeling up, the hammers are coming off

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:05.312
there were parts that are worn out

00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:08.111
We went through a very detailed condition assessment

00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:10.262
some of the hammers and some of the elements

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:13.277
that were wearing away, we did repair and replaced them

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:16.858
15 different television sets melded on top

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:19.887
and on the sides and on the floor next to the piano

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:24.479
We contacted CTL electronics down at Canal Street

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.649
The owner, CT Louie, used to work with Nam June Paik

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.929
He has a good understanding of what Paik would want

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.368
in replacing CRT technologies

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:35.321
One of the things we wanted was

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:39.976
to obtain a complete back up set so we did that

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:44.864
The television sets play four different video feeds

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:48.784
Two of the video feeds come from the security cameras

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:50.895
In addition there's a spotlight

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:55.735
The two other video channels come from laser discs

00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:57.932
which are mounted on the floor

00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:01.230
and these laser disc players are playing videos

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.219
that Nam June Paik made

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.863
One of them is a video of his mentor, John Cage,

00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:10.387
with images of Merce Cunningham,

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:15.571
and the other is an abstract video of piano keys moving

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.231
When we acquired the work,

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:20.616
the two video streams ran on umanick tapes

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:22.559
When it was installed at Moma,

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.051
the artist was here and he authorized

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.630
my grading to laser disc

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.443
We did migrate the laser discs

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:34.196
so we now have them on uncompressed, Quicktime files

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:37.714
In the future, Moma staff is gonna have to make a big decision

00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:43.136
Piano is operated by originally a floppy disc drive

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.140
Five and a half inch floppy disc drive

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.221
We replaced that with an mp3 player

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.552
that's mounted in back of that

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:56.555
Paik signed the work on the last two piano keys

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.556
He actually signed his name and the date

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.630
so that makes it all the more special

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.292
The installation took place yesterday

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:08.455
Fortunately, we have really good documentation

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.025
Many photographs of the work from its prior installations

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:16.799
detailed step by step instructions on how to install the work

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.468
and I'm sure Nam June Paik would be laughing at us

00:03:19.468 --> 00:03:21.617
because when he originally installed it,

00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:24.903
it was just haphazard, the wires were hanging

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.652
on the sides, but we wanted to get them right

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:30.641
Because he was a performing artist,

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.947
because he was a fluxus artist, he incorporated chance

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.902
What we do now isn't what he would do

00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:39.269
if he were alive, and yet we're challenged

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.773
We're trying to make decisions that would somehow

00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:44.774
be in keeping with his intentions

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.322
I was worried that we wouldn't be able to show it in the future

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:51.767
since it's dependent on these technologies that go obsolescent over time

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:56.267
And just seeing it altogether after these two years

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:58.518
of work is really exciting for me

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:01.478
It's just gratifying to see it and to hear it

00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:04.359
and to be able to celebrate this moment

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:13.403
