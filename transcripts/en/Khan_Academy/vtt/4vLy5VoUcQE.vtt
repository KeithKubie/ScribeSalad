00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] You are
likely already familiar

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.040
with finding the area between curves.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.930
And, in fact, if you're not,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.070
I encourage you to review
that on Khan Academy.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.500
For example, we could
find this yellow area

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.130
using a definite integral.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.300
But what we're going to do in this video

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390
is do something even more interesting.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.750
We're gonna find the volume of shapes

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.260
where the base is defined in some way

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410
by the area between two curves.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.610
And, in this video, we're
gonna think about a shape,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.950
and I'm gonna draw it in three dimensions.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.790
So let me draw this over again,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.700
but with a little bit of perspective.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.860
So,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.633
let's make this the y-axis.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.540
So that's the y-axis.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.620
This is my x-axis.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.670
That is my x-axis.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.120
This is the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.800
line y is equal to six

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.980
right over there.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.020
Y is equal to six.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.850
This dotted line, we could
just draw it like this,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.750
and so this would be
the point x equals two.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.000
And then the graph of y is equal to four

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.010
times the natural log of three minus x

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.380
would look something like this,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.610
look something like this.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.940
And so this region is this region,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.830
but it's going to be the base

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.900
of a three-dimensional shape
where any cross section,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.010
if I were to take a cross
section right over here,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.490
is going to be a square.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.670
So whatever this length is,
we also go that much high,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.470
and so the cross section is
a square right over there.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.870
The cross section right over
here is going to be a square.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.700
Whatever the difference
between these two functions is,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.100
that's also how high we are going to go.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.720
This length, which is six at this point,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.670
this is also going to be the height.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.880
It is going to be a square.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.270
It's going to be quite big,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.970
might have to scroll down so
we can draw the whole thing,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.810
roughly at the right proportion.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.210
So it looks something like this.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.920
This should be a square.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.220
It's gonna look something like this.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.130
And so the whole shape would look,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.260
would look something

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.300
like this,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.060
would look something like that,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.430
try to shade that in a
little bit so that you can

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700
appreciate it a little bit more,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.310
but hopefully you get the idea.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.670
And some of you might be excited,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.110
and some of you might
be a little intimidated.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, hey, I've been dealing

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.350
with the two dimensions for so long.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.350
What's going on with
these three dimensions?

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.070
But you'll quickly appreciate
that you already have

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.240
the powers of integration to solve this.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.100
And to do that, we just
have to break up the shape

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.190
into a bunch of these, you
could view them as these little

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.770
square tiles that have some depth to them.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.720
So let's make that into a
little tile, this one into it,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.380
that also has some depth to it.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.390
You could even, I could
draw it multiple places.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.223
You could view it as a,

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:41.410
break it up into these things
that have a very small depth,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.310
that we could call dx.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.390
And we know how to figure
out what their volume is.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.630
What would be the volume
of one of these things?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.480
Well, it would be the
depth times the area,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.810
times the surface area

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.150
of this cross section right over here.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.580
Let me do that in a different color.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.270
So what would be the area

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.300
that I am shading in in
pink right over here?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.640
Well, that area is going to
be the base length squared.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.780
What's the base length?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.900
Well, it's the difference
between these two functions.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.560
It is going to be six minus,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.200
our bottom function is four

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.220
times the natural log of three minus x,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.540
and so that would just
give us that length.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.500
But if we square it, we
get this entire area.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.730
We get that entire area, you square it.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.760
And then you multiply it times the depth.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280
You multiply it times the depth.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.780
Now you have the volume
of just this little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.150
section right over here,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.610
and I think you might
see where this is going.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.930
Now, what if you were
to add up all of these

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.810
from x equals zero to x equals two?

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.150
Well, then you would have the
volume of the entire thing.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.450
This is the power of
the definite integral.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.380
So we could just integrate

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.560
from x equals zero to x equals two,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.310
from x equals zero to x equals two.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.900
If you drew where these
intersect our base,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.770
you would say all right,
this thing right over here

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.940
would be this thing

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.750
right over here, where it's dx.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.540
And instead of just multiplying dx

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.420
times the difference
between these functions,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.440
we're going to square the
difference of these functions

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.130
'cause we're visualizing
this three-dimensional shape,

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.830
the surface area of this
three-dimensional shape,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.060
as opposed to just the height
of this little rectangle.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.020
And if you were to evaluate this integral,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.840
you would indeed get the volume of this,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.130
this kind of pedestal horn-looking thing.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.210
This is not an easy definite
integral to evaluate by hand,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.700
but we can actually use
a calculator for that.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.850
And so,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.020
we can

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.480
hit math

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.670
and then hit choice number
nine for definite integral,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.070
and then we just have to input everything.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.940
We're going from zero till

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.120
two of,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.580
and then we have, let me open parentheses

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.710
'cause I'm gonna have
to square everything.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.860
Six minus four times the natural log

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.570
of x,

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.650
or actually the natural
log of three minus x.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.020
And so let me close the parentheses
on the natural log part.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.810
And then, if I close the
parentheses on this whole thing,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.620
I want to then square it.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.770
And then I'm integrating
with respect to x.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.410
Enter, I got approximately 26.27.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.580
So approximately 26.27,
and this is a volume here.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.850
So if we thought about units,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.743
it would be in our units
cubed or cubic units.
