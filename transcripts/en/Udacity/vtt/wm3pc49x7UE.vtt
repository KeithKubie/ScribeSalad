00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.250
&gt;&gt; That's a good story David. Now let's consider a different set of issues.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.770
Imagine that I told you a story. Bob went to a restaurant and sat down. But

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.265
nobody came to serve him for quite awhile. Eventually, when someone did appear,

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:21.130
he ordered a hamburger. The hamburger took a long time before it came.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.160
And when it did come, it was burned. Bob was not very happy.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.710
He didn't even finish the hamburger. Do you think Bob left a large tip?

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.200
Well, I expect most of you would say no. He did not leave a large tip.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.040
If we had to wait for a long time. And if the food that came eve,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320
eventually, was not of very high quality. You'd probably not even ask tip. But

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.415
how did you come to that answer? Why did you expect,

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.204
that in this particular case, Bob will not leave a large tip? Again,

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:50.158
this connects to your notion of a story. It connects to your notion of a story,

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:54.210
of what happens in a restaurant. Why do people leave tips? When do they

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.970
leave them? To put it another way, stories help you make sense of the world.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.180
They help you [INAUDIBLE] expectations, even before [UNKNOWN]. They allow

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.520
us to make connections between evens that otherwise might appear disparate. So

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.105
in this lesson, we'll look at another structured knowledge representation called

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:16.660
scripts. For representing stories or the kind that we are talking about.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.820
And we will see how this knowledge for presentation allows us to make sense of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.590
the world. And answer the kinds of questions that we are talking about.
