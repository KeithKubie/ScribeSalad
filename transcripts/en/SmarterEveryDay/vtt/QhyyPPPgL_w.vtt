00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I did a video and I

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.060
put Mr John the butterly farmer in it and you had a bunch of questions about butterfly farming, so we're doing a video

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.090
about butterfly farming, is that OK with you?
- That's good with me.
- So, I'm gonna tell you what this

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.120
paper is at the end of the video but this is pretty important for my family, but for now,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.150
let's go learn about how butterflies are made.. Or how they.. yeah.
- Are farmed.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.200
- Yeah. Let's do that.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.230
OK. First step in the lifecycle of a butterfly is...

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
- Butterfly eggs.
- Alright. Where do we go?
- Let's go see if we can find

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.280
some in our flight house.
- Alright John so you have a huge butterfly house here.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.310
How do you know where the caterpillars are gonna be?
- I bring in a certain host plant.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.320
I know that the Spicebush Swallowtail will only lay eggs on a few plants, and one of them

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.330
is the sassafras tree.
- So they have favourite plants?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.360
- Yep, called their host plant.
- But look at, I mean all these plants right here

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.390
have flowers and stuff.
- They will not lay an egg on anything but this.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.400
- Man that's amazing! So you put one little sapling in here, and you get

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
everything you need?
- Yep. And when this one has what I want on it, I just take this pot out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460
and I bring another one in.
- Oh wait. What's happenening here?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.500
- She's about to lay an egg.
- No way. So she's laying an egg on the bottom side?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.540
- Yep.
- So can we see that egg that she just laid?
- That and probably several others.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.590
- So she just laid that egg.
- She laid one of these

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.620
two right here.
- Thats.. And I caught it on film.
- Here she comes again.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.680
- No way. Come on girl.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
- Notice she comes up to the plant downwind.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.750
- Bam. I got it that time. She did not lay.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.760
Is it normal? I just don't know what I'm looking

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
[chortle] messed that up.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.830
- I should probably listen to the butterfly farmer. OK and I assume at this point they hatch right?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.850
- Yes that's right. Next step they'll be hatching. In fact let's go over next door.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.880
- Man those are little.
- These guys are actually.. this is not

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.920
their smallest. They're probably already in their second instar.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.940
- Second what?
- Instar.
- Insteer?
- Or basically step.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.950
The process between them moulting. Most lepidoptera moult between 4 and 5 times.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.990
- Turn around. I think there's a caterpillar on your butt. [laughs]

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.040
- Wait there is.
- You said the word you.. we can't say.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.090
- Oh the B-word? I'm sorry.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.120
Go catch more butterflies. I'm sorry I won't say that again.
- So yeah this is sassafras tree

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.150
with the sleeve on it, and then the caterpillar..
- Oh man.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.180
So he looks like he's got a huge head but he doesn't does he.
- Right, yeah his actual

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.210
head is right down there on the very end.
- Is he supposed to look like a snake?
- Yeah exactly.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.220
Which no bird likes. His first 6 legs there are actually his permanent legs

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.270
which are his only true legs.
- So what you're saying is those legs will make it through metamorphosis?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.290
- Right. As an insect he only really has 6 legs.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
So lets also see if we can catch a caterpillar as it switch into its pupa.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.390
- What do you mean, switching to its pupa?
- The caterpillar will actually

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.410
split its skin, the same way it does a moult, and actually come out of the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.460
caterpillar as a pupa.
- Really? It doesn't build one?
- No. That's actually

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.480
a common misconception.
- Are you telling me a caterpillar just sits in one spot and turns into a pupa?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.510
- I can tell you whatever you want?
- Show.. show me!
[ laugh]

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.570
- If you look down there should be a silk.. basically a tether line that he has just running

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.580
right across his back.
- Oh I see it.
- Their silk is quite a bit like spider silk.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.610
It's extremely strong for its size.
- Hey what am I seeing? There's something moving inside the skin.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.630
- You know I think you're actually about to get to watch him split...

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.650
split and turn into a pupa.
- What?

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.680
- Mm-hm, this should be good. The caterpillar skin is splitting,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.700
and the pupa is actually going to wriggle right out of the caterpillar skin.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.710
- I cannot believe we're catching this.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.720
[music]

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.850
So the only thing holding him to the net is that one little silk thread that you showed me earlier.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.870
- Yep, that one little security line.
- What happens if it breaks?
- It doesn't.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.890
[laugh]
- So he's done with his skin right?
- Yep.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.960
He actually.. he jumped off, reattached and now he's gonna wriggle around until that skin drops

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.990
down below him. You see there he just ejected.. he got loose and now he's gonna

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.040
wiggle around a little bit more and then he's gonna calm down. If you tried to pull on the pupa it would cut right

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.070
through him instead of breaking.
- The silk thread would cut the pupa?
- Yep. The pupa would

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.110
break before the thread would. Down here he's just shed, that's the caterpillar skin.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.190
- This is totally backwards from what I thought. I thought that...

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.230
I thought that the caterpillar made this pupa and then crawled inside

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.230
and then turned into a butterfly but you're telling me he just sits there and grunts and turns

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.250
into a pupa.
- That's right. After he's finished there, he's gonna start hardening.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.290
He will lighten up to a nice light whitish background because he's on a white background.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.300
So he'll end up with a colour similar to this guy right here.
- So you're saying

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.340
that they change colours based on where the pupa..
- Based on the background

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.380
of where the pupa spins its cocoon.
 - So that means, think about that. That means that

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.400
this, when he was a caterpillar he had to look at the colour

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.450
he was on and remember it and then somehow

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.470
I don't know how...
- I don't think anybody does.
- Somehow he figures out what colour he needs to be.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.490
- Like a chameleon, he matches the best he can to that background colour.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.520
- So can you show us some different coloured ones?
- Absolutely. Usually get anywhere from

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.540
about 40-60 out of a sleeve, and

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.570
most of these guys here will actually be going to the bronx zoo.
- Really?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.580
From Alabama to the Bronx Zoo.
- Pretty neat.
- That's pretty cool.
- And of course I always keep a few,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
that I save out for my own breeding stock.
- So do you get to see them come out, like the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.630
emergence out of the cocoon, or the pupa, excuse me.
- Yep, sure do. And in fact

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.650
why don't you take a few of these and we'll see if you can catch them on camera, coming out of the cocoon and drying their wings?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.680
- Oh, I bet its, it feels like a trick. Is it hard to do?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.720
- Oh no you'll be alright.
- Thank you.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.740
(wife) ... wings, so I turned this upright so he could crawl. So he crawled from the bottom to to top.
- Just now. I've been

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.760
waiting for weeks for this to happen. Alright so this is one of the most amazing

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.800
parts of the process. This butterfly which is a totally different looking creature than

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.830
what went into this pupa just came out of it, and what I think is cool is that those

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.850
wings were folded up in such an efficient way that they were crammed into this thing.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.890
That's amazing. So when he comes out, those wings are obviously

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.920
kind of new, so they're wet and floppy. So they have no real structural

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.940
integrity so he can't use them, so he's pretty vulnerable for the first little bit. He comes

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.960
up to the top here and he dangles his wings down. He's got fluid in his abdomen

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.980
and he starts pumping it into those veins on his wings so he can inflate it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.980
It's actually called inflation.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.040
Oh.. you see it? That's excess fluid that the had in his body that he

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.070
was getting rid of because he's already inflated his wings. I can't believe

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.100
I just caught that. I just induced it really. Anyway, he just ejected that meconium because

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.120
it was no longer needed for his wings because they're already inflated. So it looks like he's got

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.130
one more fold in his wing that he's trying to straighten out. He's almost there but not quite.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.140
Where you going buddy? Oh! He just flew!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.170
That was the first moment that guy flew, so his wings were ready.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.190
OK so it turned out that butterfly emergence was a little too difficult for me, so I'm bringing it back to John.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.230
John's gonna borrow the camera for a week or so and he's gonna see if he can catch it for you.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.280
You gonna catch butterfly emergence?
- We're gonna try.
- Alright. Next thing you're gonna see is John with a camera.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.310
My timing was off.
- Alright we'll see what we can do. These are the guys that I think

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.350
are gonna be hatching over the next day or two. And down here I have my

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.370
trusty old carrying case and I'll actually be hanging the pupa from up on the roof there.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.380
Now if everything goes well, the next thing you should be watching

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.420
is a butterfly as it hatches from its chrysalis.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.470
[music]

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.880
Oh no! [laugh] A little bit in a hurry there.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.910
- Little bit higher? 123.. go!

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.940
How's that?
- Good.
- OK, so I mentioned earlier in the show

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.970
I was going to show you what's in this envelope. I was hand delivered this at work and it's called

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.990
a notice of decision to furlough, which means

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.020
basically I no longer get paid on Fridays. This is a pretty big

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.060
deal as a dad of 3, so there's a way you can help me out of this situation. I'm very

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.090
thankful that audible.com has decided to use

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:24.140

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.190
They're audio books, you can listen to tons of different types, but I'm gonna let her

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.220
tell you what her favourite is.
- Hello this is my favourite book. It's called

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.240
The Dawn Treader. I like it very much because they go on

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.280
adventures and like.. they are actually in a picture frame

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.330
and they go to the end of the world.
- Going where?
- To the end of the world.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.370
They don't have a...
- Tell them who wrote it.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.380
- By umm.. C.S.Lewis.
- And tell em who's in it that I like.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.400
- Reepicheep. I'll see if I can find a picture.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.430
- Who's that?
- Reepicheep. If you look

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.460
on some of his videos you can see a little Reepicheep right here.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.480
- OK. You wanna swap back?
- Yes, swap!
- I used audible

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.520
before they used me to advertise. Clearly now's a good time for me.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.570
You're smart people, you know what's up here. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.580
audible.com/smarter, free trial, it helps me out.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.610
Have a good one.
Who planted these flowers?
- I did.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.620
- Yeah?
- One of my favourites is right here.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.630
- What colour is it? This little pink one? That's your favourite huh?

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.650
- ahuh. Let me show you one that's not from the rules.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.690
- I didn't know flowers had rules.
- It's not attached.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.710
- Oh, so the base of the bloom

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.760
That's strange, why would it do that.
- Your favourite place you ever gone

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.770
- Umm.. I like Peru a lot.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.800
- Maybe... Are you filming that?
- Maybe.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.810
- Aww.
