00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey guys welcome back i'm Nate with "The King of Random" and today

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.200
We're going to try to make a spooky Halloween treat,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.080
in previous videos grant made a silicone mould of a pig's heart and then cast a chocolate heart in it for valentine's day

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.820
Now halloween is coming up and I wanted to try to give this coronary confection a haunted twist

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.010
This will be a two-for-one project something that can be used as both a decoration and a dessert as I said

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.369
There's a twist i'm planning to put on this. I don't just want to make a normal gummy heart

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.629
I think that's a little bit too simple so to kick it up to the next level what I'm going to try and do is

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.540
Make a beating pumping gummy heart (Bump) (Bump)(Bump)(Bump)(Bump)(Bump)

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.200
The first step is to get the mixture cooking the heart mold is pretty big

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.180
So let's mix up a giant batch of our gummy syrup. Let's use strawberry for the color

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.720
I'll start with three cups of cold water and add one and a half cups of corn syrup

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.760
Once the corn syrup is all smoothly mixed into the water. It's time to add 12 packets of gelatine and three large boxes of jell-o

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.560
Remember that you need to get all of the gelatin clumps out before you start adding heat

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.970
Now that it's all makes let's put it on the stove at medium low temperature

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.629
You don't have to mix everything constantly, but make sure you give it a good stir every minute or so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.349
Well that's heating up, let's make a simple pump that will allow our heart to beat once. It's all finished to make this pump

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.470
I'm just using a couple of balloons and a length of vinyl tubing the basic strategy is I'm going to have a balloon over either

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.059
end of the tube with a little bit of pressure in it that way when I squeeze on one side it will expand on the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
other side

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340
Do that for too long you're going to get lightheaded

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.009
Just to be sure that this balloon won't pop off from the pressure. Let's secure it with a little bit of electrical tape I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.020
want to be sure that the balloon won't deform or shrink while it's in the warm

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.029
gummy mixture so what I'm going to do is fill the balloon and the tube with a little bit of water I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.449
Want the balloon on the other end to be full of water, too

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.450
So I'm going to try and fill it up a little ways

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.279
Pinch off the neck and then stretch it over the end of the tube. Hopefully I can do that without spilling water everywhere

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.000
No promises. I'm using a water bottle for this because my sink faucet is not very well shaped for filling balloons with water

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.949
Air out that's good right there pinch that off I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720
Think I got it!

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.119
Let's dry this off, and then we'll use some more electrical tape to secure this one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250
It's gonna look so cool

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.269
Beating dummy heart thump. Dub dub dub dub dub

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.389
Looking agreed our gummy mixture is complete

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.949
So let's take it off the heat and let it cool down for a few minutes before pouring it into our mold our mixture has

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.000
Cooled down a little bit now

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.389
I'm gonna try using the spatula to pull some of the foam off of the top of it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.390
So we have a nice clear casting of our heart

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000
The spatulas not working great, I found this in the kitchen

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.720
I'm not even entirely sure what you're supposed to use this work, but I bet it's going to work pretty. Well. Oh

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720
Perfect all in one go

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.530
Okay time to pour our gummy syrup, and hope that the mold holds it all in nicely here we go

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.519
I'm gonna stop. Just a little bit before it fills all the way to put one end of the balloon pump into it a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.280
Little extra syrup flowing out that should be fine there, okay. I think this placement looks good

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.559
I'm just gonna use some tape to hold our tube in place

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.410
Now just fill the extra space and since the gummy syrup does tend to shrink a little bit as it cools

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.410
I'll try and add a little extra

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.080
Our gummy heart is cast now

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.820
I'm just gonna pop it in the refrigerator and let it cool there for a few hours to let our gummy heart completely solidified

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.180
All right our gummy heart and the mold have been in the refrigerator for several hours now, and it is completely cooled so now

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.699
It's time to carefully remove our gummy heart from the silicone

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.760
See how this piece is

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.560
Mm. Stuck to the wood just how it should be I don't know

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.839
That's a lot like a fruit roll-up cuz it's so thin

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.929
Bab kind of fixed to my teeth will slide the box off carefully fit it over the hose

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.309
That's coming off nicely I'm excited about this

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.599
Good you can see a gummy heart in there already

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.469
Gummy candy is actually fairly tough

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.900
So I'm not super worried about it

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.449
But I am of course trying to make sure that I don't tear it while I'm removing unmold all this is a huge heart

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.619
Holy cow I also want to make sure I don't tear the balloon that would cause problems

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.070
Good look good

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320
Yeah, oh

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.740
Look at that that is a giant

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.669
strawberry flavored gummy heart right there

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.779
Look at the details. You've got the veins running through the heart

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.380
You've got the I assume one of these is the aorta up here. Oh that looks so cool

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.869
Okay, and now we got to do the test. We got to test our pump to see if we can get our heart to beat

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.060
It's moving a little bit

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.950
It doesn't expand a ton

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.719
But there you go if you look over there kind of near where the balloon is you get some good

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Pumping action all that looks so good

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.410
Let's see I'm gonna try putting it down on the counter. I bet that makes the whole thing

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.719
Yep, it just comes alive there you go beating heart right there. Oh?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.300
It's awesome

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.159
Pretty fantastic. It's a great color. You can see a little bit of light through it

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.260
There's tons of detail and the pumping does work

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.450
You can make it sort of just beat in your hand a little bit

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.909
But I'm gonna try and make a quick little display to put the heart on that hides the tube a little bit as well

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.980
For our display. I'm just gonna use a black paper plate and cup to make a stand for our heart

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.799
I don't want the display stands to be quite this tall so first

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.760
I'm gonna cut the cup in half that edge is a little rough. I'm gonna clean it up with scissors

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.929
That's better all right so a plate will go on there. That's a good height

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.350
That'll look good. This is gonna work pretty well so far, but I want to hide the hose a little bit

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.640
So I'm going to cut a hole in the bottom of the plate and in the side of the cup so the hose can come

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640
Out the back and not be as invisible

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.520
Okay good

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.949
I'm not sure if we even need to cut a hole in the cup or not maybe just a little bit of a notch

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.970
There we go

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.790
Your heart on the stand, and it just moves on its own now

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.670
Let's just secure the plate to the cup with a little bit of electrical tape

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.609
There we have it guys a giant red gummy heart that can actually beat with a pump

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.860
This is the weirdest grossest candy. I think I've ever made, but it works pretty well

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.220
I'm pretty excited about that and it's just it looks like a giant heart

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.910
I'm so excited to use this for Halloween decoration and treat and

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.190
I think the only thing left to do is to see how it is so I'm gonna just take a big bite

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.410
out of this giant pumping heart

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200
Mmm

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.980
Tastes like I

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.969
Don't think it tastes anything like heart tastes like gummy, which is pretty good

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.500
There you have it guys

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:18.160
That's how to make a candy gummy heart that can double as both a Halloween decoration and a Halloween treat and as an added bonus

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.199
We made it so it can beat in your hand

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.040
Thanks so much for joining us for this video, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.369
Just what Leonardo DiCaprio did in the revenant?

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.760
It was like a liver i'm basically leonardo dicaprio

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.009
Well now it's time for open-heart surgery, I'm gonna cut a big slice out of this

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.320
Giant heart sliced in half

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.150
We have a leaky heart valve, it's spray

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.930
Oh, I should have filled this with red water. That would have been great

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.819
So much gummy in my mouth at the same time. Oh my god good
