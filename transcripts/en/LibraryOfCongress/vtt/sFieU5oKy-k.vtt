00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.220
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: I was --

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.270
Bridget Koontz, that was the
very first hearing on our case.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.210
You know, we got married on a
Thursday, and by virtue of friends,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.930
connecting us with a friend

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.330
of theirs who's a civil
rights attorney.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.320
We met that attorney on
Tuesday; we filed suit on Friday.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.550
So we filed suit eight
days after we got married.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.460
And on Monday, 11 days
after we got married,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.220
I was in Federal District Court,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.570
and that was when Bridget
Koontz was defending the state

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.870
against our lawsuit.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.060
And I remember in that
courtroom thinking,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.220
"Her heart doesn't
quite seem in it."

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.800
[Laughter] And I honestly
thought, "So I wonder,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.190
was she the last person in
the office this morning?"

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.580
[Laughter] And the decision was,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.610
"Last in the office
has to go to court."

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.550
So it was -- for me it was
really fun to learn that I picked

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.690
up on something that she
felt she was conflicted.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.490 position:56%
She was doing her job, and I respect
her for that; and she did her best,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.890
she did her job to fight
for the state of Ohio,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.100
but it was really kind
of nice to learn

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.820
that she was personally
conflicted, and was on our side.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.150
And I have to say the other
great thing that happened

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.990
in that very first
hearing, when we filed suit,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.950
we filed suit against the state of
Ohio and the city of Cincinnati.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.070
And in that very first hearing,
the city solicitor for the city

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.560
of Cincinnati stood up in court and
said -- and I'm paraphrasing this,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.510 position:56%
"Your Honor, the city of
Cincinnati agrees with John and Jim.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.300
Their marriage deserves
to be recognized."

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.620
And for me that was one of the
most powerful experiences I had had

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.960
because, you know, for years,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.540
Cincinnati was considered the most
gay unfriendly city in the country,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.690 position:56%
and to have the city stand up in
court and say, "We're on your side,"

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.740
that was an amazing thing.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.620
So I was in court for that.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.720
When Al started a second lawsuit

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.350
about birth certificates,
I was in their hearing.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.640
I was in every single court
hearing that I could attend.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.000
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: And do you feel
that support and that conviction,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.130
and at what point did you
stop feeling that conviction

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.310
from other attorneys or the judges
behind the bench was like, "Oh,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.060
this is not as welcoming
as we first felt."

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.000
Is there a point you remember
specifically about that?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.130
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Well, that
was certainly when we ended

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.380
up at the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.260 position:56%
So we won in Federal District Court,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.080
and the judge issued a temporary
restraining order, which said Ohio,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.150 position:56%
when John dies, you have to fill
out his death certificate correctly.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.450
You have to recognize
their marriage."

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.930
And it was a temporary order,
so the state could not appeal.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.170
John died three months later, and
his death certificate was accurate.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.110
Two months after that, the
judge made that order permanent,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.070
and at that point,
the state appealed.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.230
Now, at that point, the Sixth
Circuit consolidated our case,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.840
along with the birth certificate
case our attorney Al was leading,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.210
as well as four cases from
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Michigan.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.460
So there were six cases total, and
we went to the Sixth Circuit Court

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.060
of Appeals, which right from
the start, Al our attorney said,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.590
"I'm just forewarning you this is
considered the most conservative

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.620
appeals court in the country."

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.240
So we went into that
feeling a little uncertain,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.960
and they ruled against.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.660
And it was a two-to-one --
it was a three-judge panel,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.250
and it was a two-to-one
ruling against us.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.280
So that was the moment
when I thought, "Hmm, okay,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.370
this isn't going as
well as I'd hoped."

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.140
But it was also the moment when
I could have, you know, decided,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.440
"I need to take a step back.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.270
I want to go back to my life.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.630
John's been gone for about a
month now -- for about a year now,

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.540
and I just want to go
back to being quiet Jim,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.650
not being in the midst
of everything."

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.310
But I realized I couldn't do it.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.920
I still hadn't lived up
to my promises to John.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.990
So that was the low point for
me, but it was also the point

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.250
when suddenly, there
was the silver lining.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.330
The First Appeals Court ruled

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.640
against marriage equality;
we now had a split.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.800
So the hope was, "Maybe now the
Supreme Court will take it."

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.140
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: One of the most
compelling characters, I think,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.460
in the book is Judge
Daughtrey, who was a female judge

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.880
on the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeal, Martha Daughtrey,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.560
who was the one judge who
supported marriage equality

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.780
of the three-judge panel.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.180
She was on the side
of marriage equality.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.180
And there's a great
scene in the book

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.570
of Judge Daughtrey
describing how she tried

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.680
to convince these two more
conservative judges right

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.440
after oral arguments in
the Sixth Circuit to rule

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.940
on the side of marriage equality.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.520
She said something like -- to
Judge Jeff Sutton, "But Jeff,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.460
these two men were in love."

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.570
And unfortunately, she lost vote.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.640
And her opinion was, of course,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.220
right around the world it
was a scathing opinion.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.500
But in the book, she compares
this fight for marriage equality

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.010
to the fight to gain the right --
you know, to vote, women's rights,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.990
and in fact has a first-edition
copy of Susan B. Anthony's book

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.570
on the history of women's
suffrage in her office.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.380
So we were very lucky
to get her to --

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.810
a sitting federal judge
to come talk on the record

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.040
about how she felt about this case.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.340
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: That's great.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.590
Jim, throughout the writing
and working with Debbie,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.190 position:56%
can you talk to the process of that,
and were there intimate moments

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.800
of your life, things that
you felt were private,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.700
or things that were coming out
that were needing to be shared

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.400
in the writing of the book?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.700
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.920
I can say without hesitation
that writing this book,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.120
but also having the opportunity
to be involved in this case

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.740
and to fight for this, and to
speak about it, all of it combined,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.710
it gave me the opportunity
to keep talking about John,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.410 position:56%
and to keep him foremost in my mind.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:23.580
It kept him alive, and it helped
my grieving process in a great way.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:29.450
And Debbie has this incredible way
of pulling details out of my head.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.250
My memory's always been one of
the forest, not of the trees.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.370
So she would ask me questions
and ask for memories,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.640
and it was always the
broader strokes.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.490
It wasn't the details.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.700
And she would keep pushing
me, "So Jim, what color shirt?

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.430
What was the weather like?

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.140
What was happening in Cincinnati?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.440
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper:
"What were you eating?"

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.740
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell:
What were you eating?"

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.040
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: Yes.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.340
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: And she just had
this incredible way of pushing me

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.310
and making me actually dig deeper
and pull out those details,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.030
which I would have forgotten,
and didn't realize were there.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.550
So working on the book was
a really good experience

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.120
because it was healing,
it was therapeutic,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.180
and I got to relive a lot
of really good things.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.310
I shed a lot of tears, but
they were healing tears,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.170
and it was really great.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:23.240
So it was this constant back and
forth of conversations, memories,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.830
writing, how's this, change this,
how's that, change that, love that,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.430
keep that, add this, and it was
just a really good experience.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.600
And for me, the fact
that I did know Debbie,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.580
and it was this phenomenally
successful journalist asking me

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.340
if I wanted to help write a
book about my life about my life

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.580
with John, it was this sense of
comfort that I felt with her,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.040
comfort and safety because
she wasn't a stranger.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.150
So it was a really good experience.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.530
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: I had to take
Jim back about 40-some years,

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.830
but I had to take out [inaudible],
his civil rights lawyer,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.930
who was a main character in the
book back about 60-some years.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.660
So he, you know, described
to me his life growing

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.820
up on a chicken farm
outside of Cleveland in this,

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.120
you know, rural community.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.660
And his father, you
know, tended to thousands

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.970 position:56%
of chickens in this Amish community.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.170
And he got a full ride
to law school at NYU,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.990
and could have gone on anywhere.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.740
His friends went onto big-name law
firms, but he wanted to go back

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.220
to Cincinnati to be a
civil rights lawyer.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.700
And he made, you know, money,
and he bought a house, you know,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.440
with this small inheritance.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.530
And he's still living
in that same house.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.300
So, you know, Al's career
as a civil rights lawyer --

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.060
I've met a lot of lawyers
as a journalist,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.120
and he is truly an inspiring man.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.870
I mean, he's just -- he's
scrappy, and he's always rumpled,

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.020 position:56%
and his tie's all messed up, and
his hair is blowing every which way.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.990
[Laughter] And his office has
green carpet from the 1970s.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.110
[Laughter] And, you know, he's just
-- but he's just a true believer.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.850
And I was really moved by him,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.980
so much so that I've told
my younger son I want him

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.810
to be a civil rights
lawyer when he grows up.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.110
[Laughter]

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.680
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Yes; I mean
I can't say enough good things

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.980
about Al.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.290 position:56%
I really think if any other attorney
had knocked on our door five days

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.770
after our wedding, I'm not
sure we would have done this.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.750
But Al is just -- as Debbie
said, he is this true believer

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.950
about civil rights and
fighting for people.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:27.750 position:56%
And throughout the entire two years,
he never lost sight of the fact

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.740
that there were real
people at the heart of this,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.020
real people with a real story,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.320
real people who were being
harmed, and he fought.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.660
I mean, you'll learn in
the book, he got pushback

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.390
from national organizations saying,
"This is not the right lawsuit.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.860 position:56%
This is not the right time for this.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.360
We don't think you
should be doing this."

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.980
And Al's reply was always --

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.280
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper:
"I have clients."

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.580
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: "I have
clients who are being harmed.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.330
This is absolutely the
right thing to do."

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.440
And he is just this incredibly
intelligent, dedicated, kind man.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.740
And --

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.990
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: He had spent
35 years fighting for the rights

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.610
of women, and children,
and the gay community,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.910
because his younger brother
is gay and had taken on a case

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.520
against a Catholic high school
back in the '80s, and lost.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.480
And then he took on the city of
Cincinnati in the early 1990s,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.600
because the city had passed --
had embedded in its charter a law

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.990
that said you couldn't protect
the gay community with any kind

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.580
of antidiscrimination laws.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.850
And he spent five years personally
trying to take that law down,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.940
without pay; I mean, almost lost
his shirt, almost left the practice

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.290
of law, took the case all the way
to the US Supreme Court and lost.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.570
And so this case was in some
ways redemption, I think, for Al.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.070
And it brought him back to the
Supreme Court a second time.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.530
And as you know, arguing in front

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.160
of the Supreme Court is a
make-or-break, you know,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.490
moment for lawyers in
their legal careers.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:58.030
And Al stepped down and decided
not to be the oralist in this case,

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.360 position:56%
because there was a more experienced
oralist and a brilliant oralist here

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.710
in DC who he felt would
do a better job.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.690
That's how committed Al was.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.300
He actually stepped down and didn't
argue the case because he wanted

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.500
to do right by his clients.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.800
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Wow.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.240
And Debbie, what was
your involvement

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.030
with the LGBT community before
writing, during writing,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.860
and now a year after
the case, book just came

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.320
out two weeks ago, a week ago?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.620
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: Two week, yes.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.920
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Two weeks ago.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.220
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: Yes.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.520
I mean, I was not involved.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.200
I was really an outsider looking
into the politics of gay rights.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.640
I mean, obviously, I knew and
supported marriage equality,

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.920
but I had never really
looked into it.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.040
I mean, you know, I don't write
about those kinds of issues.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.040
But when I heard about this case,
like I think so many other people,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.940
I was so moved by the practical
problems that couples faced.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.980
The fact that John could not get
an accurate death certificate,

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.530
and Jim was not listed

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.770
as the surviving spouse
seemed outrageous to me.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.390
As an outsider looking
in, it seemed punitive.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.410
And beyond that, there
were parents in this case

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.600
who couldn't get accurate birth
certificates for their children.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.610
So here they have done to
the trouble of adopting,

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.630
or having children, you know,
through in vitro and in other ways,

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.740
all they want is to protect
their families; all they want is

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.300
to protect their children.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.490 position:56%
And they fact that they couldn't
get a birth certificate as a parent,

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.790
I just couldn't believe that.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.730
And I think that that was why
this case in some ways spoke

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.070 position:56%
to so many people, because the
lawyers and the plaintiffs were able

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.490
to show that there were
practical technical problems

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.700
that same-sex couples faced.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.720
The rest of us may not
have even known about it.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.200
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: And Jim.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.810
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Well, you know,
from my perspective, Debbie says,

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:59.480 position:56%
you know, "I was an outsider looking
in," and I've noticed a change

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.520
in her in our book events, and
she talks about how, you know,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.160
this case, this writing
this book opened her eyes

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.790
to those very practical daily ways
in which we were being harmed.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.860
And I think one of my favorite
things I've heard you say, Debbie,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.650
is that someone asked you,
you know, "What's next for you

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.170
in your professional career?"

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.190
And I love that you
said, "Well, you know,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.910
I've spent my career mostly
writing about bad people,

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.090
and now that I've written
about this, I think I want

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.090
to keep writing about
more good things.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.030 position:56%
I want -- I'm not so concerned
about writing about bad people now."

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.800
And I thought, "What
a lovely thing --

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.050
lovely effect for this
process to have had on you

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.630
to realize you get a lot more --

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.040
you get more out of that than
you had been getting, perhaps,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.690
out of writing about
bad people," so --

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.540
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper:
Yes; and I think too --

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.890
exactly, but I think this is a book
that's about underdogs, really.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.520 position:56%
It's like a David and Goliath story.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.840
It's about ordinary people who
stepped out of their private lives

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.990
to protect their families, and
the people they care most about.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.490
And then they ultimately
started advocating, you know,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.460
for the larger gay community.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.060
And, you know, I love
those kinds of stories.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.190
You know, I mean, it's geeky.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.040
But as I was writing the book,
like I hear like the "Rocky" theme

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.440
in my head, [laughter] and
he's climbing up the steps.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.710
Because these stories
really are inspiring.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.090
If you read the book, you'll see
these parents and what they did.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.940
Do you know after the state of
Ohio was forced by a federal judge

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.940
to give these parents
accurate birth certificates,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.190
the state was appealing
to the Sixth Circuit,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.200 position:56%
so they gave them birth certificates
with asterisks on the bottom

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.420
that said, you know,
"Pending the outcome

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.880
of the Sixth Circuit,"
or something like that.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.400
Even then, they couldn't get -- all
they want is a birth certificate,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.960
and who does that really affect?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.950
It's just -- they're kids, they're
just trying to protect them.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.440
And so yes, I mean, this
is a story about underdogs,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.780
and I've always been moved
by stories like that.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.080
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Okay.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.380
Okay; because now your audience --

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.570
you've had quite an
exposure to LGBT community.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.990 position:56%
And it's maybe even broader for both

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.400
of you our alphabet
soup of LGBT/QIAA.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:21.830
How do you feel about
that community as a whole?

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.900
What are we doing to address
issues across the board?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.720
What role, Jim, as an activist,
now the face of an entire movement,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.500
how do you feel we're addressing
the community as a whole?

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.730
Are we doing enough?

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.210
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: I think
we can always do more.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.680
You know, I -- for me personally,
over the past two years,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.780
it's been an important thing
for me to make sure I talk

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.620
about our transgender siblings.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.350
And I know there's
more to our community

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.330
that I should be talking about,
or I could be talking about.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.510
But for me over the past couple of
years, you know, marriage equality,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.200
I knew there would be backlash.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.700 position:56%
But the backlash has been so vicious
against our transgendered siblings,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.610
that it's been a point for
me to make to always talk

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.930
about our transgender community.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.570
And I also talk about how, you
know, stories change lives.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.340
And I think this book, it's
nothing but a story of love.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.850
It's John's and my love, it's
the love of the other plaintiffs

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.520
for their spouses, their
partners, their children.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.900
And stories do change
hearts and minds.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.390
And I think about my own experience
within the LGBTQ community.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.690
You know, up until a little
over year ago, I had no friends

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.560
who were part of the
transgender community,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.990
at least none that
I specifically knew.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.650
And over the past 14,
15 months, I've --

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.660
lucky enough now to say that I have
quite a few transgender friends.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.640
And I realize the change that has
made in me, in my understanding,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.900
in my attitudes, my outlook.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.730
And for me that's what this
community is all about,

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.540
it's sharing our stories, and it's
making sure we share the stories

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.410
of everyone who's part
of the community,

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.440
because that's how we change
people's perspectives.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.020
I mean, that happened
to me personally.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.020
I had a friend of mine from 1989,
I've known her that long, she said,

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.960
"You know, Jim, watching you --

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.300
having met John, having seen your
relationship and watching you fight

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.020
for John, fight for your marriage,
and everything you've done,"

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.770
she said, "you have changed my
opinion on marriage equality."

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.500
So stories are what change the
countries; change the world.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.470
And for our community, that's
what we have to keep doing.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.310
We have to tell each
other's stories.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.650
And for me that's been
telling stories

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.930
about my transgender friends,
and how important that is,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.060
and how that affects
change in our country.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.590
So there's a lot of
work to do, absolutely,

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.300
and unfortunately sometimes parts

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.740
of our community fall
through the cracks.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.530
And we have to make sure that
we don't let that happen.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Debbie, anything?

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.790
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: I think
he -- I think Jim answered it.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.110
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter:
I know [inaudible].

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.410
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: Yes.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.710
[Laughter]

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.010
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell:
So in the same vein,

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.650
yesterday marked the
47th anniversary

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.890
since the Stonewall Riots began.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.810
We have one year since the
Obergefell V. Hodges case.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.110
And --

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.630
I'm trying to see what's
for the next --

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.330
what do we do we tell the next
generation of LGBT community?

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:32.060
I know a lot of -- we call
the it the "Pride Parade",

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.980
when historically it
was the Pride March

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.120
because this was a
march outside to riot

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.180
out of city-sanctioned
harassment from police at Stonewall

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.540
with that just becoming
a national monument.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.070
And what's next for
the LGBT community?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.920
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: I
think what you're seeing

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.070
within the community is
more of a concentration,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.390
more of an effort to
preserve our history.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.660
And the fact that Stonewall was
just named a national monument,

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.160
that is a huge part of that.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.820
But it's on all of our shoulders to
make sure the younger generation,

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:13.560 position:56%
the people who come after us, know
what we went through, and understand

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.560
that things weren't always
as good as they are today.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.130
There have been people -- so
many people have come before us.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.880
I mean, I know personally, I
wouldn't be where I am if I weren't

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.750
for my heroes, ED Windsor, Harvey
Milk, Frank Kameny, so many others.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.200 position:56%
And if it weren't for the people who
really put their lives on the line,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.620
and risked everything to fight
for equality and dignity,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.070
I certainly wouldn't be here.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.630
I wouldn't have had the luxury of
finding myself in that position.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.570 position:56%
And that's what we have to make sure
our future generations don't forget,

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.500
is that it might be
great right now for you,

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.750
but remember who came
before what happened before.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.050
And also we have to make sure

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.950
that people understand
we can go backwards.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.960
I mean unfortunately, in so many
ways in our nation's history,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.390
when we have those steps
forward, fortunately,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.730
we often have steps backward.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.840
And we have to make sure that
people understand that and fight

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.470
to keep the progress we've made,
and to keep moving forward instead

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.140
of allowing us to move backwards.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.170 position:56%
So for me, it's all about education.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.270
I mean, I think in so many ways,
that's what it comes down to,

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.880
we have to educate others who
don't know the LGBTQ community,

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.310
and we have to educate those
of us in our community.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.770
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: We have such
an acknowledgement and recognition

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.980
for the LGBTQ community,
what they have been through

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:44.330
and faced throughout so much,
AIDS epidemic, Stonewall,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.980
so much of the current generation,
myself included, that wasn't a part

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.450
of our -- wasn't a part
of my everyday life.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:57.670
And it wasn't until, as Roberta
had spoke on the unfortunate events

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.050
of Orlando, that it was
then again brought back

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.800
to the forefront of we're not done.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.330
We haven't achieved everything.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:11.780
And so that was -- I wanted to hear
your activist perspective on that.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.530
And how about from a journalist
standpoint, what have you seen

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.520
in the media shifts, changes?

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.140
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: Well, I think,
you know, one year ago support

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.500
for marriage equality
was overwhelming.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.400
Public -- all the polls in the CNN

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.280
and in the Washington Post showed
the majority of Americans believed

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.890
in marriage equality and support,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.160
and loved the LGBT
community; and then Orlando.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.310
And it definitely seems like
one step forward, one step back.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.910
And, you know, I think civil
rights movements in general,

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.080
that's kind of often the way it
plays out, whether it's, you know,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.040
civil rights, or women's
rights, that kind of thing.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.120
And I think Orlando was --
unfortunately shows that in --

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.950
there are people in the
public, and perhaps even people

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.260
in public office, who still
don't support the gay community.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.230
It was a hate crime.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.200
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: And I know for
me, Orlando, one of the things

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.830
that I wasn't expecting personally,
you know, it was a reminder,

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.020 position:56%
and it was also a moment when I
felt something I'd never felt before

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.410
in my out gay life.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.360
You know, I've been out since I
was 26, and I can honestly say

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.400
in that time, never once have
I felt unsafe, threatened,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.670
and I've never felt the direct
recipient of discrimination.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.250
Maybe I've been ignorant,
maybe I've been clueless.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.670
I can be fairly clueless
at times, so --

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.450
but that day, I suddenly
felt afraid.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:51.970
And for me, that was I think a
much needed reminder that I can --

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:56.640
I'm fortunate in my life and
I haven't felt afraid before.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.360
And that was a remind that, "You
know what, Jim, there are kids

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.330
out there every day
who are that afraid.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.720
Our transgender family everyday
they're living their lives

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.060
that afraid."

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.630
And for me it was a
necessary reminder

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.680
that no matter how
good my life might be,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.030
it can change in an instant,

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.850
and there's still a lot
of hatred out there.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.280
And that's one of the those
things I think Orlando has served

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.370
as a wakeup call and a reminder
to many of us in the community

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.460
that no matter how
good things might seem,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.970
we still have a lot
-- a long way to go.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.980
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: I think that's
an awesome charge for all of us.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.260
And just want to take some
questions from the audience

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.760
if anybody had been thinking
about something that you would

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.950
like to ask one or both of them.

I'll probably just
give you this mic.

So if you don't mind to come
up, that way we can make sure --

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.730
this is being recorded, so make
sure that we get it captured.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.660

[ Background Talking ]

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.880
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks for being here.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.010
I was curious about sort of the
resistances that you got from some

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.910
of the, I guess, you know,
big groups that said, "Oh no,

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.670
your case is not the
right case," and all that,

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.420
and how you sort just
persisted through that,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.420
kind of what persistence you
got, your reaction to that, so --

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.880
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Well, I can say

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.090
that resistance was all directed
towards Al, our attorney,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.390
and other attorneys on the case.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.550
Al did a phenomenal job, and
the other attorneys did as well,

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:51.140
of keeping us the focus of it,
but also keeping us out of a lot

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.010
of the things that we
didn't need to worry about.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.090
So that pushback was
directed towards Al.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:01.560 position:56%
So once our case came out, shortly
thereafter the ACLU joined our case.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.560
And then when he did the
birth certificate case,

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.620
[inaudible] joined that case.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.350
And there was quite a bit of
pushback saying, "You know,

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:14.850 position:56%
this doesn't fit within our strategy
that we had for marriage equality,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.350
and this isn't the
right thing to do."

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:20.260
And we only knew about
it after the fact.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.860
And Al simply said,
"No; I have to do this.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.220 position:56%
I have clients who are being harmed.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.790
This is the absolute
right thing to do."

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:33.790
And he just kept pushing, and kept
talking, and kept talking about us.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.110
And he brought them
all over to his side.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:41.430 position:56%
And from that point on, I personally
never, ever felt any pushback

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.210
from any of those national
organizations.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.300
They were a very cohesive
team of attorneys

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.520
and experts working on our behalf.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.240
So I thank Al for that.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.680
He really kept us out of that.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.980
He made it all about us.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: It wasn't also
-- it was Al, he was the head, head.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.480 position:56%
But all of the attorneys in all of
the four states faced this pushback,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.810
to the point where they actually
asked some of the national groups

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.670
for a funding to support expert
witnesses, or other things

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.970
that lawyers have to pay for.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.950
Remember, they were working with
no pay, and they couldn't get it

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.930 position:56%
in the beginning, because the
national groups, perhaps rightly so,

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.650
were worried about the Sixth
Circuit, you know, saying no.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.020
In fact, one of the attorneys

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.790
in Michigan actually sold
her house to fund this case.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.480
She was that determined
to keep going.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.780
I mean, these are lawyers --

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.210
Al had been in business 30-some
years, he could afford it.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.510
But the other lawyers,
I mean, they just --

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.450
they did all kinds of things
to come up with the money,

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.760
because they basically
worked for free

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.060

two-and-a-half years.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.550
Here you go.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.850
&gt;&gt; Not quite 25.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.150
I was just wondering about the oral
arguments at the Supreme Court.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.800
Now, we know that we
can't always predict

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.050
from oral arguments how the
justices are going to rule,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.260
because there are all these
briefs that get filed,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.720 position:56%
and there's all this -- a lot of
work that goes on behind the scenes.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.410
But I'm wondering what your
impressions were during the oral

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.460
arguments, if there was ever
a time when you felt, "Wow,

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.700 position:56%
this is going really well," or, "Oh,
my God, this is not looking good?"

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.460
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: You
know, during oral arguments,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:58.530 position:56%
I really tried hard not to let
myself wander too much down pathways

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.930
or avenues of thought, because
I know I'm not smart enough,

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.320
I'm not an attorney, I don't
know the justices well enough

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.850 position:56%
to have put any thought into, "Well,
that justice has this question,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.510
so that means X, versus they ask
that question, that means Y."

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.220
I wouldn't let myself do that.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.660
So I spent my time in oral
arguments just writing notes

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.640 position:56%
about what was asked, what was said.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.530
And I really tried hard
not to think too hard.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:30.320
Now, I did leave that day thinking,
"I think we're going to win."

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.860 position:56%
How much of that was what I actually
got out of the oral arguments,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.590
versus how much of that was just
me knowing I was on the right side

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.590 position:56%
and being an optimist, I'm not sure.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:44.380
But I did leave feeling
pretty optimistic.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:50.370
And as far as the oral arguments,
the things I remember was when --

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.830
you know, the whole
argument around, "Well,

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.250

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.060

thing for millennia, marriage?

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.580

for all of these years.

Why are we changing it?"

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.850
And it was RBG, wasn't it?

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.280
RBG said, "Well, no, I disagree.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.470
We have actually changed
the meaning of marriage,

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.430
because women are no
longer considered property

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:15.450
of their husbands."

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.270
[Laughter] That was one
of my favorite moments.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:21.330
And another one was -- and
this was during the arguments

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.630
for the right to marry.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:26.780
And I forget who it was, but it
was, again, back to, you know,

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.080
why are we changing this?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.860
And if we think back to the ancient
Greek civilization, you know,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.240
we know that same-sex relations
were okay, because we can read

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.550
about that, and we
know that it was part

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.640
of their culture, it was accepted.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.590 position:56%
But they didn't have same-sex
marriage, at least not from anything

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.890
that we've been able to tell.

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:44.190
Well, why do you think that is?

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.400
And Mary Bonauto just
pointblank, "Well, Your Honor,

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:56.670
I'm in no position to even consider
what ancient Greek philosophers

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.050
believed or thought."

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.020
It was just this really ridiculous
point of, "Well, ancient Greek,

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.590
they didn't, so why should we?"

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.930
And well -- [laughter] and
Mary's response was, "Well,

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.580
how am I supposed to
know what they thought,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.010
or what their feelings were?"

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.320
I just thought it was
a great response.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.620
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper:
But the beautiful thing

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.230
about that is what the
justices didn't know is

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.990
that she had studied
the classics in college.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.190
[Laughter] So she was actually
prepared to answer those questions.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.090
She wasn't expecting them, but
she was prepared to answer them.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.460
Because I think -- I remember
Al Gerhardstein, there's a scene

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.840
in the book where he said he
was kind of holding this breath

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.300
because he was not expecting
the ancient Greece questions,

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.120 position:56%
"Are we really going back that far?"

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.030
[Laughter] And Mary Bonauto is
this brilliant lawyer, and --

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.400
but had never argued
before the Supreme Court.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.700
But she was prepared.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.410
She studied the classics,
and she handled it.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.920 position:56%
But I think to answer your question,
too -- and Jim can talk about this,

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.460
everybody was listening to Justice
Kennedy, because, of course,

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.180
we all thought he was
the swing vote.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.750
So every question was analyzed,
and which way is he going to go?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.650
And, you know, the room kind of
quieted down when he spoke up.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.950
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Yes.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.570
And my absolute favorite moment

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.280
of the entire two-and-a-half
hours was in the last few minutes.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.580
And the second part

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.650
of the two-and-a-half
hours were the arguments

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.110
for the right to recognition.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:13.670
And Douglass Hallward-Driemeier,
who was arguing,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.060
he was doing his closing.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.240
And during his closing, as I've
mentioned, every single attorney

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.110
on that team kept the
plaintiffs front and center.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.560
They always brought it back to us.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.110
They always brought it back to the
fact that these are real people;

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.700
these are people being harmed.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:32.740
And in the last few lines
of his closing statements,

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:36.220
he brought it back and
talked about John and me,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.670
and about our relationship.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:41.750
And for me, that -- I loved it.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.570
I mean, it felt like John
and I had the last word,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.950
which was pretty powerful.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.900
But I loved that, again,
he brought it back to us,

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.400
and he brought it back to a real
couple who suffered real harm.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.790
And I really respect that they
did that every chance they had,

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.090
they brought it back to us.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.850
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: And this
attorney is a veteran Supreme

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.150
Court oralist.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:07.290
He lives here in DC, and I think
he's argued before every circuit

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.120
court in the country, and multiple
times before the Supreme Court.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.960
And he knows not to get emotional.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.310
I mean, he knows this is not
what the justices want to see.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.750
But he was determined
to slip that in.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.050
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Yes.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.350
&gt;&gt; Debbie Cenziper: And I
was told my multiple sources

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:22.650
in the courtroom.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.320
Then when we turned around
and went back to sit down,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.620
he had tears in his eyes.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.390
So I kind of thought
that that was, you know,

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.690
really, really sweet moment.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:29.990
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Yes.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.290
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: That's awesome.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.590 position:56%
Did you still want to ask -- please.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.450
&gt;&gt; Hi. So my question actually has
two parts, if that's all right.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.750
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Of course.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.740
&gt;&gt; So how did you handle, on
a personal and legal level,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.270
the backlash that you
must have received

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.350
from religious organizations in
the country during your case?

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:57.390
And something that I've noticed
is that a lot of the hate crimes

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:02.040
that are directed towards LGBT
members of our community tends

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.100
to arise because of
their interpretation

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.520
of a particular religious text.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.570
And so do you believe, as an
activist, that it's possible

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.310
to prevent hate crimes against
LGBT members of our community

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.490
without reforming these
religious institutions?

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.790
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell:
Ooh, good questions.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.090
[Laughter]

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.690
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Wow.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.760
Okay; so in the first one,
when I get this question,

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.780
I think it always amazes people
when I say that in almost two years

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.640
from the start of our case
to the Supreme Court ruling,

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:37.000
I got four pieces of mail that
were less than supportive.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.670
That's it, four, as
opposed to thousands --

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:48.080
honestly it feels like millions of
cards, letters, e-mails, messages,

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.820
and people stopping me everywhere
I go to thank me, to share stories,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.060
to tell me why this fight -- why
marriage equality meant something

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.440
to them or someone they loved.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.970
So for me personally,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.890
I've experienced nothing
but love and support.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.490
And it's been an amazing
two years because of that.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.840
You know, every single time that
happens when someone stops me

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.600
and shows me a photo, talks
about someone they love,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.500
it's this incredible gift,
and this incredible thank-you

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.480
that the other plaintiffs
and I stood up to fight.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.850
So personally, I've
experienced almost no backlash.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.630
And I love that I can say that.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.720
To me it gives me hope
for our country.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:38.560
The religion part, you know,
marriage there's such this feeling

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.120
of ownership to the word
"marriage" by religions.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.720
And I always did my best just to
reply with, "Well, you know what,

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.750
we go to a government office
for a marriage license."

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.910
It is a civil institution,
no religion is required.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.930
I mean, any person in this
country can get married

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.850
without having a religion involved.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.460 position:56%
So I would always come back to that.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.860 position:56%
And I've never quite understood this
feeling that they owned that word,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.780
that no one else can use it.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.970
And do I think we will continue

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:20.880 position:56%
to see continued hatred directed our
way, or pushback around LGBTQ rights

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.140
from a religious perspective,
absolutely.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:31.090
And I think it will be a
process of religious leaders

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:38.790
and religious people having
that realization that, you know,

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:44.900
"Love thy neighbor," the
Golden Rule, "Judge not."

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.460 position:56%
Those concepts seem to be forgotten.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:53.290
And I think until religions really
embrace that, and live that,

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:59.620
and step away from focusing on one
or two lines when they don't focus

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.670
on every other line, until
those types of changes occur,

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.800
I'm afraid we will
continue to see this.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.650
And that saddens me because,
you know, I was always taught

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.880
that religion is about
loving your neighbor

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.730
and treating them the way
you want to be treated.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.690
So I'm hopeful one day,
maybe that will be the case,

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.350 position:56%
but it will take some -- take a lot
of effort, and time, and reformation

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:31.920
within various churches;
various religious organizations.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Great, thank you.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.520
We'll end with the word "hopeful."

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.820
&gt;&gt; Jim Obergefell: Yes.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.120
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: [Laughs]
And before we do end,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.450
I want to invite our current
chair of LC Globe, Nicholas Brown,

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.510
up for some closing remarks,
and some -- thank you.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:53.130
[ Applause ]

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.250
[ Background Sounds ]

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.850
Hi, everyone.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.150
Good afternoon.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.420
First off, I just would like to
thank Jim and Debbie on behalf

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.680
on all of the LGBTQ employees here
at the Library for taking the time

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.640 position:56%
out of your busy lives to share your
experiences with us, because to all

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.390
of us you are people who we
look up to as leaders; Debbie,

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.220
you for helping sort of tell
the story of what happened.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.750
That's a remarkable feat that we

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.010
as library people really,
really appreciate that.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.040
So thank you for your
contribution to this.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.450
And to Jim, you're one of those
people who we will for the rest

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.350
of our lives remember having
been able to see in person,

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:37.500
and to witness, and to
share moments with you,

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.110
especially in this pride
month this year which has been

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.440
so difficult in so many ways.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.890
You give us inspiration.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:49.390
And your tireless commitment to
fighting for all of us is something

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.160 position:56%
that we can only strive to come this
close to to matching in our lives.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.670
So thank you, both,
for your contributions.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:01.150
As that's kind of alluded to, this
is a huge day for us at the Library

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.900
of Congress, I think, in terms of
working with so many colleagues

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.480
around the Library, especially
Chief of Staff Robert Newlen,

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.640
Law Librarian of Congress Roberta
Shaffer, and various colleagues

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.720
in EEODP Roberto and Eric, and
Travis, of course, to come together

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.410
to celebrate our LGBTQ community.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.490
We have had a long
time at the Library

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:25.770
of working towards
gaining more recognition,

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.890
and that is certainly happening
with the support of leaders,

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.190
such as Robert and Roberta.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.400
So we really appreciate everything
that they're doing for us.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.950
And we also appreciate the folks
who have taken leadership roles

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.310
in LC Globe over the
past 20-some odd years.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.880
If you have ever been on the
LC Globe steering committee,

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.060
could you stand up for me
please, so we can recognize you?

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.790
These are the folks who
work behind the scenes

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.590
to make everything possible.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:55.440
[ Applause ]

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.320
Another special thank-you goes
out to Leah from the Law Library,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.510
who has worked very closely
with us on this event.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:05.310
[ Applause ]

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.330
And before I go into some
housekeeping announcements,

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.200
I just want to share my impression
of what the Library's role is

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.140
in capturing LGBTQ history.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.610 position:56%
All of us that work here at the
Library are charged with collecting,

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.630
preserving, and serving cultural
history, and cultural memory,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.980
regardless of what demographic,
or regardless of what topic,

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.090
what religion, what subject
area, we're here to do it all,

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.220 position:56%
which is a really remarkable
charge, and it's a difficult charge.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.840
But I think with the LGBTQ
collections, in particular,

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.800
we are doing an astonishing job,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.360
and we're all working
to spread the word.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.280
And part of that is on you all,
to share with your colleagues

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.960
and friends around the world how
important the Library's LGBTQ

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.360
collections are.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.440
We have an LGBTQ portal for
Pride Month, which gives you some

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.030
of the highlights, which
is at loc.gov/lgbt.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.780
You can go in there
to see highlights

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.650
about the Walt Whitman
papers, for example,

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:01.820
or Leonard Bernstein's collection,
or a vast range of American poets

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.930
who have read their work
here at the Library.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.780
Our collections are vast.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.970
As you know, we have
over 160 million items.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.980
A large portion of that has
to do with LGBT culture,

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.220
and not necessarily in a
direct title, you know,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.270 position:56%
it's not "LGBT Issues in the 1970s."

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:19.740
However, our lives touch
all parts of society,

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.190
because we contribute
to all parts of society.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:25.250
So you can go into collections
having to do with any topic,

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.350
and you can see the legacy of our
community having a major impact

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.310
on what we know today as society.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.860
So thank you all for contributing
to that work, and for those of you

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.160
who are visiting us today,

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.170
please visit our resources
and check them out.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.830
The Library's open to anyone.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.270
You just need to present a
photo ID and get a reader card.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.440
And you should be age of 16 and up.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.870 position:56%
And if you'd like to connect with
us on a more research level in terms

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.790
of cultivating LGBTQ collections,

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.540
consider joining our LGBT studies
group, which meets monthly.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.100
And we work to kind of dig out some
of the hidden treasures relating

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.480
to our area of study, and then
promoting them to the public.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.450
So I'll leave you with that.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.700 position:56%
And just some general announcements.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.760 position:56%
We will have book sales in the back.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.200
The copies of Jim and Debbie's
book are going for $25 of discount.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.580
So get them while they're hot.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.250
And Jim and Debbie have
been kind enough to agree

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.460
to sign copies for all of you.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.100
And also a huge thanks
to the Law Library

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.690
for arranging a light
reception for us.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.480
So we invite you all
to join us in the back

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.520 position:56%
of the room before you depart today.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.150 position:56%
And one last thing is that our final
Pride Month event is taking place

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:35.080
on July 6th, slightly outside of
Pride Month, but we're very filled

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.750
with pride, so we can
keep going all year.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:40.990 position:56%
[Laughter] And that is a really
fascinating event, featuring authors

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.130
from the Golden Crown
Literary Society,

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.480
which if you don't know
what that organization is,

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.000
it's an organization that
promotes lesbian fiction writing.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.380
So we're going to have some really
distinguished authors come here

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.860
to the Library on July 6th.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.160
Hope you join us for that.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.250
It's at 11:00 am in
LM139 downstairs.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:00.200
And if you're interested in joining
us in more social capacities,

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.020
check out our Facebook group,
facebook.com/group/lcglobe.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.350
There are things like
parade pictures,

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.980
invites to happy hours,
and that kind of thing.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.170
So again, thank you to Debbie
and Jim, and also Travis

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:14.260
for moderating today, and to
Robert and Roberta, and Leah.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.780
And thank you for being here.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.430
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
