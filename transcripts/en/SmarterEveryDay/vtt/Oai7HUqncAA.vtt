00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.949
Hey, it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.069
I'm in the middle of the woods. My son lost a cheap little drone

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.359
and the only way we can figure out where it's at is we are powering it up and

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.609
listening to where it is, and it's really got me thinking about

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.500
directional hearing.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.809
To bring you up to speed real quick, my sister bought my son a toy drone which of course he immediately went outside and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.930
flew as high as he could and let the wind carry it off into the woods,

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.029
way out of sight. All we knew is that it was in a huge section of the forest.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.730
Now, problem-solving is an important skill that I always try to teach my children

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
So, first I'll let him wander around aimlessly for a bit - of course not finding it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.240
and then I decided it was time to start our little adventure.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.180
First, we all spread out in the woods and got real quiet

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.500
We then activated the drone and used our directional hearing to see if we thought we knew where it was coming from.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020
It was super faint so each walked in the direction.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.500
We thought it was coming from and we all stopped, got quiet again, and then reactivated it.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
At this time, we were a little bit closer. So we felt more confident with our directional hearing and we moved in that direction.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360
With three of us, we were able to easily triangulate it even though

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.939
we couldn't see it, but this is where it got weird. We had absolutely no idea how far up the tree it was.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.989
It was like our directional hearing somehow worked in the horizontal plane

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.100
But in the vertical plane it just didn't work.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.900
Right now we've isolated it to this tree. We think

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.900
but we're not really sure...

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.819
exactly where. But we're using our stereo hearing in order to find it. It's really cool

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.540
Son's bringing some binoculars.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.020
Look up in the tree. That's where I hear it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.420
It is in that tree.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.560
I hear it in that tree.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.780
Okay

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.320
Where?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.200
For you, you see that branch right there and the branch is covering it up.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.200
Oh, do it again.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There it is

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.600
That's it. Okay. I think we can do this.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
Son, go get a rifle.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.600
So we found it just in time you got it. Yeah, do it up?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.100
You're freaking awesome. Did it come down?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.940
Safe the weapon, stand by.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.580
Ah ah ah

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.200
Get back!

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.580
Get on the ground

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.220
Make sure the weapon's cold

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.460
I know we're excited, let's be safe.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.460
We did it.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.380
We got it!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
Weapon's safe, let's go get it.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.100
All right, Aunt Briley gave you a Christmas present and then she saved your Christmas present. So that's pretty cool.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.659
That is the power of the directional hearing that our bodies have because if you think about it

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.269
One ear to the other one if I have a sound on this side

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.349
the sound hits this ear one millisecond before it hits this ear and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.299
The higher frequencies are muffled out by the time it gets over here because that sound goes across my face

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.959
We just use that to find this. But you know what I think is interesting?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.980
How can you find something? How did you know it was up high?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.480
I don't know. I don't either.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480
This is a really good question

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.360
Think about it.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.920
If there's a sound directly in front of you, and you hear it

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.200
It's stimulating

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.409
both of your ears at the exact same time

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.929
Because the distance is the same, right? If you take that same sound and you move it vertically, the same is true

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.860
So you can't resolve a vertical position directly in front of you with temporal cues, meaning time.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.740
It has to be something else.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.880
It wasn't until I found an experiment performed on the YouTube channel called Scilabus that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.070
I understood the answer to the problem.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.060
It's called spectral cues.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.828
If you think about a sound across the room,

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:54.240
it's going to go to your ear and bounce off of your ear and down into your ear hole

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.830
If you have a sound from below,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.380
It's going to bounce off a different part of your ear and then into your ear hole

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.940
That is going to change the sound before it goes into your body and your brain has developed this complex algorithm

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.700
It has to do with the area of study called psycho acoustics, and it will tell your brain

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.640
Exactly where it is in the vertical axis based on frequency and spectral cues and that is amazing.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.060
I watched a video on Vivian's channel, Scilabus, about how to test this

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.260
and you can do this at your own home, so I would encourage you to go watch her video

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.700
But I wanted to do it with my son, so we're going to illustrate this with my son here

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.000
See we've got this big setup. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take my hands and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.040
I'm going to clap it like this (clapping) and you point to exactly the spot where the sound is coming from.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.200
Can you do that? Try it. (clapping)

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.340
Are you cool being blindfolded?
"I'm fine with that."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.980
Okay, here's the deal, his brain is calibrated for the spectral cues off of his shaped ear. If we were to pack

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.557
Play-Doh in the pinna, that's going to change the spectrum that comes down into his ear

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.420
and he's not going to be able to calculate the position in the vertical axis.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.380
I learned this from Scilabus. Vivian did a really cool experiment go check it out on her channel.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.800
Anyway, let's do the clappy thing again.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.000
So what you'll notice is if we're on the left or the right, he gets it almost every time,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.900
but he has a hard time with the vertical axis. He can't even tell if it's forward or back

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.460
I was clapping right between your legs and you pointed up.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.300
"What?"

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.480
Do you realize how awesome that is? Let's just use all the big words.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.080
We just derailed the psycho-acoustic filter in my son's brain by negating his ability to use

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.800
temporal cues because of the position of the sound, but

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.920
driving him to not being able to trust his spectral cues because we dampened down the pinna

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.960
which is the floppy parts on the outside of his head by using Play-doh.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.640
So he couldn't figure out where the sound was coming from.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.000
That's fascinating. The cool thing about this is that dogs don't really do it that well.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.300
Have you ever said something to a dog and he kind of does his head like that?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.480
What he's doing is he's trying to cheat a little bit. The dog's putting one year above the other so they can

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.040
resolve vertical position. That's amazing. They're using temporal cues.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.460
They're cheating with temporal cues to try to get something that we get with spectral cues

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.620
I've never thought about this, and the reason that's important is because I have a whole YouTube channel

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.060
you didn't know about, probably. It's called The Sound Traveler. I have been recording video for years now

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.800
where I put bineural microphones in my ear

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:09.519
And if you wear headphones and watch the video that I'm recording it tricks your brain into thinking you're there based on these temporal cues.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.500
Okay, tell them about the thing we do. 
Briley: "So there's a second YouTube channel. It's called The Sound Traveler.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.320
We go around the world and we record experiences with bineural audio.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.860
I've gone to Thailand and DC.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.160
Destin's done Iceland, Germany..."
I went to Iceland and Germany

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.000
Briley: "Yup, we're going to Colombia soon. Uh, and it's it's a really chill channel.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.480
It's just like experiencing travel in a different way."
Yeah, it's pretty cool

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.240
It's not like a full-on like trying to win youtube kind of thing,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.409
but it's an experiment in immersive 3D audio with a GoPro on your head. It's really fun!

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:45.580
Anyway, I think you'll dig it.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.960
Briley: "If you have headphones on, just go check it out." 
Yeah, put your headphones on, check it out.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.780
It's called The Sound Traveler. I'll leave the link in the video description

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.000
I would love to get that over a hundred thousand subscribers. It's something I really love.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.660
Ok that's it for this episode of Smarter Every Day. I hope you enjoyed it.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.820
You may know that Audible's been sponsoring Smarter Every Day for a really long time. I love it.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.880
I love to use my ears to get smarter and I do that with Audible.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.520
If you want to check out a free trial go to audible.com/smarter.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.580
We've recently started introducing audible books to my children who loved it.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.700
Here's a hack for you. If you want to get like five books for the price of one,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.700
then get something called the enchanted collection or the adventure collection.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.640
It's 40 hours of audio books like White Fang, Gulliver's Travels, all kinds of cool stuff.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.580
Get the enchanted collection or the adventure collection at audible.com/smarter

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.240
That's it. I'll leave links to everything in the video description.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.420
I hope this video earned your subscription. If not, no big deal.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.120
I hope from now on if you hear a sound, you think about where it's coming from,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.280
why you know it's coming from that position, whether it's temporal cues or spectral cues,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.960
and I also hope every time you see a dog do this you know that he's cheating.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.520
He's trying to use temporal cues instead of spectral cues which is pretty doggone cool.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.400
Anyway, I'm destin, you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.060
Don't cheat. It's important that you don't cheat. We need the data, okay?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.400
And you shot it, didn't you?
Briley: "I did. I didn't mean to. I meant to shoot the branch."

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.720
I think that's why it came down though.
Briley: "It'll still be good."

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.660
You realize we used all of our country super powers to do that?
Briley: "Pulled out every single stop that we had."

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.240
Briley: "Let's zero in this - let's zero in this scope with those cans."

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.900
Hey man, we did! We zeroed the scope with old cans. And then we got...
