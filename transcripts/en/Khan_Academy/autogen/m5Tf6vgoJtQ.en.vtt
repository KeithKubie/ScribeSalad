00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 . 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.910
 Let's solve a few verbal tasks by using 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.939
 exponential growth and decrease. 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.930
 In the first task we have radioactive material decomposition 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.130
 at a rate of 3.5% per hour. 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.400
 How many percent of the substance will remain after 6 hours? 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.070
 Let me make a small table here, 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.700
 to imagine what's going on. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.940
 And then we will try to draw a general formula 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.210
 how much is left after n hours. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.980
 Let's say outgoing hours 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.280
 and remaining percentages, 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.880
 How many percent left after 0 hours? 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.710
 Well, it has not yet collapsed so we have 100% left. 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.570
 What happened after 1 hour? 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.200
 The substance breaks down at a rate of 3.5% per hour. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.140
 So 3.5% have gone. 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 In other words this is 0.965. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.870
 Do not forget that if you take 1 minus 3.5% 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.390
 or if you take 100% minus 3.5% - it shows how much we lose every hour - 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.360
 and equals 96.5%. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 So every hour we will have 96.5% 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.720
 of the quantity in the previous hour. 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.940
 At hour 1 we have 96.5% of hour 0 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.970
 or 0.965 per 100, by the amount at hour 0. 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.325
 What's going on in class 2? 

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.850
 Time 2. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540
 We have 96.5% of the amount in the previous hour. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.510
 We will have lost 3.5% 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.190
 which means we have 96.5% of the previous hour. 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.550
 It will be 0.965 on that, 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.870
 multiplied by 0.965 by 100. 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.660
 I think you see what's happening in general. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.510
 In the first hour we have 0.965 at grade 1, 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.780
 multiplied by 100. 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.758
 At the zero hour we have 0.965 at zero. 

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:13.730
 We do not see it, but there is a unit multiplied by 100. 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.110
 In the second hour, we have 0.965 at degree 2 multiplied by 100. 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 And in general at n-th hour - let me write it in 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.860
 nice bright color - we'll have the n-th hour 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.850
 0.965 at n grade, multiplied by 100, 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.130
 which is left of our radioactive substance. 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100
 You will often find it written in this way. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.190
 You have the initial value 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.450
 multiplied by private 0.965 to n degree. 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.500
 That's how it will stay after n hours. 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.820
 Now we can answer the question: 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.310
 How old is it after 6 hours? 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.510
 We will have the remaining 100 multiplied by 0.965 at sixth. 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.150
 We can use a calculator to calculate how much it is. 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.000
 Let's use our faithful calculator. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.880
 We have 100 at 0.965 at sixth grade, which is 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.820
 equal to 80.75. 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.080
 That's all in percent. 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.220
 So 80.75% of our original substance remains. 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.600
 80.75%. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.646
 Let's make another example like this. 

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:41.570
 Given that Nadia has a fast food chain, 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.360
 which in 1999 had 200 sites. 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.690
 If the rate of increase is ... 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.260
 Oh, there's a typo. 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.670
 Here should be 8% - 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.470
 the growth rate is 8% per year 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.450
 how many stores will the chain have in 2007? 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.500
 Let's apply the same logic. 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.860
 Here we have years after 1999. 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.019
 And here we have how many restaurants there will be Nadia, or hers 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.820
 fast food chain. 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.950
 1999 itself is 0 years after 1999. 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.710
 and it has 200 stores. 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.620
 Then in 2000, which was 1 year after 1999, 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.040
 how many restaurants will there be? 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190
 Well it grows at a rate of 8% per year. 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.060
 So there will be all the restaurants she had before, 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.210
 plus 8% of the restaurants she had previously. 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.980
 1.08 multiplied by the number of restaurants it had previously. 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.660
 And as you will see, private here is 1.08. 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.380
 If it grows by 8%, it is equivalent to 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.460
 a multiplication of 1.08. 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.740
 Let's make it clear. 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.290
 200 plus 0.08 multiplied by 200. 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.040
 Well, it's only 1 in 200 plus 0.08 multiplied by 200. 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.700
 That's 1.08 by 200. 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.920
 Then what happened in 2001? 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.310
 These are already 2 years since 1999, and there is an increase 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.230
 with 8% of this figure. 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.330
 You will multiply 1.08 by this number, 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.510
 multiplied by 1.08 multiplied by 200. 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.570
 I think I understood the essence. 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.790
 n years after 1999 this will be 1.08 - 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.560
 let me write it this way: 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.660
 will be 200 at 1.08 at n grade. 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.200
 After 2 years it is 1.08 per square. 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.370
 After one year is 1.08 in the first degree. 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.960
 0 years, it's the same as 1 in 200, which 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.870
 is 1.08 at zero. 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.620
 The condition asks how many restaurants work 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.550
 will there be in 2007? 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.320
 2007 is 8 years after 1999. 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.090
 So here n equals 8. 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.110
 Let us replace n with 8. 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.420
 The answer to our question is 200 at 1.08 at eight. 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.000
 Let's get our calculator and calculate it. 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.570
 We want to calculate 200 by 1.08 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.090
 to eighth degree. 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.840
 It will have 370 restaurants and it will be 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.250
 in the process of opening a few more. 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.520
 So if we round it down, 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.900
 it will have 370 restaurants. 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.255
 8% growth may not seem like something that's so fast 

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:04.910
 or so exciting. 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.280
 But in less than a decade, in only eight years, it would increase 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.390
 its chain of restaurants from 200 to 370 restaurants. 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.020
 You see that for an 8-year increase of 8% 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.440
 it is actually very impressive. 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.000
 .
