1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,810
[inaudible].

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,740
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,470
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:10,330
February 15th, 2016 hello. How are you?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,570
How was your world going on this Monday?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,700
How was your Valentine's Day? Huh?
Did you get her something special?

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,090
Um, if you're a smart son of a bitch, um,

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,830
you're either not in a relationship or
you're not taking her out until, uh,

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,470
tonight or tomorrow or whatever.
Whenever the prices go back down again,

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,300
you know, and by the way,

11
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:36,530
if enough people start doing this in the
old fucking restaurants get wise to it

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,290
and they start making their prices higher,

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,350
Valentine's Day prices a few
days before, a few days after,

14
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:46,220
then fucking wait a week, wait
a month, do it a month earlier.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,180
Um,

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,410
okay.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,360
It's the biggest fucking rip
off probably of the year,

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,060
other than probably what's
going on to Bernie Sanders,

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:00,530
but I don't really understand. I guess
she has some super delt delegates,

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,670
you know? Oh,

21
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:05,240
fucking Hillary Clinton's got the super
and she already has the super delegate.

22
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,790
She already had a hundred. She
only needs a harder, the 20,

23
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:12,590
whatever the fuck that is. Jesus Christ.
It's like, it's like playing bridge,

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,560
trying to keep up what's
going on. I have no idea.

25
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:18,920
All I know is I liked that Bernie looks
like an old dog trying to eat a meal

26
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:23,600
when he's talking [inaudible] the fucking
job was going and the weird thing said

27
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:27,800
his fingers do I like it. I could
look at that for four years.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,743
Um,

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,350
I got to admit that as much as I don't
like all the racist shit Trump is doing,

30
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,860
I do love some fucking jerk off
yelling at other politicians.

31
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:41,430
So that part has been
enjoyable. You're a liar.

32
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,960
There are that, there weren't any
mass weapons of mass destruction.

33
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,250
And they know it may sound like
he's quoting some podcasts.

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,783
Um,

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,220
I have no idea. At some point I'm
going to start paying attention.

36
00:01:57,221 --> 00:02:02,020
There's gotta be some even
keeled so-and-so out there.
I have no fucking clue.

37
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,861
I have no clue.

38
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,220
And last week I said that I hate him
when people in the public eye talk about,

39
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,300
uh, politics. You know, that's not true.

40
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:14,740
I hate when they fucking tell me why
I should vote for somebody. Oh Shit.

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,850
Were you the guy from a interview
with the vampire? Oh yeah.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,550
Who should I elect for
leader of the free world?

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,780
It was like when Tom Cruise was talking
about psychology. It's like, Oh yeah,

44
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:32,950
you pretended to be a shogun
warrior in a NASCAR champion.

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,270
Let me by by all means, let me listen
to you talk about a modern medicine.

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,003
Um,

47
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,230
as long as you preface it with
like, I'm a fucking moron.

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,910
I don't know what I'm talking
about, but I, here you go. You know?

49
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,080
But when you really start believing
it, that's when you get in trouble.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
And maybe I believe it,

51
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,610
and maybe this is the way I'm
just sort of soft pedal on a team.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,940
I'm playing the more on it as
I'm fucking feeding you my,

53
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,010
let's putting a little, a ringworm and
you're fucking ear or whatever people say

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,520
there with the fucking ear worm, right?

55
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,600
Some song you can't stand gets
in your fucking head, you know,

56
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,940
it's kind of a weird ones. What a
song you like gets in your head.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,630
And then you don't mind. And then you
drive everybody nuts around you. Like, uh,

58
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,810
um, Steve Gorman from Steve Gorman sports
sent me this, this link to this, uh,

59
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,580
this country star that's been, um,
that's been struggling for a long,

60
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,350
long time. And he finally got a big break.

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,960
I believe he's a distant cousin
of Roy Clark. I'm not sure,

62
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,010
but his name is Wheeler Walker Jr and uh,

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,660
he sent me a clip that
I'll send you guys. Uh,

64
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,710
it's a great fucking song for Valentine's
Day if you are not in a relationship

65
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,230
for a man or a woman. And, uh,

66
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:45,730
the hook is just been stuck in my head
and I really want to sing it to you,

67
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:50,050
but it's gonna ruin it for you.
So go look up a wheeler Walker Jr.

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,510
Uh, well I guess the song kind of ruins.
It's called a fuck you. Yeah, bitch.

69
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,220
And it's really catchy and it's a,

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,650
I dunno, it's fits rich, kind of
poetic. I really think the, uh,

71
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:11,600
the chorus really sums up what you
feel when somebody breaks your heart.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,770
So, um, you know, country music,
those country music stars,

73
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,470
they can do that t every once in awhile.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,230
And it's nice to see someone
go to the left, you know,

75
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:22,610
those fucking country singers.

76
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:25,040
So those poor bastards for all
these fucking years, you know,

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,530
they've been abused
and drugs and you know,

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
going to clan meetings and beating
the shit out of their women.

79
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:36,320
But when they get on TV, they got to
do that family values thing. You know,

80
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,820
they got to [inaudible]. Yeah. I just
want to thank Jesus who I'm just,

81
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,600
I just feel blessed that y'all just,
you take me into your heart, you know,

82
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,850
hey y'all, he wants you
on some potato salad.

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,440
That stupid phony fucking southern thing
where if you're from up north the first

84
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,250
time you see it, your heart and melts.

85
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,390
When you hear that Twang and you just
think that dig the nicest fucking person.

86
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:00,630
Nobody can stick the
fucking knife in your back

87
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,150
like a fucking southerner
with that fucking k y'all.
How'd you hit all mts work?

88
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,540
And they downplay it. They play dumb,
but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

89
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,680
And next thing you know,

90
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,460
you're laying in a fucking pig trough
about ready to get fucking eaten alive.

91
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,860
That's how it goes down. All right,

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,430
now guy from fucking 50
snatches and 40 smoking barrels,

93
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,120
that's where we got it from.
Okay. Not from that content.

94
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,520
You know, I don't know where the
fuck I'm talking about. Anyways,

95
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,800
I watch a brand new TV
show last night and uh,

96
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,360
I was really fucking disappointed,
you know, I fucking turned it on.

97
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,170
I needed a new shelf and I thought
it was going to be the one, you know,

98
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,210
I was like, this is gonna be it.
It's Valentine's Day night. Okay.

99
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,000
Me and the lovely Nia,
we're not going out.

100
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,720
I had a fucking one of those Tomahawk
steaks frozen in the freezer.

101
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,700
The fucking

102
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,650
phrase, right? The frosted
dead bitch all day.

103
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,800
I watch like 30 youtube
videos. His had dude sat,

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,970
do you know what you're going
to do? [inaudible] on Youtube.

105
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,210
And I watched like 50 of those fucking
things and I just sort of like,

106
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I took a survey with temperature and
time flippage in all of that stuff.

107
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,920
And I went down the middle and, uh,

108
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,440
I got a little impatient
with the big green egg.

109
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,960
My temperature is a little
higher than I wanted,

110
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,220
so came out of the medium
rather than a medium rare,

111
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,740
but it was still fucking delish and I,

112
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,760
there was a new series at that that I
tried to get into last night and I put it

113
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:41,870
on and, uh, it looked
good. The acting was great,

114
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,490
but the dialogue just wasn't there.

115
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,970
And I tried to fucking fight it
out for the first 20 minutes.

116
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,510
And then I just looked over
at Nia. Nia did one of those.

117
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,200
Yeah. You know, big inhale in the
fucking eyes, like, yeah, this is a,

118
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:01,430
yeah. And then I was just like, well,
let's shut it up. She's like, no,

119
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:05,660
you know, we gotta at least watch
the pilot episode, you know,

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,820
which is how she ended up marrying me
because I believe 20 minutes into our

121
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,940
relationship, she was like, yeah,

122
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:17,570
but she fucking stuck it through night.

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,770
She kept panning for gold and she found
a little nugget and she stuck with me.

124
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,310
I didn't, I was just like,
fuck this. I'm out. And uh,

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,090
by 40 minutes into it, I was
imitating people in it and, uh,

126
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,070
the whole thing just went down
the shitter. So once again,

127
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,680
but you know what it, you know,

128
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,160
I'm finally gonna do I think I'm finally
gonna start watching game of Thrones

129
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,410
now that they're fucking five, 10,

130
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:47,411
15 fucking seasons into what I've been
trying to watch it for the longest time.

131
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,560
But, uh, Nia is just
not into it. You know,

132
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,740
she doesn't wanna see a bunch of white
people running around chasing dragons.

133
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,700
It's just not what she's into. And,
uh, I'm not really into dragons either,

134
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,820
but like, if you're going to cut
somebody's fucking head off, like, um,

135
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,470
you know, you got to do a lot to
lose me after that point. You know,

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
I dunno. Maybe I don't know
who the fuck knows. Maybe I,

137
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,790
I remember watching the first one and
there was some sort of spooky thing going

138
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,900
on and there was some little kid that
was supposed to watch a beheading and he

139
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:20,510
looked away and then his,
I forget what his dad did,

140
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,290
put him on the rack or
something. I don't remember. Um,

141
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,841
but then I don't,

142
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:28,640
I don't know what happened and that
just kept it kept going and you know,

143
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,900
it's like a train that was coming right.
And you could have ran and caught it,

144
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:36,080
but I, but you don't, you just stand
there and you watch it disappear.

145
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,820
And in that moment when that train
disappears and you realize you're late for

146
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,590
work in that fucking moment,

147
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,110
you question everything that
you're doing in your life.

148
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,550
Why didn't I run for that train? Because
I had this job that I don't like.

149
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,310
What am I doing in this
relationship? What happened to me?

150
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,740
What happened in the last six
years in my fucking life? Right?

151
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,210
It's a critical moment there where you
have to beat all those thoughts down,

152
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,090
bury them, and go back to
being the Zombie that you are.

153
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,730
Which brings me to the
walking dead now. I'm kidding.

154
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,780
Anyways, I want to thank everyone

155
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,190
who came out in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

156
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,430
I kept doing a southern accent the
entire time I was out there and I was

157
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,060
addressing it, but, uh, I don't know
what Wyoming people sound like. Um,

158
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,840
Cheyenne, Wyoming and Denver,
Colorado. I went out with, uh,

159
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,320
Dean del Ray and uh,

160
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,560
we had the great fucking
time to play this, um,

161
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,110
the Cheyenne civic center.
How cool does that sound?

162
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:38,610
And had all this amazing woodwork inside
of it that really look like one of

163
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,560
those log cabins that either an oil man
or a fucking Hollywood starlet goes and

164
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,500
buys. You know, like when people like it,

165
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,120
a huge amount of success pretending to
be other people at some point they have

166
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:55,680
to get out of La. Then they always
end up in like Wyoming or Montana.

167
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,960
It's fucking hilarious. And they buy
what looks like a log cabin, sort of.

168
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,580
It looks like a log cabin and like a
fucking resort all at the same time,

169
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,590
you know? And then they go out there
and they buy, they're a designer.

170
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,830
I'm a fucking cattle rancher wardrobe.

171
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,590
And then they do the
fucking interview, right.

172
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:20,020
With their big stupid cowboy
hat on and older, wiser,

173
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:25,021
so and so steps back to a evaluate
the last six years of a whirlwind,

174
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,100
whatever the fuck it is.
Right. You know what I mean?

175
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,460
And then they pretend that they could
live this little fucking life out there

176
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:36,630
before they go nuts after three days
and they call up a chief [inaudible] to

177
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,340
pick them up and take
them right back, you know,

178
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:42,240
and they end up back down to
chateau. Right. The Chateau Mall.

179
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm doing blow in a
bungalow. That's what you do.

180
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,190
You find in a little
bit of balance. Um, oh,

181
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,680
speak in a fucking [inaudible]
before I go back on that shit.

182
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,470
Speaking of fucking
sick ass houses. I was,

183
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,120
I went on this Paul Newman kick, you
know, he's my favorite of all time.

184
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,840
You know, a lot of people go, Steve
McQueen. I like Steve McQueen,

185
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,240
but Paul Newman's my guy. Um,
he's my fella. I just, I dunno,

186
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,850
once I look into those blue eyes,
I just, I melt to say anything.

187
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,120
I believe it or are you a
pool shark or you a lawyer?

188
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,610
Do you play hockey? Um, I watched, um,

189
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
well I guess the first thing
I watched, I watched, uh,

190
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,840
the man with the golden arm, which d,

191
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,500
which Delray was telling
me to watch, which was a,

192
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:35,501
a movie about a Frank Sinatra
playing a heroin addict who,

193
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:36,840
uh, you know,

194
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,990
comes out of jail and he gets clean and
he plays the drums and he wants to get a

195
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,190
gig playing drums. And, uh, I
watched a great fucking movie.

196
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,470
There's some brutal,
brutal over acting. Um,

197
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,800
you got to you, I don't know. I would
definitely recommend seeing that.

198
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,880
So once I've finished that, you know,

199
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,260
it's like the next thing that was coming
up was, uh, somebody up there likes me,

200
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,960
which I had always heard
of when I was growing up.

201
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,060
And then once I saw it was Paul
Newman, I was like, all right,

202
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:04,894
I'm going to watch it.

203
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,130
And it was him playing out rocky
Graziano the rocky Graziano story.

204
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,620
And, um, and I literally forget
what I was talking. Oh that's right.

205
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:18,550
That's right. So it just got me on
this, this, this Paul Newman thing.

206
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,150
And you know what's funny
is, uh, this is thing,

207
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,320
actually Steve McQueen is in that
movie for fucking two seconds.

208
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,900
And uh, it's right as, uh, Graziano
was getting out of some fucking, uh,

209
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,990
you know, juvenile detention
home that he fucking escapes.

210
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,720
So He's going around the
neighborhood, tapping all these guys,

211
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,810
all this tough guy, friends on
the shoulders to be like, Hey,

212
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm back in the neighborhood.
And all of them turn around like,

213
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,180
who the fuck is this guy? Right?
Cause cause at Tufts street kids,

214
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,580
so fucking, uh,

215
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,980
fucking Steve McQueen is shooting pool.
They rocky taps them on the shoulder.

216
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:58,030
And he fucking turns around with
a knife out, just two seconds.

217
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,860
And then he realizes it's
reads like it's rocky, a rocky,

218
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:07,861
and he does this stupid fucking thing
with his hand that I don't know who

219
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,104
fucking,

220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,030
there's certain things in movies that
the first guy who plays that guy does.

221
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,290
And then it's this weird fucking thing
where every other actor after it starts

222
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,860
fucking doing it. And you
know, nobody ever did it,

223
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,990
who's actually the guy
that they're playing.

224
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,770
But then it's done enough in fucking
movies that the people who are actually

225
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:32,220
that guy, then they start fucking doing
it. And that's when it becomes a circle.

226
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,830
And you don't know who the fuck it
is. It's this fucking thing like a,

227
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,730
it's almost like say you were getting a
mannequin right and you want it to dry

228
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:43,210
off your nails and you do it just exactly
a rocky and he's doing this stupid

229
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:47,770
fucking thing with his
hand. Um, I don't know.

230
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,230
I'm going a really long way here to
tell you what I really want to tell you.

231
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,850
But like one of my favorite things is
to watch actors during that era playing

232
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,780
Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just,

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,950
it's fucking cringeworthy that
fucking movie that Marlon Brando did.

234
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,340
He's on the motorcycle with
the fuck was that one called?

235
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,140
It's not the wild bunch. That was a
cowboy movie. Rebel without a caught.

236
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,620
Now that's James Dean. I
can't remember, but just the,

237
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,440
the have to sit there
and watch that shit. Um,

238
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,030
how fucking brutal it
is. That west side story,

239
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
which I don't think I've ever seen.

240
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm just going to throw that in
there cause I need three of them. Um,

241
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,400
I dunno. Whatever. So I
started watching that.

242
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:33,610
So then I finished that one and
then the next one that came on,

243
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,900
I can't even remember the name of
it. Fuck, hang on a second. Now.

244
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:41,500
I gotta I MDB fucking Paul Newman. Um,

245
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,310
he just has the bluest eyes. Paul Newman.

246
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,870
I am the fucking be filmography.

247
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,700
So anyways, I think it
was called not Hudson.

248
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,770
The long story was this
next movie comes on, right?

249
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,780
And in the beginning,

250
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,830
he's driving in this car and
he's clearly in Los Angeles,

251
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,120
which was one of my favorite fucking
things ever to just see old footage,

252
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,940
black and white or color of La.

253
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:15,440
And you just get to see like you can
usually tell by the Hollywood hills and

254
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:20,090
sometimes the highways and shit
kind of where they are. And um,

255
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,100
you'll see like train tracks and shit
that they ripped up those fucking cons or

256
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:29,630
you'll see 'em you know, you'll just
see how less populated as all right.

257
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,750
Here it is. Harper Harper's the movie,
the very beginning of the movie,

258
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,440
he goes into a house and uh,

259
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,810
Lauren because in there Lauren Bacall
who married a Humphrey Bogart bogey and

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,560
Bacall one of the great couples
in Hollywood history and uh,

261
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,570
you know, Humphrey Bogart,

262
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,720
somebody that Frank Sinatra
stole a lot of his swagger from.

263
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,980
They were also the first rat pack
Humphrey Bogart and all his fucking crew.

264
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,820
And uh, not only did, uh,

265
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,400
Sinatra steal a lot of
Humphrey Bogart swagger,

266
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,680
he actually ended up fucking Lauren Bacall
later on after Humphrey Bogart died,

267
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:11,240
which is really fucked up. But
anyways, I digress. So at Harper,

268
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:15,440
he pulls into this fucking house
that I could not believe and uh,

269
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,910
I actually looked it up and it
still exists. Look it up right now.

270
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,280
If you're at work, pretend
that you're doing, uh,

271
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,700
that you're doing some sort
of, I'm busy work. It's,

272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,010
it's on one zero one
one north Beverly drive,

273
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,250
10 11 Beverley drive. And uh,

274
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,150
this fucking house, I think it's
just called the Beverly House,

275
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,530
it's in Beverly Hills,

276
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,970
probably has one of the sickest fucking
pools I've ever seen in my life.

277
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,800
It's like a three tiered thing.

278
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,980
The first two tiers I believe
are just considered a waterfall.

279
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,320
And first of all, it has like a
half mile driveway that he did.

280
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,820
He comes up around in what's Hilarious,

281
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,340
which will looks like the first
year they had the Porsche,

282
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
which at this point by
1965, when they shot,

283
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,330
it was just considered a piece of
shit. Who would know that years later,

284
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,480
some baby boomer would play
like fucking 900 grand for it.

285
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,170
So he's driving up one of, you know,
one of the fenders is like that fucking,

286
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,050
you know, what's that, that paint
that they primer and all that shit.

287
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,570
So he pulls up in his fucking house.
You've got to see the backyard of it.

288
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,550
So actually I looked the fucking thing up,

289
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,960
I found out where it was and the next
time I fly a helicopter I'm going to

290
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,160
fucking fly over the house and
check it out. Um, it's actually a,

291
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,550
just a little bit north of
the Beverly Hills Hotel,

292
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,460
but you got to check this
fucking thing out. Um,

293
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,640
one of the great things about living in
Los Angeles, a lot of people, you know,

294
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,210
always shit on living in
la, but one of the main,

295
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,680
I think la arguably has some
of the most amazing homes,

296
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,240
um, in the country, just for the
simple fact that for whatever reason,

297
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:58,290
I don't know if it's the weather out here
or what, they haven't been torn down.

298
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,630
Um, so many of them, um, you know,
other places that I've been to,

299
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:07,590
but they have like craftsman's houses
out here and then they have all the, the,

300
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,250
the Spanish, the Mediterranean
style ones they have, uh,

301
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,110
they got, it's just incredible houses.
So you've got to check this one out.

302
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:20,160
This house is actually kind of
ugly, you know, when you pull up,

303
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,980
they shut the godfather part two
there, but I'm part one there.

304
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:27,210
This is actually the house
where, uh, the horses head scene,

305
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,520
um, spoiler alert if you,

306
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,880
if you're one of the two people
have never seen that fucking movie,

307
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:37,881
they shot that scene in there and JFK and
his wife Jackie had their honeymoon in

308
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,950
this fucking house and I just saw it
recently. The last time it's sold,

309
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,980
it's sold for $135 million.

310
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,690
And all I'm doing looking at it after
by in my old ass house that was made in

311
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:59,691
1923 all I see is fucking 50,000 square
foot of galvanized pipe and cloth wiring

312
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,410
that they're going to have to somehow
fucking read through where all sections of

313
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,930
it. You know, there's a little
bit of copper pipe here,

314
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:11,010
a little bit of wiring that
was done correctly. Um,

315
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,361
but anyways,

316
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,960
that's another cool thing about these
fucking houses out there is that they've

317
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:20,961
been around so long and if they're
in a desirable area in Hollywood,

318
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,070
like the stories of like the people
that live there, like how cool. I mean,

319
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,980
that's $135 million house. Obviously
it'd be a fucking amazing house.

320
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,500
But how fucking amazing would be
to have that house and be like,

321
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,820
he didn't see a movie.

322
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,300
And you're watching Paul Newman walking
across your fucking terrace that you now

323
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:41,250
want. I don't know. I think that
Shit's cool as hell. But, um,

324
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,470
you know why you're at it.

325
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:47,070
You can check out a lot of those and
also just look up famous Hollywood homes.

326
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,960
Um, I told you there's a house about,

327
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,350
okay.

328
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,150
Not even like, I dunno,

329
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,050
maybe a 15 minute drive away
from me in, in, in Los Angeles,

330
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:05,370
15 minutes is a big fucking
deal. Sometimes just, you know,

331
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,610
15 blocks, it can go one way or another.

332
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,540
It can literally go like to,

333
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm going to get stabbed to how the
fuck can you ever afford to live in hi.

334
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,660
How many people did you steal from to
get this fucking sky's got a moat around

335
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,690
his house. Let's, let's wait. La
Is, it's like really like patchwork.

336
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,130
So like a 15 minute drive
away from where I live. Um,

337
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,040
my neighbor told me there's a
house that went up for sale.

338
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,190
I think I told this story before and um,

339
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,860
it's an old ass house. It's
pre-prohibition. And Basically, uh,

340
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:42,270
when prohibition came around, this
House had a pool and then it had a,

341
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,720
a Cabana and in the companion, this guy,

342
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,750
he built a bar during prohibition and he
had illegal booze or I don't know if he

343
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,950
was making beer in the bathtub, whatever
the fuck he was doing. But he used to,

344
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,340
he used to have all these famous people
come over there and they would just

345
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,770
booze it up. And, um, he,

346
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,830
anybody who came over there
and drank that was famous,

347
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:07,390
he would have them carve their
names into the bar. And, uh,

348
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,450
evidently according to my neighbor
who went and looked at the house,

349
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,850
even though he couldn't afford
it, he just wanted to see the bar.

350
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,150
He went and looked at it. And it's one
of those things, if you buy the house,

351
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:21,210
it's that bars obviously protected by
the historical society is some shit.

352
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,260
But you go in there and everyone from
like Louis Armstrong to like fucking

353
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:30,430
Humphrey Bogart have, have carved their
names into that fucking bar. So, um,

354
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,680
whatever, that's some sort of nerdy
Los Angeles. How shit. But um,

355
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,400
yeah, definitely. Uh,
rather than work today,

356
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,620
just go on Google earth and just look
at some of those fucking houses. Um,

357
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,100
or just Google, like famous Hollywood
homes too. This homes where like,

358
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,090
you know, when I was watching that, you
know, somebody up there likes me. Uh,

359
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
right. I should really know the
name of the fucking actress,

360
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,260
the one who plays Paul Newman's love
interest obviously is an absolute,

361
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,040
uh, fucking knockout. And
I had never heard of her.

362
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,920
So the fact that I never heard
of her, I'm like, ah, fuck. I,

363
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,160
I've looked up enough of
those, those old movies,

364
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:16,720
like I got this creepy thing that I always
look people up like an older person.

365
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:18,250
Like, all right, that
person's definitely dead.

366
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,350
Let's see how long that
they lived for. Right.

367
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,530
Or you try to find a cast
where like everybody's dead,

368
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,370
you know, which is a very
difficult thing to, to, so anyways,

369
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:32,710
so I started looking up, you know, the
people that were, you know, this woman,

370
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,750
I hope I say her name right. It's
p, I. E. R. Is it Pierre? Pete Pier?

371
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,140
I don't know. And Jelly. I have no idea.

372
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:43,570
I looked her up and I was
immediately going like,

373
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,210
she probably died of pills cause back
then like, I dunno, like getting,

374
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,590
giving people pills,

375
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,700
like it seems back then every guy either
died of a heart attack in his fifties

376
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,100
and sixties,

377
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,870
or he died at cancer and like 90%
of the women died of an accidental,

378
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:05,620
like barbiturate overdose because
back then, like, you know,

379
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,010
the woman came in and she had
some emotional issues, you know,

380
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,440
the doctors are like, for God's
sakes, get all to yourself.

381
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,510
And they would just give
her some pills to relax her.

382
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,440
It was like in that movie airplane where
they will just slapping you and giving

383
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,990
you a backhand and shit. So, um,

384
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,950
she was just gorgeous, amazing actress.

385
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:27,010
And then of course I looked
it up and um, you know,

386
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:31,120
she died accidentally. Um,
some people say suicide,

387
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,210
some people say accidentally
at 39 years of age.

388
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,960
And then I look it up and
sure enough, the place was,

389
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,520
she fucking overdosed is still there.

390
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,190
That's another one of those
things. It's a really fucking you,

391
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,120
I would see the coolest,

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,650
creepy, all these fucking
houses that people died in.

393
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,700
There's another actor in there. This
guy's Sal Mineo or whatever. Um,

394
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,700
I swear to God, who's a dead ringer
for Ralph Maggio. He's in it.

395
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,470
And uh, he ended it. He got
fucking stabbed to death
in like the mid Seventies.

396
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,180
It's fucking on real man. Like a lot of
people, a lot of stars back in the day.

397
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,090
They didn't make it. They
didn't fucking write it out.

398
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,250
It seemed like just crazy
shit happen to them.

399
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,490
And I guess what I'm saying is that
a lot of these houses still exist.

400
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:20,850
And if you're sort of, um, I guess
I'm becoming morbid in my older ages,

401
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,550
I realize, you know, you know what
I mean? You're your mortality.

402
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,790
You start looking how long this person
live? How do they live? How did they die?

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,990
Fuck. Is that going to happen to me? You
know, that type of ship. I don't know.

404
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,420
All right, let's, let's read the street.

year right kick off your year the right

425
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,360
way. Sorry with a fresh blade shave.

426
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,340
That's why me and millions of others
have joined the dollar Shave Club have

427
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:14,870
joined dollar shave club.com. You don't
realize about me reading out loud.

428
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,640
My fucking mouth is like of sentence
and a half where my fucking eyes are.

429
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,591
Slow it down.

430
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:26,591
Bill Dollar Shave Club knows the key
to getting an amazing shave is simple.

431
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,860
One.

432
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Use a fresh dollar shave called blade
to use that Dr Covey's easy shit.

433
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,020
That's it. Dot.

434
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:40,980
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing razors
right to my door for a third of the

435
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:44,460
price of those greedy mega corporations.

436
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,110
That means listeners who switched now
can afford the luxury of shaving with a

437
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:52,200
fresh blade anytime and
save hundreds this year.

438
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,990
And when you combine the fresh blade
with their Dr KVCC shaved butter,

439
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,670
it just glides. It's unimaginably
smooth. I'm telling you,

440
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,470
if you're not, it's not your average
shave foam. It won't dry out your skin.

441
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,170
The all natural ingredients.
Leave your skin feeling soft,

442
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:14,460
smooth and moisturized after
every shaved shape. Sorry,

443
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,110
take it from me. I'll take it
from somebody else, but whatever.

444
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,060
Don't take it. Do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

445
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,380
Use a fresh dollar shave
club blade with duck you.

446
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,720
Kathy's easy shave butter if you want
it. The most gentle shave imaginable.

447
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,980
Dollar Shave club.com/bar
today. That's dollar shave

448
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,380
club.com/burr. Um Oh by the way,

449
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm doing my first solo flight
through a bravo airspace.

450
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:45,710
So if you're still on the map, if
you're still on the Google Earth math,

451
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,860
I love looking at this shit,
right? And you go on to a,

452
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,570
you go on t. Um, what do you do?

453
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,930
Where you clicking on the
fucking globe there? All right,

454
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,740
now go over to the ocean. Okay,

455
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,750
follow Santa Monica Boulevard
over to the ocean. All right,

456
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,570
right where it says the 10.

457
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,430
Now go down a little bit and you'll
see something that kind of looks like a

458
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:18,660
tree, but it's made out of water.
That's Marina del Ray. All right.

459
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,040
Now if you're flying south,

460
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,660
that's where Bravo airspace begins along
the coastline. And when you're there,

461
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,130
you have to be at 150 feet
or below at or below one 50.

462
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,210
And then you transition
the bravo airspace.

463
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,650
If you go a little bit further
south, you'll see lax. All right.

464
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,240
And that's to the south of
it is to five, right in two,

465
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:46,650
five left and to the north there's
two five, right? Two five left,

466
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,560
those two runways. And those are
where the big boys are taken off.

467
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,620
So you fly underneath those guys
or ladies and you stay at or below,

468
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,660
um, 150 feet until you get two.

469
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:03,450
And then you got to zoom in a,

470
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,110
the Manhattan Beach Pier and, uh,

471
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,560
which is almost a beam
as they say, the, uh,

472
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,030
comedy and magic club
down in Hermosa beach. Um,

473
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,110
so you want to be, you want
to be right down there,

474
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,700
150 fucking goddamn feet.
Um, now wait a minute,

475
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,290
wouldn't it be Hermosa?
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

476
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,700
Hermosa beach pier is where the comedy
clubs that, but the Manhattan Beach Pier,

477
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,530
that's where you want to be. You got
us from, from there to Marina del Ray,

478
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,310
you're going to be at or below 150 feet.

479
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:38,460
So if you come out here and
you're on the beach as a tourist,

480
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:42,090
you see these helicopters
flying by really low. Uh,

481
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,970
they're not buzzing the beach looking
at your or whatever they are. Uh,

482
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,740
they are transitioning the bravo
airspace. So I'm going to be doing that.

483
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,010
Um, I don't know on one day,

484
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:58,390
but that's my big goal this week
with the helicopter thing there. Uh,

485
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,680
but anyways, let's get back to the,
uh, skip back to the podcast here. Um,

486
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,490
where is it? What else did
I want to talk about? Oh,

487
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,310
how about those Boston
Bruins. Now I know we lost,

488
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,260
I know we lost to a, the Redwings. I
didn't get to see the, uh, the game yet.

489
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:17,600
I have a taped, I'm a game
behind. I watched, um,

490
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,540
the f I'm actually game and two thirds
behind. I watched the first quarter of a,

491
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,620
of us beating the wild and Brad Marshawn
scored again his 12th goal in 12 games.

492
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,970
And I actually looked up the ticket and
I saw that he scored his 13th fucking

493
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:38,850
goal. And, uh, in 13 games,
the guy's on fire. And, uh,

494
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,330
I saw his goal in the, um,
the Minnesota wild game,

495
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,400
um, a shorthanded goal, just
a beautiful pass and uh,

496
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,790
and it was fucking awesome. And he's
gonna have like guys, he's on his way.

497
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,630
He's gonna have like 40
goals his fucking year. Um,

498
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,120
and I got to say just the Bruins and
the Celtics this year, both of them,

499
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:01,240
I was just going to be like, this is,
you know, after all the moves they made,

500
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,430
you know,

501
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,490
I just kind of felt that neither one was
going to be that competitive and it was

502
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,510
going to be tough to watch.
And this year, and, uh, I am,

503
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,300
I think they're both over achieved
and it's been fun to watch them,

504
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:16,540
although for some reason my fucking
recorder stopped taping the Celtics Games.

505
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:21,310
I was really getting into it
watching Isaiah Thomas and, um,

506
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,510
Crowder, uh, Jae Crowder and, uh,

507
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,120
who's the jam band guy that
finally learned his fucking name?

508
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,420
They're a Kelly Olynyk. Right.

509
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,410
I was enjoying watching it and our young
coach there who I still don't know his

510
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:38,080
fucking name cause I always taped the
games and they talked to them and I just

511
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,960
fast forward through all of that
shit. And then they just show him,

512
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,020
I think his name is Stan Steven,
something with an s Shawn, I dunno,

513
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,730
but he looks like a baby man.

514
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,580
The guy's like fucking 15 years younger
than me and he's coaching the Celtics.

515
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:55,180
He's doing a great job. And evidently we
got a couple of number one draft picks.

516
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,410
We're in a great fucking position. Um,

517
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,180
I missed the all star weekend stuff.

518
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:05,530
I saw some of the dunking
stuff and Kevin Hart,

519
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:09,220
did anybody see Kevin Hardy or he
went up against some other NBA guy.

520
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,920
I can tell, I don't watch the fucking NBA.

521
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:16,921
He went up against a
professional basketball player
and a three point contest.

522
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,050
Um, should I give you a spoiler
alert or should I do that?

523
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:27,051
The clickbait and the results will
surprise you and it gives a fuck.

524
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:31,450
He actually beat the guy.
And what I loved about it,

525
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,870
besides being a big fan of, uh,

526
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,890
his stuff and everything was when he went
to start shooting his three pointers,

527
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,980
they were playing disrespectful music
underneath them. They were playing this,

528
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,730
I'm always in this like,
oh, it's adorable. Or is it,

529
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,000
it's silly that this little man is going
to come out here and try and beat one

530
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,360
of our professional athletes and a,

531
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,180
okay.

532
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,770
They were right through the first two
racks and then he fucking close strong.

533
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,880
And I think he might've beat him on
the last ball. You got to see it, Matt.

534
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,080
I mean, it's a, it's pretty fucking
impressive. If I remember correctly,

535
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,810
in long time ago, he was telling
me that before he was a comedian,

536
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,420
he went to a a, you know,

537
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:16,650
he went to a basketball camp that had a
young unknown Coby Bryan and that type

538
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:21,600
of shit. So, um, but still, man, you
know, it was a long fucking time ago.

539
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,831
Since then,

540
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:26,780
he's gone all the way to selling out the
eagles football stadium doing standup

541
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,800
comedy. You'd think that his basketball
game would drop off a little bit,

542
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,110
that maybe he'd be a
little rusty at the y.

543
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:38,580
Forget about being able to beat a fucking
NBA player in a three point contest.

544
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,870
It was pretty, pretty God damn impressive.
Um, so anyways, let me get back.

545
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:47,330
Jesus Christ, Wyoming, Cheyenne,

546
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:51,070
Wyoming. So I go there and um, you know,

547
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,650
this was the last of
the 50 that I had to do.

548
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,550
So of course I'm reading all up on Wyoming
and all that type of stuff and I see

549
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,250
that Yellowstone park
is right in the north

550
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,610
northwest corner of it.
And I'm like, Oh fuck.

551
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:06,550
I gotta go up there and go do a gig in
the middle of nowhere at some point.

552
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,630
And uh, maybe I'll do a nice run through
Montana, Idaho and all that shit.

553
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:14,660
The Dakotas, um, you know,

554
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,140
I get into all that fucking nerdy
shit, right? So we do the Gig,

555
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,870
we have a great time. It takes some
pictures with some people afterwards.

556
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:22,520
And when I was on stage,
I was saying, hey,

557
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,300
where should we go tonight if I want
to go out and have a pot? Right.

558
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,830
So of course everybody's yelling out
everything at the same time and I can't

559
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:35,060
hear anything. So I'm like
one at a time, one at a time.

560
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:38,930
And then just in the back, this
guy yells out the gray door,

561
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,970
said to go to the green door, and then
the whole crowd just goes, ah, like,

562
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:46,700
you know, don't go there.
And I was like, I was like,

563
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,200
I didn't even need you guys to say that.

564
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:51,470
The green door just sounds like some
creepy serial killer place. So I go,

565
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:54,200
I'm not fucking going there.
So then somebody said,

566
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,110
I forget the fuck it was called
the Cadillac lounge or something.

567
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,990
I took a picture of it. So, um,

568
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,740
I, uh,

569
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,800
I decide, you know, all right,
that's where the fuck we'll go.

570
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,820
We'll go over to this thing.

571
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,750
I'm actually looking at the picture
right now on my, uh, uh, my phone here.

572
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,113
Um,

573
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,460
yeah,

574
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,900
come on. Come on. Where is
it? Where is it? There it is.

575
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,600
The Cadillac Cadillac ranch. Sorry.

576
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,340
So we go in there, you know, there's a
big American flag lit up on the side.

577
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:29,420
I'm like, all right, here we go.

578
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,910
Let's fucking go in there and
see what this place is about.

579
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,860
And we went in there and
I gotta tell you, man,

580
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:38,861
it was the most diverse group of fucking
people I've ever seen in my life.

581
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,240
And I think for the simple fact,
there was no other place to go.

582
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,650
So there was like a group
of bikers. There was,

583
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,520
there was soldiers. Um,

584
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,080
there was like ranchers,

585
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,160
there was a group of lesbians and then
it was just filler people that you

586
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:01,110
couldn't really tell what the fuck
they were. They was older, younger,

587
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:05,250
the whole fucking thing. So we're in,
they're like, wow man, this is fucking,

588
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,720
this is nuts. And then it had a
real like cowboy kind of feel to it.

589
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,440
Yet there was like a fucking DJ play
in like modern music. It was this,

590
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,911
it was fucked.

591
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,740
So we're in there and dean for whatever
fucking reason is just pointing at Shit

592
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,350
and people going, look at that
fucking guy. Look at this shit,

593
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,660
look at his fucking bar. And
I'm sitting there going, Dean,

594
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:27,450
stop pointing at Shit. Stop
Pointing Shit. You know?

595
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,480
And Dean's been sober for like 20
fucking years, so he's got no excuse.

596
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,460
He just kept pointing at Shit.
Um, and then finally, you know,

597
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,151
I had a, you know,

598
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:40,410
I was talking to a couple of the people
in there talking to this guy that was in

599
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,510
the middle of taking a
two year welding class,

600
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:46,110
which of course was really interesting
to me. I was talking to about that shit.

601
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,830
I was talking to some other people. And,
uh, then at one point somebody said,

602
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,960
hey, you wanna a whiskey. So like, um,

603
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,860
my thing now when I go on the road
and I drink, I have a beer and a,

604
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,390
and a and a whiskey or a scotch, and then
that's it. I call it a fucking night.

605
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,880
And it's been working out great
for me, you know what I mean?

606
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:03,960
So I have a nice little taste,

607
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:06,510
but then I don't get hammered and then
I'm fine the next morning and I kind of

608
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:11,130
work out and shit. Right. So, uh, this
guy offers, you know, he comes over, hey,

609
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,200
you know, I've got gotta buy a drink.
I said, well, I'm just getting a beer.

610
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:15,240
And I said, all right, well, you know,
I was going to get a whiskey too.

611
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,490
He goes, what do you want? He goes,

612
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:21,780
we got a local fucking Wyoming
whiskey. I was like, all right,

613
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,140
when in Cheyenne, let's
fucking do it right?

614
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,460
So he gets me this fucking shot and
he brings it over and it looked,

615
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,190
it was almost like see-through.

616
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,370
Now I don't know if they did
whiskey and water or what,

617
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,160
but I fucking took a sip of it
and they had no bite or anything.

618
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:40,680
I was just looking at him like, dude,
what the fuck is his? He goes, he goes,

619
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:44,070
well, it hasn't been aged at
all. I've got to tell you, dude,

620
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:47,970
it was the worst whiskey I've ever had
in my apology to the person who bought me

621
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,360
the shot. I couldn't finish
it. I looked, I said, Dina,

622
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,190
go look at this fucking thing.
And he was just like, yeah, dude,

623
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:55,890
that looks like piss. So, um,

624
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,470
and then at that point I wasn't looking,

625
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,370
but dean was saying that the bikers
people were mean mugging everybody and he

626
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:07,020
goes to, let's get the fuck outta here.
So we get outta there. And, uh, oh,

627
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:09,990
as we were driving over there, I
noticed that there was a drive,

628
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,470
there was a liquor store with a
drive through. So I was like, Oh God,

629
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:18,270
I gotta get a picture of that. So I
get pulled over, I get a picture of it.

630
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,370
And then I'm just like,
dude, I gotta do it.

631
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,020
I gotta go to a drive through liquor
store. So I fucking pull up. We actually,

632
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:29,550
I posted video of this and I just wanted
to get one beer and the guy goes, well,

633
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:31,470
I can give you like the 24 ounce.

634
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:35,950
So I got like a Budweiser and
I'll repost the video on the,

635
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
uh, the, the Monday morning
podcast, Twitter page. So I went up,

636
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,650
I ordered a fucking beer.

637
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,740
And what was really cool was it had the
old fucking remember the old air hoses

638
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,140
when you would pull up at
the, the, uh, the gas station.

639
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,100
And it would ring the bell like, Dang,
Dang is your, is your car pulled in?

640
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:54,190
It was so fucking cool. And um,

641
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,410
okay,

642
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,070
well he was sitting there and then this
dude just sort of walked into the place

643
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,540
or whatever. And as we drive out,
there's an Arby's across the street,

644
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:08,370
which I never fucking eat, you
know, fucking fast food roasts,

645
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,190
roast beef. I mean, I like to
think I'm a courageous person,

646
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:14,640
but that's just a little, that's, that
gets a little too shady for me. Right.

647
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,200
I'd rather eat the pink
slime. Um, so anyways, uh,

648
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,690
del Rey's going like, hey man, it
goes, let's hit the Arby's. I'm hungry.

649
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:28,250
So I go, all right, so we go into the
Arby's, right? He ordered some shit.

650
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,080
Then I ordered like some chicken sliders,
which I shouldn't have fucking got.

651
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:32,310
They were fucking disgusting.

652
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,360
It was like eating the heel of some
chicks fucking boot boot, you know,

653
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:41,070
just the way they were shaped like
clogs. They were just fucking gross. So,

654
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,420
um,

655
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,060
okay.

656
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,670
We go around to the drive through and
this is right across from the drive

657
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:49,030
through liquor store. And I look
across the street and I read the sign.

658
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,880
And what does it say?
It says the green door.

659
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,290
So the drive through liquor store is part
of this shady fucking teddy bar called

660
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,910
the green door.

661
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,220
That urban legend said that there was a
one legged stripper and now the younger

662
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:08,740
me would have been like, I got
to go in and go see that shit.

663
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:12,940
The older me goes like, oh my God,
that's somebody's daughter. So, um,

664
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:16,930
so technically I kinda did go to the green
door. I didn't, I didn't go in there.

665
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,830
I just fucking pulled up
or whatever. So I'll, I'll,

666
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:22,870
I'll post some pictures of that shit. Um,
let me see if I actually took him. So,

667
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,540
and then the next day we got up right.

668
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,100
And we wanted to go to some
local place to get a, uh,

669
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,250
to get breakfast. And we
went to this local place.

670
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:36,130
And I don't know if the
regular chef was out of town,

671
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,580
but I ordered eggs over easy
and I cut into them. Dude,

672
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,770
they was so under cooked,
like it came out clear,

673
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,350
like the white part of the egg
was still clear. Like, you know,

674
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,350
when those people drink like
egg whites, it was like that.

675
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,870
And so dean's eggs were
the same way and uh,

676
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,360
I just never sent food back, so I just
stirred him in with the fucking Hash.

677
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:58,571
I mean,

678
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:01,960
they should've just served the eggs in
a glass like fucking rocky Balboa and I

679
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,840
just suck it down. And I noticed
a woman diagonally from me,

680
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,580
she sent her eggs back to, and
then in the end when I went to, uh,

681
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,490
I went to pay, she was just like, how
was it? And when I said it was great,

682
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,800
I kinda stumbled on when
it was great. It was great.

683
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,070
And then she goes and that she me
looked up, she goes, is everything okay?

684
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,400
Is Everything okay? So I'm
just guessing that the,

685
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,290
the normal chef was out of town, so I'm
not gonna out. This place is being a,

686
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,860
a as being something bad. But, uh,

687
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,020
it was pretty rough. It was one of the
worst breakfasts I've ever had. But, uh,

688
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,890
when we, when we came back down,
um, we'd drive down to Denver.

689
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,410
I Lu feel like a little kid right now,

690
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:46,500
like I'm just telling you every
moment of this fucking this tour.

691
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,030
But a dean's a big motorcycle
guy, he's been Ryan for 30 years,

692
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:55,680
so they had this huge fucking Harley
Davidson dealership right on the 25 as we

693
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:58,260
would come down. So we
stopped in and I didn't know,

694
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:01,320
but Harley has a new bike that's
just right out of my childhood.

695
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,760
It's called the 72. And it's
got the big spoked front wheel.

696
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,930
It's got the handle bars. It's like
fucking Arthur fonds and rallies bike,

697
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:14,400
which obviously was fucking, uh, from
the s the, you know, the 50s or whatever.

698
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,300
But um,

699
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,940
I haven't written in like a year
and a half and uh, I dunno man,

700
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,940
I think I gotta ride that bike. I think
I'm going to rent it just one day.

701
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,710
There's a park up around where I'm at co
rented on like a Sunday and just go up

702
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,110
there in the morning time and just
fucking ride around and bring it back.

703
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:34,350
I'm too much of a pussy to ride
all the time cause a, you know,

704
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,290
I got too much to fucking lose and um,

705
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,080
okay.

706
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,830
Oh my God.

707
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,830
They had one in this black and
gold metal flake was fucking gone.

708
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,690
It's just perfect man. As
much as I loved the road king,

709
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,600
like every one to be motorcycle rider
who watched a couple episodes of a

710
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,500
whatever that fucking show was.

711
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:56,830
What was that fucking show there
that everybody watched about it?

712
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,820
About the bikes. Um,

713
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,170
okay.

714
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,100
You know like every fucking want to be
bad ass who doesn't have a tattoo and

715
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,330
it's not a motorcycle guy.

716
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,130
Like del Ray took a picture of me on
the fucking 70 to 72 and I just started

717
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:14,060
laughing. I was like, how much,
how much am I not a motorcycle guy?

718
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:18,500
Like do you realize if what a fucking
nerd you have to look like to sit on a

719
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:22,130
Harley and still look like a fucking
still look like somebody you could bully.

720
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,210
I look like every fucking just
white dude having a midlife crisis.

721
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,060
They're like, you know who watched
it? What does that fucking show?

722
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,350
What is the fucking show that was all
about the motorcycles that everybody

723
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:44,060
watched. I never got
into it. Um, goddammit,

724
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,040
it's the perfect reference for
this shit. But, um, anyways,

725
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,050
I might have to rent one coming up, uh,

726
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,840
might go ride a dirt
bike and get my fucking,

727
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,790
my skills back up to the ridiculously
low level that they were.

728
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,840
I just go to a local park out here and
I just drive this loop around and around

729
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,810
and around. It's actually
good because, uh,

730
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,100
there's a lot of downshifts
in that shit. A lot of turns.

731
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,380
You gotta look your way through all
this shit that I learned in the safety

732
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:10,041
course and everything.

733
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:14,420
But like I told you guys the one time
when I rode a motorcycle down sunset all

734
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,970
the way out to the beach, just
like I wanted to just thinking, ah,

735
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,930
this is gonna feel, you know,
freedom man America. Right.

736
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,970
And I was going to see all this
shit, dude, I didn't see shit.

737
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,170
I was fucking terrified. There
was just too many fucking people.

738
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,470
And I'm, you know, we
went later than I to go,

739
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:35,010
I rode with Dean and dean had done
spots, so he didn't get up to like 10,

740
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,540
so we didn't get on the road till like 11.

741
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,440
And I wanted to go at like seven in the
fucking morning when there was nobody on

742
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,640
the road and really just be able to
relax a little bit and not have somebody

743
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,740
right behind me. Um,

744
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,940
and I just remember getting off the bike
and I was like shaking and I was just

745
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,810
like, I had to have that fucking get
out of your ego moment and just be like,

746
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,500
Bill, this isn't in you. You
don't have this in your blood.

747
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:03,240
You're not a motorcycle fucking guy. He
just not, so don't be that shit head.

748
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,860
And, uh, I immediately sold the bike or
got rid of it, whatever the fuck I did.

749
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:12,460
I don't even remember. But, um, I don't
know. I think every once in a while, if,

750
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:15,240
you know, I smoke a couple cigars
a month, I got that under control.

751
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,460
Every once in a while I run a motorcycle
and I know everybody's going to fucking

752
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:22,450
be like, oh, [inaudible] Jewish, cause
you're going to be fucking rusty r right.

753
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,820
Taking all the fun out of
everything. Um, all right. Oh also,

754
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,360
uh, this week, um,

755
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,670
I got back into like drinking juices and
shit and there was this fucking allergy

756
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,980
shit, which was disgusting
when I drank it.

757
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,590
But I felt amazing afterwards
and I'm trying to, uh,

758
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,190
you know, like Dean said, you know,
it's a good addiction to have.

759
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,820
Like you get addicted to
shit. I realized that.

760
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:55,190
And if you're addicted to like
working out and good stuff,

761
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:57,660
that's obviously a much
better thing for you. So I'm,

762
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,430
I try to get back into that
type of stuff. But anyways, um,

763
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,380
this, uh, this past weekend, on
Saturday night when I got back,

764
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,200
I went to a, uh,

765
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,290
this music music cares event. And, um,

766
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,630
every year they honor somebody
and whoever they're honoring,

767
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:21,440
everybody comes out and I'm just,

768
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:24,210
does this person's music.
So say they wandering ACDC,

769
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:29,290
a bunch of famous fucking musicians that
are into ACDC would come out and do all

770
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:32,090
their songs and switch them up
and do different versions of them.

771
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,850
So is Lionel Richie,
right? Oh, what a feeling,

772
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,200
right? So I go to this fucking thing and

773
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,860
it was unreal. It was
like Lenny Kravis usher,

774
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:49,300
who I couldn't believe how small
he was. He fucking crushed it. Um,

775
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,810
John Legend, Stevie wonder. All right,

776
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,850
all these monsters and then Stevie wonder,

777
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,090
and I knew Dave Grohl was
going to go on and I'm,

778
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:01,010
I kind of fuck is Dave
Grohl gonna follow us?

779
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:02,540
Is he going to play drums and saying,

780
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:05,840
is he going to do the come out
with his blue guitar and sing?

781
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,320
And he just went up and just
sang a song. That was it.

782
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,180
He told this fucking
story about, you know,

783
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:14,990
when he broke his leg or he fell off
the stage where he broke his leg.

784
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,860
He was talking about all the
outpouring from the fans and all that.

785
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:23,180
And then one day he just got this
giant fucking basket of muffins.

786
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,960
The biggest basket, I guess
ever. This fucking giant thing.

787
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,000
And there was no note or anything on,

788
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:34,360
and as he's telling this story that
the band sorta just playing, you know,

789
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,320
some music underneath it and he's
telling this story and he's got people

790
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,440
laughing, but they're listening and all
that shit. And then like two days later,

791
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,000
I guess he got a, he got a,

792
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:47,920
a a call from his manager
who said, yeah, uh,

793
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:48,940
Lionel Richie,

794
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,010
Lionel Richie just called up to see
if you got the fucking giant basket of

795
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,700
muffins. And then he just
goes, uh, so I just, you know,

796
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:01,870
I forget how we fucking ended
the story. I'm butchering it now,

797
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,170
right as he ends the store and you
realize that it was Lionel Richie,

798
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:10,390
they kick into that his song, you
are a Dave Grohl just crushed it,

799
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,320
you know, let's argue you are this
something and you are the rain.

800
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,200
And he just was up there
singing it, fucking crushed.

801
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:21,100
It went on after Stevie
wonder and crushed it.

802
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,560
Um, so I, I got to, I got to do
that. You know, it was funny was, uh,

803
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:32,230
I, I went down there and, um,
you know, I'm not a suit guy,

804
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,950
but you had to wear like a shirt and
tie dude. And I swear to God, like,

805
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,890
I dunno, just like me when
I was on the motorcycle,

806
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:41,380
when I had on that suit and tie,
dude, I don't know what I was.

807
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:45,820
Sometimes I look all right. But, uh,
the thing about suits is if you, if you,

808
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,690
you got to buy them, like they
go on a style really quick.

809
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,970
And this one was like
three, four years old.

810
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,180
I just gotten a dry clean to some
show the last time I wore it.

811
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:59,140
And I put this fucking thing on. And,
uh, I was talking to Nia, I was like,

812
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,630
and I just kept going. I look like an
asshole right there. I like, she's like,

813
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:05,020
no, you look fine. I guy. Yeah, I
don't think so. I look like an asshole.

814
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:09,040
So the whole fucking night, um, you know,

815
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,930
anytime I would walk into the bathroom,
you know, it was a long fucking,

816
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:15,970
I was like a four hour fucking
thing, you know. And, uh,

817
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,940
anytime I would go in there
and I would wash my hands,

818
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,080
I would just sit there and I would
look at myself in the mirror.

819
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:24,610
I just kept laughing. What a fucking
jerk off I look like. Uh, I don't know.

820
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:28,810
It wasn't a good scene, you
know, I don't like hate myself.

821
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:32,500
It's not a good place for me to be say,

822
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,270
I think it's time to retire
that suit. Um, all right,

823
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:41,290
let's get into some of the, uh, some of
the fucking questions here for the week.

824
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,790
Um, ah, here we go. A judge Scalia,

825
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,820
bill listener from Virginia here,

826
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,300
the death of Judge Scalia brought out
some jokes on social media and a lot of

827
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:57,580
people took the angle that
they were happy that he died.

828
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,000
Now I'm assuming this is somebody on
the supreme court because I don't pay

829
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:01,750
attention to shit,

830
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,860
but I did see some stuff about this is
the first time the supreme court won't be

831
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,480
conservative. He goes,

832
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,380
what's your position on making
jokes about being happy people died.

833
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,450
Thanks for, for, for that.
Laughs. Thank you. Me.

834
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,180
Thank you. Thanks for the laughs. Um,

835
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,600
my position on making
joke about why, yeah,

836
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,950
I think you got a B. Uh,

837
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,840
I think you gotta be like a dictator
for people to do shit like that. Yeah.

838
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:37,670
I mean PR I wouldn't say don't do
it cause there's always a joke.

839
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,740
I mean, some day when I die, there's
going to be a joke. I mean, I'm,

840
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,360
I know if I'm hovering around as a
ghost, I'm going to laugh about it.

841
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,290
What the fuck do I care? I'm a ghost at
that point. Right. I didn't go to hell.

842
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,980
All right. I'm floating around. I
could deal with this. Uh, but yeah,

843
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:56,240
I don't do that. Um, well look,

844
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,130
if you just make a joke joke, that's fine,

845
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:02,660
but if you're doing it because you didn't
share like their political views, uh,

846
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,540
yeah, I'm not into doing that type
of shit. Like, you know, some,

847
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,160
some shit head. I'm going
to start doing this.

848
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,630
Like this shit had tweeted the week,

849
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,700
somebody sent me a text today telling me
that I needed to distance myself. Bill,

850
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:17,060
just to let you know, you need to
distance yourself from so and so.

851
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,040
Um,

852
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,040
and then sent me a link and this is
somebody that had been friends with for 20

853
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,011
fucking years.

854
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:30,011
And then I see this link and it has to
do with being a vegetarian or eating meat

855
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,500
and the name of the video is
so and so is an ignorant moron,

856
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,740
which right there I love,
like that's your angle,

857
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:43,700
like to get someone to listen to
your opinion. Um, right there.

858
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,080
I just look at it like this is just,

859
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:47,900
this is just somebody trying
to make a name for themselves,

860
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:52,790
trashing somebody that, that has
made a name for themselves, you know,

861
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:56,180
with some over the top
title. First of all,

862
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,120
I love is an ignorant moron.
Like that's like redundant,

863
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,880
you know, he's a stupid, not smart person.

864
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,910
I'm like,

865
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:10,870
I need to distance myself from say from
someone who's been a great friend for 20

866
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:14,950
years because of their
dietary decisions, you know,

867
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,850
because they talk about food and nutrition
in a way that's a truth that they

868
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:21,370
believe in all of this, you
know, like, and then anyone what,

869
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,030
you're a fucking genius, you know?
And it's just, you know, I don't know.

870
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,470
I don't know why people do shit like
that. So that kind of ties into,

871
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,160
and I would never, obviously,
you know, that's, I dunno,

872
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,170
I would never tweet
it. Somebody like that.

873
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,250
You need to distance yourself from this
person because I don't agree with their

874
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:42,660
workout regimen. And the same
thing with like that, like if I,

875
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,320
I wouldn't be happy that somebody died
because I didn't like their political

876
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:50,230
views, you know what I mean?
I always have that in my head.

877
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:54,280
They had somebody's dad, somebody's
husband or some shit, you know, whatever.

878
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,610
He was a gay judge. That's
somebody's boyfriend. Right.

879
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,800
I had a fucking dumb I, yeah, I don't
do shit like that, but if somebody does,

880
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:08,470
you know, I'm not the comedy
fucking police. Um, all right,

881
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,743
summer home,

882
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,940
Phil. My wife wants to own a
home by a lake in New Hampshire.

883
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,073
That's fucking awesome.

884
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,040
I'm trying to convince her that it's
cheaper to just rent a sick house every

885
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,270
summer for a couple of weeks instead of
paying 15 grand a year in taxes on top

886
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:27,120
of the mortgage. Help me sort out this
business. Please go fuck yourself. Well,

887
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:31,920
what I would say is, you know,
you can rent out your house,

888
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,610
your summerhouse, you know,
this is what I would do.

889
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,093
Okay. I would,

890
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,100
I would buy that house on the lake and
then I would just rent the whole fucking

891
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:48,710
thing out. And then
whenever I wanted to go,

892
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,730
I would rent some other
place. You know what I mean?

893
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,960
And this is how I'm weird because I
wouldn't want to go into a place that I

894
00:53:56,961 --> 00:53:59,540
owned knowing that
everybody fucked in my bed.

895
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,400
I would rather go to a place knowing
that a bunch of people fucked in somebody

896
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:05,234
else's bed.

897
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,440
It makes no sense. What you should do
is buy it and then rent it out. I mean,

898
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:16,250
buying property is always great.
However, if you're having a rough time,

899
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:19,790
like I'm a big believer in no
paying down your first house,

900
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:22,543
um,

901
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:28,100
you should really pay that thing down and
get it under control before you go and

902
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:33,210
get a summer house. And I do
know that in relationships,

903
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,650
when it comes to money,

904
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:38,730
there's usually one person understands
it and the other person doesn't

905
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:41,220
understand it and they
want everything. Yesterday,

906
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,970
and you might be a little
more conservative, which
is what you sound like. So,

907
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:51,000
um, I w you know, I would just sit
down and just say, look, first of all,

908
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,700
you're in a great position because it
doesn't sound like she can just go out and

909
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:57,180
pull the trigger herself. So I just say,
listen, I definitely want to do that,

910
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,370
but we need to, we need to pay down
this house a little bit or, you know,

911
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:03,450
if we can't afford it,

912
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,890
let's buy it and then we'll rent the
thing out all the weekends that we're not

913
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:12,810
going to be there. Um, I
think that's definitely to,

914
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:17,640
it's definitely a smart way to do
it. But, uh, I would just sit down,

915
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:19,610
okay.

916
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,610
And write out all the points that you
want to make and then draw a smiley face.

917
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,940
This is what I do when I'm being a smart
person because I know how short a fuse

918
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:33,140
I have. And, uh, I
write all this shit out,

919
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,450
everything that I want to
say and all that stuff.

920
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:40,640
And then I draw a smiley face
reminding me to not lose my temper.

921
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,670
Reminding me that other
people are entitled to have
different opinions and uh,

922
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,210
you know, and not to be a cunt.

923
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,560
I didn't do that a couple of days ago
and ended up having a big stupid fight

924
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,640
over the, the, the
bathroom sink. You know,

925
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:58,650
I'd gone on the road and it did start,

926
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:03,150
started to clog up and I didn't
have time to fucking fix it,

927
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,850
but you know, we can't drain
up. So I figured, you know,

928
00:56:06,851 --> 00:56:10,360
my wife would fucking handle it and I
come home to brush my teeth and I turn it

929
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:14,440
on and within fucking two seconds
it's already filling up as a puddle.

930
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:15,700
It's completely backed up

931
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,640
and you know,

932
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,140
it's usual shit, usual shit in a
relationship. You say to somebody else,

933
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:26,200
did you notice? No. You had noticed
and in your head you're like,

934
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,350
how the fuck did you not notice this shit?

935
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,520
But what I learned in that argument is
I have to understand that this shit that

936
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:36,940
she's looking at me at
looking at me at about like,

937
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,590
how the fuck do you not
notice it? And it's just,

938
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,050
cause I'm just not wired like that.
And that's why you get married.

939
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,280
Hopefully you're a yin and a Yang. I
finally set him right. I didn't say it,

940
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,420
Yang and Yang. I said, [inaudible] why I,

941
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:53,220
and I think this the first time publicly
I've ever said it right. Um, yeah,

942
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,770
they're going to be good at this
shit that you're not good at. And um,

943
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,680
actually had a great
day with Nia yesterday.

944
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:03,681
Like I didn't do shit for once and
we just hung out all day and um,

945
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,930
you know, we watched some movies and shit.

946
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,590
You made a little bit of food
and I always forget that,

947
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:11,820
that every once in a while you guys,

948
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,940
you gotta hang out with each other rather
than just being roommates to remind

949
00:57:16,951 --> 00:57:21,810
yourself like, oh yeah, that's right.
We actually really love each other.

950
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,640
I forgot about that shit and I don't,

951
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:28,410
the amount of times I've had to fucking
learn that, you know, she get married,

952
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,630
you really start doing the
math. Like, dude, fuck do shit.

953
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,340
I don't need anything. I will
literally give her everything.

954
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:42,740
I will fucking just give you fucking
everything and I will walk out with the

955
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:45,710
shirt on my fucking back and
I will start all over again.

956
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,450
Like I think that that's
the way to fucking do it and
just walk down the street

957
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:54,550
after it like Johnny
fucking apple seed. And um,

958
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,970
because I really think you just get
into having all of this fucking stuff,

959
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:01,520
but if you just let go of all
of it, then you don't have it.

960
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:04,130
I think getting divorced could
be a really light feeling.

961
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,980
This is how far I went over and argument
over a clogged up sink before he came

962
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:12,610
to my census. I was walking down
the street with the, with the stick,

963
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:15,310
with the Bandana and a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich in it.

964
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,030
Then I was just finally like,

965
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:21,840
what am I doing? You know,
stop being a fucking idiot.

966
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,960
All right, let's get to some advertising
here. All right, me undies, everybody.

967
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,770
Oh Gee, I got to sing this quietly because
we have company over here right now.

968
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:34,110
Podo poop. Poop me and eat me
undies. No more sweaty nuts.

969
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:34,731
Badu do.

970
00:58:34,731 --> 00:58:39,731
Do me on these BMDS keep a dry with
your butts when that doesn't make sense.

971
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,860
Ah, I said nuts. I was thinking bus
would rhyme. I, you know what I, I've,

972
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,160
I've got to retire this fucking
song and he's a new fucking,

973
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:51,570
I need some new bits on this goddamn
thing. All right. Mandy's all right.

974
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:54,600
This year don't be predictable and show
up at your Valentine's Day dinner with

975
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:59,580
some last minute box of chocolate or
bouquet of roses. Bouquet bouquet.

976
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:04,380
I don't want to say that are going to
die in a week anyways. Uh, give the gift.

977
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:05,760
Everyone's talking about me.

978
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,110
Young Ds me on days
taking care of your taint.

979
00:59:10,111 --> 00:59:13,650
Poodoo to do [inaudible] me on these.

980
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,750
Your balls will say your a
saint. Uh, show your special day.

981
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:21,270
That fucking guy up there
either. Can you shake

982
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,480
[inaudible] is dry over.

983
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,060
Show your special someone just how
much she care with the present.

984
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,940
You're both love. A gift that
looks great and feels great.

985
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:35,270
Something that says you deserve the
best. I have to tell you right now, you,

986
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:39,650
if you give somebody underwear for
a gift, you better be fucking them.

987
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,730
Are they better be your kid? Cause
other than that, it's fucking weird. Uh,

988
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:46,400
you know, give you kid underwear.
You know, you're, there you go.

989
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,230
Jesus Christ straighten up and fly. Right.

990
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,533
You know,

991
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,780
I have a little respect for yourself,
you know, and then if you, you know,

992
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:55,870
you're with the person intimately,
you can give it to them, you know,

993
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,680
there's no fucking way actually
is a joke. You can do that.

994
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,433
You know,

995
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:00,951
you know,

996
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,650
I was actually thinking the other day
when I went to buy my wife a Valentine's

997
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:05,090
Day card, you know,

998
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,990
I was looking for the blank ones cause I
hate the fucking Valentine's Day cards.

999
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:09,201
You know,

1000
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:13,880
they're either over the top gross or
they're just fucking like too distant.

1001
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,650
You know, it's very hard to find that one.

1002
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,800
That's the nice balance of I love
you, but let's not be gross. Um,

1003
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,990
so I was looking for the blank ones and
I came to the sympathy cards and, uh,

1004
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,330
I just was thinking like, you know what,

1005
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,440
I really want to stand up with Joe de
Rosa again and then send him a sympathy

1006
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:33,110
card afterwards. You know,

1007
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,140
telling them I hope he feels better and
everything and just basically, right.

1008
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:38,960
Joe, I saw your set last night. I know
you're going through a rough time.

1009
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,793
Okay.

1010
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,000
I don't Dunno. It was funny to me.
Anyways, let's get back to the,

1011
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,800
he's saying treat yourself and your
boo to a matching pair of me on these.

1012
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,610
The most world's most comfortable
underwear. Uh, this company,

1013

this underwear is
comfrey is it gets me on.

1014
01:00:56,971 --> 01:01:01,560
These are made of micro
modal, modal fabric,

1015
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:05,460
meaning they're twice as soft as
cotton and they don't just feel great.

1016
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,510
They look great to me.

1049

Everybody a Billie bubbles,
barely bubbles in the rain.

1050
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,940
Um, I went to high school with
a guy who picks up my trash.

1051
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,600
I get along with them and I always
wave and sometimes if he's not rushing,

1052
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,610
I'll have a short conversation with them.

1053
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,100
Last week I saw my neighbor
yell at him. He wasn't a,

1054
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,590
he wasn't a jerk back, but
he wasn't a dick either.

1055
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,790
What? He wasn't a jerk back, but he
wasn't a dick either. Later on that day,

1056
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:31,350
my neighbor came over and asked me if
I'd make a statement about the issue that

1057
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:35,490
he harassed her. I saw the whole
thing go down. He didn't harass her.

1058
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,650
She yelled at him for coming a day late
during a week when a holiday pushed

1059
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:45,570
everything back a day in terms of
sanitation pickup. Uh, what a comment.

1060
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,090
She said that even without my statement,

1061
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,400
she's going to press charges
and file a complaint.

1062
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,330
I'm going to call the town or police
and let them know what's going on.

1063
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,480
I'm so livid that she would ruin
this guy's life. He's a great dude.

1064
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:00,510
Thoughts on how he should handle
this? Should I report her for lying?

1065
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,860
APP's a fucking lately and I would take
time off from work to testify that she's

1066
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:10,470
Elian Whore App's a fucking Luli.
Who the fuck yells at a trash man?

1067
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:16,530
The service that they're providing. Fuck
her. Fuck her. Do you know something?

1068
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,020
I would 100% do it and I would,

1069
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,320
I would even fucking tell her that
you're going to do it at some point.

1070
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:25,500
Not Not in the beginning because
you don't want to. We can his case,

1071
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:29,130
but I would do it without a doubt. And
when the whole fucking thing goes away,

1072
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,730
I would let her know that you did that
and I would let her know what a small

1073
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:36,570
person you think she is and that she's
disgusting and to stay away from you and

1074
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,560
anybody else that you love
because she subhuman there.

1075
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:45,780
I was at the limit dilemma, Dear Bill. Oh,

1076
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,950
what a fucking whore. He came in
day late and then you harassed me.

1077
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,710
Gee, you know what? You know
what she I, you know what?

1078
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,140
I bet she does for a living.
She sounds like a blogger,

1079
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:59,790
always playing the fucking victim and
always going down and just trying to get

1080
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:04,140
somebody in trouble and try and fuck
over their, their ability, you know,

1081
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:08,840
to earn a living. What a
fucking Twat. Alright, dear.

1082
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,750
Would you rather have to live
in an air balloon for a month?

1083
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:14,820
Never having set down or would you

1084
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,580
rather live in a submarine? Never
breathing the surface for a whole month.

1085
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,040
Both scare the shit out
of me for a whole month,

1086
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:28,390
but I think I choose to submarine
seems more natural. Yeah.

1087
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:32,470
And there's also a bathroom. I wouldn't
want to have to shit on people.

1088
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:38,560
And P why would obviously wait
until I was over a, a rural area.

1089
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:40,933
Okay.

1090
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:45,050
Yeah. Plus you, you'd be inside, you'd
have a bed p when you're in the summary,

1091
01:05:45,051 --> 01:05:47,450
you have a blanket, you know,

1092
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,440
you get to be down there
with all the fellow of, Hey,

1093
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,300
I'm no man. I mean,

1094
01:05:57,301 --> 01:06:00,840
I think it would be cool to fucking look
out the window and see all the fucking,

1095
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:06,510
uh, the sea life and all that shit. I
would go fucking nuts down there. But,

1096
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,340
um, I don't know.

1097
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:14,170
Fucking up there in an air
balloon gets cold or hot.

1098
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,810
You're really dealing with the fucking
elements when you're up there and starts

1099
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,840
fucking raining. Um,

1100
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:25,910
yeah, I dunno. I W I would be a, I
would get over that really quickly,

1101
01:06:25,911 --> 01:06:30,200
but I think being in a sub, you know,
you're down there, you could flake cards,

1102
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:35,120
you could fucking break each other's
balls or whatever. I Dunno. Yeah,

1103
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:38,690
I definitely would take out
a much rather do a sub. Um,

1104
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:42,200
and if I had to die the way,
I'd rather die in a sub.

1105
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,410
I'd rather have it just fucking, you
know, if you're going to die in the sub,

1106
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:49,370
it's going to be quick.
You know, it's just over,

1107
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,630
right? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.

1108
01:06:53,631 --> 01:06:56,540
I don't know if sometimes maybe it might
not be quick. They close that door.

1109
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah. Those are two terrifying
things I got to go with you.

1110
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,910
Gotta go with you on that. Um,

1111
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,773
yeah.

1112
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,580
All right. Dilemma Billy bully. Uh,

1113
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,620
if you had to choose which holiday to
get canceled and never celebrate again,

1114
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,590
would you choose Valentine's
Day of President's Day?

1115
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,570
Who deserves more recognition,

1116
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:20,670
your girl for doing what you do all year
without a holiday. That's hilarious.

1117
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:24,300
Yeah. We don't get a holiday.
Um, no, maybe I read that wrong.

1118
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:28,860
Or presidents who may or may not be
horrible people who hurt the country.

1119
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,230
I canceled president's Day because
I'd rather keep the one that involved

1120
01:07:33,231 --> 01:07:36,010
chocolate being around. Oh,
that's a good reason for it. Um,

1121
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,230
if I had to get rid of one,

1122
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,100
I don't think anybody really
celebrates president's Day.

1123
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:43,950
I don't really consider it a day
off. It's kind of like flag day,

1124
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,660
you know what I mean?

1125
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,670
Or a buttermilk pancakes day isn't
there one of those fucking days to um,

1126
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,460
Jesus, do you want me to cancel a holiday?

1127
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:59,900
Uh, I wouldn't cancel Valentine's
Day just cause women like it so much.

1128
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:03,250
Believe it or not, I am a consequent.
I'm not that fucking bad. So I,

1129
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:06,800
I'd keep that one. Yeah. You
know what? Fuck President's Day.

1130
01:08:06,801 --> 01:08:08,810
All those guys have
bought and sold anyways.

1131
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,630
You've seen it with Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

1132
01:08:11,631 --> 01:08:15,680
You've seen how the Democrats had just
going to pick her because going to play

1133
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,514
ball,

1134
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:19,970
they are all tied into
the fucking, the fucking,

1135
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:24,490
I dunno what you want to call it. Did she?

1136
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,890
She that Bernie Sanders
is too fucking radical.

1137
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:29,740
He's going to switch shit up too much
and then they're not going to work with

1138
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:32,020
them. Even if Bernie Sanders
gets fucking elected,

1139
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:32,860
they're not gonna work with them.

1140
01:08:32,861 --> 01:08:35,590
They're going to show their fucking
true colors. They're a bunch of that.

1141
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:39,060
Just a bunch of, they're all bought
and paid for it. They thought, well,

1142
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:43,600
how the fuck do that? Clinton's got $3
million to throw their kid a wedding.

1143
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,840
You know what I mean? Let
me have fucking break.

1144
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,350
Because you went out and you gave
speeches to all the people that fucking

1145
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,450
financed your campaign and then you
hooked him up and look the other fucking

1146
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:58,350
way. I swear to God, I swear to God.

1147
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,110
Do you want to how the
fucking pharmaceutical
companies and the people who

1148
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,930
fucked up the food supplier able
to do it and there's nothing,

1149
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,540
there's nothing behind it. It's cause
they fucking paid everybody off.

1150
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,880
I swear to God. All right,
I'm on my stuff on my I,

1151
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,990
this is why I always vote for that
third party guy. And everybody goes, Oh,

1152
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:15,930
you throw it away. You fucking vote.
How is throwing away my fucking vote?

1153
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,530
Voting for somebody who's a decent fucking
human being? I sweat it. Got People,

1154
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:22,650
they don't want to try to do what's
right. They just want to win.

1155
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:26,660
They want to be like,
oh my God. One again.

1156
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,870
See that every time I sit there and I
trashed people for fucking given their

1157
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:35,630
public opinion, then look and make
the gummy. I do the exact same thing.

1158
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:40,490
I am what's known as a hypocrite.
The HIPAA count. Um, all right,

1159
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:44,270
that's the a, the podcast
for this week. Um,

1160
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:46,760
I wanna thank everybody that
came out. Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1161
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,430
I know there was last second,
but uh, I had a great time.

1162
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:54,290
Had a great time in your,
uh, your state capitol. Um,

1163
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,820
Joe was just a really, really cool fucking
town and I had a great time in the,

1164
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,240
uh, Cadillac ranch there.
That sounds, I swear to God,

1165
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,750
like the fucking bunny ranch. It
sounds like a fucking whorehouse,

1166
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,110
but it wasn't. Um,

1167
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,260
it was cool talking to the people there
and thank you to everybody, you know,

1168
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,740
that bought me a beer and a shot and
all that shit. Thank everybody Denver,

1169
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:17,180
by the way, which was just
a fucking insane show.

1170
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,830
Um, that was another special one. Just
cause I've done so many fucking gigs.

1171
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,190
Yeah. Colorado in the middle of nowhere.

1172
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:27,220
I always bring up Arapaho community
college. I'll never forget that.

1173
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,080
Nooner where they had me standing in
an area where three hallways met right

1174
01:10:32,081 --> 01:10:34,480
before class ended. That
was a fucking nightmare.

1175
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,620
Next to a popcorn machine and five
people scattered out about 40 chairs,

1176
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,180
empty chairs. There's, um, anyways,

1177
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,090
that's the podcast for this week. Uh,

1178
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,880
I'm going to try to watch some Celtics
and get caught up on the Bruins games,

1179
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,220
um, and keep drinking my juice.
All right. Go Fuck Yourself.

1180
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,560
I'll talk to you later on this week.
