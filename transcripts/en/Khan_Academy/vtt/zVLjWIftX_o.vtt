00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:03.821
I have two green balls
and three purple balls

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:07.274
so how many balls
do I have altogether?

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:12.754
So two green balls
and three purple balls

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:19.068
is going to be 5 balls altogether.

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:24.328
We can count them; 
one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.864
Now what if we did something
a little different?

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:34.994
Let's start with the five balls,
and let's take away two.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:41.984
Let's subtract two of these balls.

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:47.643
Take away one and two,
and what are we left with?

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:52.892
We are left with
one, two, three balls.

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:56.883
We're left with three balls.

00:00:56.883 --> 00:01:00.883
You might see a pattern here;
two plus three is equal to five

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:04.883
but if you start with five
and take away two,

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.753
you're going to be left with three.

00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:10.073
Look how they're arranged.

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:15.473
Two plus three is equal to five
and five minus two is three.

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:18.351
It works the other way around.

00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:24.381
If I start with five
and I were to take away three,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:29.172
if I subtract one, two, three,
what am I left with?

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:33.868
I'm left with one, two,
I'm left with two.

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:38.720
So two plus three is five,
three plus two is five,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.720
which is another way of saying
that five minus two is three,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.060
or five minus three is two.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.550
Take a look at this,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.534
it's a really important 
idea to understand in math.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:58.909
If you add two numbers
and you get another number,

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:02.053
then you take the result
and subtract one of these

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.010
you're going to get the other number.
