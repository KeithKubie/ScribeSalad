outgoing and curious about everything
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.490
outgoing and curious about everything
and especially about he went to West

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
and especially about he went to West
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.550
and especially about he went to West
Point which is our military academy and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
Point which is our military academy and
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.070
Point which is our military academy and
that's kind of like a technical

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
that's kind of like a technical
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.509
that's kind of like a technical
education it's like an engineering

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519
education it's like an engineering
 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.940
education it's like an engineering
education and so he was particularly

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
education and so he was particularly
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.290
education and so he was particularly
interested in science engineering things

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
interested in science engineering things
 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.720
interested in science engineering things
like that so I I think that that was

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
like that so I I think that that was
 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.750
like that so I I think that that was
very influential in in my upbringing as

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
very influential in in my upbringing as
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.229
very influential in in my upbringing as
far my science upbringing and being

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
far my science upbringing and being
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.220
far my science upbringing and being
something that really encouraged that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
something that really encouraged that
 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.210
something that really encouraged that
kind of of curiosity and interest in and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
kind of of curiosity and interest in and
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.160
kind of of curiosity and interest in and
how the world works like how things work

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
how the world works like how things work
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.979
how the world works like how things work
that that was that was one of his big

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989
that that was that was one of his big
 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140
that that was that was one of his big
things he would understand how you know

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
things he would understand how you know
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.620
things he would understand how you know
gadgets worked and I think I inherited

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
gadgets worked and I think I inherited
 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.910
gadgets worked and I think I inherited
or not genetically but I I was

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920
or not genetically but I I was
 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800
or not genetically but I I was
encouraged to have that that kind of

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
encouraged to have that that kind of
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.330
encouraged to have that that kind of
habit of mine when when from my father

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340
habit of mine when when from my father
 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.509
habit of mine when when from my father
so that was certainly a big part also my

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
so that was certainly a big part also my
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.400
so that was certainly a big part also my
father was in the army

father was in the army
and in my as I became politically active

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
and in my as I became politically active
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.009
and in my as I became politically active
or politically aware in the 1960s the

family turned against the war in Vietnam
 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.260
family turned against the war in Vietnam
and this is a very I think perhaps

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
and this is a very I think perhaps
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.379
and this is a very I think perhaps
unusual upbringing and in the army so

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389
unusual upbringing and in the army so

in in science so how about me my a good

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200
in in science so how about me my a good
 

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.190
in in science so how about me my a good
role model well you know I said that I

the attitude of being skeptical about

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
the attitude of being skeptical about
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.940
the attitude of being skeptical about
everything so I think everyone should be

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:50.950
everything so I think everyone should be
 

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.730
everything so I think everyone should be
skeptical about his or her own behavior

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:53.740
skeptical about his or her own behavior
 

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.130

one of the plunders of people that was
 

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.630
one of the plunders of people that was
on the radar of the chemistry committee

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640
on the radar of the chemistry committee
 

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.900
on the radar of the chemistry committee
and that's because I was invited to a

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:43.910
and that's because I was invited to a
 

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.310
and that's because I was invited to a
conference and the hundredth year

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320
conference and the hundredth year
 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.440
conference and the hundredth year
anniversary of the chemistry prize in

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.450
anniversary of the chemistry prize in
 

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.310
anniversary of the chemistry prize in
2001 to a conference in honor of that

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320
2001 to a conference in honor of that
 

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.900
2001 to a conference in honor of that
anniversary they were just very few

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
anniversary they were just very few
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.060
anniversary they were just very few
participants in the conference maybe 20

00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.070
participants in the conference maybe 20
 

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.500

what the ceremony is going to be like

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.410
what the ceremony is going to be like
 

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.140

although not from the point of view and

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.150
although not from the point of view and
 

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.160
although not from the point of view and
act of an actual laureate but that also

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.170
act of an actual laureate but that also
 

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.070
act of an actual laureate but that also
alerted me that it was pretty likely

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.080
alerted me that it was pretty likely
 

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.310
alerted me that it was pretty likely
that I was on the

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320
that I was on the
 

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.829
that I was on the
radar of the chemistry committee so it

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839
radar of the chemistry committee so it
 

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.240
radar of the chemistry committee so it
did come as a surprise 17 years later

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.250
did come as a surprise 17 years later
 

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.350
did come as a surprise 17 years later
because I thought the time had long

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
because I thought the time had long
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.280
because I thought the time had long
since passed so it wasn't an you know a

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.290
since passed so it wasn't an you know a
 

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.639
since passed so it wasn't an you know a
bolt out of the blue but it was a big

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:42.649
bolt out of the blue but it was a big
 

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:46.059
bolt out of the blue but it was a big
surprise because I had long since

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:46.069
surprise because I had long since
 

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:48.730

to be a prize winner when you're retired

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:57.390
to be a prize winner when you're retired
 

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.350
to be a prize winner when you're retired
because I retired from my university

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360
because I retired from my university
 

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.070
because I retired from my university
three years ago and I'm not doing much

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.080
three years ago and I'm not doing much
 

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.020
three years ago and I'm not doing much
science anymore

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.030
science anymore
 

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.890
science anymore
so it is it is something to look back

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:09.900
so it is it is something to look back
 

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.990

taking it I'm accepting the prize as a
 

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.600
taking it I'm accepting the prize as a
representative the science community

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:29.610
representative the science community
 

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.560

that I that I belong to because many

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.570
that I that I belong to because many
 

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.490

was even more pleasure than I do and I

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.690
was even more pleasure than I do and I
 

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.620
was even more pleasure than I do and I
should add that this is the first Nobel

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:57.630
should add that this is the first Nobel
 

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.660

education is what do we teach our young

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:47.860
education is what do we teach our young
 

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.670
education is what do we teach our young
people to try to ensure as well as we

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680
people to try to ensure as well as we

can that they could be successful in
science afterwards so do we teach them

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440
science afterwards so do we teach them
 

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.460
science afterwards so do we teach them
the specific technical skills that we

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:02.470
the specific technical skills that we
 

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:07.800
the specific technical skills that we
ourselves depended on that's a that's a

question that teachers often have have

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800
question that teachers often have have
 

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.120
question that teachers often have have
to have to grapple with and they're two

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.130
to have to grapple with and they're two
 

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.130
to have to grapple with and they're two
sides of that one thing is I think that

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.140
sides of that one thing is I think that
 

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.820
sides of that one thing is I think that
students really need to understand

students really need to understand
 

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.280
students really need to understand
specifically and concretely

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.290
specifically and concretely
 

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:28.580
specifically and concretely
what what physical things support our

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:28.590
what what physical things support our
 

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.110
what what physical things support our
theories about nature what results

theories about nature what results
 

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.990

what's what concrete results are behind

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000
what's what concrete results are behind
 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.360

what we think of as our knowledge about
 

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.180
what we think of as our knowledge about
nature so we probably the students

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:42.190
nature so we probably the students
 

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.840
nature so we probably the students
really should learn about the some of

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.490
through enormous and enormous
collections of structures for very rare

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:21.500
collections of structures for very rare
 

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.970
collections of structures for very rare
structures that have a desired activity

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:24.980
structures that have a desired activity
 

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.309
structures that have a desired activity
