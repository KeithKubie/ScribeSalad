00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Why have we spending so much time on 3-SAT in this unit instead of our usual problems,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.970
vertex cover, clique, independent set, and shortest tour?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.550
The thing is, there are very little know results for randomized algorithms for these problems here.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.210
Of course, there are still many randomized algorithms for these problems here

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.680
especially for shortest tour, some also for clique and independent set,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.580
but these are all algorithms where you don't know any guarantees.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.610
You don't know if the algorithm will perform well or if it will produce a very suboptimal solution,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.420
which of course leads to a question where you could ask,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.550
well, in what cases might it be okay to use an algorithm that is randomized

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.410
and does not offer any guarantees?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.260
And of course, I'll let you think about that.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.330
Would it make sense to solve a problem with a randomized algorithm

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.910
where you don't have any guarantees if the stakes are low?

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.210
If no better algorithms are available, so the deterministic algorithms have failed

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
and there's no randomized algorithm known with a guarantee,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
is it when you can think of any better algorithm, or is it when nobody you know

00:01:01.260 --> 99:59:59.000
including yourself knows any better algorithm than a randomized algorithm without guarantees?
