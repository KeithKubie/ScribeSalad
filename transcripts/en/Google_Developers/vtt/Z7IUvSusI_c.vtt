00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.960
I was notoriously bad with technology.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440
One day I felt I should challenge myself.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.600
What if I study computer science?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.240
I have become a facilitator
for four periods.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.520
We enjoy sharing with fellow women.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.800
My name is Vitalia Eka Wardhani.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160
I am 18 years old.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.920
The mindset of my family is:

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.960
you don't need to pursue higher education

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.280
because Indonesian women on average

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.520
have to get married after graduating from school.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.240
Many women in the world have progressed.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560
So, I thought: "If they can do it..."

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.360
"why can't I?"

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.280
Many girls want to be a developer.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.200
They often approach me and say,
"Hey I have an idea!"

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
So I invite them to join us

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.120
so they can learn how to
make their own app.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.440
I found this class through
friends on social media.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.600
It's pretty difficult.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.480
I want to know more
about Android Studio

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.720
because we don't learn much
about it in campus.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.360
After I finish studying I plan

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.640
to share what I've learned from this study group.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.520
Many cities in Indonesia have been left behind,
and I want to teach in these areas.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200
Please come in.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.560
Whether it's here at campus

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.680
or in Indonesia Android Kejar.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.840
I'm really happy I can share with fellow friends.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.360
Like that.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720
For women in Indonesia

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.880
my advice is:

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.520
don't be afraid to chase your dream.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.920
If other people can do it,
then why can't you?
