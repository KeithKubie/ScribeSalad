limited not by the technology but by

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
limited not by the technology but by
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.679
limited not by the technology but by
things like standards and by accounting

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
things like standards and by accounting
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.899
things like standards and by accounting
for life cycle costs and so that's where

for life cycle costs and so that's where
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.130

we ended with some of the policy

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
we ended with some of the policy
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710
