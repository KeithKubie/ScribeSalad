00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.090
There are a number of different reasons why values

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.660
may be missing from your data. But here are a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.560
couple that I think are particularly common or important.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.540
So, the first is that occasional system errors may prevent

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.980
data from being recorded. Another reason that data may

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.430
be missing, is that some sub set of subjects or

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.820
event types are systematically missing certain data attributes. Or maybe

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.260
missing entirely. Let's dive deeper into both of these reasons.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.480
One explanation for missing data is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.480
that something may be failing occasionally when

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.050
collecting data. For example, if you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.790
were conducting a traditional door-to-door survey, maybe

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.270
the person handling the documents loses a few or tends to miss some

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.180
streets at random because they don't know the geography of the town well.
