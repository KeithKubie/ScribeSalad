1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,880
So what would you think about if they
abandoned weight cutting [inaudible] they

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,430
just opened up more weight classes
and abandoned weight cutting.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,320
I mean I wouldn't mind it. I
would, I would like to see that.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,910
Don't think it'd be
better for the fighters.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,210
I think it'd be better for the fighters
and [inaudible] really cool matchups

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,110
yeah.
You know what I mean?

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,570
Cause there's some guys that cut a lot
of weight and there's some match ups that

9
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,490
would be really cool at
different weights too.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,330
I think it's one of those dumb things
that's existed in the past and we never

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,300
corrected. Yeah. I think,
I think we should stop it.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,590
It's not helping anybody to lose weight
for a fight so that you can be fit and

13
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,860
in great shape. Yeah. F okay,
sure. But how do you go about that?

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,710
But I mean losing weight,
like losing weight and training,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,900
not like massive dehydration.
Yeah.

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,700
For weight cut day and then rehydration
the next day for fight day. I think it's,

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,220
it's a crazy strain that guys are doing
to their kidneys and their bodies.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,840
I mean many fighters have told me that
they don't feel like they can take a body

19
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,610
shot as well when they cut a lot of
weight like that. Sometimes the your head,

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,440
my head, I remember on the Johnny
Walker fight, I'd cut, excuse me,

21
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,870
it could have been from the Weight Cup,
but that morning,

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,820
like if I've been tapped on my jaw,

23
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,760
I just felt like my head was just like
off like rally, you know, like yeah,

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,620
it felt very sensitive and he does from
the weight and the same night I get

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,540
knocked out.
I don't know what it was from,

26
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,680
but I remember feeling that morning
when I woke up. Cause usually I like,

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,220
I'll shake everything off. I'll like, you
know, like punching myself in the jaw,

28
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,290
all that stuff just to
get ready for the fight.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,920
And I remember that that morning when
I was like tapping myself on the jaw,

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,270
my head just didn't feel right.
Dude. That's not a good feeling. No.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,360
But I gotta checked after I didn't
have any like concussion or anything.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,230
Did you have some particularly
hard sparring session or
something close to that?

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,420
Uh, I don't think close to
it during that camp. Uh,

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,190
like I said, I didn't feel it all the
way until I didn't have it. The only,

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,400
the only time I ever felt it
was like after the weight cut.

36
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,500
So it could have been
from that. Right. Yeah.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,760
And I think that morning I actually ended
up cutting the last little bit of my

38
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:09,240
weight, the morning of weigh ins
too, which is not usually like me.

39
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,500
I'll usually cut it the night before.

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,530
So you said you like to start
your day off with a run. Um,

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,990
are you doing that every
day? Yeah, definitely.

42
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,250
So that's one thing that I learned too
is just training every day. Not Learn,

43
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,900
but it just feels different.

44
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,560
Now I have to go and train every
day when I was in Vegas, like, ah,

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,380
I've got to drive 30 minutes,
you know, all of these things.

46
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,570
I had a lot of excuses to make up.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,660
And now with the convenience
of how training is now,

48
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,920
I don't even make up excuses. I'm like, if
I'm tired, I still, it's two minute walk,

49
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,220
get your ass to the gym. You
know, and so yeah, every,

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,070
every single day training and
then weekends off for sure.

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,570
So you're running every single day,

52
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,600
then you're training every single day
before Moitai it's mandatory. You run.

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,380
But like the train, train, train and
real, she ruined first. You show up,

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,040
you run the day. The first
day I showed up, uh, at,

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,740
at Tiger's Moitai class, I
didn't even, tennis shoes.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,960
I just showed up with my flip flops
because I was staying right across the

57
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,770
street and I showed up. I start wrapping
my hands in the trainer. He's like,

58
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,550
are you going to train? And I was like,
yeah, I think so. He's like, you think so?

59
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:13,300
We'll go run. And I was like, I don't
have shoes. Only had my flip flops.

60
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,560
And he's like just pointed like so go run.
And I had to run like,

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,400
I think it was like eight kilometers in,
in flip flops before I even trained.

62
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,250
Yeah, that's like four
miles. Yeah, somewhere around
there. Five and a half. Yeah.

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,710
It's like four, like four miles, something
like that. We just had to run, run, run,

64
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,190
run, run, run. I asked the girls
like, how long do we run? Four.

65
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,050
She's like usually like five to six
kilometers or something like that. Yeah,

66
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,240
it was like five ks. Like
three and a half months. Yeah,

67
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,930
I'd say like just cutting
it short. Five K. Wow.

68
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,170
And then in flip flops and I was
like, okay, cool. Yeah, I never,

69
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,440
I never forgot my shoes again. I would
always show up at that. Fuck your feet up.

70
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,680
It wasn't too bad actually now because
I wasn't wearing shoes a lot anyway.

71
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,210
Oh yes.
Thailand.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,030
Sometimes you had to take off your
shoes before you enter the store. So,

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,930
so they're,

74
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,490
they're hard assed in their discipline
with the wanting you just serious about

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,470
very serious. Yeah. They're just serious
about it. They're like, show respect,

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
you know?
And when you're running,

77
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,090
you're running with a group of
guys or everybody, guys, girls,

78
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,890
whoever shows up to class. But is it
is like, okay, so when they're running,

79
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,580
are they running, like organize
like in a group or are they just,

80
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,540
is everybody running a few miles
before class? Every time. The first,

81
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,320
the first Muay Thai gym that I trained
at the straight Moitai Jim in Bangkok,

82
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,750
they run as a unit every
day 5:00 AM. Wow. As a team.

83
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,420
They live at the gym, they eat at
the gym, they sleep in the gym.

84
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,800
They are like,
they don't have homes there.

85
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:40,570
Home is the gym and their job
is just fight and eat, sleep,
train, fight. That's it.

86
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,390
It's crazy when they even take on the
name of the gym. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
And that's a whole different life.

88
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,630
Like that is what made me respect and
learn and love Moitai so much as how these

89
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,790
guys trained in just they live
together, everything. It was amazing.

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,070
So they run as a group,
but the other like the other place,

91
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,170
we all start off,
but if you,

92
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,790
if someone's laughing you and they
just want to run fast, like it's,

93
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,830
it's totally fine. But before the
class everybody has to go. Yeah. Wow.

94
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,300
That's a smart way to do it,
man.

95
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,770
I mean if you could really convince
them to be conditioned all the time and

96
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,810
there's no like you have no option.

97
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,660
You can't be out of condition if you're
going to run five miles every day,

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,450
no five miles. And then hitting, kicking,

99
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,650
hitting and kicking pads for five to 10
rounds a day, clinching 45 minutes a day,

100
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,980
like clenching at after every session.

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,900
It's like you run knee bag, sit
ups, all that stuff. Second,

102
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,970
second session is,
um,

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,980
kick the bag three to five rounds until
a trainer picks you up. Like for me,

104
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,480
I had to wait for a trainer to actually
even like want to hold pads for me.

105
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,010
If you just show up, you'll
just be hitting the bag
until the trainer was like,

106
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,600
Hey, okay, I'll hold for you.

107
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,590
And then once you actually find a
trainer that wants to work with you,

108
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,360
then you kind of,

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,920
whatever their schedule is for you that
they'll create it though you'll hold the

110
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,580
whole pads, you'll kick
the bag, you'll do pushups,

111
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,700
he'll do sit ups and then clinch 30 to
45 minutes after and it's the same thing

112
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,100
every single day.
Wow.

113
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,480
And do you ever worry that this might
be something that would be monotonous

114
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,770
because you're doing
the same way every day?

115
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,940
Or did you think we just concentrate
on excellence? No, because it's also,

116
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,780
uh, like going to the fights and
there's so many different styles.

117
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,570
So like people are doing the same
thing every day. The repetition,

118
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,590
but the styles are completely different.
You know,

119
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,510
like nobody fights like
sand Chai. Right, right.

120
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,600
He does the same thing everybody else
does. But he has his own style. Yeah.

121
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,730
You know what I mean?
Or some guys will do the same thing,

122
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,480
but they don't even like to kick or knee.
They just like to throw elbows.

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,020
I know plenty of guys like that where they
just like, you know that when he goes,

124
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,860
he's just throwing elbows all five rounds.
Yeah,

125
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,410
this guy's just going to throw knees.
So it's just like,

126
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:58,490
which tools do you use the, it's like,
are you a near, are you at a kicker?

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,010
Are you an elbow guy or you left cake?
Are you a low kicker?

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,370
It's kind of like what's what
strikes are your, are your thing.

129
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,940
And then you go watch the chaos and
these guys are getting split open every

130
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,120
night fucking on the stretchers. They
take them stretchers on the rig, man,

131
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:15,070
it's amazing. Wow. It's like not to see
someone get hurt, but like just the,

132
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,170
the fact that like these guys
are all out brawl every night.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,750
Every single night there's a
fight at the stadium. Sure.

134
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,850
Thursday nights are the
nights that like the,

135
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:27,020
like the higher guys go and they're
packed with people. Thousands of people.

136
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:31,940
Like the one I went to, there was a few
thousand people there for the stadium.

137
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,270
It looked pack and
everyone's betting like, ah.

138
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,380
And then when the kicks land, I'm like,
Oh hey, I just, the energy is crazy. Wow.

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,250
They never showed up, man. I'm
