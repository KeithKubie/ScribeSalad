1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,200
S. C. E. Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:14,150
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:17,840
Today we have a mystery
that is vanishingly tiny,

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,530
shockingly hot and manages to
combine submarines, Keanu Reeves,

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,600
red lobster and game of Thrones.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,980
And of course our producer Molly Webster
and many members of your family. Hello.

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,690
Hello? Hello? Nope.
Where are the children?

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,950
So we all know you want to begin in
the beautiful state of South Carolina,

10
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,130
South Carolina. The time on appear. Yeah.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,980
Is My radio gear waterproof?
No, on a dock. Oh, okay.

12
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,380
So we're going to walk down to the donkey,

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,720
which is just like this place where
they all put boats in the water

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,270
and that's where we always [inaudible].

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm going to explain why dockets. Okay.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,540
My parents recently moved to this marshy,

17
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,450
swampy area on near the
intracoastal waterway,

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,070
which is like a connecting
series of salty channels.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,370
And we grew up in Ohio and so this is
like a totally different landscape than

20
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,530
what we grew up in. Okay.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,050
And those little people would be
my nieces and nephews, my bike,

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,350
Sylvie can ride it. You
that America is there.

23
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:22,870
My children getting along and compromise.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,190
That would be Chrissy Webster and one
of my sisters and we sound a lot alike

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,750
anyway, so, okay, so this is
the story. The story is, um,

26
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,460
so when my parents first moved there,

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,970
I remember going out on the docks with
my dad and we were sort of looking at the

28
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,800
beautiful marsh, right.

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,280
And there was this really weird
sound like coming off the water.

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,320
E Y D I recently took my nieces and
nephew out to see if they could hear it.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,130
Okay. So we're not going to move
and we're not going to squeak. Yeah.

32
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,000
Can we talk? We're not gonna talk. Oh,
okay. So we leaned down off the dock.

33
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,440
Ready? Now we're going
to see if we can hear it.

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,743
Huh?

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,220
Oh my gosh. I hear some crackles.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,900
That crackling sound. Yeah. What is that?

37
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,080
That was the question.

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,410
It sounds like rice crispy.

39
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,660
Most of the scientists you talk to say
it sounds like bacon frying or twigs

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,420
crackling in a fire. Maybe have
a large Perrier factory just yet.

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,450
I would say that except there's no
bubbles popping like on the water. Oh,

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,110
so it's not a gaseous emission.
It's a clickety clack.

43
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,910
Let me just play you a better
recording. Yeah. Pull it up. Wait,

44
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,590
do I have to put it
through the producer PC?

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,453
Uh,

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,030
this is actually an underwater
recording. Oh my God.

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
Oh

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,140
Gosh. In a teeny world. That would
be like the 4th of July. Yeah. Wow.

49
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,960
That's big. It's bigger than bigger
than Bacon and Bacon. I know.

50
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,080
It depends on how much
bacon you're frying.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,220
So what, sorry, what is this sound?
What is it? This sound is, um,

52
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,390
a very tiny [inaudible]. Let
me just back it up a second.

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,090
Well, th the story started in the
forties. That's Michelle verse Laos,

54
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:28,530
professor of Physical Acoustics and
medical acoustics at the University of

55
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,760
Toronto in the metals.

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,260
Basically what he said is World War II
is the first war where we're like really

57
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,550
using submarines and [inaudible]

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,423
sonar.

59
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,880
And so you've got all of theseU s navy
submarines down deep in the ocean and t

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,800
hey're like listening out for the enemy.

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,790
But what happens is all they hear
is this like crazy crackling sound,

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,100
the sound levels that were measured.
So, so this lab, this sounds very,

63
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,150
very intense.

64
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,600
He says in some instances it was
actually interfering with the sonar

65
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:56,930
[inaudible].

66
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,580
That was a a bit of a problem.

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,130
Yeah. So I found it.

68
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,980
I found a classified document that was
declassified right after the war where

69
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,530
the navy, they actually hired this,

70
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,880
they actually hired this scientist,
this guy named Martin Johnson.

71
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,743
This is in cal,

72
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,840
I believe it was in San Diego.

73
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,290
They hired this guy to figure
out what is the sound like?

74
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,900
What is the sound we're hearing
like all over the ocean.

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,830
What is it already jazz like, just
tell me what the damn sound is. Yes.

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,190
Well it turns out I don't
want to go too fast here.

77
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,200
It was noted in those years that
that sound originated from the ship.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
It was a shrimp. Oh yeah.

79
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,030
The shrimp is called the snapping
shrimp or a pistol. Shrimp.

80
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,130
Ooh, I like that. Yes.

81
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,030
And interestingly,

82
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,470
I found these like old navy recordings
rolled about one foot in length that they

83
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:58,700
would give to the navy guys where they
had to learn the sounds they were hearing

84
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,920
coming in through the ship and through
the sonar in your own work with the

85
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,520
expendable radio sono bully, you
will probably hear in many songs.

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,020
Although then the submarine song,

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,990
it was like, this is the
sound of [inaudible],

88
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,320
nothing different. It produces
a harsh clicking noise.

89
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,920
And I was like, okay, shrimp
sonar. Cool. I get it.

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,570
Thought maybe it would end there.

91
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,590
And then I found what felt
to me to be a crazy article,

92
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,830
which was this newspaper clipping from
1946 basically says shrimp's help win the

93
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:30,904
war.

94
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,470
And it's about how the American navy
admitted that one of their tactical things

95
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:43,321
during like World War II was that they
would hide their submarines in the beds

96
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:49,090
of these shrimp. So like the Japanese
submarines couldn't detect our ships.

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,020
Oh my goodness. It was like a
marine in visibility cloak. Yes.

98
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,640
And according to Michelle,

99
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,220
the u s would also put speakers
on the hall of the ships

100
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,850
too, to simulate snapping

101
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,620
what it was. Sound Cammo. Yeah, see,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Are these trims?

102
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,290
Are they like normal normal
shrimp cocktail type shrimp?

103
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,980
Well, there are about five
centimeters. Two inches,

104
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,730
so like smaller than a
shrimp. I might eat. Well,

105
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:18,170
it depends what sort of shrimp
you eat. I don't, I don't know.

106
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,770
Whatever red lobster's. There's no
wait a second. If they're that small,

107
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,780
how are they making that sound? That

108
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,700
is an excellent question. Wait, where
do you think the sound comes from?

109
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,330
I'm thinking it's this room
be are eating their food

110
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,220
in the noises. Their little
key. Ooh. Shrimpy tea.

111
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,220
I think it, for me, I think it
comes from their like snappy clot.

112
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,160
Then you

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
and that's what you would think, right?

114
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,040
Like especially if you look
at these things up close,

115
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,600
they have two front claws and the
claws aren't the same on each side.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,980
That's Nancy Knowlton. I'm marine
biologists snapping shrimp expert.

117
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,960
There's that claw that's specialized for
pinching and that claws tiny and a claw

118
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,900
that specialized for snapping. And
that claw is like exponentially bigger.

119
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:13,490
It's like 10 times, 20
maybe three times bigger.

120
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,953
It's quite a bit bigger.

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,860
And so they use it to defend themselves
against potential predators or

122
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,260
competitors. And they're very territorial.

123
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,120
She's as in one tramp
runs into another shrimp.

124
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,260
They can get into these prolonged snapping
matches where they snap at each other

125
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,890
to show me, me, me, me,
me is bigger and stronger.

126
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,530
[inaudible] okay, fine.

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,670
And they can pretty much judge how
big they are by the power of the snap,

128
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,550
all of which is to say, my
niece, Sophie's guests. Okay.

129
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,250
Because for there like
snappy clot, then he's like,

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,091
yeah, of course.

131
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:48,030
It's like the two sides of the
cloth just like snapping together.

132
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,370
Just like you snap your fingers
like this, just a snap, snap.

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,630
But that turns out not
to be true. So not true.

134
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,730
Two things were wrong
basically with a picture.

135
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,880
I gotta know if you've ever tried to clap
your hands in the swimming pool under

136
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,730
water,

137
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,050
but it's very difficult. Yeah.

138
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,260
You don't feel very smart
when you make difficult work.

139
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,950
There's not a lot of sand.

140
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,610
And that is because there's a lubrication
layer of water in between that

141
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,740
prevents a direct mechanical contact or

142
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,251
yes,

143
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:22,170
there's this lubricating layer between
the two claw haves and it makes snapping

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,370
hard. And the second problem was that
the sound just seemed way too loud.

145
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,760
Like when they measured the
decibel level of a single snap,

146
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,940
it's about 220 desi bells of sound
that that can be produced by,

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,480
by a single snap.

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,360
To put that in context, that
is basically equivalent to

149
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,513
[inaudible]

150
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,810
jet plane from just one snap.
But it's very impulsive.

151
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,330
So in a very, very short
duration, it's still,

152
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,820
it's like one of the loudest
sounds in the ocean. So was like

153
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,110
probably more than snapping going
on here. Yeah. So, so, okay,

154
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,120
so it was 1999 Yup. The new high speed
camera in our lab. And so they're like,

155
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:05,451
okay,

156
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:10,451
we're gonna point this camera at the
shrimp and see what happens when this

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,890
shrimp snaps its claw.

158
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,300
So they take the little shrimps and
they glue screws on their butts,

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
glue screws on their button and they
screw them into tiny platforms in like a

160
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:27,800
little aquarium so that they were fixed
in space and that that was important

161
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,430
because a happens in like a microsecond
and they need to keep it still so the

162
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:35,060
camera can just focus right on
the claw and to do the experiment,

163
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:38,510
what we needed to do was to tickle
them a little bit with the paintbrush.

164
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,110
You tickled them with a
paintbrush? Yeah, exactly.

165
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,230
Then they cock their clothes and then
they snap and then it fires and the camera

166
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:52,370
captures the entire thing with like
thousands of frames per second.

167
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,710
And did they see anything? They did
see something or what? What? How?

168
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,760
What is it when they looked
at the footage of the moment,

169
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:02,420
just after it snaps in super slow Mo,

170
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,450
you saw a very blurry object
in front of the shrimp.

171
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,370
What? Blurry Ha. It was just
like [inaudible] blurry,

172
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,500
something that was blood blurry.

173
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,290
I mean it turned out that we
were sort of out of focus.

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,350
So they refocus the camera. They do
the same thing. They tickle the shrimp,

175
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:25,460
the claws snaps. And they see
that when the closs snaps, ah,

176
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,550
they see this like bubble in front of the
shrimp claw and it turns out that it's

177
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:37,061
that bubble that's causing the
noise and so much undersea turmoil.

178
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,800
The bubble is at the
root of everything. Okay.

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,510
And with the high speed camera they were
sort of able to see how it all breaks

180
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,850
down and it sort of unfolds
like this [inaudible]

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
what actually happens
when this club closes?

182
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,950
Is that the water that's
in between these clothes,

183
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,850
can we stop at high speed? The typical
speed can be up to 60 miles per hour.

184
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,450
Like as fast as a car goes. Oh yes. Yes.

185
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,150
So this jet of water shoots
out like 60 miles per hour.

186
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,810
And what happens is like
behind the jet is that Ah,

187
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,840
this like empty spaces created like a
little void in the ocean and all the water

188
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,080
molecules in that space. Cause they're
like, Ooh, look at all this room.

189
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,160
They start to expand outwards
and essentially they just
become like a little gas

190
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,870
bubble. They actually change
from liquid to gas. Yeah,

191
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,860
they actually go from like liquid is
like tightly packed molecules and then as

192
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,840
they spread out they become like gaseous

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,950
and they create this like little gas
bubble pocket in the middle of a huge

194
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,341
ocean.

195
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:45,460
And as they have all the space they like
it bigger and bigger and bigger until

196
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:49,250
the ocean is like nope. Microseconds.

197
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,340
Later the ocean start pushing back in
on this bubble and the all the little,

198
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,910
little uh, air molecules in the, in,

199
00:11:56,911 --> 00:12:00,100
in this bubble have nowhere to go and
they're getting forced closer and closer

200
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,250
together. And so they really
want to get away from each other,

201
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,720
all those air molecules.

202
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,660
But you're pushing them together really
hard and since they can't get away from

203
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,480
each other, like the energy
builds up super, super cute.

204
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,990
She had the pressure rises
and the temperature rises

205
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,030
really rises 5,000 degrees.

206
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,030
The surface of the sun
is also 5,000 degrees

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,630
and the gas that's inside
the bubble turns to plasma

208
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,470
and that plasma and mix very
short, intense flash of light

209
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,070
as the, the bubble implodes.

210
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,420
And then like a microsecond later

211
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,620
it generates the shop

212
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,863
great.

213
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,200
And that shockwave will
basically kill or stun any,

214
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,800
uh, prayed at this nearby.

215
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,620
Somebody from the College of exaggeration
graduated this particular explanation

216
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,230
because teeny Google that animal,

217
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,830
whether the blood was bubble as hot
as the sun, then I'll think, oh yeah.

218
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,723
Okay.

219
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,573
Fairly crazy.

220
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,940
But it's amazing how evolution has
created this kind of sonic weapon.

221
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,740
So basically yes

222
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,930
strips,

223
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,200
they're like super awesome cause things
call that generate huge bubbles of heat

224
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,940
and it's like Gomez a trip
because it's a black belt. Wow.

225
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:31,620
So it's spitting out light
and hot, hot hot temperatures.

226
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,910
Yeah. Does that mean that God, the
sun thing is crazy? That's crazy.

227
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:39,660
I feel like it should be like
a marvel character modeling.

228
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,690
Yeah. Cause if you scaled this up,

229
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,780
the bubble would be the size
of a basketball in human scale.

230
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,440
What could I do with the
basketball of Sun, heat and light?

231
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,570
I could rule the world with
that. I'll be having that cat.

232
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,010
Hey, hey that last piece of
cake is mine. That was low.

233
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,260
When my sister is hanging
off the dock, she asked like,

234
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:05,430
can we use this stuff power
like the world or something? No.

235
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,420
The answer was no,

236
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,340
but the same physical processes that are
involved in the shrimp bubbles. Right.

237
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:14,520
So like the temperature and the
heat that bubbles can create.

238
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,920
Researchers became really excited about.

239
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,140
Is there a way to harness
this bubble power?

240
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,580
Yeah. There's also a Hollywood

241
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,490
movie. I think I did it.

242
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,620
Is it stable on the powerful of bubbles
with Keanu Reeves? I believe. Really?

243
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
Really? Yes. Yes.

244
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,180
There is enough energy in this glass of
water to power the city of Chicago for

245
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,120
weeks. They went too far. Oh.

246
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,170
[inaudible] fly boom.

247
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,230
Taken with a weapon with a
weapon. Possibilities. Yeah.

248
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:50,400
My nephew got excited about this
too. My name is Oliver. Huh.

249
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,490
But I hate to tell you,

250
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,890
I don't think there are any mean
you can't like make a bigger claw.

251
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,970
Put It on a sub. Nope. Sorry guys.

252
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,210
[inaudible] oh, there is
this one thing where uh,

253
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,880
researchers are thinking about using
bubbles and this goes beyond the shrimp

254
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,550
bubbles in a way that could save lives.

255
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,963
Okay.

256
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,970
My name is Joseph Packard. I'm
calling from Columbia, South Carolina.

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Radiolab is supported in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

More information about

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,770
this is Radiolab.

261
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,320
And now we're going to go back
to the story from Molly Webster.

262
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:54,321
So you were saying people here are
trying to use bubble power to save lives.

263
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, so when I was talking to
Michelle verse Laos Applications,

264
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,190
we're talking on the phone and he
explains all the crazy bubbly stuff and

265
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:06,380
somehow like in the middle of the
conversation, he just said, um,

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,370
if you think the shrimp bubbles are cool,

267
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,290
everything we know about
the shrimp bubbles like can
also be like adapted to use

268
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:17,790
bubbles in the body. Oh.
And I was like, Whoa, wait,

269
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,870
but bubbles in the body. Isn't that, isn't
that an embolism? Loa? Yeah, totally.

270
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:22,621
I had the same thought,

271
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:27,280
like when divers get the Benz or when
they like tap bubbles out of ivy lines and

272
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:30,940
stuff. But these are very, very small
bubbles, smaller than red blood cells.

273
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,140
According to verse Laos,

274
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:36,610
they're like one 20th the size of human
hair and they are completely harmless.

275
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,090
And he told me about how uh, in Toronto,

276
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:43,440
and they actually just did this
for the first time in November. Uh,

277
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,340
on a patient they're using bubbles to
get across the blood brain barrier.

278
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,950
What is, what exactly is the
brain blood brain barrier?

279
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,800
Is it cells or is it tissue? Super,

280
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:58,440
super tightly packed cells.

281
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,590
It sort of sits between the
bloodstream and the brain.

282
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:06,120
It's like this protective wall and it
keeps out all of the nasty stuff so it

283
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:10,740
keeps out any like a bacteria or viruses
that would be in your bloodstream,

284
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:13,230
can't get past the wall
to get into your brain.

285
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,910
I kind of keep thinking of it as like,

286
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,310
I'm never actually watched game of Thrones
except for like one episode and in it

287
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:21,930
there was this giant wall

288
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,650
to protect civilization from
sort of all the bad things,

289
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:32,340
the wild things and it was made
of ice and it went up forever.

290
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,720
That kind of feel like that wall in game
of Thrones is like the barrier between

291
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,710
the rest of the body. And the brain.

292
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,470
But you said it's there
to protect the brain.

293
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,230
So why would you want to
punch a hole in it? Well,

294
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,310
you can imagine that if somebody has
a brain tumor and we want to deliver

295
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,640
chemicals in there that we
think can help fight the tumor,

296
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,150
those chemicals, the brain
does not want in there.

297
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,370
So the blood brain barrier can create
problems. According to Todd main prize,

298
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,320
I'm in neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook.

299
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,680
He's part of the team in Toronto
that's using this new bubble technique.

300
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,420
And here's how it works. Wow. Okay.

301
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,480
So say you've got a tumor on
the right side of your brain,

302
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,320
right above your ears.

303
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,840
So main prize and his team will stick
you in a chair and then they'll put a

304
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:16,430
helmet on you. Special Helmet.

305
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,280
This helmet has 1024
ultrasound transducers

306
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,333
and we

307
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,180
aim the thousand 24 all to the same spot,

308
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,500
right on the spot at the wall where
the tumor sits just on the other side,

309
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,270
just out of reach. Okay,

310
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:37,340
so that all the ultrasound waves kind
of [inaudible] I guess at that one area.

311
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,950
And then we inject the bubbles.

312
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,930
How many bubbles are in a dose?
Um, like hundreds of thousands.

313
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,630
So they just put an IV in your arm and
the bubbles go in and they'll go like

314
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:55,450
into your arm, like over your shoulder,
into your heart, to your lungs,

315
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:59,060
back to your heart. Eventually some of
them will get up to the brain. You know,

316
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,830
it takes approximately 28 seconds from
the time when you inject the bubble into

317
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:07,120
an arm vein to by the time they start
going into her brain and eventually some

318
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,460
of those bubbles get up to
the blood brain barrier,

319
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:13,540
that wall to the spot where that laser
beam is focused, that specific spot,

320
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,570
that tumor sitting on the other
side up. And when they cross paths,

321
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:17,404
would that be

322
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,410
ultrasound waves causes the micro
bubbles to oscillate in size.

323
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,810
They'll go big and small. Big and small,

324
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,580
big smile, big smile, big smile,
big smile. Oscillate inside.

325
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,370
I think of it as like a, uh,
like a bubble dance party.

326
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,990
So at this really specific
part in the brain,

327
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,920
and it can be smaller than like one
millimeter by one millimeter square.

328
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,510
All these bubbles are dancing. And
what that does is it causes the wall,

329
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,330
that specific spot almost loosen.

330
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,290
And so like a little like a window of
space or a little hole is created in that

331
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,020
wall. And if you happen to have
chemotherapy in your blood,

332
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,300
which you will because we'll
give it to you ahead of time,

333
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,190
the minute that hole is open. Okay.

334
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,950
The idea is the chemotherapy in your
bloodstream would be able to just sort of

335
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,640
flow through that opening and get
straight to that brain tumor tissue.

336
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,170
So they're using sound to turn the bubbles
into little dancing drill bits. Yeah.

337
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,063
And drill through them.

338
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,650
Yeah. Wow. Now the body's
a living organism. So,

339
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,270
uh, over the next six to 12 hours,

340
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,940
they will close those gaps.

341
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Transient meaning it heals
itself in about six to 12 hours.

342
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,680
And you're saying they tried
this on someone already?

343
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,750
Yeah, last November and
they think it went well.

344
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,260
One of the things these researchers
said was once you're able to open these

345
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:49,990
passageways to the brain, um, it's
not just chemo that can get in there,

346
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:54,190
but like suddenly any type of drug
you might want to send through can get

347
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,024
through.

348
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,290
And we've just never had access
to the brain before in that way.

349
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,380
And there's this question of like, how
will drugs interact with the brain?

350
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,560
We kind of don't know. They've,
they've never been there before.

351
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,280
It's like a whole new frontier.

352
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,350
You think shrimp and time is done.

353
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,520
So I mean,

354
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:22,521
basically all boils down to the same
sort of physics of bubbles that we have

355
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,530
learned from the shrimp and that
we can apply to many other, uh,

356
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,650
applications.

357
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,120
Fun. It's dinner time.

358
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,110
We're gonna put it on the radio so you'll
hear it. The people that like shrimp.

359
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,950
What do people don't like?
Shrimp Nail. Just skip it.

360
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,560
I can't believe Molly's putting this
on the radio. I make no promises.

361
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,250
This has gone on the radio. Oh, Yay.

362
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,620
Molly Webster. This piece was produced

363
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,400
by Molly and Annie Mcewen
with help from our guests.

364
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:08,380
Sound designer Jeremy Bloom.

366
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,000
next up, a story from our
producer, Simon Adler, who, uh,

367
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,030
who got interested in bubbles
after Molly found her shrimp piece,

368
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,220
got interested in bubbles and he managed
to find a guy named Dave Stein who has

369
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,950
taken bubbling to a whole new level.

370
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,120
It's a bigger bubble. Better,

371
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,800
I think trying to make things
bigger as a function of growing up.

372
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,731
I don't know,

373
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:49,731
I always thought that this was kind of
inherent in the human psyche is to want

374
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:53,940
to do certain things bigger and
better. And so, well, may we,

375
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,470
we might even make this
a Stein's law. Okay.

376
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,190
Steins Stein's law. Law
of bubble of bubbling.

377
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,120
No Stein's law of size is kind
of off the top of my head here.

378
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,600
But for any given object,

379
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
there is a larger size such that the
nature of the object is transformed in,

380
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,620
in simple English. What would that mean?

381
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,150
That as something gets
bigger it gets what? Okay.

382
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,620
Jake in Jupiter. Okay. Gaseous
planets. Okay. All right.

383
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,990
If you make Jupiter bigger
and bigger, bigger and bigger,

384
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,220
there is a size at
which it becomes a star.

385
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,420
Hagen, it ignites, it becomes a Sun.

386
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,000
It transcends what it was.

387
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Then can a bubble get so big that
it's no longer even a bubble?

388
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,730
Well, before the invention
of the bubble thing,

389
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,070
1984 bubbles,

390
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
we always thought of as being
relatively small and relatively round,

391
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,780
but as soon as you get
up to a certain size,

392
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,300
say five foot diameter
kind of in that range, uh,

393
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,310
now a sudden suddenly they're not round
anymore and they don't pop in the same

394
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:29,540
way. People who would think of bubbles
popping instantaneously because they're

395
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,060
thinking of the little round
bubbles from the dime store.

396
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,420
And what really happens in very large
bubbles like the ones I and my friends

397
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,070
make, the bubble doesn't
pop instantaneously.

398
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,250
It gets punctured at a certain point
and then it rips open like a zipper and

399
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,260
there's a sound to it. It kind of goes

400
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,770
like that. So it's not

401
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,640
[inaudible] from one end of
this long bubble to the other.

402
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,680
Can we back up to tell me the
story of how you like why,

403
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,840
who were you in 1984 when you're like,
I'm going to make this bubble thing?

404
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,330
What, what, what, what
motivated all of this?

405
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,030
Well, what motivated all of this
was I was an architect at the time.

406
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:22,930
I was working for hardy Holzman Pfeiffer,

407
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:24,390
a very fashionable firmed out [inaudible]

408
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,240
and he says he spent his days designing
these really intricate buildings where

409
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,830
like glass staircases

410
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,580
meet the stonework of the building at a
45 degree angle and the roof is going up

411
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:38,580
at another angle, all has to
work down to the 16th of an inch.

412
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,870
Who wasn't very happy
at it actually. In fact,

413
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,470
I used to worry about
structural collapse. Okay?

414
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,120
He says he'd be walking down
the streets of Manhattan,

415
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,730
imagining some building he
was building in his mind,

416
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,860
say the a addition to the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

417
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,530
He's imagining this building and then
all of a sudden his mind would shift to

418
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,410
worry about that building
collapsing. And he says,

419
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
this just kept happening
with every project.

420
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,810
All these buildings kept just
crashing into the ground. Like,

421
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:10,950
did this keep you up at night? Did
you wake up? Yeah, I felt I had to.

422
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,130
I felt that as a re architect,

423
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,280
it's my responsibility to imagine
all the possible disaster.

424
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,100
He says it became this not so
healthy occupational obsession and y.

425
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,020
W. Y. Alright. That's a good
question. Let me tell you something.

426
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm probably getting some
of these details wrong, but

427
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,870
my grandfather Clarence bulky,

428
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,230
was a metallurgist who had a,

429
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:43,920
something to do with building
the atomic bomb and so did my

430
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,420
uncle. And um,

431
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,540
my mother was quite traumatized by being
a daughter of the bomb, so to speak.

432
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:56,160
And it says it became part of the family
legacy and maybe warmed its way into

433
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,830
his psyche and poisoned his work. Well,

434
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,960
that's just the way I
registered it. I'm just,

435
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,580
what I'm trying to basically trying to
say was that I was not really happy as an

436
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:09,040
architect. Anyway, that summer,

437
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,860
1984 my little daughter Kayla,

438
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,930
who was one and a half saw a man blowing
bubbles with one of those little dime

439
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:20,260
store wands and she was just transfixed.

440
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,780
She was transported to another
realm. She had a lot like any kid.

441
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,710
And so from that point on we
were always blowing bubbles,

442
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,670
all kinds of small bubbles, medium
ones, large ones. Pretty quick.

443
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:38,170
He started to wonder, how can we make
these bubbles bigger? And we used to,

444
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:42,280
you know, we cut out the ends of the
coffee cans, dipped one end in the soap,

445
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,340
blew through the other,

446
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,320
got maybe a bubble that might
be a foot foot in diameter,

447
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,130
tried getting a coat hanger
and bending it into a circle,

448
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,360
dipping that into a frying pan full of
soap. With that you can make a bubble,

449
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,550
may be a two foot or something.

450
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,820
And is your daughter getting more and
more excited as the bubbles get bigger?

451
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:05,350
Is this about you? She was getting
kind of bored with it actually.

452
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,760
Dave started to get a little
upset. Yes, that's definitely true.

453
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,990
And I was thinking, you know, this
is an interesting design problem,

454
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:17,170
maximizing the size of bubbles
and know how you go about that.

455
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,520
Initially his thought was,

456
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,060
and this is kind of everyone's thought
when they start thinking about this,

457
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,500
you just need a bigger circle, a bigger
hoop through which to blow the bubble.

458
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,400
It's like a hula hoop with a handle on
it and you would need a a little one of

459
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:33,130
those little plastic swimming
pools full of bubbles, soap,

460
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:36,370
which starts to seem kind of like a
lot of, so from a design perspective,

461
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:37,810
like how do you scale that up?

462
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,560
You can't just keep making the hoop and
bucket bigger. Like that seems crazy.

463
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,890
So at that point I was sort of stuck,

464
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,740
but whatever he was going on with
his life designing buildings.

465
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,250
But then he says one day in the summer
of 1984 I was lying in bed one morning.

466
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:58,360
I can still remember the the
pattern of cracks in the ceiling.

467
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,180
The idea hit him like a ton
of bubble shaped bricks.

468
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,670
Why not have a collapsible hoop?

469
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,100
I sort of instantly saw
this thing in my mind,

470
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,390
which was what we now know as
the bubble, the bubble thing,

471
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,080
and so Dave leaps out of bed
heads to the hardware store,

472
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,970
buys his stuff and I bought the Gel and
the chain and the fascinating stories.

473
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:22,390
Home starts assembling the device
where you in your kitchen where,

474
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,520
where were you when you were doing
well you don't do this indoors.

475
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,750
Ultimately he stepped outside and what
he had in his hand was really nothing

476
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:33,751
more than like a stick with a loop of
chain attached to it and one end of the

477
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:38,650
loop you could kind of slide up and down
on the stick so that you could expand

478
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,310
and collapse the loop. That's
the beauty of this design.

479
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,150
To have that control and be able to
close any weight back in the backyard.

480
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,050
I closed the loop so it was just
like a cord, like a straight cord.

481
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,280
I dunked it in the bucket of soap.
I raised it up, I open the loop

482
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,240
right away. There's huge

483
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,643
bubbly

484
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,940
starts coming out, tube stretches
for seven, eight feet. He's not sure,

485
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,060
but at a certain point that
closes the loop to pinch it off.

486
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,420
Now it's a free floating bubble
and it's sailing away over the,

487
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,000
over the house top and through the farm.

488
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,170
Suddenly there's this gigantic
bubbles floating away,

489
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,850
the biggest bubble ever blown,

490
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,140
I believe since it was somewhere between
the size of a refrigerator in a car

491
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:29,410
iridescent and wobbly and
then suddenly it popped.

492
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,900
What did you feel in that moment
where you were you, Dr Frankenstein,

493
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,850
who had just let this monster
out into the world who I had,

494
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,810
I got this cold thrill
going down my spine.

495
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,540
I'll never forget that. And as he sent
more and more of these into the air,

496
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,230
pretty soon people started arriving

497
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,670
in their cars and trucks.

498
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,030
Everybody was totally astonished and um,

499
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,640
I thought this might be my ticket

500
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,400
architecture.

501
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,680
So Dave was able to patent the bubble
thing and made enough money to get out of

502
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:08,514
architecture.

503
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,540
And in the process he transformed bubble
blowing from a thing that just like

504
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,040
kids do to this, I don't know,

505
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,030
kind of sport where you
have like bubble athletes.

506
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,050
My Name's Gary preroll.
Matt and Megan Park,

507
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,560
Rick Findlay, all over the world in
Mexico, they call me [inaudible] hall.

508
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,040
I currently am the a champion,
the heavyweight, the big boy.

509
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,930
People are blowing like
really big bubbles.

510
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,770
You could picture a say a two 18 wheelers,

511
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:37,400
a stacked on top of one another.
That's about how big the bubble was.

512
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,460
That's a slight exaggeration. But anyways,

513
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,610
there are debates going on
about what kind of soap to use,

514
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,140
which is the best polymer to add to that
soap and what kind of fabric to use for

515
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:50,260
the loop. But despite
all this experimentation,

516
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,960
pretty much everyone uses a variation
of Dave's original idea that these,

517
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,160
these people are sort of
my followers. You see,

518
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,750
I find it very interesting that you had
this fear of your buildings collapsing

519
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,000
and here you go into this world where
all of the things you're making are meant

520
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:10,510
to collapse. Well, here's the thing. Uh,

521
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,170
it's true that every bubble will collapse,

522
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,970
but there is no blame.

523
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,300
See and nobody got it.

524
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,030
I think we might be able to get some here.

525
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,950
So that night Dave took me
out bubble baking powder.

526
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,060
We have thermometer, we have
test strips for measuring Ph.

527
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,100
He'd been watching the humidity
was okay, but the wind,

528
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,780
this amount of wind is
usually very difficult.

529
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,550
So we'll go down and
try to find some shelter

530
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,950
corner of what? West
end and one oh six here,

531
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,620
midnight in Manhattan. Pretty much empty
couple of cars, almost no one walking.

532
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,100
So now I'm going to dunk it in the
soap and now I'm going to raise it up

533
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,420
and I'm going to open the loop and I'm
going to see if I can make a bubble here.

534
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,270
There we go. Okay, that
one's pretty good. Okay.

535
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,180
It is sailing along into the intersection
and I wanted to now chasing the bubble

536
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:22,300
is now chasing the taxi.
How, how big is that one? Uh,

537
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,100
that's about the size of a killer
whale. I'd say maybe 20 feet long.

538
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
When you get these giant bubbles
sailing around among these buildings,

539
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,690
it activates the space.

540
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,200
He says it seems to transform the
architecture and it definitely did. Um,

541
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,060
like it made this city look suddenly
beautiful and like a lava lamp and alien.

542
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,880
And we've got some people walking by
that are now taking videos of them. Jay,

543
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,960
look at that one. Oh, that's a great
one. That's, that's the size of a,

544
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:58,360
of a smallish baby
elephant and maybe, okay.

545
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:01,710
And the taxi has now just done a u
turn to watch us and see us. We got,

546
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,580
we've got a bike messenger who,
who's rubber necking as he goes by.

547
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,300
Even if midnight and audience just
materialized. It just incredible.

548
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:14,650
Like everybody, okay, New Yorkers
are assholes and people are stopping

549
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,250
stopping with smiles and their click.

550
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,740
This taxi has just stopped in the middle
of the road to want you to do this.

551
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,530
So you do, you often stop
your taxi to look at a,

552
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,360
to look at things are really
different things. So big.

553
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,340
I see this small on before,

554
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,060
but this is totally different like this

555
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,780
and it's so silly, right? It very
similar. Sillies it's very wonderful.

556
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,790
Very dizzy.

557
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,680
Very Kitty. Oh there. That's the
size of a killer whale for sure.

558
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,830
You ever feel silly out here? I,

559
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,710
uh, sometimes do,

560
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,830
but I also sometimes compare myself to
my grandfather and I'm much happier to

561
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:12,121
have invented the giant bubble
thing than having invented the bomb.

562
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,460
I also think, you know, I, in a way,

563
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:23,461
I feel like I have started an art
form and that is going to go on.

564
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,760
And, uh, and

565
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,403
