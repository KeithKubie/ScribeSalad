00:00:01.498 --> 00:00:05.665
- And so my fellow Americans
ask not what your country

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:11.573
can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.220
- All the time.

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:37.827
It is amazing to me that
for something that is so

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:41.190
fundamental to the
functioning of our country

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.694
that we have not invested
more in making it easier

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.382
and not harder for people to vote.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:51.014
- If I learned anything
during my time working for

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:53.626
Bill Weld and Paul Cellucci
is that if you really

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:57.378
assumed that the Republicans
had all the right answers

00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:59.134
or the Democrats had all
the right answers you

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.294
were likely to be wrong.

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.430
- At a time when young people
often feel disconnected from

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.966
politics we need to reach
across the generations

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:18.133
and recommit ourselves and
our country to these ideals.

00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:24.985
- All this will not be
finished in the first 100 days.

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:30.340
Nor will it be finished
in the first 1,000 days.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.796
Nor in the life of this administration,

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:38.052
nor even perhaps in our
lifetime on this planet.

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:39.469
But let us begin.
