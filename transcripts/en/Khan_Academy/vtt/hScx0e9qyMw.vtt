00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.500
- Hey, this is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.360
and today we're learning about
McCulloch versus Maryland,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.810
a Supreme Court cases decided in 1819

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.840
that helped to define the relationship

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.810
between the federal
government and the states.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.850
The question at issue in this case

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.430
was whether the state of Maryland

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.770
could tax the Baltimore branch

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.000
of the Bank of the United States.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.430
And whether Congress even had the power

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
to create a Bank of the United
States in the first place.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.730
To learn more, I sought out
the help of two experts.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.070
Randy Barnett is the
Carmack Waterhouse Professor

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.970
of Legal Theory at the
Georgetown University Law Center

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.430
and Director of the Georgetown
Center for the Constitution.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
Neil Siegel is the David
W. Ichel Professor of Law

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.670
and Professor of Political
Science at Duke Law School.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.990
So, Professor Barnett, could
you kind of set the stage

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.300
for us, what was happening in this case?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.447
What was the overall context?

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:02.060
- Well, McCulloch versus
Maryland was a culmination

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.340
of a 30-year old
constitutional controversy.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.120
In fact, it was the culmination

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.810
of one of the earliest controversies

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.880
that we had in the
country, and that is over

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.700
whether Congress had
the power to establish

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
a national bank, a bank
that would be a corporation

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.290
formed by Congress and which
would have certain privileges

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.360
that Congress granted it.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.480
This was a proposal that had been made

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.690
by Alexander Hamilton when he
was Secretary of the Treasury

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.897
in the Washington administration
in the very first year

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:32.040
of the Washington administration,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.410
and it went to Congress, and
there was a very, very robust

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.010
debate in Congress as
to whether this measure

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.040
was within the powers
of Congress to enact.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.230
Eventually, Congress voted that it was,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.780
and then before he signed the bill,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.540
President Washington asked
some of his cabinet members

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.200
to give him their opinion on
whether it was constitutional,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.360
and he heard from several
of his cabinet members.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.460
He heard from his Attorney
General, Edmund Randolph,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.030
he said it was unconstitutional.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.950
He heard from his Secretary
of State, Thomas Jefferson,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.420
Jefferson said it was unconstitutional.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.560
And finally, he heard from
his Secretary of Treasury,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.740
who had proposed it, Alexander Hamilton,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.690
who said it was constitutional.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.260
And Washington signed the
bill and it became law.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.020
And it established the First National Bank

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.060
of the United States.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.950
- [Siegel] This case arose in May of 1818

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.477
when Maryland sued McCulloch,
and he was the cashier

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.690
at the Baltimore branch of the bank.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.230
And Maryland sued him in state court

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.450
to recover a tax assessed
by Maryland on the bank.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.140
And this was a time of intense hostility

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.520
towards the national bank
in a number of states.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.560
The state banks competed
with the national bank,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.130
and there had been an
economic panic in 1818,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.720
when the U.S. bank halted its loans

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.516
and state banks that had loans

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:55.770
from the federal bank were crippled.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.410
And in response, a number of states

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.830
passed nearly annhilative
taxes on the federal bank,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.840
and that's the environment
in which, in 1819,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.890
McCulloch against Maryland
came before the Supreme Court.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.130
- [Kim] I find this very interesting,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.950
because this is something
that we talk a lot about

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.350
in the early 19th century,
the Bank of the United States.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.610
And what was good about it
and what was bad about it.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.840
And there are certain people
who were certainly enemies

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.950
of the bank, like Thomas Jefferson,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.200
and then later, Andrew Jackson.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.210
Why did people object

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.503
to the Bank of the United States so much?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.050
- [Siegel] Yeah, there were
a variety of objections.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.600
There was a real political
policy disagreement

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.510
about whether it was a good idea.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.510
Hamilton had a nation-building,
economy-building objective

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.140
as the first Secretary of the Treasury.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.060
He wanted to pay off
both the national debt

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.350
and the state debts from
the Revolutionary War,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.790
which remained unpaid.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.980
He was emphasizing
manufacturing and commerce

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.930
and a national bank was
a key part of his plan.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.400
The bank would make it easier
for the national government

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.440
to raise taxes, to pay off debts,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.840
to make payments, to
obtain short-term loans.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.360
The notes issued by
the bank could function

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.930
as a national currency,
it could also provide

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.590
a source of capital for
financing businesses.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.710
But the opponents had different ideas.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.000
- [Barnett] One of the leading opponents

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.520
in Congress was James
Madison, who at the time

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.970
was a representative from
Orange County, Virginia.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.510
And what concerned him, and
I think it's what concerned

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.800
many people, was no
expressed enumerated power

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.900
in the Constitution for
Congress to make a bank.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.986
There was an enumerated power
to create a post office,

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:53.050
but there was no enumerated
power to create a bank.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.780
So the question is whether the failure

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.480
or the silence of the Constitution

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.460
on whether there was this power

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.440
should be construed in favor
of having such a power,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.770
or not having such a power.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.870
And Madison's concern was
that to imply such a power,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.060
especially when the way in
which it was being implied

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.470
was very remotely connected to
one of the enumerated powers

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.130
that were in the Constitution,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.010
was very dangerous because
by that form of reasoning,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.470
Congress can essentially
do whatever it wished,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.670
and that would violate the basic pledge

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.490
that this was going to
be a national government

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.660
of limited and enumerated powers.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.240
- [Kim] So in Congress, what was the power

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.630
that proponents of the bank used

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.220
to justify passing it?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.569
- [Barnett] The principle
power that they used

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.029
is called the Necessary and Proper Clause.

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.410
The Necessary and Proper
Clause says Congress

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.270
shall have power to make all laws

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.350
which shall be necessary and proper

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.890
for carrying into execution
its foregoing powers,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.460
those powers on the list,
and all other powers

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.340
vested by the Constitution
in the government

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.140
of the United States or any
department or officer thereof.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.620
This is called the
Necessary and Proper Clause.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.460
It allows for Congress to make laws

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.320
incidental to the enumerated powers

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.770
to effectuate, or carry into
execution, those powers.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.240
And supporters of the bill said

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.300
that the bank carried into
execution a number of powers,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.933
it carried into execution
the taxing power,

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:21.370
it carried into execution
the commerce power.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.860
The opponents of the bank said, well,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.880
it may do that, but it only does that

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.770
in a very attenuated way.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.260
And therefore, if it can do this

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.610
in order to effectuate that power,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.710
then it pretty much can do anything

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.810
to effectuate power, and therefore

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.010
it can pretty much do anything.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.440
And that's a big problem.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.440
- [Kim] So Maryland sues
McCulloch, and then what happens?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.490
- [Siegel] Maryland sues McCulloch,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.150
because Maryland didn't
pass the annihilative tax,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.252
it was a tax of around two
percent of the banknotes

00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:56.960
issued by the National Bank.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.370
And Maryland won in the state trial court,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.297
and Maryland won in the
state supreme court,

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.520
and this was really not a surprise

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.353
at the time,
- (laughter)

00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:08.000
state courts were, let's just say,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.510
solicitous of the views of the state

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.660
and after the state supreme court decided,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.570
the case went to the U.S.
Supreme Court on appeal.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.200
So even though Maryland sues McCulloch,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.553
by the time it gets to the Supreme Court,

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:22.940
it's called McCulloch against Maryland

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.000
because McCulloch, the cashier
at the Baltimore branch,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.850
is now the petitioner, he's requesting

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.950
the U.S. Supreme Court
review of the decision

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.960
of the Maryland high court.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.432
And McCulloch is asking the
Supreme Court to intervene

00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:41.480
and, in essence, side with
the federal government

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.650
over the state.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.483
- [Kim] Interesting.

00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:47.200
So what are the
constitutional issues at stake

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.783
once the McCulloch case
gets to the Supreme Court?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.633
- [Barnett] Well, the Supreme Court

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:54.731
in a very lengthy opinion has to consider

00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:56.320
a couple of different matters.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.510
First it has to consider
whether the states

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.850
have the power to tax a
federal entity like a bank.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.040
And that's where you
have the famous statement

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.990
by John Marshall that
says, "the power to tax

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.020
can be the power to destroy."

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.190
What he's talking about
is the power of states

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.120
to tax a federal entity like a bank,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.810
might be the power of states to destroy

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.530
a federal entity, and he
ruled against that claim.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.080
And he basically argued that states

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.400
couldn't have that kind of power.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.137
- [Siegel] And a threshold question

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.590
before the Supreme Court
decides that question

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.030
of state authority to tax
the national government,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.730
is whether the national bank
can exist to begin with.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.080
Is there federal power to
create a national bank?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.880
Part of what Maryland is arguing

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.170
is that there's no federal
power to create the bank,

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.820
and so in fact, this taxation
that it's engaging in

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.130
is unproblematic.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.000
The first question is whether
the federal government

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.060
can create the bank,
and if the answer is no,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.200
then the case is over.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.670
If the answer is yes, then
you get to the second question

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.640
of whether the states can tax this part

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.730
of the federal government,
the national bank.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.720
- [Kim] So at this time, the Chief Justice

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.960
of the Supreme Court is John Marshall,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.000
very well-known as being
kind of the Chief Justice

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.660
that brought the Supreme Court

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.660
to be a major player in the
U.S. governmental system.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.270
How did he interpret what was going on,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.290
what did he and the other justices decide?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.870
- [Siegel] He borrowed extensively

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.670
from Hamilton's arguments.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.180
And so Marshall adopted
Hamilton's arguments

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.710
in defense of the
constitutionality of the bank,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.710
that Hamilton originally
articulated back in 1790, 1791.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.160
So the court held an opinion
by the great Chief Justice,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.860
first, that Congress does
possess the authority

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.350
to create the bank and
secondly, that states

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.650
have no authority to tax the bank.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.050
- [Barnett] And that is what Marshall

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.500
concluded was within Congress' power

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.900
under the Necessary and
Proper Clause to enact.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.730
And in fact, when it got to the court

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.060
in McCulloch versus Maryland,
it was the state of Maryland

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.520
who basically adopted
the Jeffersonian approach

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.950
and said that a measure
must be, in its words,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.570
indispensably requisite,
or what you might call

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.330
absolutely necessary in order
for it to be constitutional.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.960
And whereas the defenders of the bank bill

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.300
said that it could be
a lot less than that.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.490
So, I think there's
basically three positions

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.323
that you can have.

00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:29.480
It has to be indispensably requisite,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.980
or logically necessary,
that's the Jefferson

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.470
and Maryland view.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.000
It could be merely a matter
of convenience or expediency,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.120
meaning basically Congress
can do whatever it wants.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.410
That's the liberal view
that's sometimes attributed

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.930
to John Marshall in
McCulloch versus Maryland,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:47.960
but he denied it.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.100
And there's the in-between position

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.000
that I think both Madison
and Hamilton were favoring,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.600
and that is the requirement of some degree

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.270
of means-ends fit, so that a measure

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.600
really is aimed at a particular end,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000
and it's not really trying
to accomplish something

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.950
that Congress isn't given the power over.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.830
- [Siegel] What I think is less well-known

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.510
about this case is that this
part of the case was over

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.720
and the court had already decided,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.610
that this federal power
to create the bank,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.230
before it even got to the
Necessary and Proper Clause.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.200
This case is a great
example of what's called

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.110
Structural Constitutional Interpretation.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.610
Hamilton articulated two
structural principles.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.340
First, that the federal government

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.950
is supreme within it's sphere of action.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.789
And second, if some kind of end

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:43.650
is within federal power, is
listed in the Constitution,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.360
then any convenient or useful means

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.530
to accomplishing that end
is also within the scope.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.790
And so Marshall decides
that drawing inferences

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.440
from his understanding of
the theory and structure

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.430
of government created by the Constitution,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.530
and only after he does that, does he then

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.220
turn to the Necessary and Proper Clause

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.790
to confirm what he has already deduced

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.260
through what he calls general reasoning.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.380
- [Kim] So, McCulloch versus Maryland

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.100
is frequently paired with
Marbury versus Madison

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.870
as being two cases that really decide

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.700
the extent of federal
power in this early era.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.800
Do you think these two cases are related?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.970
What do they tell us about the ideas

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.960
at this time period about federal power?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.070
- [Barnett] Well, they're very important.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.590
I don't think they are quite as extreme

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.390
as they've come to be
read after the New Deal.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.400
When the New Deal Court
and the rest of advocates

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.300
for a New Deal were
going back into the past

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.140
and seeking justifications
for what they wanted to do,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.040
they read McCulloch versus
Maryland very broadly.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.810
They also read Marbury versus Madison,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.730
actually they read Marbury versus Madison,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.120
in some respects, very narrowly

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.120
because they didn't
want courts invalidating

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.750
their New Deal legislations.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.310
Marbury versus Madison was not a huge deal

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.590
at the time it was decided.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.880
The idea that judges had a duty

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.210
to follow the higher law
when it was in conflict

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.900
with the mere statute was widely accepted

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.840
at the time of the founding.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.380
And so Marbury was not
announcing a new policy.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.230
McCulloch versus Maryland,
on the other hand,

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.960
was extremely controversial
when it was decided,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.530
and in fact quite oddly,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.240
James Madison, who had signed the bill

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.460
authorizing the second bank into law,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.230
greatly, strenuously objected
to John Marshall's opinion

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.740
in McCulloch versus
Maryland upholding the bill

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.820
that Madison had signed into law.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.245
So, Madison still maintained that Marshall

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:53.890
had a latitudinarian or
overly-broad interpretation

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.310
of federal power even
in upholding the bill

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.520
that Madison, by this
time, had come to believe

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.305
was constitutional.

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:01.620
- [Kim] So what ultimately happened

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.080
with the Bank of the United States?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.510
- [Siegel] What ultimately happened

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.530
is both the bill creating the First Bank

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.670
and the Second Bank had what's
called a sunset provision,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.727
which means after a
certain amount of time,

00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:16.480
and it was 20 years, it expires.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.693
And so to reauthorize
it, it puts the burden

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:22.170
on inertia on those who
want the thing to continue.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.520
And so Congress had to pass another bill

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.850
reauthorizing the bank, and
President Andrew Jackson

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.950
opposed reauthorization.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.240
- [Barnett] President
Andrew Jackson vetoed

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.260
the reauthorization of the bank,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and it was very interesting
because he vetoed it

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.640
on constitutional grounds, he
said it was unconstitutional.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.810
And yet, what happened in
McCulloch versus Maryland,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.490
if McCulloch versus Maryland said the bank

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.350
was constitutional, how
could President Jackson

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.050
say that it was unconstitutional?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.050
Well, it was interesting.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.250
Because what McCulloch
said was that the bank

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.000
was constitutional as an
exercise of Congress' power

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.560
to make laws that are
necessary and proper,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.070
that Congress believed
was necessary and proper,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.490
and because Congress
believed it was necessary,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.610
and because the measure
was plainly adapted

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.040
to a legitimate end in the Constitution,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.680
then it was constitutional.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.310
What Jackson said was, hey look,

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.060
the court said that it's up to Congress

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.010
to decide whether something is necessary

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.183
and therefore constitutional,
and I as president

00:15:23.183 --> 00:15:26.830
exercise a veto power as part
of the legislative process,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.260
therefore, it is up to me to decide

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.820
whether the measure is necessary

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.470
and therefore is constitutional,

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.210
so I as president have decided

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.690
that a bank is not
necessary and therefore,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.140
because the bank is not
necessary, it is unconstitutional,

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.760
and McCulloch versus Maryland
allows me as a participant

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.450
in the legislative
process to make that call.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.470
- [Siegel] Congress did
not override Jackson's veto

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.920
and the bank expired and
the story ended in 1836.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.040
And I think this speaks
to one of many morals

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.390
of the story of the Bank
of the United States.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.170
The Supreme Court doesn't
have the last word

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.310
on Constitutional
questions when it upholds

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.280
exercises of federal power.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.600
It's then left to the political process

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.490
to decide whether or
not it wants to continue

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:19.270
whatever controversial action
or legislation was at issue.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.290
- [Kim] So is there any aspect

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.290
of McCulloch versus Maryland
that still affects us today?

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.680
- [Barnett] One reading of McCulloch

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.610
is that it gives Congress
a power so broad,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.150
that allows Congress to exercise any power

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.750
that it deems convenient to the exercise

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.680
of one of its enumerated powers,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.710
that is how McCulloch has
come to be interpreted.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.960
I think that is an
over-reading of McCulloch.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.540
And it also overlooks
one of the key passages

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.930
of McCulloch versus Maryland that nowadays

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.943
is given no legal effect
by the Supreme Court.

00:16:54.943 --> 00:16:56.860
This is what John Marshall said:

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.410
should Congress, under the pretext

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.260
of executing its powers, pass laws

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.270
for the accomplishments of objects

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.130
not entrusted to the government,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.020
it would become the painful
duty of this tribunal,

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.830
should a case requiring such
a decision come before it,

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.310
to say that such an act was
not the law of the land.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.950
So what Marshall is saying there

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.950
is that just because Congress
says a law is necessary

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.220
to one of its enumerated
powers, doesn't make it so.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.650
And if there is a lack of
fit between means and ends

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.850
suggesting that in fact
Congress is trying to pursue

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.160
one of the powers that was not given to it

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.660
under the Constitution, it really would be

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.700
the painful duty of the tribunal

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.310
to say it was not the law of the land,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.760
and that's what connects this case

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.050
back up with Marbury versus Madison,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.180
in which it is the painful
duty of the Supreme Court

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.420
to say that a statute is
not the law of the land

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.960
if it's unconstitutional.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.030
That aspect of McCulloch versus Maryland

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.320
is no longer followed in part
because during the New Deal,

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.370
the Supreme Court said it would
not inquire into the motives

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.630
of Congress in enacting laws.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.720
And in fact, what McCulloch is saying here

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.700
is to inquire into the motives,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.910
it's to say, hey look, it
purports to be doing one thing

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.800
but it's really doing something else

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.044
and that is pre-textual.

00:18:18.044 --> 00:18:20.980
- [Siegel] There has been
irreconcilable disagreement

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.730
on basic Constitutional questions

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.703
from the very beginning
of the Constitution.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.040
Madison and Hamilton, who come together

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.750
and write the Federalist Papers,

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.060
they disagree about this
fundamental question

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.000
of strict versus loose construction

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.940
of Congress' enumerated powers.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.050
They also disagree about
Congress' spending powers,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.860
they disagree about
inherent executive power.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.690
So sometimes, originalist
constitutional arguments

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.486
presuppose a greater degree of consensus

00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:52.530
about what the Constitution means

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.800
at the start of the
country that I don't see

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.460
when I study the history.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.250
We have always disagreed.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.120
We've always managed to find some kind

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.950
of community in disagreement.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.890
It's the conflicts and
disagreements that have binded us

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.020
together as much, if not more,
than the agreements we've had

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.570
about what the Constitution means.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.020
- [Kim] So we've learned that
McCulloch versus Maryland

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.960
was about far more than
just a tax on a bank.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.580
It bolstered the power
of the federal government

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.170
by broadly defining the
Necessary and Proper Clause

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.770
and by confirming that federal law

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.900
is supreme to state law.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.350

McCulloch versus Maryland,
