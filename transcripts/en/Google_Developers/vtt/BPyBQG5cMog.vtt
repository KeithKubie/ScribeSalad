00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.879
&gt;&gt;Dick: OK thanks for coming everybody to
the -- it's a long title; Technology, Innovation,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.060
Computer Science, and More: A VC Panel.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.120
I'm Dick Costello.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.670
I'm the COO at Twitter, but I’m not why
you're here; these guys are why you're here.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.460
With me are, I'm gonna do the introductions
so that we don't do the whole 10 minute introduction

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.470
apiece and then we've only got a few minutes
left.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.000
So I'm gonna do the introductions for them
and then dive right into questions and then

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.280
leave you guys a bunch of time for questions.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.820
So we've got Albert Wenger from Union Square
Ventures.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.860
Chris Dixon, the tall guy with the glasses
from Hunch.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.489
Dave McClure from, do we still say we're from
500 hats? Dave? Yes.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.489
All right.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.729
Brad Feld from Foundry Group.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.780
And Paul Graham from Y Combinator.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
Okay?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.780
Thanks guys.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.409
So these guys are all tech.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.859
I would say you're technologically based VC's.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.859
You've all coded at some point in your life,
fair enough?

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:54.859
Good.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.649
So the first question then is, right off the
bat, I wanna ask you guys is, would you invest

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.789
in a start up with non-technical founders?

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.420
And why and how is technology so important
to your investments?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.810
Most importantly would you invest in a start
up with non, non-technological founders?

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.490
It's not that hard a question.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.490
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yes.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.490
&gt;&gt;Dick: [Laughs]

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.590
&gt;&gt;Paul: You mean only non technical founders?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.590
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.719
&gt;&gt;Paul: Ah, yes we would, and we have.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:45.619
In fact the guy we invested in is back there
 -- Haj Tagar, he now works for Y Combinator.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:58.009
But what we care most about is how sort of
determined and formidable the founders are,

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.009
right.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:14.310
There’s some people who are just gonna cut
a swath through the world getting what they

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.970
want.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.610
And we want to invest in them.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:54.140
So we would invest in a start up founded by
non-hackers if they were that sort of people.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:14.470
However, if they had any brains, they would
realize that they needed some hackers to make

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.170
a product, right?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:40.080
And so if they're the kind of people who get
what they need in life then they probably

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:54.120
ought to have a line on some hackers by the
time we see them, right?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:03.460
Because you're gonna need hackers.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:15.630
‘Cause if you're smart and determined, you’re
probably already gonna have them, you're gonna

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.600
have talked somebody into being your hacker,
so.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:31.330
We would invest in people who weren’t technical
but it’s a bad sign if they don't have some

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.030
hackers pretty near by, right?

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:45.720
&gt;&gt;David: I guess I would make the distinction,
like first there's, there’s kind of like

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:57.330
truly non technical people, or like non-internet
people who are like English Majors and then

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.650
they worked at Proctor &amp; Gamble in marketing
or whatever, and these are people who like

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.740
don't even do the Internet and that kind of
stuff and that's like one type of non-technical.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:24.750
And then there are people who I think are
kind of are active web users and kind of Internet

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.120
people, and sometimes great user experience
user people aren't necessarily you know, hard

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500
core technical people, I would sort of consider
those like internet people though.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:44.280
And I think those, and then I think the third
category is kind of hard core engineers.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:57.070
I would sort of say it also depends so much
on the start up, the type of stuff that I

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.440
think most people here invest in.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.260
The best teams probably have a really strong
technical person and a really strong product

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260
person.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.370
The product person might not actually be like,
like whatever like, writing Python or whatever,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:24.490
but they kind of get the whole thing, and
this and that.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:32.560
I think they're in some, like I, there's one
company I invested in called Gerson Lehrman

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:42.160
Group which was a, sort of a, what I would
call a business model innovation out of Wall

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Street.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:51.460
And these guys knew Wall Street and this and
that, and they didn't really need to have

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:58.370
 -- it wasn't really a technology innovation
as much as a business model.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.830
So I think it just depends.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:12.330
&gt;&gt;Dick: So let me kind of push on this a little
bit with Brad and Albert.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:26.960
A couple of MBA's come into your office, they’re
non technical MBA's and they've got a business

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.930
plan around a digital media start up.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:43.000
How do you feel about that as opposed to some
very product focused tech folks coming in?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.660
&gt;&gt;Albert: So we've actually , I think passed
on a number of opportunities over the last

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.120
18 or 24 months that were sort of, of the
form, team comes in, it's four or five people.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.639
They have a very aggressive plan.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:08.050
But they have no line of code written and
they're looking to raise six or seven million

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.350
dollars and that makes us extremely nervous.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:21.140
And those were very capable teams from the
business side, and both of those, the specific

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.680
deals I'm thinking of, both got funded by
other VC's.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.000
But we, we didn’t think that, with that
kind of starting configuration that they would

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.599
have the DNA where technology would really
matter to the organization, and technology

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:40.159
would get built in a way to support the business
and there would be a product.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:49.839
And we feel that for a lot of the successful
businesses on the web, a lot of the leverage

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:54.709
in the business comes from the technology
working.

00:08:54.709 --> 00:09:06.829
And so for us having that sense that the technology
will work and will provide the leverage in

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:08.889
the business is pretty critical.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:09.889
&gt;&gt;Chris: No

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:16.490
&gt;&gt; Dick: I knew, I knew, I knew you were going
to help me out. [Laughs]

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:23.860
&gt;&gt;Dave:
Yeah, I mean I think the answer is you wouldn't

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:30.009
invest in a team that generally didn't have
some sort of geek talent on it.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:39.519
But I think the missing part of the question
is a lot of what we're investing in is consumer

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:53.449
internet and I think there’s a really significant
under emphasis on user experience and design

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:58.680
and sometimes when you say product, that is
that person.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:11.639
But a lot of times when people say product
it’s just a smart person who uses the web.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:21.929
And that doesn’t mean that they understand
user experience and really get that part of

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:23.550
it.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:40.059
And that's really essential for most of the
consumer and small business internet services

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.259
we're building.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:57.620
Even beyond that I think distribution is super
fuckin' important and people don't like, understand

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.920
how to do that.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.950
And I'm not talking about traditional marketing
but people understand scalable like, distribution.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.199
Be it search, be it social platforms.

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:15.309
Not just viral loops but any other type of
affiliate models.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:21.250
So understanding how to build product is great
on the user experience side as well as the

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.990
code, and then how to do distribution I think
is really important.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.259
&gt;&gt;Chris: Can I add a few words to my no?

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:30.259
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:31.259
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank You

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:33.439
&gt;&gt;Dick: I'm a kind and gentle moderator

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:40.940
&gt;&gt;Chris: One of the things when I look back
on, sort of all the, and we're casting this

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.790
as early stage investors…

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.790
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.570
&gt;&gt;Chris: coupled as founders.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.570
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:52.519
&gt;&gt;Chris: The best companies, the founders,
whatever their skill sets are, whether it's

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:59.470
one founder, two founders, or three founders
 -- each of the founders is completely and

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.800
totally obsessed with the product.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:11.290
And so to Dave's point whether they're focused
on the distribution dynamics of the product

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:20.040
or they're actually the ones heads down building
the product or they're the person that is

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.749
thinking about market fit -- the product and
what the product’s gonna do.

00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:30.869
The product is the orientation and that's
very different than, sort of the technical

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:34.450
founder who shows up and doesn't care so much
about the product but wants to be a co-founder

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.839
of a company that has a product.

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:36.839
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:43.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: And so in those combinations you
almost, when you're obsessed with a product

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.690
you almost always have to have, by definition,
somebody on that founding team that’s technical

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.709
because it’s really hard to be obsessed
with a product unless you're actually like

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:54.760
building stuff and doing stuff.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:04.269
The other thing I'd say to that is, I have
become completely allergic to the two MBA's

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:14.050
who outsourced the development to some consulting
firm to help them to get started because if

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:23.899
they haven't been able to figure out how to
attract somebody that’s going to live in

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.980
the product from the beginning.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:37.059
Doesn't mean they can't use another firm to
help them get things up and going early on,

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.899
but one of those founders sort of obsessively
living in the product.

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:41.899
&gt;&gt;Dick: OK great.

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:43.389
You know you mentioned something I want to
jump right in on.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:47.430
You mentioned coming in and founders talking
about market fit.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:55.500
You guys all invested in somewhat – invested
in different lifecycles of the company.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.310
Paul in from very, very, very early.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:04.759
Brad and Albert, you guys'll do B and C's
as well as A – and Steve.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:09.049
When you guys think about investing, Marc
Andreesen wrote a blog post -- I think it's

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:16.980
probably about two years ago now -- where
he talked about -- do I look for market or

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.629
the people or the product?

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.629
Right?

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:26.019
And he had a specific point of view on that.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:42.750
Is there any specific, one of those three
that you guys say trumps the other two?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.750
&gt;&gt;Paul: The people.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:49.420
Markets I think, when people say that they
prefer markets over people, they're usually

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:56.089
people like Marc Andreesen who have such fabulous
deal flow, that all the people they see are

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:57.089
great.

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:02.709
And so among these great people they take
the ones that are also in great markets.

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:03.709
Right?

00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:09.160
But unless you're in this weird situation,
really the people are the part that, that,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.989
that you can't change, right?

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:22.209
You can take great people and they can completely
change their idea, at least at our stage they

00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:23.339
frequently do.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.180
You can't change the people.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:36.989
So it's like with real estate, the one thing
you can't change about real estate is the

00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:38.959
location right?

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:43.319
People is like that for a startup.

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:52.459
&gt;&gt;Chris: So a wise person when I used to write
code a long time ago said that the best way

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:56.990
to make progress is to simplify the problem.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:04.079
And to reduce the dynamics and reduce the
constraints.

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.489
Something like that.

00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:16.449
This was before object method programming
and Ruby On Rails, so that's a whole different

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:18.369
path.

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:30.990
The, ah, I have in our firm at Foundry Group,
we've eliminated one of those three things

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:38.929
which is market in that we only invest in
things where we really understand the market

00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:54.129
and personally have huge affinity for
the markets that the companies that we're

00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:56.809
investing in go after.

00:16:56.809 --> 00:17:09.459
So that allows us to not worry about the market
dynamic with the entrepreneur on the front

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:13.720
end because we can eliminate that.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:24.630
And it's I think another way, when if you're
an entrepreneur, a way to think about is if

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:30.620
you're able to participate in a market that
you understand really well, that gets rid

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:38.210
of one of the pieces of complexity.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:45.010
Or if you can match up with investors who
understand the market really well that you're

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:55.419
going after, that gets rid of one of the pieces
of complexity that tends to be a very high

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:56.419
variable.

00:17:56.419 --> 00:18:07.250
&gt;&gt;Albert: So I think a lot of this has changed
because the nature of the businesses has changed

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.070
in many ways.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.830
So during the era where traditional enterprise
software was built, I think there was a style

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:19.419
of investing where people picked teams that
were known how to, they knew a particular

00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:25.720
market for enterprise software, they had a
sales person, they had a person who knew how

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.799
to build something, they had a Spec person.

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:37.220
But on the consumer internet, what we find
is, one of the most powerful things that a

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.240
company can have is engaged users.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.450
So it’s already launched, it has people
using the service, and they’re deeply engaged

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.929
in the service and there’s a feedback loop
that’s working between the users and the

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.230
people who are building the product.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:19:01.980
And as a result we've backed a number of startups
that have people where, if you looked at those

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.580
people on paper anyhow, they certainly would
not have gotten funding for a traditional

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.040
enterprise startup ever under any, any kind
of set of circumstances.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:17.789
But they've turned out to be great founders
for these kind of startups that are dealing

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:27.139
with engaged users, and dealing with products
where the design and the feel of the product

00:19:27.139 --> 00:19:29.480
makes a big difference.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:39.420
&gt;&gt;Dick: I'm going to, I'm gonna just ask one
more of my questions and then there are so

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.600
many people in here, I'm kind of gonna go
right to the Wave after that so we can get

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:50.060
lots of time for questions from the audience.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:57.789
I think that’s always a better approach
in rooms that are this crowded. So my last

00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:06.640
question that I'll ask you guys, and Mr. Dr
McClure I'll start with you 'since you're

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.650
sitting there pensively.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:17.380
Is, so we see their eyes of open source and
a general embrace of openness and almost a

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.269
constant buzz in the embrace of openness.

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:24.919
Actually you're a perfect person for this
question.

00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:34.159
But we also see the closed and proprietary
platforms like Apple, perform extremely well.

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:45.130
So purely from an investing perspective, how
do you think about open vs. proprietary?

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:51.039
&gt;&gt;Dave: So I'll take the bait here.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:56.100
Channeling Steve Jobs, openness for losers.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.480
[Quiet laughter from audience]

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.299
Proprietary standards are what in general
drive innovation and adoption.

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:12.000
And Open standards, sorry Proprietary drives
adoption and innovation.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.159
And open standards lowers costs and widens
the market.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:19.210
And there's definitely exceptions to those,
but I think most people who have cool products

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.110
and cool ideas want to preserve their advantage,
want to like establish sustainability.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.110
&gt;&gt;David: Exception.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.309
Exception; like the Internet for example.

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:29.309
[pause]

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:31.049
&gt;&gt;Chris: Or maybe Google.

00:21:31.049 --> 00:21:33.679
Google sounds like an exception.

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:34.730
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeaaahhh

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.429
&gt;&gt;Dave 2: HTTP. HTML being a, you know,

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:39.500
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:45.750
But I mean that was after, so Twitter is basically
a SMTP on a private basis.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.289
Do you think like, like does it service well
that Twitter's controlled by one company?

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:49.979
No, we don't have a fuckin' choice, sorry.

00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:55.149
You know, SMTP isn't, and yes we all get to
benefit from that.

00:21:55.149 --> 00:22:00.850
But you know, Twitter's gonna make a lot of
money because Twitter is not an open standard.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:09.179
&gt;&gt;David: So I think, you should, ah we’re
having this big Twitter battle on this topic,

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:10.179
so

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:18.120
&gt;&gt;Dave: So open standards definitely provide
foundations for other people to do amazing

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.950
things, I totally agree with that.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:43.299
&gt;&gt;David: So, and every time you, every time
you advocate openness first of all, it always

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:50.480
evolves into like you’re a socialist or
something.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:23:01.009
I'm a capitalist who believes that sometimes
having certain layers in the stack being open

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:05.840
actually increases overall Net innovation.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.779
&gt;&gt;Dave: Sometimes.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:13.590
&gt;&gt;David: And overall Net private wealth creation.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:22.960
Now I’m not saying all that, you know, if
you're a Twitter share holder, maybe its better

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.190
to have that all accrued to that single company.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:38.280
I would argue that having a subscription,
short subscription messaging protocol, be

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:47.110
open, the dominant one being open like SMTP
would lead to more Net private wealth creation.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:56.549
It's a capitalist phrase not socialist, than
having it controlled by a single company.

00:23:56.549 --> 00:24:06.730
So I think this should be an economic argument,
if you read, there's a lot of interesting

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.629
economic literature on the topic.

00:24:09.629 --> 00:24:18.659
I blog about it and I link to it if you ever
want; CDixon.org.

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:27.740
But it's not a political debate in my mind
 -- it's an economic debate and I think that,

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:38.320
like for example the fact that Http and HTML
seems to have opened some of the wealth creating

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.629
decisions of all time.

00:24:39.629 --> 00:24:44.860
So I just don't think, I just, so to me it's...

00:24:44.860 --> 00:25:01.740
&gt;&gt;Dave: The challenges there are that the
benefits of the wide open standard aren't

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:09.590
really available to everyone until it's open
and adopted as a standard

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:15.450
&gt;&gt;Dick: [interrupting] But it's just, just,
just...

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:25.649
&gt;&gt;Dave: On the way there it's not, it's a
lot of work for not a lot of compensation

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:30.760
when you're trying to get to that standard.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:43.429
Whereas on a proprietary basis you can immediately
start extracting value from the things that

00:25:43.429 --> 00:25:50.770
you're doing on a proprietary basis.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:58.279
&gt;&gt;Chris: The neat thing about that...

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:06.070
&gt;&gt;Dick: [interrupting] Just about from an
investing perspective.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:11.919
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, from an investing perspective.

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:23.960
The neat thing is we're 5 minutes into the
debate and we're not answering the question.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.080
So from an investing perspective, it doesn't
fucking matter.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.080
[Audience laughter]

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.289
&gt;&gt;Chris: Really, really, really simple.

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:37.700
Massive companies have been built on proprietary,
massive companies have been built on open;

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.639
it's incredibly chaotic and dynamic.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:44.950
That may be my wife, hang on.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.240
Ah, it's my aunt.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.559
It's my aunt I don't have to answer that.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.640
[Audience laughter]

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.679
The thing that’s so fascinating about the
open vs. proprietary dynamic is the business

00:26:56.679 --> 00:27:05.050
we're in is now so big and so chaotic and
changes so continually that the opportunity

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.830
to disrupt different segments exists.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:17.280
If you asked IBM in the mid '50's whether
open vs. closed was a better strategy and

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:23.960
then you asked the government in 1960 whatever,
I mean, all of these things moved very slowly

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.850
and ponderously because they were driven by
one or two very large companies.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:48.379
Today the disruption happens very widely and
I think that’s a source of innovation from

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:50.970
an investor perspective.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:57.019
There's tons of opportunities in either place.

00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:03.820
&gt;&gt;Paul: For startups, I mean, there’s, there’s
various senses of open, right?

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:11.710
There's like, software can be open source,
or protocols can be sort of public standards

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.860
decided by some slow moving committee.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:22.029
That part doesn't sound so exciting for a
startup.

00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:29.530
But the part that does sound exciting for
a startup is that there is just an enormous

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:42.909
number of programmers, and you guys in the
audience -- probably a lot of you are in this

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:48.809
group of people -- programmers want to write
code.

00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:54.220
There's this hugely powerful force of people
who want to create things.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:04.250
And if you have a start up where part of your
software can be created by the world at large,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:13.999
right, then you can harness this enormous
force of all these people who don't work for

00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:22.879
your company but wanna write code and be well
known or just produce something beautiful,

00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:23.879
you know.

00:29:23.879 --> 00:29:26.019
So to that extent, that’s exciting.

00:29:26.019 --> 00:29:33.519
If people seem like they’ve got a start
up that somehow is gonna get code that's very

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:39.129
valuable to their company written by this
massive recently unleashed force, that’s

00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:40.129
good.

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:47.080
&gt;&gt; Dick: Albert, do you have anything you
want to add?

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.720
&gt;&gt;Albert: Yeah.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.370
I do think there's one level of openness that
does matter from an investing perspective

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:59.840
and that is sort of, the level of openness
at the internet level.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.470
So I think we are not particularly concerned
that some people are trying to create within

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.610
the internet certain areas that they're trying
to control.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:16.549
We're not concerned about Twitter trying to
do that, Facebook trying to do that, Apple

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:19.450
trying to do that within their realms, because
there's still the Internet at large.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:26.200
So the only thing that we worry about from
an investment perspective is anything that

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.679
would kind of cut across the layers of the
internet. So, things like deep packet inspection

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:35.770
and traffic shaping at the access layer are
things that are of a concern because they

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:41.779
are things that unlevel the playing field
and make it hard potentially for you guys

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:42.890
to start the next Google.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.620
And that is something that we do worry about.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.620
&gt;&gt; Dick: Right.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:55.919
I'm going to go already to the Wave with the
first question here.

00:30:55.919 --> 00:31:08.779
Do you feel that web apps will replace the
need for native apps and if so, why?

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:16.590
And I guess we would then add on, tack onto
that, when you guys are evaluating questions

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:25.530
like this, like this one specifically right
here, how do you think about, what do you

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:30.230
look for when you think about competitive
advantage and how this is going to help or

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.230
hurt?

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.230
[pause]

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.230
Go ahead, Paul.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.230
&gt;&gt;Paul: Are the questions ranked?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.830
‘Cause that's such a great question.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:45.190
Did that get voted up, or did it just accidentally
happen to be the first?

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:53.080
&gt;&gt;Dick: It's got a little bit of voting up.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:32:09.909
There's been some voting up although it's
not totally Dory'd to use the Google term.

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:23.320
&gt;&gt;Paul: Ah, ‘cause that is a great question.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.101
My answer is I hope so.

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:31.639
‘Cause I’m very afraid a world in which
we are all Steve Jobs' slaves.

00:32:31.639 --> 00:32:32.639
[Audience laughter]

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:34.809
And I feel like [audience clapping] I mean,

00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:41.799
&gt;&gt;Dave: as long as we're getting paid 70 cents
on the dollar it's a pretty good slavery though.

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:49.779
&gt;&gt;Paul: We're not, we’re not even fully
his slaves yet and he's band us from using

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:50.779
compilers, right?

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:58.759
3.3.1 I feel like if anything can save us
it might be Chrome actually. Not Androids.

00:32:58.759 --> 00:32:59.759
&gt;Dick: Pandering.

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:02.799
Minus one point for pandering to the audience

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:09.039
&gt;&gt;Paul: No, no, no. I just dissed Android
in the second half of the sentence. I meant

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.799
Chrome rather than Android.

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:11.799
Because...

00:33:11.799 --> 00:33:20.980
&gt;&gt;Dave: If you had two startups come to you,
equal talent.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:34.350
One developing for Android, one developing
for Apple – which one are you going to pick?

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:37.580
&gt;&gt;Paul: Oh God, are you kidding?

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.059
Of course, the iPhone.

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:56.690
I’m talking about what I hope will make
us free, not what I hope will generate a lot

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.429
of returns.

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:00.169
[Audience laughter]

00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:16.580
Anyway, it's not the startups that are gonna
do this; it's the guys working on Chrome.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:31.150
What the guys, what the guys working on Chrome
ought to do is just say screw standards, we're

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:41.400
just gonna like introduce all kinds of features
to Chrome that will make web apps be as powerful

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.780
as native iPhone apps, iPad apps, whatever.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:54.620
So everybody can just write web apps, and
they don't have to be in the apps tour anymore.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.800
[Inaudible comment from Dave]

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.470
Is that what Joe Hewitt says? Well, a smart
guy. [Audience laughter]

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.870
&gt;&gt;Dick: So Brad, Brad, how do you feel about
that question?

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.700
&gt;&gt;Chris: I was thinking about the question
a different way.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.500
It feels too narrow a question ‘cause it’s
just focused on user facing apps.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:22.161
We have a lot of investments that, they’re
not web app possible. We're invested in a

00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:31.900
company called Oblong which was founded by
the guy who created the idea and the user

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.230
interface paradigm behind Minority Report.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:40.280
He worked for Spielberg and this is a company
that’s growing like crazy.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.880
Their thing is not a web app; it's a totally
different thing.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:52.190
And they're some of the best developers and,
and coders I've ever worked with.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:59.410
So I think this is a narrow question in the
context in a moment in time where we're now

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:06.520
dealing with HTML 5 vs. flash vs. a couple
of other things and we're going from a place

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:13.050
where the browser as a ubiquitous access point,
online still isn't a real thing but the browser

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:18.490
with the cache that’s active that actually
is intelligent and can be used offline without

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:24.460
a whole bunch of histrionics is a relevant
way to actually think about a programming

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.460
paradigm.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:31.780
So I think five years from now this question
wouldn't be a relevant question ‘cause it’s

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.140
gonna shift again.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.370
And it's gonna shift again about what’s
being built on top of what we're dealing with

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.370
today.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.770
&gt;&gt;Albert: And I think that’s the most important
point from an investment perspective.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:54.411
I think we would not look at something where
we would feel that the decisive factor and

00:36:54.411 --> 00:37:14.820
the success or lack of that company was whether
or not web apps were going to dominate or

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.090
app apps.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:27.680
So, I think things that approach things by
saying we're going to succeed in area X because

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:42.250
ours is a web app and the other guys is a
native app, probably not strong enough an

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.250
argument.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.940
There has to be some other difference, more
meaningful to them

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:55.670
&gt;&gt;Chris: And it just occurred to me that probably
nobody in this audience thinks a native app

00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:00.180
means something that’s installed on a Windows
7 desktop.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:08.260
It just occurred to me, because five years
ago that’s probably what a native app would

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:18.750
have meant to most of the people in an audience
like this, so just to point to the shift again.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:25.200
&gt;&gt;Dick: Chris I wanna, I wanna jump in, in
front of you saying something here ‘cause

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.950
I wanted to ask you a question on this point.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:43.010
Brad mentioned investing in Oblong which is
this kind of out there crazy user interface,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.150
that's all it really is, a user interface
right?

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:59.110
And you mentioned earlier investing in GLG;
Gerson Lehrman Group which is really investing

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.110
in a business model.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.000
So to this kind of, how do you think about
X vs. Y, when you're looking at deals like,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.150
when you invested in Gerson Lehrman Group
and for them, for the people in this audience

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:16.800
that are building something that’s like
totally out there, it's not an iPhone app,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.380
it's not an iPad app, but it’s this new
kind of thing, how do you think about yes

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.850
I believe this will have sustainable competitive
advantage or Yeah I'd buy into that, right

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.120
when you're thinking something about an Oblong
or Gerson Lehrman Group?

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.640
&gt;&gt;Dave: Wow, there was a bunch of questions
in there. Um.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.340
&gt;&gt;Dick: Well I'll narrow it down.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.930
How do you think about sustainable competitive
advantage

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.730
&gt;&gt;Dave: sustainable competitive advantage

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.130
&gt;&gt;Dick: when you get pitched on something?

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:50.790
&gt;&gt;Dave: So you mean sort of building on equity
value that’s defensible.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:58.010
I think, well I think like for example on
the consumer internet, you tend to see sort

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:03.440
of equity value, as it were, either through
a brand name, building a brand, like a real

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.350
consumer brand, network effects like Facebook
has incredible network effects; Twitter has

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.350
great network effects.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:13.160
Where they can be network effects for users
or it can be what’s called complimentary

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.060
network effects which is with third party
developers so obviously Microsoft sort of

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.870
builds incredible sustainable competitive
advantage that way.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:33.110
Or it can be pure technology which is less
frequent these days in sort of the web app

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.110
world.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:39.790
My last company was in security, consumer,
computer security that tends to have some

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:44.100
areas like that, there tends to be sort of
actual technology advantage.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:49.590
I mean of course anything you do as a startup
company, they can copy, it's just a question

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:54.130
of if it takes them 20 months and they have
some strategic reasons why they want to have

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.130
it built faster.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.600
I think there was another question?

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.770
Well anyways, does that kind of get to what
you're asking?

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.950
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah. Sure.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:18.550
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think a lot of times we’re too
focused on like what’s the technology du

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:35.320
jour and what’s kind of like cool and everything
and not so much just on basic distribution

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320
and modernization, so.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:43.230
As an investor the things I'm thinking of
right now are what platforms got me access

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.120
to 100 Million users or more and have decent
modernization, right?

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:56.670
So either on the distribution basis or modernization
basis I would say Facebook, Twitter, Native

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.420
search on Google, paid search on Google, YouTube
which most people don't think about as a distribution

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.220
platform, Apple, maybe Android in the future,
and then potentially I think Gmail is actually

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.430
interesting for us and bPlatform.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:13.590
So like when you start to think about like
I'm in control of building a great product

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:25.410
‘cause I'm an engineer I know I can build
a great product.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:33.960
If I'm customer focused, I can make sure people
like it.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:43.360
Then the biggest challenge is how do I get
out to a bunch of users.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.100
So, figuring out scalable distribution channels,
whether they're paid or free, is generally

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.470
not something that engineers know how to do
unless they’ve actually been in a company

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.360
where that’s been you know, part of the
ethos.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.740
So I know you probably know how to build a
product, if you have a good designer or user

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.170
experience pro, person on staff, you might
actually get the user to understand that you've

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:12.040
got a good product, but then you got to get
it out to a hundred thousand people and I

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:23.560
don't think we pay enough attention to how
do we do the distribution layers.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:32.930
&gt;&gt;Dick: This has been the question up here
that’s been voted up here a lot is a simple

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:38.030
one; what is your favorite kind of investment.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:46.330
Why don't we start with Albert and go down,
go down the line?

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.270
&gt;&gt;Albert: The one that makes money

00:43:49.270 --> 00:44:01.420
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yes. Which leads then to the second
part of that question which is what are the

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:08.970
kinds of returns you expect to see or hope
to see?

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.420
&gt;&gt;Albert: I actually did want to come back
to this question.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420
Sorry.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.410
I really think that this question of what
is sustainable competitive advantage is a

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:21.490
much more interesting one because I do think
that there was a longer technology cycle some

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:24.360
time where there was real technology differentiation
mattered a lot.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.360
And it’s not clear that that’s how significant
that's going to be in the future.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.720
So one that wasn't mentioned, and I think
it’s very important to mention is data.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.440
So you could come up with a much better, quote
unquote, algorithm than Google, but it wouldn't

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.890
help you very much because you wouldn't have
access to the search volume, or the historic

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.890
search data.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.450
So we think a lot about data assets as being
one of the few things that’s actually defensible.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:55.880
I've recently for some reason, sometimes startups
come in bunches, I've seen a whole bunch of

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:03.870
startups that are all in the we're going to
monitor your cloud infrastructure or your

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:11.210
servers in the cloud and they all have roughly
the same feature set, so when you think about

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:22.560
how they compete with each other, the only
thing that really matters is who gets the

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.800
most servers quickly and does the best job
with that data.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:43.110
That’s gonna be virtually impossible for
anybody who starts later to replicate.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.700
[Pause]

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:58.970
Sorry I didn't answer the other question.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:05.440
&gt;&gt;Dave: Answer the other question.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.240
&gt;&gt;Albert: No, no.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.880
I've passed the microphone

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.581
&gt;&gt;Chris: So as a firm foundry group invests
in a handful of very broad horizontal themes

00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:12.581
so I don't have a favorite amongst those,
but I'll describe one, so that you get sort

00:46:12.581 --> 00:46:14.760
of the sense of how I think about it at least.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.400
I, I have a long standing premise that if
you go forward 20 years, the way that we interact

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:29.070
with computing and computer devices and software
will be radically different than we do today.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.490
And just this conference is an example.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:40.500
If you think about how you interacted with
computing and data and software 20 years ago

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.260
vs. how you're doing it in real time here,
it's completely different.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:53.420
I think the idea that people have laptops
in their laps that are connected and they're

00:46:53.420 --> 00:47:01.130
looking up at a screen with stuff like this
in this kind of interaction paradigm is not

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.020
how it's gonna be 20 years from now.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:06.010
And in 40 years I think hopefully the machines
will be friendly to us.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.010
[Audience laughter].

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.720
And so that's a deeply held belief.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:21.660
And so I'm completely focused from an investment
perspective in things that are addressing

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.200
that with that kind of an arc.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:30.940
I want to be an investor in companies that
are radically changing the way that we interact

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.790
with mice, keyboards, data, interface, etc.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.040
And that’s a theme of ours we call Human
Computer Interaction.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:45.130
It covers a lot of different places, and there's
an awful lot of stuff in that, in that, in

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.120
that zone that we wouldn't invest in.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.580
But it’s interesting when you land on something
as an investor where, and obviously you have

00:47:54.580 --> 00:48:02.320
to have deep technical roots to be able to
do some of this stuff because they're hard

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.320
things.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:22.050
But you also have to have a level of creativity
where you can look forward in terms of how

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:30.310
we're gonna interact and how we're gonna think
about that interaction.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:35.000
So I mean I could drill through the other
things that we have but that’s an example,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.240
one of the things that gets me excited.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.120
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think there's different dynamics
for large VC vs. small VC. Large VC, one lets

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.270
say that’s 250 million dollars in greater
under management

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.010
&gt;&gt;Chris: That’s still small VC.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.060
&gt;&gt;Dave: How much?

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.060
Yeah OK.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:52.310
I mean I think you have to create new ecosystems
and platforms right.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:56.820
So you have to envision the new Facebook,
the new Google, the new whatever.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.300
Whereas smaller investors can probably play
into existing ecosystems and create businesses

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:05.170
that are like riding on top of this.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:11.460
So I think I like business where I understand
what problems being solved.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:18.610
I don't necessarily need you to create the
next greatest browser, you know phone device,

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:19.610
whatever.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.780
I want you to figure out how to teach my kids
to read Spanish.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:32.790
And that’s like not necessarily a sexy problem,
but I tell you if you figured like an online

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:46.410
education product for kids to learn Spanish
in the U.S between the ages of zero and Seven,

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.810
I'm fuckin' interested.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.980
That’s a big market.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:54.110
People are gonna pay for that.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.110
Probably Mandarin too, at least in another
five years, so like don't, I don't think most

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.110
people do that.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:02.210
I think there's a lot of entrepreneurs that
are, for lack of any better description, are

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:08.500
young male, white, under 25 with glasses,
that are left handed, and they’re building

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:14.710
games and entertainment and music things that
they like to use.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:26.510
And I don't think there's enough people in
the 30-50 demographic with kids that are building

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:39.270
stuff, and that audience is very much online
these days, that's very monetizable and I

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:57.360
would encourage the entrepreneurs in the audience
to talk to your moms and talk to your uncles

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:07.710
and aunts and parents and like figure out
what kind of problems they have and solve

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.650
some of those.

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:20.670
‘Cause they're a lot easier to monetize
than the next damn newsreader or music service.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:36.440
&gt;&gt;Chris: Let me challenge one thing that you
said which is I think,

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:42.650
I think, I'd argue a dichotomy between sort
of large fund vs. small fund dynamic.

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:53.260
I think it’s horizontal thinker vs. vertical
thinker, and I think you find them all over

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:58.210
the place, you find them in different places.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:13.820
So what Dave just described was a very vertical
market segmentation type of application which

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:20.330
I think that, there's, there is a lot of places
where there’s opportunity there, where there

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:23.360
aren’t that many people chasing after it.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:31.010
Then I think there's horizontal opportunities
which could be a new platform, but they could

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:42.600
also be something that touches lots of different
types of customers, much more generalizable.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:58.950
And I actually think that independent of fund
size, big or small, you can be a successful

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:18.170
investor in either place, but I think it's
very hard to be a successful investor in both

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.170
types.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:28.170
So when I've experienced other VC's that have
tried to invest in vertical things and horizontal

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:38.671
things they tend to get tangled up in it.

00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:41.730
You have to have a framework for how to think
about it.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:54.080
And I think as entrepreneurs, a lot of entrepreneurs
get whiplashed from VC's who say well go after

00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:08.330
your first vertical market, you have to go
find some customers, dah dah dah dah dah,

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:15.290
and that’s going to evolve into a horizontal
thing.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:20.370
When in fact the right approach to it is to
define the horizontal thing, build the infrastructure,

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:27.970
a la Twitter, and then worry about the vertical
segmentation of it down the road.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:42.890
I'm not making an opinion about one being
better than the other; I think they're just

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:56.050
very hard to mix together in the same person's
brain.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:07.150
&gt;&gt;David: Breadth versus Depth versus programmer

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.850
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:20.190
&gt;&gt;Dick: So Chris what’s your, what are your,
what are the things you look at that you say

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:23.830
this is really super appealing to me?

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:29.700
&gt;&gt;Chris: So I do investing on the side, and
I'm fulltime working on a startup.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.590
And I had a previous startup

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.860
&gt;&gt;Dick: You don't have to apologize for investing.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.820
&gt;&gt;Chris: [laughs] I just wanna say that

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.330
&gt;&gt;Dave: It's OK to be a VC.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.160
&gt;&gt;Chris: So I've pitched many, many VC's and
I sit there in these meetings, and most of

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:51.250
them are sort of saying OK like, my last company
was called Site Advisor, an internet security

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:54.740
company, and they were like OK let me analyze,
I don’t know anything about consumer securities

00:55:54.740 --> 00:56:01.250
right now, but let me go and learn about it
and try to predict the future and decide whether

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.190
your idea is good.

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:09.520
And I just think that method is a really bad
method for investing.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.040
I mean I think, this is what is called thesis
driven investing.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:18.220
I think it's possible to do well if you're
very focused, like I think the Union Square

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:25.610
team and I think Brad is. I, I just sort of
think it's like a form of intellectual modesty

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:31.650
to say I can't predict the future so for example,
and I've just become from thinking like it's

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.280
80% about people to it's 99.9% about people,
so I just invested in you know, Moot's new

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.280
thing, he's a 4Gen guy, he's like this 21
year old and he's created this thing that’s

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280
got 10 million kids using it.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.640
I mean the idea that I’m gonna go in and
like analyze what the 21 years olds are gonna

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640
do tomorrow, I mean I think it's preposterous.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.640
All I know is this guy has done a lot of really
cool stuff, and I like to, I like to back

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640
people like that.

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640
And I'm not going to try to predict the future.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.640
I guess I'm sort of copying here off Paul’s
methods.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:49.810
&gt;&gt;Paul: I had a long time to think about the
answer to this question, sitting on the end

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:50.810
here.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.720
So I went through various answers actually
for what my favorite kind of investment was,

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.720
but I decided in the end it's the company,
the idea that’s just on the right side of

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.720
crazy.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720
Because just as with scientific ideas the
very best, you know the most exciting scientific

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.720
papers, are the kind that draws some, actually
this is true for mathematical proofs too,

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.720
that end up with some conclusion that makes
you say really?

00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720
That’s true?

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.720
And the most exciting sort of startups to
work on and impossibly also the highest returning

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:12.850
ones are the ones that have ideas that are
so out there, they just really seem dubious

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.460
when you first start.

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:15.620
So I remember Air BnB for example.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.110
When they first came to us I said, really?

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.630
People wanna like stay on one another’s
sofas and stuff?

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:23.340
And they said yeah it's true, we’re surprised
too, but they do.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340
[Laughs]

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.340
Right?

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.590
And like those guys, I mean, I'm not even
supposed to tell you how well those guys are

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.600
doing actually, ah, they're really doing well.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600
So I love that kind of thing.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:41.850
And it would be, it would be great if that
turned out to be the kind of startup that

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:47.220
had the highest returns too because then my,
my selfish desires and my responsibility to

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.370
our investors would, would line up.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:55.460
&gt;&gt;Albert: One word that we think about a lot
when we think about what our favorite startups

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.190
are is the word Native.

00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:03.300
Which is, if you take certain enterprise systems
for example, people are saying well I'm gonna

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:11.750
do the same thing that Enterprise company
XY is doing, and I'm gonna do it on the web

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:13.100
and I’m gonna make it 20% cheaper, or 20%
faster.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.310
And that’s not native to the web.

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:19.640
So native to the web is trying to figure out
what could I do on the web that the enterprise

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.710
company could've never done and will never
be able to do.

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:28.670
What can I do on a mobile phone that can't
be done on a browser that sits on somebody’s

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:29.670
laptop?

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:34.830
How do I make use of something that's native,
completely native to that experience?

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:41.250
And so we think the most interesting startups
are the ones that figure out what the native

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:45.570
model is that’s now enabled that didn’t
exist previously and often those native models

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:46.570
tend to sound crazy at first, like we're gonna
give the software away.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:47.570
It’s gonna be completely free.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:48.570
&gt;&gt;Paul: And the first version is derided as
a toy.

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.570
&gt;&gt;Albert: Yes.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:50.570
&gt;&gt;Paul: Right?

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.570
&gt;&gt;Albert: Yes

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:52.570
&gt;&gt;Paul: That's very important.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:53.570
We look for that actually.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:54.570
When people build something they say oh it
works, but this is a toy, this isn't serious.

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:55.570
Not yet.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:56.570
It's like micro computers, right?

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:57.570
Toy computers.

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:58.570
&gt;&gt;Dick: Ah, I'm gonna, Albert, you're now
in charge of managing the Wave so you have

00:58:58.570 --> 00:58:59.570
to refresh it once in a while.

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:00.570
I'm delegating while I ask the next question.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.570
Which is, so again I'm trying to think of
questions here from the perspective of entrepreneurs

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:02.570
in the audience.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:08.460
One of the things that frustrated a lot of
entrepreneurs that I know, would be they'd

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:14.500
go into investors and pitch them and the investors
would say look I like the product, I like

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.230
the technical founders but I don't think you
guys are gonna be, should be the managers

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:17.240
of the company, right?

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.910
What, when is it OK for the founders, the
tech founders to manage the, to be the managers

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:22.910
of the company?

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:23.910
When is it not?

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.910
And do you really know at the beginning or
do you give them a chance to try and manage

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:25.910
it themselves?

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:26.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: If they want to.

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:27.910
If they wanna be the managers, they should
be the managers.

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:28.910
And if they don't, they shouldn’t.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:29.910
I mean maybe if we were later stage and we
had to deal with disasters caused by people,

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:30.910
by hackers who weren't suitable to manage
corporations maybe we would think differently.

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:31.910
But in our world at least, if the founders
wanna be in charge, they can be in charge;

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:32.910
if they wanna get somebody else to be in charge,
they can.

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:33.910
Whatever they want.

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:34.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Sure, but so, let me just -- let’s
push back on that a little bit. We've all

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.910
heard of the, at least I’ve heard of the
situation where entrepreneurs go in and pitch

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:36.910
a seed round or an A round, and they get back
“you guys are great, you're passionate.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:37.910
I don't really think you guys are the guys
to run this company.”

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:38.910
What's happening there?

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:39.910
What are the dynamics there?
What should the people in the audience...

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:40.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: You get that less and less actually.

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.910
VC's, even VC's that are notorious for firing
founders seem to be coming around to doing

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:42.910
it less.

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:43.910
They've learned that like, you fire the founders,
the company sucks anyway, and all you get

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:44.910
is a bunch of bad PR and it doesn't really
improve your returns.

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:45.910
You’re gonna make the big money from Google,
you know, not from some...

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:46.910
&gt;&gt;David: I think you deal with the good VC's
‘cause there's still, there's still plenty

00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:47.910
of VC's I see that do this, that play these
games.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:48.910
I saw something recently where a guy who'd
joined up with an MIT scientist and then the

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:49.910
VC's tried to like cut and go directly to
the scientist and cut.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:50.910
I mean it's still happening.

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:51.910
It's just ridiculous.

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:52.910
It’s like, I think, you look at the good
VC's, they bet, they find great teams like

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:53.910
you guys do or, and they bet on them and maybe
three years down the road, when you're like

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:54.910
growing really big you bring in, you know,
with the consent of the founders professional

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:55.910
management, but the idea of like switching
out early is just I think, disastrous and

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:56.910
unethical in many cases.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think there's a, there is a nuance
that’s the difference between switching

00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:58.910
out early and the VC not being able to just
say I'm just not interested, which is sometimes

00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:59.910
what you're getting as code for I'm not interested.

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:00.910
And a situation where you're raising an early
stage round and you’re going after something

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:01.910
that is very big and you acknowledge that
it's very big, and whether it's, in Paul’s

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:02.910
language, you don't wanna be the person running
it, or you really need a partner for some

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:03.910
reason, the bad behavior is to simply tell
you your not the right person.

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:04.910
The good behavior at least from my perspective
is to say we really like what you're doing,

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.910
we're really interested in working with you,
you need another person on the team that looks

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:06.910
like this.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:07.910
And that person might be CEO, it might be
a COO, it might be a technical co-founder

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:08.910
but you need another person in the box.

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:09.910
And we're gonna help you, not by pushing our
guy or gal on you, but by here's some people

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:10.910
that we know.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.910
And that's what becomes interesting to us,
and you help us find that.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:12.910
I've been through this a handful of times
with seed stage companies.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:13.910
NewsGator which I'm an investor in is one
the co-founder was, or the founder was CTO

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.910
or he was a CTO and he thought he wanted to
be a CEO but he didn’t know what being a

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:15.910
CEO was.

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:16.910
And he actually didn’t want to be the CEO,
he wanted to be the CTO, he just didn’t

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:17.910
know what that meant.

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:18.910
And the VC saying after you've made the investment,
“OK now I need to bring my boy in,” is

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:19.910
really crappy.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:20.910
The VC saying before the investment “Hey
I'm not sure you really know what you wanna

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:21.910
do here Mr. first time entrepreneur, let's
talk about it some more and go deeper.”

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:22.910
I think that’s a constructive conversation.

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:23.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think that there's like intellectual
honesty which is important in the founders

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:24.910
in understanding like what part of the company
cycle you're driving and what you're qualified

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:25.910
to do is important.

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:26.910
So I'm not gonna like, fire any founders.
I'm generally not taking any board seats so

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:27.910
I'm not doing that anyway but it does piss
me off when there’s people who are running

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:28.910
these companies who are obviously not qualified
to be doing the things they're trying to do

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.910
and they're not honest with themselves about
being the person to do it.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:30.910
So like, you could simplify and say, you know,
there's three sort of basic stages that you

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:31.910
roll through as a company, which is Product,
Market, Revenue.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:32.910
Like, can you build the product?

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:33.910
Ok great.

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:34.910
That someone likes to use.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:35.910
How big is the market, or what market can
you actually get to that you can get distribution

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:36.910
into?

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:37.910
That may be a different role than the person
who’s building the product and that person

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:38.910
doesn’t have to run the company but you
need to have them in the organization.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:39.910
But then at some point you need to be scalably
sustainable at some level.

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:40.910
You can't keep raising money forever, unless
you're Jeff Bezos.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:41.910
[laughs]

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:42.910
And I think having a timeframe under which
you reach some level of sustainable revenue

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:43.910
is important.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:44.910
So those three things are very different roles.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:45.910
There's very few people who as CEO's can manage
the transition from each of those things.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:46.910
Can you build the product?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:47.910
Can you scale the product to a large audience?

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:48.910
And can you manage a large organization sustainably
and financially?

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:49.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I would only add one more thing to
that, which is, if I look backwards on the

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.910
portfolio that we built in the last 3 or 4
years, which is 20 something companies.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:51.910
On almost every case the founding team is
the team that's running the business.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:52.910
So, coming back to the people thing, I think
there is, we're really focused on that founding

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:53.910
team at the beginning which might incorporate
a new person who’s not there in that first

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:54.910
meeting, but that’s the team that becomes
the team that builds the business.

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:55.910
And augmenting that founding team with the
right people is much more important than firing

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:56.910
somebody and bringing in a new person.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:57.910
Because then I totally agree with Paul having
been through this historically a lot.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:58.910
The company's fucked and you may as well move
on.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.910
And there are very few cases where you get
recovery from that.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.910
And the one exception is when you get to the
sort of product step function, you're out

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.910
20, 30 million bucks and you've now transitioned
from this hyper growth business to one that’s

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:02.910
profitable and the original CEO entrepreneur
runs out of gas because of their own experience,

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.910
and that does happen sometimes.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:04.910
And that’s I think where the intellectual
honesty comes in.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:05.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Can we get a microphone going around
in the room; I think there's some in the back

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:06.910
somewhere?

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:07.910
[Inaudible comment from audience member]

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Aha.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:09.910
Yeah.

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:10.910
I also want to get a microphone going around
just so people can ask questions from the

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:11.910
audience.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:12.910
But three second gut check, let’s do this
one.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.910
Three second gut check; would you invest in,
if I ask for a, if I ask for a, how ever you

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:14.910
pronounce that word?

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:15.910
The, ah, you know what I mean.

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:16.910
&gt;&gt;David: I haven't met the team.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:17.910
I'd wanna meet them first.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:18.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: The open Facebook thing.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:19.910
&gt;&gt;David: But I think investing in a direct
competitor of Facebook is probably not a value

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:20.910
creating activity.

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:21.910
[Laughter from audience]

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:22.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: All right.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:23.910
Ok, perfect.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.910
This is great.

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:25.910
All right.

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:26.910
What are some of the, perfect, now they're
rated.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.910
What are some of the big no-no's for startups.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:28.910
Let’s go, let’s go Paul, start with you
this time.

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:29.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: Give me that.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:30.910
The biggest like, some big no-no's, boy there’s
so many no-no's.

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:31.910
It's a world of no-no's.

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:32.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Let’s go your big, for each of you
what’s the biggest, like Oh my God.

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:33.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: Taking too long, too long to launch
and in building something for like some theoretical

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:34.910
user that you believe exists somewhere but
is not you or anybody you actually know.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.910
[Audience laughter]

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:36.910
&gt;&gt;David: Well I think you had a great post
didn't you recently, like 22 no-no's or something?

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:37.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: 18

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:38.910
&gt;&gt;David: 18 no-no's, which I probably agree
with all of those.

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:39.910
I think it's all about beginning the team,
finding the right people.

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:40.910
It’s like a marriage.

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:41.910
That's it.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:42.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Dave’s looking at Paul’s Post
now.

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah. I was just gonna recreate the
post.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:44.910
Just fuckin' launch, I mean that's...

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:45.910
Well actually the other thing is gathering
a whole bunch of analytics that you don't

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:46.910
do anything with.

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:47.910
So like, it's great that you have some big
ass Google analytics report with all sorts

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:48.910
of graphs and charts.

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:49.910
But if you don't like make a decision about
your product or your market based on the analytics,

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:50.910
they're fucking worthless and it's a waste
of time.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:51.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: So I'll do one very general, one
very specific

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:52.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: You two are like enabling each other
to swear more, I'm noticing. Brad and

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:53.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I didn't swear, that wasn't swearing,
I was going to swear.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:54.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: All right, I’m going to let it go
for now.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:55.910
[Audience laughter]

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: What’s wrong with that? So, so
the general one that’s a no-no in my mind

01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:57.910
is fear. So every single person in this room
is going to die. That is a fact.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:58.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: [inaudible comment]

01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:59.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: No.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:00.910
You will die, you will die.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:01.910
There may be some changes that prevent you
from dying, but based on current reality you

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:02.910
will die.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:03.910
[Inaudible comments from audience].

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:04.910
That's true.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:05.910
So I believe in the context of being a startup
entrepreneur, fear is not useful, where fear

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:06.910
is a construct that is fear of uncontrollable
and unknowable things.

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:07.910
Which is linked directly to just Launch.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:08.910
Right?

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:09.910
Again I said I was being abstract.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:10.910
The entrepreneurs who are tentative, hesitant,
uncomfortable, afraid, hold back; that’s

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:11.910
a warning sign.

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:12.910
The ones that are willing to make mistakes,
screw up, throw it away, try again, keep going

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:13.910
and just drive forward, those are the ones
that I wanna work with.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:14.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Is that a, is that a corollary to
the old , you know the, the, the, I think

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:15.910
it's a Winston Churchill quote which is something
like I'd rather make a, a , a, I'd rather

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:16.910
make a 100 decisions, 51 of which were right
rather than as opposed to two great decisions.

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: Absolutely.

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:18.910
You need to make the two great decisions in
the context of a startup or you won't be successful.

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:19.910
And Winston Churchill made a couple of great
decisions along with the ones that he made

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:20.910
wrong.

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:21.910
But he was willing to make a lot of decisions
versus hang around and optimize for those

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:22.910
exact one or two.

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:23.910
&gt;&gt;Albert. Um, two big no-no's I think are
doing too many things, not being focused.

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.910
And confusing venture capital as a goal as
opposed to a means.

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:25.910
&gt;&gt;Dick.: OK. Is proof of concept always needed
to get Capital? Or what stage does a company

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:26.910
need to be at when they deliver?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.910
So Paul, I know you’re gonna answer.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:28.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: If they really mean VC, usually yes.
Maybe if you were a super famous person, you

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:29.910
know like Moot or something like that.

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Or MC Hammer.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:31.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: [laughs] Yeah.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:32.910
You wouldn't need to.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:33.910
But for ordinary, ordinary people, yes.

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:34.910
I mean if the VC's don't already know your
name, then you gotta have some kind of proof.

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:35.910
I mean I'm assuming that this means literally
VC, like series A rounds. I mean it’s not

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:36.910
needed for us.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:37.910
&gt;&gt;David: I would say like, that in defense
of Moot, that the important thing with Moot

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:38.910
was not that he was a celebrity.

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.910
The important thing was that he built interesting
stuff.

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:40.910
Right?

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:41.910
Like.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:42.910
Yeah yeah.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:43.910
That to me is, so I think it's more like you've
built something, whether the thing you've

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:44.910
built is the thing you're pitching is separate.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:45.910
But I'm much more impressed by somebody who
can come in and say I built this open source

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.910
project or I did some, whatever, built something,
than I am whatever, resume, or mockups or

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:47.910
whatever.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah and just on that previous thing
that we were talking about product market

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:49.910
team before.

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:50.910
Product is the mirror for team.

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:51.910
Like you can tell me you've got a great team
but if your product blows and you've been

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:52.910
at it for a while, like sorry you don't have
a great team.

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:53.910
[Laughs].

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:54.910
So like as much as team matters, product is
the evidence of their efforts and the product

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:55.910
should be awesome.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:56.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think especially if you take a
developer perspective to the question, as

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.910
an investor whether I'm doing a seed investment
or a series A investment, it's generally true.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:58.910
It's much more impressive to play with and
react to the thing you've created than go

01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.910
through a PowerPoint presentation, right?

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:00.910
And in fact I don't want to go through that
PowerPoint presentation; I don't want you

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:01.910
spending your time on that.

01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:02.910
I want you spending your time on building
something and getting it out there for people

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:03.910
to play with

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:04.910
That's your PowerPoint presentation.

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: I remember pitching you Feedburner
and on like slide one you were like uhuh,

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:06.910
uhuh, uhuh.

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:07.910
Well all right, we'll just put this slide
aside.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:08.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: But at the same time you can go a
little long on product.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:09.910
I mean like it's great to show me product
for 5, 10, 15 minutes.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:10.910
But after like 35 minutes, I kind of wanna
know hey do you have any kind of business

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:11.910
model?

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:12.910
Do you know, have you done any customer surveys
on the product that you're showing me?

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:13.910
Like it's not the only thing.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:14.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Yeah.

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:15.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: Nothing bad.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:16.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Nothing bad.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:17.910
Ah, OK there was another, OK here it is.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:18.910
What’s the largest social issue that the
brightest mind should be working on tackling?

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:19.910
And I think this is one you could probably
talk about for 10 minutes or 20 minutes or

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:20.910
so but just, if you had to pick one, what’s
a social issue that you think that people

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:21.910
should be working on and using technology
to solve.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:22.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: I know this sounds really boring but
I mean, if you could figure out a way to like

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:23.910
make electric power generation 1% more efficient.

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:24.910
That would just improve people's lives enormously,
right?

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:25.910
These little mundane things are actually much
bigger than you know, curing one particular

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:26.910
dramatic disease.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:27.910
So I would say actually odd as this seems,
this is one big thing I look for; introducing

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:28.910
market pricing to do a means that didn't have
it previously, right.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:29.910
&gt;&gt;David: I think in at least the IT space,
probably education.

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:30.910
I think there's a lot of opportunity there.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:31.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm a big fan of using financial engineering
to open up markets that previously didn't

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:32.910
exist.

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:33.910
So micro finance is one particularly amazing
thing.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:34.910
But like, mortgage markets, before mortgage
markets existed, like that was a pretty cool

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:35.910
piece of technology in its day.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:36.910
I mean the last 10 years of like financial
crisis aside we are a better society as a

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:37.910
result of

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:38.910
[background laughter and banter]

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Chris’ comment was ‘that worked
well’.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:40.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: the mortgage crisis.

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:41.910
It’s easy to pile onto that shit and like
there are many, many, many people who could

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:42.910
not buy homes 100 years ago because we didn’t
have the advent of financial markets and mortgage

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:43.910
markets and in the other countries not in
the U.S where we don't have savings and other

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:44.910
law in property rights.

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:45.910
That’s really important to capital formation
so financial engineering is a technology that

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:46.910
I think too many people don't pay attention
to because it can move mountains.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: This room is full of very smart people.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:48.910
I think the best thing that everybody in this
room could do is allocate a small portion

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:49.910
of their energy to making the rest of society
smarter.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:50.910
So back to education.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.910
If you look at the correlation between human
progress and education, direct correlation.

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:52.910
And I think if you look at our government
and the government dynamics and if we could

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:53.910
tell the government stop messing around with
stuff and just put all that money into education,

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.910
make us smarter as a country, or whatever
country you're from, that would have huge

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:55.910
impact.

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:56.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: Making education free for everybody.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:57.910
Which I think is possible with the internet.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:58.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: We're gonna combine a couple of questions
here.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:59.910
One I see up here and one I saw earlier.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:00.910
I'm gonna, I’m gonna interpret the third
one up there.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:01.910
How do you guys value companies when they’re
pre-revenue?

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:02.910
Right?

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:03.910
I think that’s another question entrepreneurs
have all the time.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:04.910
And then I think I'll combine that with, combine
that with, there was a question earlier that

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:05.910
said is there another investing, are we in
another bubble in the investing side?

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:06.910
We're starting to see startups with crazy
valuations again.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:07.910
And is this just gonna constantly keep on
happening where you go up and down up and

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.910
down, up and down every other year?

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:09.910
Or, or, is it going to accelerate?

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:10.910
Is it gonna stabilize?

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:11.910
How do you guys think about that?

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.910
Right?

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:13.910
And I'm asking it from the perspective of
those entrepreneurs in the audience who hear

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:14.910
that, this question and answer thing got valued
at a Bazillion dollars and then they've got

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:15.910
something that they think is a lot farther
along and then they hear from a VC you know,

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:16.910
I'll give you one on two pre.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:17.910
So how do you guys – how should they be
thinking about that?

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:18.910
Is it just supply and demand?

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:19.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I would actually say, let me start
with the, the bubble dynamics.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:20.910
And I've been investing since -- I started
investing in 1994 with my own money, so I’ve

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:21.910
been sort of through a couple of cycles now.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:22.910
Don't, as an entrepreneur who's raising money,
don't over value your imperfect market data

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:23.910
to drive your thought process.

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:24.910
If you’re trying to create a really large
business over a long period of time, you're

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:25.910
gonna go through whatever those dynamics are
and you want to create a situation where you

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:26.910
are in a position where you have control over
what’s going on as quickly as you can.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:27.910
That’s gonna drive the largest ownership
of the business.

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:28.910
If you try to optimize at every valuation
point, you’ll get confused based on what

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:29.910
the market dynamic is.

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:30.910
So personally I actually don't pay that much
attention to the broad market dynamic ‘cause

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:31.910
I figure it’s gonna go up, and it gonna
go down, it's gonna move around.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:32.910
I focus as an investor much more in do I want
to be a partner with the people in this company

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:33.910
trying to build something really significant.

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:34.910
And I go back to I think there's a bunch of
VC's who are very mathematically oriented,

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:35.910
I need to have a certain percentage of the
company, I have to get this much money to

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:36.910
work, blah blah blah blah blah.

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:37.910
It's total bullshit.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:38.910
I mean the great people wanna be invested
with great entrepreneurs on things that could

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:39.910
be enormous.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:40.910
And that's what you should be looking for
in an investor.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:41.910
And as an entrepreneur you should be trying
to create something that has that kind of

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:42.910
potential and that’ll drive it more than
the macro stuff.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:43.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Albert do you have anything you want
to add?

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:44.910
[Pause]

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:45.910
Ok I'm going to hop to one more question that
I, that I, go ahead.

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:46.910
Albert looks like...

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:47.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: it's either a really great answer
or a really crappy answer.

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:48.910
One of the two.

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:49.910
[Albert tries to talk, but is over spoken
by Dave]

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:50.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: So no product – zero to 1 million.

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:51.910
Product/No customer -- 1-2 million.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:52.910
Product and customer, not profitable -- 2-3
million.

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:53.910
Product, customer, profitable; 3-5 million
pre.

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:54.910
5 million final offer.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:55.910
[pause]

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:56.910
Done?

01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:57.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: I do think that there are these
waves.

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:58.910
But I also think there's also something else
going on which is in some of these areas,

01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:59.910
there’s been almost a winner takes all but
certainly a difference of you know, several,

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:00.910
one or two orders of magnitude in value between
the leading company and the second company.

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:01.910
And so if you think that you're investing
in the leader, almost any price at which you

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:02.910
invest will turn out to have been a good price.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:03.910
I remember when somebody was investing in
Facebook at a Billion, and people were like

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:04.910
ick, that’s crazy.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:05.910
Well that turns out at least as of right now,
to seem to have been a pretty good investment.

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:06.910
So I think that when you have dynamics, in
areas where you have dynamics where they could

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:07.910
be winner take all effects, the distortions
in the valuations could be very, very substantial

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:08.910
that result from that.

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.910
&gt;&gt;David: I think there’s two real quick
things.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:10.910
One is you can't make a great company through
financing but you can kill it through bad

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:11.910
financing.

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:12.910
And so I see in New York, you have this epidemic
of like hedge fund people investing at way

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:13.910
too high valuations and they come back and
they can't raise money and no one wants to

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:14.910
do a down round and it kind of kills the company.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.910
I think that...

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:16.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: I think that’s an important thing
to kind of stress and maybe explain to people

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:17.910
what you’re talking about there ‘cause
I think, I think that’s a mistake that entrepreneurs

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:18.910
make a lot.

01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:19.910
Like they maximize, they optimize for valuation
early on as opposed to other aspects of the

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:20.910
deal and they get themselves stuck.

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:21.910
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah I think it sounds self serving
for any of us to say this, but I think it's

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.910
true.

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:23.910
I think you should think about net dilution
over time, and I think if you took one pre

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:24.910
from Albert, sorry, if you took one on two,
$1 million on a $2 million valuation of let’s

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:25.910
say, just throwing out some numbers, versus
$8 million at an $8 million valuation from

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:26.910
some third tier VC, I bet you that you'd have
by the end, you'll have a more successful

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:27.910
company and you'll own more of it going with
the good guys.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:28.910
And so I think one of the things actually
I think like why Y Culminator has been phenomenal

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:29.910
a lot, I think just the kids today are just
vastly more intelligent than like I was, in

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:30.910
that they think a lot about net dilution over
time and they think about raising just enough

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:31.910
money to kind of hit and create a milestone.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:32.910
And then as you go on, you can go get the
dumber money or whatever, and then when you

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:33.910
sell it, who gives a, you just do it for price.

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:34.910
But at the early stage you're partnering.

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:35.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Did you have anything else you wanted
to add there Albert?

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:36.910
Are there any questions in the audience, anyone?

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.910
Yes.

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:38.910
Right up here at the front.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:39.910
I'll repeat it.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:40.910
[Audience question]

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:41.910
You mentioned that creating education which
should be free for everyone is a great social

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:42.910
goal, that you'd be willing to invest in that,
or is just a great social goal?

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:43.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: So the question is, you mentioned
free education for everyone is a great social

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:44.910
goal, but would you really be willing to invest
in that or is it just a social goal?

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:45.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: In a way yes, because if you think
how would free education for everyone work?

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:46.910
It would probably be everyone educates one
another right?

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:47.910
It doesn't mean like, you have the existing
people who teach for money and they do it

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:48.910
for free.

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:49.910
It would be more peer to peer.

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:50.910
So if you invest in websites where people
communicate with one another, you are investing

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:51.910
in that.

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:52.910
And I hesitate to bring up this example because
it is less true now.

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:53.910
But when we first funded Readit, it was pretty
erudite.

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:54.910
And people were sort of caricatured on that,
on that account.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:55.910
So if you invest in companies where people
talk peer to peer, that is that.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:56.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: Also certain services can be free
to almost everybody but still monetize some

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:57.910
high value transactions.

01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:58.910
I think our favorite example of that is Craigslist.

01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:59.910
And you know Craigslist is mostly free and
most of what takes place on Craigslist is

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:00.910
free but certain high value transactions are
monetized but we would have loved being an

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:01.910
investor in Craigslist.

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:02.910
So if we can build the equivalent for education,
it could make education free for almost everything.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:03.910
But there might be some small component that
actually sustains the business.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think a version of open I really
do like, is where you see an existing market

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:05.910
that’s really high pricing, like really
painful and you find somebody who's willing

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:06.910
to charge a much lower amount and blow up
that market.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:07.910
And basically it's close enough to a lot of
things that feel like free and open to be

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:08.910
that way.

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:09.910
And so Skype in its day had done that.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:10.910
Albert and I are investors in a company called
Twilio that I feel is doing that right now

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.910
to Telecom.

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:12.910
And so, any place you can find somebody like
trying to extract really premium pricing but

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:13.910
not really delivering a lot of value and you
can cut them off at the knees by offering

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:14.910
something at 10% or less of their pricing,
like that’s a really interesting and exciting

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:15.910
business to go after.

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:16.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: Other questions? Yes.

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:17.910
[Inaudible audience question]

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:18.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: How important is previous experience
with co-founders and what do you look for

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.910
in that experience?

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: You mean previous experience with
your co-founders or do you mean previous experience

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:21.910
among the co-founders?

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:22.910
[Audience reply]

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:23.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: To us, not super important but we're
super early stage so it might be different

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:24.910
among, among actual VC's

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:25.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: I'm not sure there's a distinction
between, among, and with in that context so

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:26.910
let me, let me be more, no, no, no, but I,
I, I can interpret it either way actually.

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:27.910
If you have, if you're a first time entrepreneur
your run time of other life experiences with

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.910
your co-founders, I value that a lot.

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:29.910
If you're an experienced entrepreneur and
you've done it before, I value it less.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:30.910
Because the problem or one of the challenges
that I've run into in the first time entrepreneur

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:31.910
cycle is that there’s so many different
things that you're getting stressed on that

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:32.910
you haven't experienced before, that having
some history together, whatever the context

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:33.910
is, tends to be helpful.

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:34.910
Once you've been through the cycle at least
once as an entrepreneur and you're on your

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:35.910
second or third company, it’s so useful
but not nearly as impactful.

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:36.910
That’s why I just wanted to clarify kind
of that.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.910
&gt;&gt;Albert: And for founders who have not worked
together and are first time founders, something

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:38.910
that is very, very, very important is the
vesting of founder shares.

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:39.910
I've seen all sorts of crazy things including
people leaving and going to an Ashram and

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:40.910
you don't want to have to replace those shares
with your own shares.

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:41.910
&gt;&gt;Paul: Let me tell you something.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:42.910
If you guys start a startup with someone,
and one of your co-founders doesn't want vesting,

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.910
they are gonna bail.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:44.910
This is an almost invariable rule.

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:45.910
If whenever, almost every time we have someone,
we always suggest have four year vesting with

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:46.910
a one year cliff, especially the one year
cliff, and practically every time there has

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:47.910
been a group that ignored our advice, one
of the guys left.

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:48.910
And it was ‘cause this guy was thinking
of leaving that he insisted on not having

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.910
the cliff.

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:50.910
So have a cliff or don't do it.

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:51.910
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think one thing about investing
for most of us here, is we're probably investing

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:52.910
before product market fit, not after.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:53.910
Chris wrote a great post about sort of the
vast scarcity of investors before product

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:54.910
market fit and the like feeding frenzy after
market fit, and I think really the secret

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:55.910
is trying to figure out what other metrics
than just revenue or uniques are you using

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:56.910
to figure out, like whether the company actually
has value or the people have value.

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:57.910
And I think our version of diligence is a
quick first check and a thoughtful second

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.910
check.

01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:59.910
Which is we need to make a quick assessment
on whether you have some ability to build

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:00.910
shit and get it out the door and write you
a small first check.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.910
And not think about that too much and then
six months later, have you actually got something

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:02.910
of value?

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.910
Great.

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:04.910
Then we're gonna think about whether we're
gonna do, you know, for those of us who are

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:05.910
follow on investors, whether we're gonna do
a larger second check into the company.

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:06.910
&gt;&gt;Dick: I think that’s all we have time
for.

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:07.910
It's 4 o’clock.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:08.910
So thanks everyone for coming and being patient
here towards the end.

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.914
Thank you very much.
