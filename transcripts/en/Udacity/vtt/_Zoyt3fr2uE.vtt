00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're here at Cambridge University in England

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where Isaac Newton formulated much of his mechanics.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the last unit we talked about motion,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but without really discussing what causes an object to move.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In this unit, we're going to talk about Newtonian mechanics

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the role force plays in governing the motion of objects.
