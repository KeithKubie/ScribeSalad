00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.620
NARRATOR: Beyonce.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.540
Barbara Streisand.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.460
Judy Garland.
J-Lo.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.540
Lady Gaga.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.000
What do they all have in common?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.460
"A Star Is Born."

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.380
The story Hollywood
has remade five times.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.290
Here's why.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.290
"A Star Is Born" tells
the story of a rising star

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.460
and her troubled A-list mentor.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.420
They develop a
romantic relationship

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.380
that quickly turns tragic.
And then--

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830
[gasps]

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.880
NARRATOR: It all starts in
1932 with a movie called,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.420
"What Price Hollywood."

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.330
Different name, yes, but
the exact same story.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.500
So much so that the
director, George Cukor,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.210
turns down the job for the
first "A Star Is Born."

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.540
That version released
in 1937, starring Janet

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.710
Gaynor and Frederic March.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.420
The film went on
to be a success.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.830
It won the Oscar for
Best Original screenplay

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.080
and was nominated
for six others.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.420
In 1942, Judy Garland
starred in a radio adaptation

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
that she wanted to
bring back to Hollywood.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.790
After 10 years of
campaigning, in 1954

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.290
she finally got George
Cukor to sign on.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.210
And then the story sat
dormant until 1976.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.710
Barbra Streisand shook
things up by taking

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.790
the film from the world of
movies into the world of music.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.080
She wanted to play the
role opposite Elvis,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.420
but had to settle for
Kris Kristoffersson.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.380
It took home the Oscar
for Best Original Song

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420
and was nominated in three
other technical categories.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.290
In promoting the movie,
Streisand remarked that it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.620
seems to work every 20 years.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620
And like clockwork, 1998.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.170
What followed was a decade
of high profile false starts

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.750
and rumors.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.290
It started with a possible
remake starring Will Smith

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.120
and Whitney Houston,
which turned

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.620
into Will Smith
and Jennifer Lopez,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.250
then Jamie Foxx and
J-Lo, Russell Crowe

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.620
and Beyonce, Leonardo
DiCaprio and Beyonce,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.420
Tom Cruise and Beyonce.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.580
And then finally, in 2018, a
new version starring Bradley

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.620
Cooper and Lady Gaga premiers.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.120
Each film was
reflective of its time,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.500
but all carry the same message.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.290
Roger Ebert once
said, it portrays

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.670
Hollywood as very
glamorous, but also

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670
a very cruel place as well.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.500
Some things never change.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.830
ANNOUNCER: March On.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.120
Celebrating women
who change the world.
