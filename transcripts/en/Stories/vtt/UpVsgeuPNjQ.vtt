[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250
BETTY SAADEH: My
name is Betty Saadeh.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.010
I'm one of members
of the Speed Sisters.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.091
Speed Sisters were the
first female racing

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:52.840
team in Palestine.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.310
For a woman in a very
reserved society,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.180
instead of just staying
home, and getting

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.219
married, and taking
care of their kids,

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.760
to find them between
men, and racing,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.010
and drifting, not real easy.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.860
NOOR DAOUD: When
I started racing,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.650
nobody really respected me.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.380
It was weird.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.770
But it was like, why
don't you just be at home,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.870
and get married, and I can do
something good in your life.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.520
BETTY SAADEH: This
is the only thing

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.240
I can have fun and
feel free is racing.

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:40.700
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.390
MONA ENAB: We don't
have a special track

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670
for the races in Palestine.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.580
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.200
MONA ENAB: We have like five
races we do it the year,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050
and in Palestine,
and three races

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410
will be outside of Palestine.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.500
There is me and more girls
are racing with the boys.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.730
There's a lot of boys
in racing here today.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.209
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.890
BETTY SAADEH: Oh, this is the
only big parking lot we have.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.170
See, it's full of rocks.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.990
This little boy was
shot and killed,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.300
so all his classmates
come here and throw rocks

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.970
at the Israeli's soldiers.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.652
So one day, I came with
[? Noud ?] to practice,

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.360
and they started
shooting at me tear gas.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.610
I got shot two in the back.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.185
And since that day,
I don't come here.

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:16.310
NOOR DAOUD: Of course, it's
also hard in Palestine,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.100
because we're under occupation.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.050
And we have to pass
checkpoints, and you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.260
have to go through
things, and it's not

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.520
easy to live in Palestine.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.390
So I'm sure like, yes, I
mean, racing helps a lot

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.210
to get the frustration out.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.345
BETTY SAADEH: I think
we, the Speed Sisters, we

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:34.625
changed the picture
of Palestinian women.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.150
We want to do our lives, and
do our hobbies, and have fun.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.675
Woo.

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:49.050
NOOR DAOUD: A lot
of people, they

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.100
come to me, like they want to
learn, especially little girls.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.440
And I like that, and I'm
willing to help anybody

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.250
that wants to go for it.

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.025
NOOR DAOUD: I want
to see people to show

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.050
their [? tone ?] to the world.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.430
So that's why, one
day, I hope I will

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.060
open an academy in Palestine,
and bring all the people that

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.800
wants to learn, and teach them,
and just live their dreams.
