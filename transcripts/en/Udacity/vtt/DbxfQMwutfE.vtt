00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say the train of physics is moving to the right at a speed of 10 m/s relative to the ground,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and let's say you're on this train, and you start walking forward towards the front of the train

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with a velocity--well, we already use v so I use u--of 2 m/s,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to know what's your total speed relative to the ground.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
How fast, when you have both the train motion and your motion, are you moving across the ground.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in meters per second.
