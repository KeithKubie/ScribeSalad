00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you got this right, good work--the way we've solved this is by saying,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
well, we want to know the parallel component.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The cosine of 30 tells me the ratio adjacent to hypotenuse,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that gives me a parallel force of 8.7 N.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I just multiply this by 15, and I get a value of about 130 J.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do one more problem so that you can practice this on your own.
