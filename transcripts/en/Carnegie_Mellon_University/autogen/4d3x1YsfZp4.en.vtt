well again that's what you get from

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:48.660
well again that's what you get from

aggregating demand and with the stimulus

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:51.510
aggregating demand and with the stimulus
 

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.540
aggregating demand and with the stimulus
money the upfront costs are going to be

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:53.550
money the upfront costs are going to be
 

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.760
money the upfront costs are going to be
significantly lower so I think it will

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:55.770
significantly lower so I think it will
 

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.970
significantly lower so I think it will
be affordable and again it's our job to

00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980
be affordable and again it's our job to
 

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.980
be affordable and again it's our job to
aggregate demand and make it work but

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:00.990
aggregate demand and make it work but
 

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.990
aggregate demand and make it work but
it's also the telecommunications
