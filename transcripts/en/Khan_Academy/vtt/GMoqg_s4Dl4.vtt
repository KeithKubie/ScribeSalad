00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.582
Factor 8k squared
minus 24k minus 144.

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:09.040
Now the first thing
we can do here,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.020
just eyeballing
each of these terms,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.820
if we want to simplify it a
good bit is all of these terms

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.930
are divisible by 8.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
Clearly, 8k squared is divisible
by 8, 24 is divisible by 8,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.130
and 144-- it might not be as
obvious is divisible by 8--

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.400
but it looks like it is.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.600
8 goes into one and 144,
8 goes into 14 one time.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.730
1 times 8 is 8.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.800
Subtract, you get a 6.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.450
14 minus 8 is 6.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.880
Bring down the 4.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.020
8 goes into 64 eight times.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.430
So it goes into 144 18 times.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.560
So let's just factor
out an 8 of this.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.530
And then that will
simplify our expression.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.890
It will actually give us
a leading 1 coefficient.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.900
So this will become 8 times k
squared minus 24 divided by 8

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:04.590
is 3k minus 18.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.150
Now we have to factor
this business in here.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.800
And remember if anything has the
form x squared plus bx plus c,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.910
where you have a leading
1 coefficient-- this

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.190
is implicitly a one--
we have that here

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.220
in this expression
in parentheses.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160
Then we literally
just need to-- and we

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.670
can do this multiple
ways-- but we

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.610
need to find two
numbers whose sum is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.450
equal to the coefficient on x.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.840
So two numbers whose sum
is equal to negative 3

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.240
and whose product is equal
to the constant term.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.370
And whose product is
equal to negative 18.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.410
So let's just think about the
factors of negative 18 here.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.140
Let's see if we can do
something interesting.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.855
So it could be 1.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.480
And since it's negative, one of
the numbers has to be positive,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.739
one has to be negative 1 and
18 is if it was positive.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.280
And then one of these could be
positive and then one of these

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.630
could be negative.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.740
But no matter what
if this is negative

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.950
and this is positive
then they add up to 17.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.290
If you switch them, then
they add up to negative 17.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.169
So those won't work.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.720
So either we could
write it this way,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.765
positive or negative 1, and
then negative or positive 18

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.640
to show that they have
to be different signs.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.990
So those don't work.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.720
Then you have positive
or negative 3.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.820
And then negative
or positive 6, just

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.870
to know that they
are different signs.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.330
So if you have positive
3 and negative 6,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.360
they add up to
negative 3 which is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.020
what we need them to add up to.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.280
And clearly, positive 3 and
negative 6, their product

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.250
is negative 18.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.690
So it works.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.810
So we're going to
go with positive 3

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.030
and negative 6 as
our two numbers.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.610
Now, for this example-- just
for the sake of this example--

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.720
We'll do this by grouping.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.770
So what we can do is we can
separate this middle term right

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.750
here as the sum
of 3k negative 6k.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.619
So I could write the negative
3k as plus 3k minus 6k.

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.160
And then let me
write the rest of it.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.460
So we have k squared up
here, plus 3k minus 6k,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.640
which is the same thing
as this over here.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.840
And then we have minus 18.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.240
And then all of that's
being multiplied by 8.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.790
Now we're ready to
group this thing.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.620
We can group these first two
terms, they're both divisible

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.610
by k.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.270
And then we can group-- let
me put a positive sign--

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.530
let's group these
second two terms.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.790
So then we have 8 times--
I'll write brackets here

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.670
instead of drawing
double parentheses.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.320
Brackets are really
just parentheses

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.110
that look a little
bit more serious.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.990
Now let's factor out a k
from this term right here.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.740
I'm going to do this
in a different color.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.010
Let's factor out the k here.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.540
So this is k times k plus 3.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.480
And then we have plus.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.938
And then over here
it looks like we

00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:51.339
could factor out a negative 6.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:52.880
So let's factor
out-- I'm going to do

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.090
this in a different color--
let's factor out a negative 6

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.590
over here.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.910
So plus negative
6 times k plus 3.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.360
So now it looks like we
can factor out a k plus 3.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.180
There's a k plus 3 times k, and
then we have a k plus 3 times

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.140
the negative 6.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.880
So let's factor that out.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.579
So we have this 8 out
front, that's not changing.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.120
So let me write that
in the brackets.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.390
We're factoring out a k plus 3.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.400
So then we have the k plus
3 that we factored out.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.980
And then inside of that
we just have left this k.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.900
Instead of writing
plus negative 6,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.010
I could just write k minus 6.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.430
We factor out the k
plus 3 and we're done.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.780
And then we can rewrite this.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.360
The way we wrote it here
it's 8 times the product of k

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.260
plus 3 times k minus 6.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.450
But we know from the
properties of multiplication,

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.470
this is the exact same
thing as 8 times k

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.760
plus 3 times k minus 6.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.522
And we are done.
