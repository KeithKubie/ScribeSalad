00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.008
Sometimes when you grow up, you don't quite realize

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.425
how all the  experiences you have

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:16.841
shape who you become down the road.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.759
And it's been very interesting in this role to look back and think about how my views

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.841
on diversity and inclusion have been

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.925
shaped by my own experiences throughout my life.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.425
And I'd like to maybe call out two of those.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:32.841
One is being a first generation student

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:33.717
and the other being an immigrant.

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:36.966
I, as you can tell, clearly have an accent and

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.258
I didn't move to the United States

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:42.258
until I was just about 30 years old.

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:44.801
And it took me a while to figure out that no matter

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.717
how hard I tried to blend in,

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:49.300
I will always stand out.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.383
And at some point in time that was very confusing.

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.133
And then I realized you know,

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.509
it's actually something interesting.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.925
It's a great way to sort of connect and actually start

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.008
talking about diversity and inclusion.

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.883
And one of the ways at a place like Emory

00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:06.759
in which it has really helped me is we're a global university.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.592
We have people from all over the world and

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.133
includes our faculty, students and staff.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.550
It also has helped me understand, particularly in the last

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.091
year or so, how difficult it has been as U.S. society

00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:23.592
is contemplating about what is the role of immigrants.

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:25.383
And as we know, it's quite polarized.

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:28.509
There are those who believe that without immigrants,

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.008
the United States never would be what it would be,

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.008
but that enough is enough

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:34.425
and we need to stop immigration.

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:36.883
And then there are people who see that,

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:39.050
but say that we need to keep this going because this is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.133
why we are this incredible society that we are.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.550
That's why we have the impact on the world that we have.

00:01:44.592 --> 00:01:48.133
So you find yourself as an immigrant between those two

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.634
groups and try to figure out well,

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:50.841
what does it mean for me?

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.342
And especially for our students, it has been very difficult.

00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:58.133
Because these are people that came to the United States,

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.258
they want to have a U.S. Education.

00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:03.300
They believe that's the best education they can have.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.217
That it provides the best experience

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:06.717
they can have to survive.

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:10.342
But at the same time, they experience fear

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:13.217
because you no longer know if you're welcome.

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.717
Sometimes you don't want to acknowledge

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:16.592
that you are an immigrant.

00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:18.509
At the same time we have students

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.634
who are not immigrants,

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:22.759
but who look like immigrants or who sound like immigrants

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:26.425
who get very upset when people start labeling them as immigrants.

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:30.467
So it has opened the door to really talk about what does diversity mean,

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:31.925
what does inclusion mean.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:35.175
And what we have all realized and we are very committed to

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:39.133
addressing is the notion that you can have all the diversity in the world,

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.425
but it doesn't create a positive culture.

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:45.634
And in order to have a positive culture, you must have a focus

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:49.425
on inclusion so that everybody feels part of it,

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.175
everybody feels respected.

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:52.925
And I think it's that respect that is so important to people.

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:56.425
Even if we don't understand the differences between the cultures,

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.091
even if there are barriers, as long as there is respect

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.383
and dignity, people are okay with it.

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:05.467
So we have a lot of formal and informal activities to address that.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:09.008
I also notice that it almost seems that the more diverse

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.091
an institution gets, in my case,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.091
talking about Emory, the more diverse Emory gets,

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.175
the more difficult inclusion, in some ways, becomes.

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:22.550
Because people try to sometimes pull back into groups that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.217
are inclusive and that are the groups that you align with the most.

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:29.800
And a lot of people will say well, we're inclusive because you're here,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.467
so why do I need to do extra work to make you feel welcome?

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:36.133
But all of those are wonderful lessons and that's

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.759
what universities like Emory stand for.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.634
So I do believe that because I am an immigrant,

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:44.258
it really has helped me be a voice in that conversation

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:46.925
and ask some of the questions that maybe I couldn't ask

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:50.175
had it not been for the fact that I am an immigrant.
