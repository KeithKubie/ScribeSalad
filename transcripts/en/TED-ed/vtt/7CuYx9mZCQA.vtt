00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.542
Some of the issues that are important

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.476
if you want to have people in space

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.026
for long periods of time.

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:14.074
One is that people will tend to lose

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:15.566
bone and muscle mass.

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.531
We know this.

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.478
If you have to put a cast on your leg,

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:20.485
and you take the cast off after a few weeks,

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.607
you'll see that your muscles have shrunk in size.

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.911
And if you measured the bone strength,

00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:28.814
you'd also see that might have gone down a little bit, too.

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:32.093
And so, it's very interesting that our body has that ability

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:34.404
to adapt to the loads that are put on it,

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:36.466
so that bones and muscles aren't static,

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.936
they're always changing.

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:40.213
While we think of bone as being a solid thing

00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:41.884
that doesn't change very much,

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.363
it changes too.

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:45.615
And it turns out that in weightlessness,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:46.984
you lose bone.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.174
And then you also cause the muscles

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.493
that work against gravity,

00:00:51.493 --> 00:00:53.209
what are called the postural muscles,

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:56.289
they'll start to shrink and lose strength.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.186
There are other things in the cardiovascular system,

00:00:58.186 --> 00:00:59.786
the heart and blood vessels.

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.129
And if you think about it,

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.616
standing up in gravity

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.786
means you have to work against gravity

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.155
in order to keep blood pumping to your head.

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.182
So, if you couldn't keep blood pumping in the head,

00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:13.543
you'd pass out every time you stood up

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.278
because when you're lying down,

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:17.146
you don't have to push against gravity.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:18.356
But when you stand up,

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:19.736
you got to work against gravity

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:21.404
to keep blood flowing to your head.

00:01:21.404 --> 00:01:22.569
And your heart and blood vessels

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.539
have a really nicely worked-out system

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.216
to make that happen every time.

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:32.236
But that system can also change in weightlessness.

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:34.209
And then the other area that changes

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.486
is the system that has to do with balance.

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.492
Again, maintaining your balance

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:41.383
is something that you're doing against gravity, right?

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:43.459
If you didn't have gravity present,

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.954
you wouldn't have to worry about falling.

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:48.235
But you obviously do have to worry about falling,

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:50.902
and we have a very highly developed sense of balance

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.468
to keep us upright

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:53.840
and to prevent us from falling.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.887
And when you see what skaters do,

00:01:55.887 --> 00:01:59.261
you realize just how exquisite a system it is.

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:00.762
But when you go into weightlessness,

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:02.592
your balance system changes.

00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:03.989
You don't really notice it

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.018
while you are in weightlessness,

00:02:05.018 --> 00:02:06.941
but when you come back,

00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:08.017
you do notice it,

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:08.941
that your balance has changed

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:10.358
and you have a little bit of trouble

00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:11.820
maintaining your balance.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.902
And what it shows is that while you're in space,

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.628
your brain is trying to allow you

00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:19.658
to function in weightlessness.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.152
And so, it re-adapts you to be weightless,

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:24.217
which you don't notice until you come back

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:26.742
and find out that you're now back on Earth

00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:29.798
with a balance system that's been adapted to space.

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:33.444
You know, all life developed here on Earth

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.431
with gravity being present,

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:39.222
so life evolved under the influence of gravity,

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:41.952
and then we grow up with gravity being present,

00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:43.825
so we learn how to walk

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:44.852
and catch a ball

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.442
and ice skate

00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:47.118
or whatever,

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:49.504
all with gravity being present.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:53.786
And what if you were to grow up without gravity?

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:57.034
What about the systems that depend on gravity,

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:58.833
like your muscles

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.805
or your balance system

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.575
or the heart and blood vessels?

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:05.327
Would they develop normally,

00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:07.929
or would they be different in some way?

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:08.961
One reason why you might think

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.584
that it would go down a different pathway

00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:12.920
is from an experiment

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.614
that was done some time ago

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:16.593
by two neuroscientists

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:18.362
called Hubel and Wiesel.

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.672
And what they did is they had a kitten,

00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:24.546
and they put a patch over the eye of the kitten.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:27.198
And then the kitten grew up to be a cat,

00:03:27.198 --> 00:03:29.681
and they removed the patch.

00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:31.962
And so, the question is,

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:34.916
can the cat see out of that eye?

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:37.236
Now, there's nothing wrong with the eye, right?

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.212
But it just hasn't seen anything,

00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:41.651
there hasn't been any light coming in.

00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.512
And the answer is that the cat can't see out of that eye

00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:48.526
because what happens is that the brain

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:51.466
goes down a different pathway when it develops

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.989
and the connections that would ordinarily develop

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.364
to that eye don't develop.

00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:58.567
And that can't be undone,

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:00.383
that's a permanent change.

00:04:00.383 --> 00:04:02.013
So, the brain of that cat

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:05.310
is fundamentally different from the brain of a cat

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.883
that grew up seeing out of that eye.

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:10.971
That cat grew up with a different brain, in essence.

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:11.840
So, then you wonder,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.616
well, what about gravity?

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.444
What if you don't have the forces

00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:17.342
that gravity produces?

00:04:17.342 --> 00:04:19.729
Is your balance organ going to develop

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.299
in the same way,

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.868
or will it be different?

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:24.542
If somebody grew up in space,

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.453
could they come back to Earth and function,

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:30.696
or would they really be a different person?
