00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.720
Before you see the whimsical new animated feature

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.560
*clears throat*

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.040
Before you see the whimsical new-

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.880
*clears throat*

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
Before you see the whimsical new... uh...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.540
You know what? The epic voice just isn't the right fit for Wes Anderson.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.520
Can anyone here do a good Alec Baldwin?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.740
- Hello.
- Close enough. Take it away Baldy.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.020
"Oh, f*** it."

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.000
Before you see the whimsical new animated feature from your barista's favorite director,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.700
revisit all his meticulously crafted awkward family fables that make you kinda happy,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.340
kinda sad and kinda unsure when you're supposed to laugh or not.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.000
He he he he he.......

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.160
Why are they laughing?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.380
Every Wes Anderson movie, I mean film. 
Every Wes Anderson film.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.460
Sally forth and tally-ho with director Wes Anderson, whose style is so specific

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.600
he's basically his own genre;

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.740
featuring more symmetrical shots than you can shake an art department at,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.480
more nostalgia than you can cram into a quirky indoor tent

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.380
and more whimsy than a love-struck Cub Scout dancing in his underwear to a lakeside record player.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.400
Honestly, after eight movies, I'm not sure if I made that shot up or not.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.060
Oh, there it is.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.560
Meet a Wes Anderson protagonist.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.820
He's definitely not a woman -

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.840
but an emotionally stunted man suffering from a vague bout of ennui.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.060
"How was that supposed to make us feel?"

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.440
Watch him deal with a strained parental relationship.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.780
"Your mother's asked me to leave."

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.200
"Would it be possible for me to address you as 'dad'?"

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.180
"No."

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.600
- "Why didn't you come to dad's funeral?"
- "Because I didn't want to."

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.960
Sibling rivalries...

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.020
"You don't love me!"

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.840
"Yes I do!"

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.980
"I love you too, but imma mace you in the face!"

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.840
And maybe an affair.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.800
"You've made a cuckold of me."

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.860
"I think he's on to us."

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.980
"Of course he is."

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.960
But with the help of a brown subordinate slash love interest, a wardrobe full of dapper menswear

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.500
and a classic slow-motion walk,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.320
he'll end up happy, I think? It's sort of hard to tell, but that's what makes it artistic.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.780
Revisit eight films as meticulously crafted as the dollhouse sets they probably feature.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.020
Including: A tale of two disaffected friends, the cleaning woman that one of them loves

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.940
and a meticulously planned robbery that goes wrong.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.940
A tale of this disaffected student, his disaffected older friend, the teacher both of them love

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.220
and a meticulously planned revenge plot that goes wrong.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.860
A tale of this disaffected family, the sister that one of them loves

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.060
and a meticulously planned family reunion that goes wrong.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.120
A tale of this disaffected oceanographer, the reporter both he and his son love

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.720
and a meticulously planned documentary that goes wrong.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.880

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.160
and a meticulously planned trip through India that goes wrong.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.220
A tale of this disaffected Fox, the wife he loves

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.120
and a meticulously planned different robbery that goes wrong.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.320
A tale of these two disaffected kids who are in love with each other

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.860
and the meticulously planned escape that goes wrong.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.980
And a tale of this hotel manager, the dead old women he loves

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.520
and the meticulously planned art heist that goes wrong.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.680
It sounds repetitive, but trust me. They're just the most charming little things.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.640
"Thanks."

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.360
So before you see the adorable looking Isle of Dogs,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.140
revisit the director who can only be described as Wes Anderson -

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.780
who's influenced an entire generation of indie filmmakers

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.380
and an even larger generation of pale hipsters who hate their parents.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.980
'Ugh, you just don't get me dad. I was born in the wrong decade.'

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.680
"The escape route, just in case somebody is tailing us."

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.740
"We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House #1"

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.420
"It's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry."

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.680
"I'd like to pitch camp here about 1600."

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.220
"Klaus Daimler"

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.080
"Bob Maplethorpe"

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.860
"Edward Appleby"

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.840
"Rosemary Cross"

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.520
"Applejack."

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.900
"Goodnight, Mr. Littlejeans!"

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.920
"You tried--"

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.720
"Ohhhh!"

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.260
"Uhhhh!!!"

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.400
"My mother's dead."

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.720
"Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago."

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.100
"You should have been at Dad's funeral."

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.700
"My father died at seven and a half"

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.820
"My father was murdered."

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.480
"They ran over Buckley."

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.700
You know, we gave him crap for repeating himself

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.040
But the last thing anyone wants is a desaturated shaky-cam CGI fest out of him.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.520
Just a movie about the drama club at Hogwarts.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.840
Hey, Internet! Do you love puppies?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.900
Then click the link on the left because we got the cast of Pacific Rim to play with puppies.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.380
We present Pupcific Rim: Puprising

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:59.340
