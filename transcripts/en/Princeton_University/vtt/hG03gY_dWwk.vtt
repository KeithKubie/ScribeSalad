PAUL GAUTHIER: With the
population growing on Earth

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.360
as well as the climate
changing a lot,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.180
the amount of land that
we can use to grow plants

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.740
has been decreasing
over the past decades.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.920
So by growing the
plants vertically,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.590
on the same area of
land, we can actually

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.697
increase the production by
how many layers we put in.

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:22.559

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.230
SETH LOVELACE: Our vertical farm
is just a hydroponic station.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.180
But all of our different
members on the team,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.640
we're trying to bring different
metrics, different ideas,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.710
to really make the farm
work more efficiently.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.660
A lot of people might
say, at my level,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.960
math gets very abstract
and very rigorous.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.585
So how can you really use
that to solve problems?

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:39.960
But I'd say, at
the core of math,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
it's more of the approach
that really matters.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.220
My project, in
particular, focuses

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.340
on how to analyze the
nutrient composition

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
of our hydroponic solution
in the vertical farm.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.400
And we'd like to really alter
the nutrient composition

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.070
of this hydroponic
solution so that we can

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.510
grow bigger and better plants.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.947
Our ultimate goal is to work to
make the farm fully automatic.

00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:02.780
JESENIA HAYNES: I'm
growing lettuce and kale

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.340
in the vertical farm.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.720
And I'm assessing the
environmental impacts

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.550
as it relates to the
Princeton campus.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.250
So I'm measuring the
water and energy used.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.560
I want to see if
Princeton, hypothetically,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
uses this system to grow all of
their lettuce and kale needs,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
how that would compare
to where they currently

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.930
buy their lettuce and kale
in terms of energy or water --

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.950
so track the miles
it takes to transport

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.370
the food here and sort of turn
that into a carbon footprint

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.936
and energy cost.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:32.560
PAUL GAUTHIER: For
growing one lettuce,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.830
you will probably need up
to 50 gallons of water.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.580
And the reason of that is you
have to water them very often,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.050
and the water runs off.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.840
When in the vertical
farm we actually recycle

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
this water, and the first
result that we got from here

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
shows that we are
producing lettuce or kale

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.437
with 0.5 gallons of water.

00:01:52.437 --> 00:01:54.270
SETH LOVELACE: The
accessibility of research

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.670
to undergraduates on this
campus is just amazing --

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
doing research in a lab,
getting hands-on experience,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.010
and really learning in a
laboratory environment.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.770
I'd say that's one of the most
valuable aspects of a Princeton

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.810
education, that you can
simply make something

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.890
like that happen.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.940
JESENIA HAYNES: I would
like to find a career

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.590
or activity relating to ecological
conservation, sustainable

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.130
farming.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.080
So I think this is
good for me because it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.420
gets me thinking about what
I want to do for the future.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.000
And it gets me exposed
to this type of farming.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.250
PAUL GAUTHIER: All the
strains of Princeton

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.130
will combine into this project.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.770
With all of that, we
hope that Princeton

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.180
will start leading the
field in vertical farm

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.540
by providing new insights
in terms of technologies,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.660
but also training new
students for future consulting

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180
companies that, sooner
than later, will probably

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.570
be asking for people
understanding vertical farming.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.010
And then we can provide
data to the industry.
