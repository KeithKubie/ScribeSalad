&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hello and welcome. My
name is Alana Weiss. I'm part of Google EDU

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.500
and today it is my honor to welcome Barry
Schwartz to the Leading at Google series.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.940
Barry is a professor of psychology at Swarthmore
College and he's been teaching there since

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.140
1971 upon the completion of his PhD at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.230
He's the author of ten books and hundreds
of articles and he's actually been to Google

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.640
before. Because in 2004, he published a book
entitled "The Paradox of Choice: Why More

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.630
is Less." And his TED Talk on that book is
actually how I learned of his work and became

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.049
very excited.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:48.060
And he is here today to speak about his newest
book, "Practical Wisdom." Please join me in

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.729
welcoming Barry. Thank you.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:51.729
[applause]

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:59.790
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Thanks. Hi everybody. It's
really a pleasure to be here. And it's also,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.040
of course, a little intimidating, but I'll
try to suppress my terror. I decided that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.850
what I would do is combine the stuff that
I have already written about on Choice very

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.120
quickly, just in case there's somebody out
here who doesn't already know something about

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.360
it, but focus mostly on the new work on "Practical
Wisdom."

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.020
So the title of the talk is "Practical Wisdom:
The Choices that Matter," because the book

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.200
on choice was all about how when you give
people too much choice, it leads to all kinds

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.370
of bad results. And what I'm gonna focus on
today is how when you give people too little

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.790
choice, it leads to all kinds of bad results.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.030
And in addition, the Choice stuff is really,
from my point of view, about how Google relates

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.560
to the rest of the world, at least as far
as you're concerned. It's really about what

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.560
Google needs to do actually succeed in serving
its clients and giving us, the rest of us,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.770
what we need.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.260
The Practical Wisdom is really much more about
how Google works with Google. It's really

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.950
about how organizations need to be structured
and how they need to run in order to allow

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.490
people to do their best work. So, this is
a more inward-looking, at least from my point

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.360
of view, focus.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.680
OK. So, the official syllogism in the US and
pretty much every other Western country runs

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.050
roughly like this: We can't ever have too
much freedom; the more freedom people have

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.250
the better off they are; we should take every
opportunity to enhance freedom when we can.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.770
If we agree to that and pretty much everyone
does, the question is how do you enhance freedom?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.569
And the answer is obvious. You can't enhance
freedom without giving people choice. So,

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.099
more freedom means more well-being. And more
choice means more freedom.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.930
And so it follows as the night, the day, that
the more choice people have the better off

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.310
they are. This seems to me to be almost unassailable.
It's logically powerful. The only trouble

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.400
is that it is psychologically false; it ain't
true. And the research that I and others have

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.040
done in the last ten or fifteen years, has
shown that when people have too much choice,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.440
bad stuff happens.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.050
And again, I'm gonna do this very fast. The
first bad thing that happens is that people

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.510
are paralyzed. With everything at their disposal,
they can't pull the trigger. Instead of being

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.750
liberated by all this choice, they're paralyzed
by all this choice. The second bad thing that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.330
happens if they overcome paralysis and choose
they are likely to choose badly.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.430
People make bad decisions even in simple environments.
Well, you can just imagine how much worse

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.010
the decisions are when the environments get
complex and let me assure you that choosing

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.920
among 60 or 70 Medicare Part D prescription
drug plans is complex enough to challenge

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.790
anyone, even the people in this room, let
alone their aging grandparents and parents.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.150
The third bad thing that happens is if you
overcome paralysis and choose and if you get

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.459
lucky and you choose well, you end up, people
end up less satisfied with good choices if

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.689
they're chosen from large choice sets than
if they're chosen from small ones. It is always

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:32.669
easy to imagine when you encounter any imperfection
in any item or activity that you have chosen.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.159
It is easy to imagine that some alternative
out there would've been better. And so, you

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:45.069
compare how good the thing is with how good
you expected it to be and you end up disappointed.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:52.229
So, psychologists have known for 40 or 50
years that choice is good. And yet, my stuff

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.699
has emphasized the ways in which choice is
bad.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:01.339
So how can choice be good and bad? And the
way I have conceptualized it is that the relation

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:08.419
between the amount of choice people have and
how they feel looks roughly like this curve.

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.759
And just so that you're clear, the curve does
not actually capture real data.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:20.800
It's an idealization. But the point is that
all the way on the left, when people have

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.699
no choice, life is infinitely bad. You can't
live a human life and not have significant

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:28.869
choice.

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:35.330
However, as you add choice and you make life
better and better and better, a point is reached

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.009
where all of the benefits of choice essentially
asymptote, flatten out, and all of the negative

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.020
consequences of too much choice start to rear
their ugly heads and the curve changes direction.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.069
To be technical, the relation between choice
and well-being is non-monotonic. And the task

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:01.059
is to figure out the point in a choice space
where people can derive all of the benefits

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:09.419
without paying the substantial psychological
cost. So, if the curve looks like I just described

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:16.340
it to you, the question you face as a provider
of options to people is what's the right amount

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.340
of choice?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.560
So, one task that people face, whether it's
supermarkets, clothing retailers, or information

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.990
providers, is what's the sweet spot? How many
options is the right amount of options for

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.169
people to derive the benefits of having choice
without paying the price?

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:42.120
And the sad fact is that there is no algorithmic
way to answer that question. I'm afraid the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.009
way you figure out what the sweet spot is,
is by studying people making decisions in

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.419
different domains. The sweet spot is likely
to be different in different areas of life.

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.610
Finding the sweet spot however, is enormously
important. The second thing you can do and

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.999
I think Google does this remarkably well is
you separate the principle from the agent.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:10.490
That is to say, you have an agent who curates
the choice space.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.650
And even though there may be hundreds and
hundreds of options, the principle, the person

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.419
who's going to actually have to make the choice,
only sees three or four. And you have wisely

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:27.650
structured the choice domain and filtered
out options so that not only does the principal

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.699
only see three or four, but it's just the
right three or four.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.849
And it doesn't matter under those conditions
how many options are out there because the

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:40.179
only ones that the principal sees are the
ones that matter. And the last thing that

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:47.459
you can do is pay attention to what economist
Richard Thaler and law professor Cass Sunstein

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.949
refer to as "choice architecture."

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:55.650
Pay attention to how options are structured
so that you make it as easy as possible for

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:02.719
people to make, to choose at all, and to choose
well. And the most important characteristic

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:09.370
of choice architecture is to pay attention
to what happens when people do nothing.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:16.270
People do nothing a lot. They're busy. They're
distracted. They're overwhelmed. They do nothing.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:24.449
In a study of organ donation, 90-something
percent of Americans approve of organ donation.

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:31.330
Twenty-six percent of Americans are organ
donors, right? One-quarter of the people in

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.400
the United States who think organ donation
is a good idea are actually organ donors.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.150
If you look in Europe where they also use
driver's license renewal as an opportunity

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.780
to get organ donors, you see that there are
many countries in Europe where virtually everyone

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.520
is an organ donor. And there are a few that
look like the United States.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.150
So, what's the difference between the countries
on the left and the countries on the right?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.940
The difference is the countries on the right:
you are an organ donor unless you opt out.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.390
The countries on the left, like the United
States, you are not an organ donor unless

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.160
you opt in.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.950
Paying attention to what happens when people
do nothing is a major, major opportunity to

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:17.860
help people make good choices. The same thing
has been shown with 401Ks. The standard procedure

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.370
with 401K participation is that you have to
give your employer permission to withhold

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:29.240
some money and otherwise, everything comes
to you and there's no savings for retirement.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.850
If you switch the default so that money is
automatically withheld from your paycheck,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:40.920
unless you tell the employer not to, you triple
the rate of 401K participation. So this is

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:49.990
merely one example of how, rather than imposing
solutions on people and eliminating choice,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.020
which would after all be un-American.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.580
You give people options, but you structure
the options so that people are nudged in the

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.510
direction that you have independent reason
to believe is the direction that they would

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:08.130
choose. And so, as a provider of quote "all
of the world's information," you have an enormous

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.970
opportunity to do precisely this, basically
with the results of every search anyone ever

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.970
does.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.610
You nudge people in the right direction. Make
it hard for them to go in the wrong direction.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:30.770
People are nonetheless free to look at the
75,000, 822nd ranked result of a Google search

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.920
if they want to, but you're making it easy
for them to look at the results that are most

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.680
likely to be the results they care about,
as long as you do it right.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.820
And there are millions of opportunities to
make nudges like this. I just read a paper

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.230
three days ago. We have an obesity problem
in the United States. I assume you're all

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:53.820
aware of it. Although, apparently, there's
no obesity problem at Google, despite the

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.840
infinite availability of food.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.560
So, it turns out that people are much more
likely to choose items from the top of a menu

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:08.630
list or the bottom of a menu list than they
are items in the middle. You can't force people

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.910
to eat healthy, but if you put all the really
poisonous stuff in the middle of the menu,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.240
you will decrease the chances that people
order it.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.180
And there are nudges like this available almost
everywhere you look. None of them depriving

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.280
people of freedom of choice, all of them helping
people to make better choices. So that was

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.950
what the Choice book was about, how we have
too much choice and what we can do about it.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:42.811
Now I wanna focus on my current work, which
is about how we have too little choice. What

00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:48.450
prompted this book, and it's written with
my colleague Ken Sharp, who teaches political

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.910
science at Swarthmore. What prompted this
book was the sense that Ken and I have had

00:11:53.910 --> 00:12:00.320
for quite some time that America is, in some
important respects, broken.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:07.100
And what I mean by that is that our kid's
teachers don't know our kids well enough,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:13.170
we think, to give each of them what they need.
And they don't seem to care enough to find

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:21.110
out what our kids need. Our doctors rush through
office visits in seven minutes, hardly having

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.980
the opportunity to get to know us.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.240
And increasingly, at least I find this, our
office visits to the doctor are mostly spent

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.300
with you watching as the doctor stares at
the laptop and enters data in response to

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:41.320
the questions that you get asked. Lawyers
pursue billable hours and seldom ask whether

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:49.430
what we think we need and want is what we
should need and want and of course, the bankers.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.990
Bankers nearly wrecked the world economy and
it seems to me the jury is still out about

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:03.700
whether the world economy will be saved. Nothing
in America seems to work the way it should.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:11.640
Now, historically, when we encounter institutions
that don't work well, don't give us what we

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:18.800
need, don't give us what we want, we have
two tools that we reach for to solve the problem.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:26.460
One tool is rules: more and more rules; more
and more detailed rules; closer and closer

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:34.850
regulation. The other tool is incentives.
If we can find a way to create smart incentives

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:40.000
so that people do well by doing good, the
system will take care of itself.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.430
Some combination of rules and incentives is
the magic solution to the problem of inadequate

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:53.290
schools, overly expensive and inadequate health
care, shyster lawyers, and corrupt, greedy

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:59.620
bankers. If only we can find the right rules
and the right incentives. The theme of our

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:06.050
book is that neither rules nor incentives
will get us what we need.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:11.660
They are blunt instruments and in fact, they
actually get in the way of getting us what

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:21.060
we need. So, what we need is character. And
in particular, we need an aspect of character

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.930
that Aristotle called "practical wisdom."
That I'm going to try to explain to you very

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:32.630
quickly what that is and how every effort
we currently make to make things better in

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.410
our social institutions is actually making
them worse.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:42.680
So, let me talk to you about a janitor named
Luke, who works at a major medical center

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:50.750
in the Midwest. These are the characteristic
duties of hospital janitors in this particular

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.070
medical center. Don't memorize them. There
won't be an exam. But if you scan them, it

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.060
should be clear that none of these things
is the least bit surprising.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.120
They're just what you would imagine. Here
are more of them. It may surprise you that

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:10.390
there are so many items on the list, but not
what the items are. So, this is Luke and Luke's

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.000
colleagues job description.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.390
And yet, psychologists who interviewed Luke
and his colleagues about their work and how

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.490
they saw their work and what was important
about their work would hear stories like the

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:30.080
one that Luke told of how he had cleaned the
room of a patient, a young man who was comatose

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.610
after a bar fight.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.990
And the young man's father was keeping a vigil.
He was there in the hospital all day, every

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.180
day, but he smoked, this guy. So he would
occasionally go out to wherever he could smoke

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.710
to have a cigarette. And so, Luke cleaned
this man's room and the dad didn't see Luke

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:57.550
clean this man's room and he confronted Luke
irate and demanded that he clean the room.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:03.800
And Luke. What did Luke do? Well, he said,
"I could've told him that I cleaned the room.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.161
I could've gotten angry because he was being
so disrespectful. But, you know, he was a

00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:15.111
man who was trying to do something, anything,
to help his son. So, I just cleaned the room

00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.930
again."

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:23.420
Luke's interest was in serving the needs of
the patient and the patient's family. None

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:29.660
of that was in his job description. He did
it effortlessly. He did it immediately. And

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.240
it was things like that that made Luke eager
to show up for work every day. It wasn't emptying

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.540
trash cans.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:43.060
It was being part of a mission of easing suffering
and providing comfort to people in distress.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.250
And Luke was not unique. There was another
case of a guy who was sweeping the, washing

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:55.420
the floor in the hallway and a patient who
had just recovered , had just been operated

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.710
on was slowly and with great difficulty getting
out of bed to move a little bit up and down

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.179
the hall to speed the healing.

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:09.530
And he stopped washing the floor so that the
patient could actually do this little bit

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.860
of exercise without slipping and falling.
There was another janitor, Charlane, who was

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.309
told she had to clean the visitor's lounge
and she went to the lounge and noticed that

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:23.669
there were four or five people, members of
the same family, who were there again, day

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.059
after day and night after night.

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:30.039
And they happened to be napping. And so, she
refrained from cleaning the visitor's lounge

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:37.429
so that she wouldn't disturb them, even brooking
disapproval from her supervisor. So, these

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:44.160
are the characteristics of janitors and their
work that they regard as most important, even

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.429
though there is not a single item on their
list of duties that even mentions another

00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:51.450
human being.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:58.241
They are crafting their work so as to contribute
to the mission of the hospital. And they are

00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:02.909
doing it wisely. Obviously, there are times
when patients want them to do something when

00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:06.830
they have to back away because it requires
a kind of expertise that they don't have.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:13.049
They need to know when to go forward and when
to back off. And they learned how to do this

00:18:13.049 --> 00:18:21.269
by basically having lots of experience working
with and around sick people. The second example

00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:28.029
is of a judge. Judge Lois Forer. And she was
a judge in the Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:32.730
and she reports the case of a young man named
Michael, who committed an armed robbery.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:38.940
He had just lost his job. He had a wife and
a six-year old child, with great difficulty

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:45.490
they were managing to send away to a parochial
school. And he had just lost his job. He had

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.270
a little bit too much to drink. He was feeling
desperate. He got into a taxi and he held

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.899
up the taxi driver with a toy gun.

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:59.249
He got 50 dollars. He was caught. There was
no question of his guilt. And the question

00:18:59.249 --> 00:19:06.330
that Forer faced is what should the sentence
be? There is a sentence for committing armed

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:12.139
robbery in a public conveyance of five years
in prison. That's what she could have sentenced

00:19:12.139 --> 00:19:13.139
him to.

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:18.059
She thought that was preposterous. He had
no criminal history. He was acting in a state

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:24.231
of desperation. He seemed to be a dedicated
family person. And so, she sentenced him to

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:30.610
eleven months in jail with release every day
to go to work. So he got up, went to work,

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.379
spent the day in the workplace, came back
and slept in jail.

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:38.350
After eleven months, he was released on probation.
Went back to his family, got another job,

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:44.220
family stayed united, everything seemed to
be fine, except that the prosecutor couldn't

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.399
live with that incredibly lenient sentence
and appealed the sentence.

00:19:49.399 --> 00:19:56.309
And after the wheels of justice ground as
slowly as they do, the prosecutor won the

00:19:56.309 --> 00:20:06.450
appeal and Michael was required to serve out
the remaining four years and one month of

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:18.279
his sentence. Michael disappeared and Lois
Forer quit. She couldn't be a judge when being

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:21.639
a judge meant that you couldn't use your judgment.

00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:28.590
And so, what Lois Forer was trying to do was
be a wise judge. What Luke and his colleagues

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:35.440
in the hospital were trying to do is to be
wise custodians. And what it means to be wise

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.799
from Aristotle's point of view is to combine
two things. One is the will to do the right

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:46.529
thing, to provide what people need.

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:51.869
Which, of course, depends on what domain you're
operating in. The other is to have the skill

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:58.090
to figure out what the right thing is. And
that takes skill because there's no formula

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:04.529
to tell Lois Forer what the right sentence
is in any given case. And there's no formula

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:11.239
to tell the custodians how to intervene on
behalf of patients.

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:19.820
Wise people know when and how to make the
exception to every rule. Wise people know

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:26.040
when and how to improvise. We talk about wisdom
as a kind of moral jazz. There are notes on

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.539
the page, if you like. Those are the rules,
but they're just guidelines. And what makes

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:35.369
great jazz is not that you play the notes
on the page, it's how you deviate from the

00:21:35.369 --> 00:21:41.299
notes on the page. You can do that well or
you can do that badly. Wise people are good

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:48.320
jazz musicians. Wise people know how to find
the mean, which is not the arithmetic average.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:55.190
It's what Aristotle had in mind when he talked
about how courage was the mean between cowardice

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.840
and recklessness.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.710
Now where is the mean between cowardice and
recklessness? The answer is: it depends. It

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:08.320
depends on the context. It depends on the
circumstances. There is no formulaic way to

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:16.309
figure out what the mean is. Wise people know
how to choose among virtues when they conflict.

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:21.149
Imagine a doctor who believes that doctors
be honest with patients.

00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:26.320
Who doesn't believe that? The doctor also
believes that doctors should be kind with

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.989
patients. Well, it turns out that sometimes
being honest tells you to do one thing and

00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:38.540
being kind tells you to do another. How do
you balance two legitimate, important, but

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.679
conflicting aspirations, conflicting values?

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:49.139
Wise people figure out how to do it and the
point of balance, again, as Aristotle emphasized,

00:22:49.139 --> 00:22:55.440
depends on who you're dealing with, what the
circumstances are. Wise people know how to

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.610
put themselves in other people's places. They
can see the world as other people see the

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.610
world.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:08.019
And they can feel what other people are feeling.
Empathic understanding is an essential ingredient

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:13.210
of wisdom. It's something that takes experience
to learn. Little kids have the impulse to

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.499
be empathetic, but they don't have a clue
about what would actually help.

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:22.429
There's this great story about a two-year
olds at nursery school and one of their classmates

00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:28.499
is upset and crying and it bothers them, so
they wanna help this unhappy two-year old.

00:23:28.499 --> 00:23:33.259
So the question is what should they do? And
the answer they come up with is this.

00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:39.840
"When I'm unhappy, I want a hug from my mom."
And so they walk over to this unhappy two-year

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:47.170
old, take her hand, and walk her over to their
mom. "A hug from my mom makes me feel better."

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.109
[inaudible words]

00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:51.110
Would you mute whatever that is?

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.960
[inaudible words]

00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.549
Is this the Giants game or something? No.
Thank you. "A hug from my mom makes me feel

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:05.109
better when I'm unhappy, so a hug from my
mom will make anyone feel better when they're

00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:06.109
unhappy."

00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:10.830
They have the impulse to ease the suffering
of others, but they don't have a clue about

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:17.070
what it takes to do that. Most of us, arguably
are a little better than two-year olds, but

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:25.259
it takes experience really to get good at
that. And perhaps most important, a wise person

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:31.879
uses these skills in pursuit of the right
aims, to serve other people and not to serve

00:24:31.879 --> 00:24:33.450
him or herself.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.639
If you use all of these skills to serve yourself,
you become a Machiavellian manipulator and

00:24:38.639 --> 00:24:45.320
that's not what Aristotle thought a virtuous
person was like. And last, a wise person is

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:51.749
made, not born. We argue in the book that
everybody has the capacity to develop these

00:24:51.749 --> 00:24:55.619
characteristics, but it takes experience.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:25:01.350
It takes trial and error. It takes making
mistakes and getting wiser as a result of

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:09.110
learning from your mistakes. Nobody is born
with the magic gift of wisdom. So, the wise

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:15.759
doctor balances honesty, kindness, and kindness,
paternalism and patient autonomy. Let me tell

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:16.759
you what to do.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:24.489
You decide what to do. A wise lawyer balances
passionate advocacy and judicious counsel.

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:31.360
A wise teacher or parent balances the fairness
with giving each child what she needs; that

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:37.690
is to say, treating kids differently. And
the question is what does the wise Googler

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.700
do?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.480
I hope if there's time for some questions,
you'll contribute to the answer to that question.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.820
I have a few suggestions, but I'm not gonna
give them to you yet, 'cause otherwise, you'll

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:54.859
just leave. So, we need, the argument in the
book is that there is no substitute for wisdom,

00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:58.820
for the will to do the right thing, and the
skill to figure out what that is.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:04.919
Nonetheless, what we are doing in American
society is engaging in a war on wisdom without

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:13.399
realizing that we're doing it. And we're engaging
in the war, both on the development of skill

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:21.600
and the development of will. What rules do,
rigid scripts do, is they prevent people from

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.629
improvising.

00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:27.409
They prevent people from engaging in trial
and error and making mistakes and getting

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:33.509
better. You follow the script that some person
smarter than you has handed you. And the result

00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:38.960
is that you never get any wiser after ten
years than you were on your first day.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:46.669
I can give you a great example of this. This
is the lemonade story about a professor of

00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:50.710
anthropology at the University of Michigan
who took his son to a Detroit Tigers game.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:56.789
This boy was seven years old and he wanted
some lemonade. So dad got up to the concession

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:59.499
stand to buy his son some lemonade.

00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:06.270
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade. Dad
had no idea what that was and so he bought

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.440
it and he brought it back. And there was this
kid drinking out of a bottle of Mike's Hard

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.440
Lemonade. A security guard saw it and immediately
called the police and an emergency ambulance

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.440
team.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.600
They rushed to the stadium, got the boy, whisked
him off to the hospital, checked him out.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.669
Turned out he was fine. His blood alcohol
level was negligible. They were all set to

00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:35.159
release the child and the welfare officers,
who were also summoned to the scene, said,

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:42.659
"Not so fast. What we have here is a case
of child abuse. We will not allow the child

00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.279
to go back to the home."

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:51.460
And so they put the child in a foster home.
A week or so later, the case came before a

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:58.850
judge and the welfare worker said, "We hate
to do it, but we have to follow procedure."

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:05.519
A week later, the case came before a magistrate
who said, "Well, here's what I'll do. I'll

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:12.429
let the boy go home, but only if Dad leaves
the house and checks into a hotel. I hate

00:28:12.429 --> 00:28:15.679
to do it, but we have to follow procedure."

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:21.130
After three weeks, I'm happy to say the family
was reunited and for all I know this seven

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.909
year old kid now works here. The point though,
is that every step along the way from the

00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:31.889
police to the child welfare agency to the
judge, the answer to the question was always

00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:37.470
the same: "I hate to do it, parenthesis, I
know this is stupid, closed parenthesis, but

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.119
we have to follow procedure."

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:48.210
Judge Forer, as I said, was required to follow
procedure and changed Michael's sentence and

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:54.519
the result she found so intolerable that she
quit. And then there's education. If we think

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:59.519
we don't have teachers who are smart enough
to figure out how to teach, what we do is

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:03.180
we give them scripts so that they don't have
to figure out how to teach.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.570
And here's an example from a Chicago kindergarten.
Every kindergarten teacher in the City of

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:15.100
Chicago was doing exactly the same thing on
Day 53. "Reading and enjoying literature/words

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:20.950
with 'b'. The bath." This is instructions
to the teacher. The instructions are 20 pages

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:21.950
long.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.000
The book is 30 pages long. "Assemble students
on the rug or reading area. Give students

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.440
a warning about the dangers of hot water.
Say quote 'Listen very quietly as I read the

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.639
story.' Say, 禅hink of other pictures that
make the same sound as the sound bath begins

00:29:38.639 --> 00:29:39.639
with.'"

00:29:39.639 --> 00:29:48.820
And so, we routinize procedure that people
follow so as to protect students or patients

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:54.309
from disaster. But when we do that, we virtually
guarantee that all they're going to get at

00:29:54.309 --> 00:30:00.229
best is mediocrity. There is no script that's
the right script for every kid. When you give

00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:05.320
teachers a script, you're guaranteeing that
you will miss fit many of the students that

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.840
the script is being used on.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:13.580
In addition, you deprive teachers of the opportunity
actually to become teachers. They never get

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:19.359
better at what they do because they don't
have the room, the space, to learn what works

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:24.460
and what doesn't work. And this is what we
have done increasingly and what we have appealed

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.570
to to try to fix all the institutions that
seem to be falling short.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:35.779
So, if you're not gonna just rely on rules,
how about if we create smart incentives? Make

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:42.050
it worthwhile for teachers to improve test
scores. You know, the higher kids' test scores

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.659
get, the better the teacher's salaries are.
They get bonuses. They get all kinds of other

00:30:46.659 --> 00:30:47.659
perks.

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:51.779
Let's make it worth their while and then they'll
work their asses off to get the kids to do

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:57.840
better on tests. Some of you may have read
recent scandal in Georgia public schools.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.200
The teachers seem to have discovered, and
principals, have discovered one way to enable

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.059
kids to do better on standardized tests.

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:11.539
And that is by changing the kid's answers;
massive, massive cheating scandal in Georgia

00:31:11.539 --> 00:31:17.710
public schools. So far, at least 175 teachers
have been implicated. So, this is not about

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:23.940
a bad apple. This is about a very rotten barrel.
And one of the things that produces this rotten

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.119
barrel is the incentive structure that currently
operates in education.

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:33.340
I'll give you one example of this because
I love it so much and it concerns a day care

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:39.409
center in Israel that was being troubled because
parents were coming late to pick up their

00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:43.529
kids. They just couldn't tear themselves away
from the incredibly interesting work they

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:44.529
were doing.

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:48.889
So there was a temptation, you exhort the
parents to come on time. It's disrespectful.

00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:53.849
They were still coming late. There's a temptation
to close the center up and just leave kids

00:31:53.849 --> 00:31:59.629
sitting on the street, but somehow the director
thought that that was inhumane. And so he

00:31:59.629 --> 00:32:04.320
figured the only way to get these people to
show up when they should is to make it cost

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.639
them to come late.

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:12.200
So he introduced fines, lateness fines. They
were roughly the equivalent of a parking ticket.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.799
And guess what happened when parents were
fined for coming late?

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:17.592
&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER#1: They got angry.

00:32:17.592 --> 00:32:21.480
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: They didn't get angry. More
people came late.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.940
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Because it was
fair.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.259
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Not because, because it
was a price. You said it was a fine. I think

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:31.929
it's a price. It's a price worth paying. Is
it worth 15 bucks for me to spend another

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:35.369
half hour in the office? Damn right it is.

00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:39.720
And so month after month went by with these
fines in place and the curve of lateness kept

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.889
going up and up and up, and finally in despair,
the director of the day care center discontinued

00:32:44.889 --> 00:32:47.450
the fines. And now what do you think happened
to lateness?

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.429
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: It stayed high.

00:32:49.429 --> 00:32:51.340
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: It got even higher.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.559
[laughter]

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:54.919
Because now it was a better deal.

00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:57.019
[laughter]

00:32:57.019 --> 00:33:00.500
Here's the important thing to, now, could
you have come up with a fine that would've

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.599
worked? Of course, ten years in prison for
coming ten minutes late. That would probably

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:10.249
get people, that would focus the mind, but
reasonable penalties didn't work.

00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:15.769
And here was the logic behind the imposition
of penalties. People already have one reason

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:20.710
to come on time. They have an obligation.
They have a responsibility, a moral and social

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:25.059
responsibility. Let's give them a, that apparently
isn't strong enough. Let's give them a second

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:26.059
reason.

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:32.700
Now it'll cost them. Two reasons to do something
have to be stronger than one. Yes? Well, no.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.049
'Cause what happens is that the second reason
completely undermines the first. Coming on

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:44.109
time loses any moral content at all. It is
simply a matter cost/benefit calculation.

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:51.200
And then once that seems to have happened,
it looks like it permanently eliminates the

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.659
social and moral sanctions on showing up on
time to pick up your kid, because when you

00:33:55.659 --> 00:34:00.099
eliminate the fines it's not like your sense
of obligation perks back up.

00:34:00.099 --> 00:34:05.789
It seems like you have transformed parental
behavior and the motivation behind it so that

00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:12.270
it has become now just about "what's in my
best interest? What am I willing to pay?"

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:20.270
And that's a disaster. Big tests in schools
have, I won't talk about nuclear waste dumps

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.600
'cause I don't have enough time.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.860
It's basically the same story. Well, I will.
I can do it in two sentences. You ask people

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.570
in Switzerland if they'd be willing to have
a nuclear waste dump in their community. Fifty

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:36.320
percent of people say yes. I assume the United
States would get the same response.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.540
You ask people if they'd be willing to have
a nuclear waste dump in their community if

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:49.140
you paid them six weeks' salary a year. Now,
25% of people say yes. No pay--50%. Substantial

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.890
pay, 25%. Why? Because you have implicitly
instructed people to think about this as a

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.810
matter of self-interest rather than as a matter
of citizen responsibility.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.000
And when they're thinking about it as a matter
of self-interest, it is self-evidently true

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.900
to them that it is not in their interest to
have a nuclear waste dump in their community

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.250
no matter what they get paid. Bonuses in the
financial sector.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:18.010
Thirty years ago, smart economists, that's
not an oxymoron. Smart economists had this

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:25.480
idea that the way to get companies performing
well is to give leaders of companies a significant

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.580
portion of their compensation in the form
of stock options and bonuses.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:38.420
Now when you get to the pinnacle of Google
or IBM or GE, you won't sit back, semi-retire,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.370
and have four-hour lunches because how much
you earn is gonna depend on how well the company

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:49.740
does. It seems blindingly obvious now, since
that's the way everybody gets paid, but it

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.050
was an insight then.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:56.110
And it was an insight that inspired confidence
that the market was now going to be completely

00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:02.680
self-regulated. You were making it so that
people could only do well by doing good things

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:09.870
for their companies; a revolution in engineering
workplace organization.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:16.620
It is exactly that revolution that produced
the concern for how well a company is doing

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:22.020
quarter by quarter, or month by month, or
week by week, or even minute by minute, so

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.130
that CEOs consistently made decisions that
sold the long-term well-being of their companies

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.650
down the river in return for profitable quarters.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.450
This financial revolution turned out to bring
in its wake a financial disaster.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:41.470
[Barry Schwartz clears throat]

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:51.120
So here are just some examples of what happens
when you demoralize the workplace. Now, you

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.510
might think that there's no such thing as
a banker who wants to do the right thing.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.540
Yeah, doctors want to do the right thing.
Doctors want to cure disease and ease suffering.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:06.800
Teachers want to stimulate young minds. Lawyers
wanna pursue justice, but what the hell do

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:14.320
bankers wanna do except get rich? Well it
turns out even bankers, at least historically,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.920
while certainly interested in doing well for
themselves, also saw themselves as performing

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.430
a vital function for their communities.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:27.690
They were revered members of their communities.
They enabled people to buy houses. They enabled

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:32.750
people to start businesses or expand businesses.
They were deeply respected. They wanted a

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:38.570
profit, but they wanted a reasonable profit
and they earned the respect of their communities.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:45.590
You can still find bankers like this, but
they tend to work in very small banks, banks

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:50.910
that are community banks. They get up every
day knowing that at the end of the day somebody's

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.450
life will have been made better. It's not
clear to me that any of the bankers we read

00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:01.160
about on a daily basis these days in the financial
pages think that there is any point at all

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.640
to banking except for maximizing return on
investment.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:12.600
And that just doesn't cut it. OK. So, too
many rules undermine the development of the

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.690
skill that you need to be wise and too much
reliance on incentives undermines the will

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:24.980
that you need to be wise. And again, all of
these efforts to reform systems were well-intentioned.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:30.420
They were not designed to make the systems
worse. They were designed to make the systems

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.690
better. And they may make the systems better
in the short run, but they create a problem

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:42.530
which guarantees that the systems will be
worse in the long run. So, what about wise

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.110
Googlers?

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:52.400
So, "don't be evil" is just not enough. It's
better to have that watch-word than not to

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:59.420
have it. I agree. But all that does is tell
you what not to do. And it's sometimes useful

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:05.970
to have negative instructions. Know what pitfalls
to avoid. But the question is what should

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.970
you be doing?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:12.070
What is it that Google can do or you can do
that actually improves the quality of life

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:17.870
of individuals and the quality of life in
a whole society? This is an extremely important

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:25.060
question that should always be at the forefront
of your minds. Focus on the user. What does

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.300
your user want?

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:32.260
And more important from my point of view,
what does your user need? Give people what

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:38.850
they need, even if they don't necessarily
know that that's what they need. This requires

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:43.790
the kind of empathy that I was talking about
a few minutes ago. You can't figure out what

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.630
people need unless you understand them.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:54.490
And you can't understand them unless you know
them. One thing, as an aside that I'll suggest,

00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:00.280
is that focus groups are almost remarkable
in how useless they are no matter what you're

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:06.660
trying to study because focus groups assume
that people can tell you what's wrong and

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.660
what's right.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:12.450
And in general, people can't tell you what's
wrong and what's right. They don't understand

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:17.200
themselves well enough to be helpful even
if they're trying to be. You have to watch

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:26.960
what people do and not so much what people
say. Keep an eye always on developing technology

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.870
that is values-driven.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:37.690
Keep an eye always on what the telos, what
the goal, what the purpose of the organization

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:45.230
is. That needs always to be in mind. And what's
important here is that it needs to be embodied

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:49.390
in the day to day practices of the people
who are actually doing the work.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:55.460
These great speeches that CEOs make about
how they're interested in serving the community

00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:01.470
are received with complete cynicism by their
workforces who know that they're going to

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:08.240
be expected to make margins, quarter by quarter,
in their area. And the CEO isn't gonna give

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.430
a damn how those margins get made as long
as they get made.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:18.131
So, the trick is to make sure that the telos
of the organization, the mission of the organization,

00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:26.200
is actually embodied in the day-to-day practices
of the organization. And lastly, fail early

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.820
and often. I gather this is not foreign to
people who work at Google.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:38.330
There's an enormous benefit to failure. Trial
and error and mentoring by people who have

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:45.600
already failed early and often are, as far
as I know, the only route to wise decisions

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:53.030
and wise practices. And so, you need a culture
in which people are encouraged to fail.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.300
With, I should point out, somebody looking
over their shoulder to make sure that none

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.450
of these failures are completely catastrophic.
I don't think surgical residents should be

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:06.310
given the freedom to fail when they start
doing open-heart surgery. You wanna make sure

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.460
that patients don't die en route to becoming
skilled surgeons.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:16.550
The last point I'll make is that I think that
if we refocus ourselves on the importance

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:23.470
of wisdom, it can become self-sustaining.
Once we are clued in to why wisdom is important

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:29.650
to get us the schools, the hospitals, the
technology companies that we want and need,

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:36.580
it will keep itself going and here's why.
What we know about happiness and its determinants

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.430
is that there are two most important determinants
of happiness; the two most important determinants

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:47.380
of well-being are close connections to other
people, a network of meaningful and close

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.610
social relations, and meaning and purpose
in your daily work.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:57.690
Freud had it right, though for the wrong reasons,
when he said that life is all about love and

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:05.200
work. Life is pretty much all about love and
work. And what Ken Sharp and I believe is

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:12.600
that you can't have good, meaningful, close
relations to other people and you can't do

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:21.070
meaningful, purpose-driven work unless you
have developed the practical wisdom that enables

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.610
you to figure out what people need and then
how to provide it.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:30.590
So once people become wise, their work goes
better, their relationships go better, they

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.170
get more and more eager to get up in the morning
and do tomorrow more or less what they've

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:39.170
done today. And that makes it self-sustaining.
Thank you very much.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.390
[applause]

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:47.730
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Are there any questions?

00:43:47.730 --> 00:44:00.270
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thanks very much
for this wonderful talk. I was just thinking

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:03.810
about a talk that Jared Diamond gave, I think
in 2003 or 2004.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.810
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Who? I missed the name?

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.810
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Jared Diamond,

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.810
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Uh huh.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.810
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: who wrote "Guns,
Germs, and Steel"

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:08.810
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Yep.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.370
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: about the signs
that our civilization is headed toward collapse

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:19.310
based on historical evidence of how. And I'm
wondering if you look at the power structures

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.770
that have prevented that suppress this kind
of wisdom, that create all of these rules,

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:31.810
do you think it's possible that changes can
come about within these power structures,

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:37.510
or only after they collapse? Can wisdom become
a way a society is run?

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:42.450
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: So, that's a great question.
I wish I knew with confidence the answer.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.930
What I can say is in the book we talk at some
length about two kinds of people who work

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:53.940
within these systems and acknowledge in their
own terms, not in ours, that they're not working.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:45:00.040
We talk about people who are canny outlaws.
They follow the rules because of somebody

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.350
looking over their shoulders, but the find
ways, like teachers, will follow the scripted

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.520
curriculum, but they'll do it at double-time.
And so, they squirrel away ten minutes here

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.710
and twenty minutes there or a half hour there
and in that time that they have saved, they

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.390
teach the stuff the way they think it should
be taught.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.700
They prep kids to take standardized tests
and they'll tell them, "Listen, if you get

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:25.200
a question about this, don't give the answer
I just told you 'cause you'll be marked wrong.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.220
Give this answer instead." So these are people
who are trying to do it alone. Any my view

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.620
is that this is not sustainable.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.311
Eventually, they burn out in discouragement,
or they get caught and they get fired. More

00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:41.790
hopeful are the people we call "system changers."
These are people working within the practice

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:48.770
of law, the practice of medicine, who see
that they are not training their new doctors

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:53.790
and lawyers well and are trying to create
systems for training, medical training, that

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.250
are completely different from the ones that
they grew up with.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:02.480
And some of these things are popping up in
highly prestigious places as pilot programs.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:11.050
Harvard has one. UCSF has one. Students get
contact with patients early. They see the

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:16.490
same small set of patients for a whole year,
so that they actually get to understand what

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:22.490
it means to be sick in the context of living
an often complex and difficult life.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:27.140
They have lots and lots of interaction with
mentors who are looking over their shoulders,

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.890
letting them make the first pass in their
decision, but correcting them when they get

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:36.900
it wrong. The students in these programs love
them. They're incredibly difficult to get

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.900
into.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.420
Everybody wants to get into this program,
but they only accommodate 15 or 20 people.

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:47.450
Now my hope is that what will happen over
time when the evidence comes in that the people

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:53.310
who get trained in this way become better
lawyers, teachers, and so on is that it will

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:58.630
transform the way in which medical and legal
education occur.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:04.630
That's a big step, but it's not enough because
if they then enter the structure of their

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:10.260
profession and all of the incentives that
are presently in place continue to be in place,

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:15.710
this seems to me almost certain, It's almost
certainly gonna happen that all of the good

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:23.760
stuff that they've learned gets destroyed,
or at least tackled, challenged.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:30.030
So, I hope you don't need the systems to collapse
completely so that you can build new ones

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:36.700
on the ruins. I'm hoping that it's possible
to build new systems on, not quite ruins,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:42.260
but clearly defective existing ones. But I
don't know. I just don't know. There's an

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.980
ideological component to this.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:49.151
Everyone thinks that the way to get what you
want is to make it worth people's while. That's

00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:55.910
wrong. Doctors want when people enter medical
school wanting to be doctors for the right

00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:01.051
reason. Everyone? No. Almost everyone? Yes.
You don't need to make it worth their while.

00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:06.200
You need to get out of their damn way so they
can do it the right way for the right reason

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.630
on their own. And as long as we're wedded
to this ideology that comes from economics

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:15.650
that nobody ever does anything except for
some self-interested outcome, we'll never

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.010
redesign systems in the way that we need to.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:23.660
So, optimistic I'm not. But I'm also not hopeless.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:33.810
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Have you looked
at the differences between the US and other

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:37.050
countries with respect to this practical wisdom
topic?

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:40.840
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: The answer to that is no.
We haven't really done the kind of careful

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:48.300
and systematic inquiry. What we have done
is look at examples, books and articles, written

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.140
about the guide of the actual practice of
teaching in medicine or the way in which teachers

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:59.800
and doctors are trained and use these examples
to illustrate, we think often vividly, what's

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.090
the wrong way and what's the right way to
engage in these practices.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:09.580
But we haven't done anything remotely like
counting. The sense I get is that the problem

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:16.250
is less acute in Europe than it is the United
States, partly because one principle driver

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:23.460
of all this obsession with rules is the threat
of being sued. And that's less of an issue.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:30.320
The culture of litigiousness that is characteristic
of the United States is close to unique to

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:37.690
the United States. So there's a little bit
more room in Europe for people to spread their

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.040
wings and take a chance without worrying that
the world will come crashing down around them.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.100
But I think the ideology that you have to
make it worth people's while to get them to

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:53.750
do anything is pretty much as pervasive there
as it is in the US. And that's a major obstacle

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:57.390
that needs to be overcome.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:05.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Hi Professor Schwartz.
I was actually in your Practical Wisdom seminar

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320
when you taught it with--

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: With Ken?

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Ken Sharpe, yeah.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Who are you?

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Meesha.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.320
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Ah.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yeah.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.320
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Were you in the first one?

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.730
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: I was in the first
one. Yeah, yeah. So it's awesome to see the

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:16.730
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Did I get it right?

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:20.620
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yeah. I remember
you walking through all the different industries--lawyers

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.150
and doctors and pointing all that out. So
I'm looking forward to looking at the book.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.150
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Thanks.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:30.040
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: The question I
had was about opting people in automatically,

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.201
going back to that.

00:50:31.201 --> 00:50:32.201
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: Yep.

00:50:32.201 --> 00:50:37.310
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: I think Google
does a lot of this. We opt people into advertising

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:44.870
on ad networks that they don't know about,
hopefully in their best interest. Privacy

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:53.840
issues as well. How does paternalism and practical
wisdom help us walk that line in those areas

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.840
particularly?

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.380
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: This is an incredibly interesting
and complicated question. I'll give you a

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.390
brief pass at it. Sunstein and Thaler, when
they wrote their book called "Nudge" were

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:09.990
very insistent and I think it must be because
Thaler is an economist, that you don't nudge

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:15.320
people in a direction because it's good for
society or even because it's good for them.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:21.650
You nudge them only when you have independent
evidence that it's what they want. So, if

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:27.190
you didn't know that 96% of Americans approved
of organ donation, it'd be hard to justify

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:33.720
moving to an opt-out system of organ donation.
That seems to me to be way too cautious.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.570
So, I think it's appropriate to nudge people
in directions that are good for them, whether

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:44.480
they want it or not, or that are good for
society. The critical thing is that you are

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.900
not forcing people. People can opt out. If
they don't opt out, what they end up getting

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.320
and what they end up doing makes them better
off and all the rest of us better off.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:00.810
But what exactly is the level of privacy for
example, that's the right level of privacy

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:06.600
to serve the interest of individuals and the
interest of the collective? That's a really,

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:13.860
really hard question to answer. But I think
it's one that's worth asking because defaults

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:20.290
have incredible, I mean, Facebook is a classic
example of the power of default. People didn't

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:26.310
realize that they were parading all of their
weapons and their body parts for the entire

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.820
world to see. They just thought that their
closest 12 to 15 thousand friends would know

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.420
about their unusual habits and hobbies.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.740
It turns out no. Everybody, including anyone
who might employ them got to find out about

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:43.640
that. It wasn't deliberate on the part of
the people who did this. It was the default.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.350
So, there are some defaults that are better
than others. And it takes a lot of work and

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:51.830
understanding of people to figure out which
defaults are the right ones.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:59.210
The other thing I'll say is this. It is absolutely
crucial, in my mind, that Google's integrity

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:06.610
be unimpeachable so that when people see the
ranking of hits when they type in a search

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:14.600
term, they know that there is no pecuniary
interest driving that hierarchy. It is instead

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.790
the result of a very smart algorithm that
will only get smarter and that is designed

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.250
to serve what the client's needs are.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:31.380
That's a very precious resource to guard and
nurture, because once you lose that sense

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:37.050
on the part of the public that you're in it
for the public's good, it'll take you a generation

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.360
to recapture it.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:46.840
My own concern is that Google has gotten a
little bit careless about preserving the unimpeachability

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:52.910
of its integrity in the service of a business
model that pushes, obviously pushes in a different

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.290
direction. So, I don't think you can put a
price on that.

00:53:56.290 --> 00:54:01.030
I think its value is essentially infinite
and it is something that is really easy to

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:04.670
lose and then hard to recapture. That help?

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:08.110
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yeah. Thank you.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:14.020
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: So, I have one
other question came to mind, which is both

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:19.970
for me and for a co-worker of mine about rewards
for children for trying to get children to

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:24.750
follow, for example, using the toilet and
not in diapers.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:28.680
A co-worker of mine gives his son chocolate
chips and his wife says, "It's terrible. You

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.890
should never do that. That means they'll always
be looking for a reward." Any thoughts on

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:33.890
that?

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:39.230
&gt;&gt;Barry Schwartz: This is why there's nothing
in life that requires more wisdom than being

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:45.440
a parent. It is terrible to use rewards to
get your kid toilet trained, unless you're

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.290
desperate and nothing else works.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:53.790
It's terrible to use rewards to get kids to
do their homework, unless you're desperate

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:59.940
and nothing else works. A lot of the seemingly,
from my point of view, foolish efforts to

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:05.130
incentivize school performance that school
systems are now using, this is not the first

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:06.200
thing they rush to.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.460
They rush to it basically in desperation.
If there was some other way to do it, they

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.500
couldn't figure out what that was or they
didn't have the resources. So, they're gonna

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:20.220
try to improve the quality of what the amount
that kids learn any damn way they can.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.370
And I think sometimes parents are desperate
enough that they do what they know in some

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:29.270
sense is the wrong thing, because the goal
is important enough that you just have to

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:34.510
get it. And then you'll worry about the negative
consequences of getting it in the wrong way

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.610
further down the road.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:43.940
So again, I don't know, you shouldn't. Some
rewards are worse than others. Chocolate chips

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:49.940
are worse than praise, for example. There
is some reason to think that recognition is

00:55:49.940 --> 00:56:00.520
a less tainting reward than material rewards
are. But even recognition is problematic because

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:05.100
kids start doing work in school because they
wanna be recognized, not because they wanna

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.120
learn.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.510
So, they're interested in approval and not
mastery. And as the work gets harder, you

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:16.100
see dramatic differences. Kids who are interested
in approval choose easy things to work on

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:20.310
so that they'll get approval. Kids who are
interested in mastery are eager to fail so

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.310
they'll get smarter.

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:27.570
Carol Dweck at Stanford has done brilliant,
brilliant research for 25 years on this distinction

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:32.470
and how at roughly third or fourth grade,
kids who are performing at exactly the same

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:38.060
level start to diverge. The mastery oriented
ones take off and the performance oriented

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.960
ones basically flat line.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:46.340
So, a little too much recognition and praise
may have the effect of turning your kid into

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:53.000
somebody who always wants a pat on the head
with unfortunate consequences down the road.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.860
