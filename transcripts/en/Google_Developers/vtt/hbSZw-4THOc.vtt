JEFF POSNICK: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.120
Welcome to this week's episode
of "YouTube Developers Live."

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.970
And this week I have a special
guest, folks behind FanBridge.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.030
Local with me, I'm Jeff Posnick
in New York, we have

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.810
Noah and Spencer who
are more on the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.930
business side of FanBridge.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.780
And they're going to talk a lot
about the background of

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.180
the company.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.930
And we have some of the
developers who have been

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.200
building FanBridge powered by
some of our YouTube APIs,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
Gabriel and Jonathan joining us
via Hangout from Argentina.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.320
So thanks very much for
doing that, guys.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.500
And yeah.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.210
Let's actually just get right
into it because there might be

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.230
some folks out there who
aren't sure what

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.770
FanBridge is all about.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.290
So if you guys can go into a
little bit more detail, I

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.170
would be real interested
in hearing.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.140
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Yeah, I
mean, so Noah and I, we

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.930
co-founded FanBridge about
five years ago.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.790
We were graduating from the
Stern School of Business

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.150
together, kind of entering
a full-time day jobs.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.140
So believe it or not, the
first couple of years of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.020
FanBridge, this was a nights
and weekend project.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.490
So midnight till 4:00 in the
morning and then all day

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.130
Saturday, Sunday.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.285
JEFF POSNICK: Gotcha.

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:14.910
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And what
we were trying to think

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.130
through is how could we address
the fact that we saw

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.160
kind of inefficiency in how this
proliferation of content

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.250
creators were building audience
in a sustainable way

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.620
around that content creation.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.820
So we saw more of them coming to
market than ever before in

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.280
more verticals than
ever before.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.690
And at the same time, kind of
the technology around them in

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.685
terms of building audience
was lacking.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:40.380
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.340
SPENCER RICHARDSON: So we
developed that out and Gabriel

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.470
and Jonie down in Buenos Aires
were the first two people we

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.380
brought on full time.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.980
So then the four of us just
kind of went from there.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.156
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:54.790
And I'm sure that kind of the
rise of YouTube as a platform

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.980
creator has kind of coincided
with some of your business

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.560
plans around that.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.120
SPENCER RICHARDSON:
Absolutely.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.800
JEFF POSNICK: It's great to see
everybody building on top

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.540
of YouTube as a platform and
making things possible for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.380
creators to get the word out
about their content.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.240
So who exactly is the target
audience for the types of

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.660
services that you
guys provide?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.290
NOAH DINKIN: Yeah, definitely.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.680
So we worked with other
different types of content

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.790
creators when we first started
so musicians, athletes,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.430
authors, anybody who makes
different kinds of content.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430
And then really over the last
year, we noticed a couple

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.830
things happening, one that video
content specifically

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.270
YouTube videos, became the
number one most engaged with

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.380
content type across the
entire platform.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.620
So through email and social
media, it was the number one

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.030
piece of content that
people would click

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.840
on and engage with.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.080
Right?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
So that was really
interesting.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.780
JEFF POSNICK: Versus what
other types of--

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.100
SPENCER RICHARDSON:
Like photo, text.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.640
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.400
SPENCER RICHARDSON: So the
numbers we were looking at

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
were like click-through rates
and email campaigns, or

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.660
engagement with social media
modules, and Facebook pages,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.620
as well as where inbound traffic
for audiences were

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.996
coming from.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:58.230
NOAH DINKIN: So that was
really interesting.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.870
And then as we dug in more to
the YouTube ecosystem, we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.530
realized it's massive.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.710
And you guys think it's funny
because you've been here for a

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.300
while, but it was just eye
opening to us how big this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.150
world was and how many different
creators there are,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.010
both individual guys in their
home making videos with tiny

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.720
audiences that are growing,
individual guys with massive

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.170
audiences, the funded channel
initiative where Google

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.630
committed hundreds of millions
of dollars to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.670
fund original content.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.930
You have the MCNs sitting on
hundreds or thousands of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.380
channels sometimes tens
of thousands.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.610
And then more and more in 2013,
you're seeing brands

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.510
really deciding that YouTube is
a place they need to have a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.470
presence where they
did with other

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.510
platforms a few years ago.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.990
And so today, our platform
really serves best people who

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.320
are content creators that
have an audience.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.410
So that's the individual
creators, the funded channels,

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.760
the MCNs, all these guys who are
attracting tens, hundreds,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.260
or millions of fans.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.150
And we're giving them tools to
help their audience come back

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.482
over and over again.

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:03.040
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And just to
add to that, big thing that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.870
we're looking at is, these
guys are taking a more

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.270
traditional business
perspective now.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.720
So they're looking to build a
business around that content.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.360
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.703
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And so I
think that's really the core

00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:15.970
of the infrastructure that we're
developing is how do you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.490
create a recurring kind of
revenue or a recurring

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.630
engagement stream so that way
we can maximize kind of the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.660
lifetime value of
that audience.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.890
And that really is, I think,
where the core of what we

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.380
started building fits well
with kind of the YouTube

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.370
ecosystem is the fact these guys
are getting monetized and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.356
they're looking for new ways
to monetize as well that we

00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:35.355
can support.

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:36.220
JEFF POSNICK: Excellent.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.020
So anybody out there who already
has an established

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.980
audience of some size might
find some value from using

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.540
FanBridge basically.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.870
SPENCER RICHARDSON:
Well, yeah.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.910
And we do have, it's interesting
because there's a

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.240
certain high-growth vertical as
well that they start very

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.080
small, and they grow
very quick.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.850
So I think while the core
technology operates best for

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.720
people with kind of developing
current audience, at the same

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.820
time, we are seeing particularly
as we talk and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.060
work with like a multi-channel
networks, part of the thinking

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.780
there is, how do we also
leverage the benefit of the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.680
audience growth from kind of the
incumbent players and help

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.760
that leverage new people coming
in to those networks.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.870
That way we, can scale them up
faster than what might happen

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.290
kind of organically on the
platform at present.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.110
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.530
So I know that you guys are
integrating with a number of

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.690
different APIs, but before we
get into the more technical

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.220
discussion, be great to see a
demo of what the platform

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.210
looks like from the perspective
of somebody who's

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.530
using FanBridge, and I believe
we're going to be handing that

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.316
over to the folks in Argentina
to drive that demo.

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:43.950
GABRIEL SOSA: All right.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.160
So I'm going to do a Screen
Share now so you can look.

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.100
JEFF POSNICK: Very good.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.070
So that's coming through fine.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.762
Thanks so much.

00:06:08.762 --> 00:06:10.012
GABRIEL SOSA: Oops.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.462
Sorry guys.

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:15.712
JEFF POSNICK: No worries.

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:31.850
GABRIEL SOSA: So what we got and
you see here actually, is

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.110
the main page where once
a user logs in.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.770
And you have here the
activity feed.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:46.130
And of course, open through
the YouTube API, we are

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.160
getting information about all
the videos once the user

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.810
connect with us, their
user account.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.530
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.910
So users go through the like
OAuth to login flow, and they

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.160
grant access to their account.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.770
And then you're able to make
these calls on their behalf?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.405
GABRIEL SOSA: Right.

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:02.660
Exactly.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.420
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.160
GABRIEL SOSA: So on top of that,
what we do is gather

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.470
information of all videos and
also using the v2 API, which

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:23.460
is the last release of the API,
what we do is to start

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.250
persisting and saving the
watch time, which is an

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.410
important metric for our
users right now.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.650
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.140
GABRIEL SOSA: So here, what you
can see is amount of, in

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:41.560
this case, the amount of bang
that YouTube drive has drive

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:48.600
to each video or the channel
in this case for this user.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.040
Right?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.620
JEFF POSNICK: And that's
obviously very useful

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.750
information I mean--

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.620
GABRIEL SOSA: But basically,
right now, you can imagine

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.810
that content creators
are looking for.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.250
JEFF POSNICK: And I think that's
a recent change where

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.170
people kind of realize that
views might not be as

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.260
meaningful as actual
minutes watched.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.067
And we do expose in the API ways
of running reports and

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.555
getting them to watch
details now.

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:15.440
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And one
thing I would just add in the

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.790
dashboard, is the fact that a
big question we were getting

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.110
from people is, how are the
marketing efforts I'm doing

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.390
across email, across social
media, across mobile having a

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.530
direct impact on the watch
time of my videos?

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.080
And so we're actually, the first
marketing platform to

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.400
have launched an ability through
the watch time API to

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.159
see exactly how much your email
campaigns in each of

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.960
those channels, social media,
and so forth, are actually

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.190
driving down to a video level
as well as an aggregate.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.880
So it's not just showing kind of
an overlay of your historic

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.230
watch time across all videos.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.750
It's really about how are
marketing efforts and actions

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.530
you're taking in the FanBridge
platform directly contributing

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.020
to your number one metric.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.305
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.400
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And in the
activity feed, the concept

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.680
there, I'll just add to Gabriel,
is really tied into

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.730
more of a recommendation
engine.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.280
So the idea is turning an
account holder, so a digital

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.880
marketer, or a DIY kind of
person into basically giving

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.270
them a to-do list now of actions
that we know based on

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.650
the global system.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.820
And the data on the back end
is what they need to do to

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.590
impact that watch time metric.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.340
So we're making them more
focused kind of marketers,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.280
which is also saving
them time.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.450
And time is probably the hidden
commodity that's the

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.575
most valuable to all of these
guys is what we're noticing.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.390
JEFF POSNICK: I mean, a lot of
this information has been

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.140
available in the past, but just
via web interfaces like

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.576
off of YouTube.com.

00:09:41.576 --> 00:09:45.210
We just haven't had an API
for a lot of these

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.320
things up until recently.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.230
So I really do think that it's
not necessarily that you

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.620
couldn't get this information
before.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.390
It's just presenting it in a
compelling way that saves

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.190
time, and it's great to hear
that you guys are like using

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.310
it for actionable things
that you could do.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.780
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Exactly.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.680
Well tying it into their
marketing efforts directly

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.070
hasn't been done.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.390
I think that's the unique, kind
of the key is, I want to

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.820
know what I'm doing on Facebook,
or I'm doing within

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.360
YouTube, or I'm doing through
email is having an impact.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.990
And I think being able to answer
that is pretty cool.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.020
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.610
Was there anything else
on the interface that

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.030
you wanted to show?

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.350
SPENCER RICHARDSON:
Definitely.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.350
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.670
If we switch back to that,
and you guys can drive.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.085
GABRIEL SOSA: Sure.

00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:34.700
So I want to spend time
with this page.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.250
So apart from the total
gain time, we

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.730
have total watch time.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.720
We are starting in
a live feed.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.830
That is where you're looking
here, all the videos.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:50.370
And also we view how much time
that's viewed in the last

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.520
minutes and some recommended
actions.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.370
For example, one of these
actions is, OK, you have 7,000

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.560
views, 6 comments.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:06.390
Why don't you create a widget
so you can add more views on

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.660
that video.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.540
For example, I'm going
to paste here

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.130
one of our own videos.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.820
And with this, we created-- this
is a widget where we have

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.790
two options or two
gaining options.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.600
One is to watch the whole
video, you have

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.460
to update the email.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.635
So this is a way to subscribe
to the FanBridge list.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:48.380
Or in the last week, we added a
new feature that is you have

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.670
to subscribe to the
YouTube channel.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.010
I think this is great for the
YouTube creators because it's

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.220
going to basically boost
they're channel, right?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.060
So I would just add options
where everyone can see.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:10.950
Also, we can set up how long we
want to allow people to see

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.310
the video with muted, so
we don't have that.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.060
How long we want to allow the
people to watch the video

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.360
before asking to subscribe to
that, I would put 50 seconds

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.460
to ask for subscription.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:24.968
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:12:24.968 --> 00:12:28.225
And this using the standard
play rate API methods or

00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:30.920
during start time
and end time?

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.230
GABRIEL SOSA: This is-- right.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.530
This is all using the standard
script editor, but we added

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.420
some subscript code
outside new layer.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.190
And so it's rescinded.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.630
And it's all using the v2 API
and the Google API to

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.370
subscribe people to
their channels.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.850
So with this, say we create
the embedded code.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.360
And with this, we have both, a
subscript code that people can

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.200
paste in their own site, or we
are giving them a direct

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.410
landing page so they can put in
an iFrame within their site

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.105
or just give it to everyone.

00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:18.460
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.882
Great.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.825
GABRIEL SOSA: So I will
paste this here.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:41.770
Everybody, it's only 50/50.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.320
JEFF POSNICK: Epic
ping pong match.

00:13:46.146 --> 00:13:50.440
GABRIEL SOSA: And there it asks
you to subscribe to the

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.460
channel so you can continue
watching the video.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.030
JEFF POSNICK: Gotcha.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.750
GABRIEL SOSA: So yes.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:04.490
Basically, this is a great way
for us to allow creators to

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:09.190
promote their own videos now and
also to getting people to

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.480
their own list.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.310
And of course, this empower more
activity feed in a way

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.630
that everyone who is starting
getting into their own list,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:25.480
we are going to show with them
live in this activity feed.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.400
So it's all inter-rated.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.844
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

00:14:28.844 --> 00:14:31.140
SPENCER RICHARDSON: I think
the interesting thing also

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.190
just to add, so we did quite a
bit of testing around this

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.100
stuff before we launched
production, so we'll bring in

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.060
different channels just in the
office sometimes and have them

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.410
work through.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.740
And one thing we noticed is by
having that timing gate giving

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.040
people the ability to kind of
have a lead-in teaser, we were

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.410
able to actually almost double
the conversion rate that we

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:53.930
were seeing.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.070
So typically, you kind of find
that right moment when we've

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.350
all seen on TV where they cut
to commercial right at that

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.670
like terrible kind of moment.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.075
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:05.760
So I wanted to see what
was going to happen

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.450
with ping pong match.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.040
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Exactly.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.770
So who won?

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.410
Or did the shot make it
to the table or not.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.970
So that actually, is something
that just an example of how

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.760
the data really drives the
feature set that we've built

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.610
into this stuff.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.070
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.956
Cool.

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:25.070
Can we talk a little bit about
the way that you're using

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.530
YouTube APIs?

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.410
Because I see a number of
different integrations that

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.310
are being done here and some
really cool stuff.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.850
So starting with the use of the
data APIs because I know

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.310
there are some things that are
specific to the newer version

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.180
3 of the data APIs that you all
are making use of and I

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.590
think is one of the first
companies that we've worked

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.120
with that are using things
like posting channel

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.330
bulletins, for instance.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.070
And can you talk a little bit
more about how you're using

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.320
the data APIs?

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.230
I don't know if you're going to
be showing anything else on

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.090
screen right now.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.216
NOAH DINKIN: Yeah.

00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:00.280
We may want to show that
to publishing.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.783
JEFF POSNICK: It would
be great to see

00:16:00.783 --> 00:16:02.033
your face this time.

00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:09.090
JONATHAN TRAVIN: A weird look.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.830
So basically, all the data API
we are using to re-tape all

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.090
the videos, video data, you just
saw in the activity feed.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.890
We thought we can get comments,
how many views, also

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.905
the video links so
we can supply and

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:32.170
creating using the terms.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:37.560
So basically, the biggest part
of the API we use is to

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.910
re-tape and to show in
the activity feed.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.400
We cache that data internally.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.710
We use that certain that it's
more than going to be.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.160
Not many people know it.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.930
That make it easy for us because
as you know, when we

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.830
ask for data in YouTube, not all
the videos have this same

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.958
quantity of data,
so [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.220
with different specifications
on description.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.380
So we decided to use modules so
it's easier to retrieve and

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.559
to store that data.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.849
JEFF POSNICK: Excellent.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.369
JONATHAN TRAVIN: We are also
using this for when creating

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.040
email campaigns.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.280
So once you connect your account
using the YouTube host

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.660
[INAUDIBLE], we already have
permission to take this data

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.590
and to display it and use it
like a parcel of audio videos.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.430
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.720
JONATHAN TRAVIN: So it
simplifies the life of the

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.410
YouTube creators when they want
to create an email, they

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.470
want to see their stats, like
you just saw in one example

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.180
you call audio videos.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.500
This was from our own account
with all of your stats, which

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.930
is very quick to see
what's going on.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.160
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.820
And I think this is one thing
that maybe some developers out

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.820
there don't necessarily
understand about how to use

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.570
OAuth 2.0 with their APIs.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.740
The fact that you do go through
the approval flow

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.630
once, and once you go through
that flow, you can ask for

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.740
multiple API scopes, so I assume
you guys are asking for

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.090
both data API scopes and
also for analytics.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.900
And then you get a token that
you can then reuse in the

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:34.470
background to continuously pull
data and we don't require

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.540
developers to ask users to log
in multiple times just because

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.560
they're using OAuth 2.0 So it's
great to see that you

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.180
guys are making use of that.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.500
And I just wanted to highlight
that as something that some

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.895
developers out there who are not
as familiar with OAuth 2.0

00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:49.900
might not understand.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.410
So that's great.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:59.200
GABRIEL SOSA: And so in the
client side, we are using the

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.310
JavaScript API of the player.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.780
So when we are completed
integrating what you just saw,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.875
it's a new layer over the
JavaScript API that allow us

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:18.325
to contribute the player in a
way that the user wanted so we

00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:25.775
can get the integrating and then
subscribe, let's say, the

00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:30.140
final, the watcher
to the channel.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.290
That's another API.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.650
So basically, we are not just
using the server-side API but

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.430
also the client-side ones,
which is really good.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.225
And allow to play with
the YouTube player in

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.005
the way we need it.

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:46.450
NOAH DINKIN: Right.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.790
I think one other one that you
alluded to is, I think we were

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.740
one of the first users
of the v3 API to do

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.860
channel bulletin posts.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.870
And so that lets you, we already
let you push out to

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.850
Twitter and Facebook
from FanBridge.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.410
You can type a tweet or a
post, schedule it, or

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.440
post it right now.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.420
You can post to multiple
accounts, and then we added

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.150
YouTube in there.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.340
So as far as we know, we were
actually the first people to

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.060
allow you to schedule
a bulletin post.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.430
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.640
NOAH DINKIN: Right.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.620
So YouTube.com, you have to be
there in the moment pushing

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.950
Publish, whereas this, a channel
owner or creator can

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.010
set it up ahead of time whether
it's for late at

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.400
night, whether they're targeting
a different time

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.370
zone, over the weekend.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.530
If they're a musician on YouTube
and they're touring,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.170
they can set these
up ahead of time.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.130
You can automatically include
video URLs or playlist URLs.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.370
And just makes it really easy
to schedule this stuff ahead

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.830
of time and push out to
that channel feed.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.380
JEFF POSNICK: And I think this
is a great feature of the API,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.240
which I'm glad you
guys are using.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.015
I hope more folks out there who
are watching are using it

00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:46.560
too, because it does open up
this type of interaction that

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.125
you couldn't really do before.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:51.120
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Well, it's
how we can basically create a

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.360
programming infrastructure on
top of the platform so that

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.500
way as people create content,
which is really what the

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.980
content creator should focus on,
the system is able to pull

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.090
in content in real time as it's
coming out, take historic

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.850
content that we are collecting
data on as well, and now use

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.460
these tools, these APIs to
create a publishing model that

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.840
satisfies what the audience
really needs, which is almost

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.340
a continuous engagement model.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:15.760
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.490
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And
that's what creates

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.410
that recurring value.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.660
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.010
Great.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.940
And I see you guys are
using the YouTube

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.670
Analytics API as well.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.210
NOAH DINKIN: Yeah.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:24.540
Absolutely.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.060
JEFF POSNICK: Because that's
kind of what opens up a lot of

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.500
this kind of advanced watch-time
metrics, and being

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.840
able to run really
granular reports.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.880
I mean, this is actually a great
integration with the

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.780
Analytics API.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.560
It's definitely what we had in
mind when developing it for

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.450
like doing a very targeted, I
don't say one off reports,

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.610
because you could certainly do
it on a recurring basis, but

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.060
that's really where the
API shines, I think.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.980
So I'm glad to see this
type of integration.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.740
NOAH DINKIN: Yeah.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.050
I think it's showing people
stuff at the high level, which

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.110
is a lot of what YouTube's
dashboard itself does.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.790
And then that digging in at a
granular level and crossing it

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.080
with off YouTube marketing
activities, whether it's on

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.520
other social platforms, via
email, or whatever have you

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.980
showing people the
different results

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.760
from different channels.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.450
Because I think that's an area
that there's definitely a lot

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.580
of room to run with
on the API.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.160
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.680
From a technical perspective, is
there any kind of feedback

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.160
or pain points that you want to
offer back to me on behalf

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.720
and I can pass along to our
relevant engineering folks?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.660
We're always interested in
people's development

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.210
experience.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:35.350
GABRIEL SOSA: The v3 API for
analytics was like our new

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.910
shiny toy, like a
few weeks ago.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:43.315
So wanted to like play with
it and big cool features.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.440
So we did it and like
we are waiting for

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.420
our next toy, basically.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:03.530
Now, we come and talk with
plenty of API developers, and

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.330
every time we can have like a
new feature of things we try

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.236
to make use and advise
for our users.

00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:18.900
And those two certainly can see
how leaks in FanBridge on

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.800
YouTube, and that can
get great results.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.390
That's really nice.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:32.630
The v3 API has new, good
features in terms of responses

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.230
and the data we can
get from it.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.980
So it's really nice.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:42.182
What's really the nice
times to develop.

00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:43.210
JONATHAN TRAVIN: Yeah.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:48.361
And I also want to encourage
developers to use OAuth 2.0

00:23:48.361 --> 00:23:53.800
because you can see we really
use it like three different

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.880
APIs, we only request to the
clients only once their

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.660
credentials.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.110
And we are fine.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.003
We can help everyone and
they have to login

00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:05.825
only once with YouTube.

00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:07.890
JEFF POSNICK: And you're not
maintaining a database

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.740
somewhere with people's email
addresses and passwords or

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.470
anything like that.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.900
I mean, this is definitely
the right way to do it.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.336
So thank you again for
pointing that out.

00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:19.380
JONATHAN TRAVIN: They should not
be afraid that anyone is

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.970
going just steal their password
because nobody is

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:23.950
saving passwords.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.450
So there are plenty of security
things apart from our

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.375
things that I think I
would encourage any

00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:32.735
developers to use that.

00:24:32.735 --> 00:24:36.280
It would make their life easier
for them and for the

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.230
content creators.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.860
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.798
NOAH DINKIN: What do you
guys wish the API had?

00:24:41.798 --> 00:24:43.060
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.420
This is your chance.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.680
It's not your only chance.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.360
We obviously welcome
feedback here.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.320
NOAH DINKIN: It's OK to be
honest even if we're on

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.360
Devloper's Live spot.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.610
Think about pivotal.

00:24:55.686 --> 00:25:01.715
GABRIEL SOSA: No, I think the
more data we can get on

00:25:01.715 --> 00:25:05.780
channels and videos is the
more we can show users.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:11.420
I think that with the API, we
are getting like a little bit,

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.250
but I think it is too
better to show us.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.762
And we can make plenty
use of it.

00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:22.120
JONATHAN TRAVIN: I like some
more real-time features.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.398
Real time could be nice to
have for any developer.

00:25:27.398 --> 00:25:27.892
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:25:27.892 --> 00:25:28.720
NOAH DINKIN: Right.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.360
I'll throw in some other
requests on there since

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.690
they're being very
polite right now.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.240
I think we blow through all of
our query or quota and that's

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:37.740
been increased.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.190
So the ability to process much,
much larger queries or

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.090
requests whether it's batch or
not, I think that would be

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.160
super helpful.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.930
As Jonie just said, real time
because a lot of the MCNs,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.740
they want to know what's
trending right now across my

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.750
network, and with a two-day
delay, that's

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.920
really tough to do.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.200
And it's not two days for every
metric, but for some of

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.670
them it is.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.300
And I think more depth in
engagement like they said into

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.450
the subscribers.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:05.010
Today, a million subscribers
is a million subscribers.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.630
The channel doesn't know if
that's 10,000 watching

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.250
everything all day long or
a million people watching

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.590
everything once.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.320
Right?

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.300
So more, what's an active
subscriber, just more data

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.170
around that so we can help our
clients understand that and

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.970
maybe target those people
differently.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.676
JEFF POSNICK: All right.

00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:22.530
SPENCER RICHARDSON: There's
also, I mean, some other parts

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.170
of the platform we're not seeing
visibility on in terms

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.840
of performance metrics
particularly around subscribe.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.060
I think for us, that's something
where we do have an

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.840
email component to the platform
that's sometimes, I,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.290
think helping hedge people's
bets in terms of more

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.010
customizable infrastructure
that they're

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.580
driving traffic to.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.710
That said, we'd love be able
to export more of that into

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.550
the subscribe framework because
we do see that as

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.460
really viable kind of channel to
be marketing down into, but

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.570
there's limited degrees of
freedom right now in terms of

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.940
what platforms like us who are
building infrastructure for

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.330
these guys can see and kind of
play around with in terms of

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.150
performance of subscribe,
edit ability,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.600
different things like that.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.390
So little touchier, but it's
on our list of things we're

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.040
paying attention to.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.870
JEFF POSNICK: Well that's all
excellent feedback that is now

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:11.870
officially on the record.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.830
NOAH DINKIN: For better
or for worst.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.140
JEFF POSNICK: Thank you.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.085
We have a video of it, and so we
can present it to the folks

00:27:17.085 --> 00:27:18.385
who make sort of
the decisions.

00:27:18.385 --> 00:27:18.750
NOAH DINKIN: Excellent.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.540
And we can set some timelines
on the record.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:20.770
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:21.130
Exactly.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:21.620
great.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.216
NOAH DINKIN: We have case
studies to back it up.

00:27:23.216 --> 00:27:24.950
JEFF POSNICK: Excellent.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.220
So I know that we do have some
external questions that we're

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.835
being asked if your
FanBridge power.

00:27:30.835 --> 00:27:31.455
NOAH DINKIN: FanBridge
questions.

00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:32.650
JEFF POSNICK: Questions,
platforms.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.910
So I'm going to pull
those up over here.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.760
And I don't think we're going
to have time for all of them

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.200
necessarily.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.190
But let me just reload and--

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.440
oops.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.130
I'll give you a chance
to login on the

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.980
computer over here.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.600
I do happen to know one
of the questions.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.400
I'm going to short
circuit that.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.300
And we have a question every
week as to whether YouTube

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.400
Developer Relations and Google
Developer Relations, in

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.690
general, is hiring.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.610
So if the answer is yes and
you're interested in doing the

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.805
sort of thing that I do, working
with developers and

00:28:03.805 --> 00:28:08.590
getting them to meet folks with
cool integrations, check

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.650
out developers.google.com/jobs.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:12.610
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Plus you
get to work with Jarek.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.780
JEFF POSNICK: You do get
to work with Jarek.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.490
Shout out to Jarek.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.685
He's not on today's show.

00:28:17.685 --> 00:28:18.460
NOAH DINKIN: Cool.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.980
So we have a handful
of questions here.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.000
So one part of the platform, I
guess someone is looking on

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.370
our site that we didn't touch
on is, we're a certified

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.730
engagement solutions
developer.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:27.990
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.480
NOAH DINKIN: So what that
enables us to do is turn on a

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.070
deeper engagement experiences
within YouTube channel pages.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.630
So you have the Home
tab, the About tab.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.030
Now, we can turn on
a Custom tab.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.775
And right now, we're powering
our fan questions experience,

00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:48.560
so you can ask a channel owner
or a creator a question, which

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.200
is what we use to solicit
these questions.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.030
They get queued privately, and
then the creator can answer

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.490
them via text or record--

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.290
actually, this is another API
that we're using, the YouTube

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.280
Direct API I think
it's called--

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.510
to record straight from your
webcam, the answer publish it

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.890
automatically to your
YouTube channel.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.230
JEFF POSNICK: User of it's
a webcam upload widget or

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.060
something along those lines.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.280
NOAH DINKIN: Right.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.140
JEFF POSNICK: I forget to use
the exact branding, but it's

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:09.880
great you guys are using that.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.310
NOAH DINKIN: You can that--

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.330
JEFF POSNICK: That's
a perfect use.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.580
NOAH DINKIN: --drop in a YouTube
video embed if you

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.590
want, if you already have
the video entered.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.220
So that's really cool.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.760
So that can exist right
on that tab.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.490
And then events, right?

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.845
So whether you're a musician
touring, or you're an author

00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:26.450
doing a book tour, or speaking
tour, or even just a TV show

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.900
using different events.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.780
So John Mayer has this on his
channel right now his a

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.650
non-monetized channel, which
is YouTube.com/mayermusic.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.980
And he's just announced that
he's up on tour on the Google+

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.800
Hangout two weeks ago.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.000
And so now, we're powering all
the tour dates for that.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.250
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.410
NOAH DINKIN: And right now,
these tabs can only be put on

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.122
non-monetized channels, but
we're crossing our fingers

00:29:47.122 --> 00:29:47.880
that that expands.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.800
SPENCER RICHARDSON: That
will be for our

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.395
monetized guys as well.

00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:54.230
NOAH DINKIN: We think
that's pretty cool.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:59.220
So why should a YouTube channel
collect their fan's

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.000
email addresses?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.610
Do you want to take this one?

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.240
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.830
I mean, I probably have
opinions on this.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.370
There's something about owning
your audience that's valuable.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:16.760
I think, a lot of people
approach YouTube

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.640
from the ground up.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.480
So they're viewing it as their
entire kind of world,

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.530
particularly for
video creators.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.310
I think more and more people
are seeing it as the social

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.410
network it really is.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.630
And I think as you look at the
time line of social networks

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.050
that have hit the market and
growing very rapidly around

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.450
these kinds of clients, you
notice a trend that there's

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.150
really never like an Export
Your Email List button.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:45.430
And so what we want to do is
have our technology both drive

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.490
growth for the channel owner
in the form of more watch

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.330
time, YouTube channel
subscribes, and so forth.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.675
By the same time, if they can
build and own email database

00:30:55.675 --> 00:31:00.300
as well, we do tend to see that
that is the highest ROI

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.390
channel for a lot
of these guys.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.020
And it enables you to kind
of move traffic around.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.170
So while we'd like to pour more
of that kind of email

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.140
tech into things like subscribe
inside YouTube

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.840
natively, we do see in lieu of
that a pretty strong demand

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.940
right now around being able to
build up and own the database

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.770
that I can then re-market
into.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.235
And given our ability to have a
more flexible infrastructure

00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:28.840
to work with there, it enables
us to make sure that

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.510
subscribers of that database are
having a continuous feed

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.480
of content.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.140
Again, working with the APIs
that you guys provide to pull

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.150
in that content.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.050
So it's a very--

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.390
so we used to call it
your email list is

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.480
your retirement fund.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.640
I think now, for us, we
see it as really your

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.970
recurring value fund.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.270
NOAH DINKIN: And a lot of
YouTubers sell much more and

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.860
more driving people to those web
stores, or back to YouTube

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.585
when they have a new video,
or they do a collab

00:31:58.585 --> 00:31:59.830
with someone else.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.440
Sometimes the platform itself
isn't the easiest place to

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.390
drive a lot of traffic, and this
gives them the ability

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.350
to, as Spencer said, point
that traffic flows

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.870
wherever they want.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:09.690
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:16.640
So one kind of final pitch that
we have has also been

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.870
that the black hole metric right
now that we're noticing

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.870
kind of behind the scenes in a
lot of this, is audience turn.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.650
So we're a SAS business that
kind of we refer to it is this

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:34.900
concept of basically, a turn,
people falling out.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.380
And so I think what we're seeing
email channel really

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.920
enable people to do is drive
traffic back over onto YouTube

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:47.030
as the target in a way that's
a little bit more, creates

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.880
kind of a cumulative benefit, if
you will, to their videos.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.880
So instead of seeing this
pattern of I do a video, and

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.410
it's 100,000 views, and the next
one is 150,000, and the

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.770
next one is 80,060,
then 200,000.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.680
We can smooth out that curve
into more of a cumulative

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.510
growth curve by using channels
like email to consistently

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:12.490
drive traffic back and reduce,
really, that metric of turn

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.390
around your audience.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:13.690
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.220
SPENCER RICHARDSON: And that's
what creates true virility

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.025
because basically, turn
is negative virility.

00:33:19.025 --> 00:33:20.090
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.070
That's a very interesting
way of looking at it.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.290
Cool.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.740
I think that's about all
the time that we

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.560
have for today's show.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.160
And definitely want to thank
Spencer and Noah for joining

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.300
us locally here in
New York City.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.900
And thank Jonathan and Gabriel
for joining us

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.720
on the Google+ Hangout.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.240
I think you guys, a really
fantastic product, but also

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.850
just really cutting-edge
API integration.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.470
So it was great to have
you guys on the show.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.590
And we'll be back next
week at the same

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.655
time for another broadcast.

00:33:46.655 --> 00:33:47.040
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Sweet.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.250
NOAH DINKIN: Thanks
very much, guys.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:48.840
GABRIEL SOSA: Thank you.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.200
JEFF POSNICK: All right.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.940
Thank you.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.411
SPENCER RICHARDSON: Cheers.

00:33:50.411 --> 00:33:51.824
JONATHAN TRAVIN: All right.

00:33:51.824 --> 00:33:53.074
Bye.
