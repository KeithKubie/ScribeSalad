don't know where it's gonna go off and
 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.020
don't know where it's gonna go off and
then suddenly by chance you capture

second of all in the real world you pick

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
second of all in the real world you pick
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.230
second of all in the real world you pick
up a terrorist who's a member of a cell

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240
up a terrorist who's a member of a cell
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.270
up a terrorist who's a member of a cell
or an organization that is in fact about

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280
or an organization that is in fact about
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.700
or an organization that is in fact about
to do something really awful the very

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710
to do something really awful the very
 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.200
to do something really awful the very
fact that you have arrested that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210
fact that you have arrested that
 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.050
fact that you have arrested that
terrorist means almost certainly that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
terrorist means almost certainly that
 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.240
terrorist means almost certainly that
his cell door organization is going to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250
his cell door organization is going to
 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.899
his cell door organization is going to
cancel their plans or alter them because

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909
cancel their plans or alter them because
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:53.890
cancel their plans or alter them because
they know that they're going to be

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900
they know that they're going to be
 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.040
they know that they're going to be
compromised and so in the real world

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050
compromised and so in the real world
 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.020
compromised and so in the real world
when we pick up people when the CIA

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030

ticking bomb what they're asking about
 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949
ticking bomb what they're asking about
is who are the names of your

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
is who are the names of your
 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.559
is who are the names of your
co-conspirators where do they bank what

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569
co-conspirators where do they bank what
 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.500
co-conspirators where do they bank what
are their cell phone numbers tell us

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
are their cell phone numbers tell us
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.390
are their cell phone numbers tell us
about how you operate the kinds of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
about how you operate the kinds of
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.640
about how you operate the kinds of
things that you are planning not because

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
things that you are planning not because
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.750
things that you are planning not because
we know those things are going to happen

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
we know those things are going to happen
 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.190
we know those things are going to happen
but just to get us

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
but just to get us
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.930
but just to get us
of how they operate and all of those are

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940
of how they operate and all of those are
 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.790
of how they operate and all of those are
really vital pieces of information and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800
really vital pieces of information and
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.070
really vital pieces of information and
you interrogate a hundred people in

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
you interrogate a hundred people in
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.380
you interrogate a hundred people in
al-qaeda you put all that stuff together

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
al-qaeda you put all that stuff together
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.780
al-qaeda you put all that stuff together
you're going to avert attacks and you're

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
you're going to avert attacks and you're
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.540
you're going to avert attacks and you're
going to save lives but it's not the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
going to save lives but it's not the
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.420
going to save lives but it's not the
same thing as a ticking bomb and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
same thing as a ticking bomb and
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.000
same thing as a ticking bomb and
everybody we pick up in Afghanistan

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010
everybody we pick up in Afghanistan
 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.309
everybody we pick up in Afghanistan
everyone we pick up in Iraq everyone we

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319
everyone we pick up in Iraq everyone we
 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.229
everyone we pick up in Iraq everyone we
pick up in a safe house in Paris or

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
pick up in a safe house in Paris or
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.380
pick up in a safe house in Paris or
London or Manila may have some small

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
London or Manila may have some small
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.530
London or Manila may have some small
piece of that larger puzzle and so in

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
piece of that larger puzzle and so in
 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.820
piece of that larger puzzle and so in
the real world when you start making

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830
the real world when you start making
 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.910
the real world when you start making
this ticking bomb argument and you apply

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920
this ticking bomb argument and you apply
 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.250
this ticking bomb argument and you apply
it to those cases eventually you end up

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
it to those cases eventually you end up
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.839
it to those cases eventually you end up
torturing hundreds or thousands of

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849
torturing hundreds or thousands of
 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.910
torturing hundreds or thousands of
people which is what happened so it's a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920
people which is what happened so it's a
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.309
people which is what happened so it's a
fun academic exercise that has very

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319
fun academic exercise that has very
 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.330
fun academic exercise that has very
dangerous consequences in the real world

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.640
torture is incredibly useful if your

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
torture is incredibly useful if your
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.130
torture is incredibly useful if your
goal is to extract confessions from

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.110
it's not true and that's what it's used
for by brutal regimes around the world

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120
for by brutal regimes around the world
