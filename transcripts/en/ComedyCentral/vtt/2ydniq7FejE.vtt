GOT THE VERY LAST
GOVERNMENT-ISSUED SEX KIT HERE.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.305 line:0%
 
- OH, COOL.
- OKAY.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.707 line:0%
 
I KNOW SEX
CAN BE SCARY SOMETIMES.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.442
SO THIS WILL HELP YOU
MAKE IT FUN AND SAFE.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.977
HERE'S A MAPLE-FLAVORED
DENTAL DAM.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.411
IT ALSO GLOWS IN THE DARK.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.248
THAT'S IF YOU WANT TO PERFORM
SOME CUNNILINGUS,

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.582
AND YOU CAN ALSO
TRY RIMMING.

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.184
HERE'S A VIBRATOR FOR YOU.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.585
WE'VE GOT THE BUTT PLUG
AS WELL.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.687
CAN USE IT
FOR SOMEONE'S EXIT.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.589
- IT LOOKS LIKE A SQUID.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.525
- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME, MICHAEL?

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:25.826
- WHAT IF
I'M NOT GOOD AT SEX?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.127
OR WHAT IF
I'M SO GOOD AT IT,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.662
I BECOME OBSESSED WITH IT?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.565
OR WHAT IF IT'S SOMETHING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW?

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.767
I GUESS IT JUST ALL
FEELS SO COMPLICATED.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.169
- WELL, I WOULD TRY
THE BUTT PLUG.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.670
YEAH.
- COOL.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.372
- ONE THING,
I WOULD RECOMMEND USING

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.474
SOME OTHER PROPHYLACTICS,
UNLESS YOU WANNA

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.242
END UP LIKE YOUR FRIEND
TOONS OVER THERE.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.711
- BREATHE IT ON OUT.
BREATHE IT ON OUT, TOONS.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.446
AND BREATHE OUT.
AND GOOD.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.915

LITTLE BUTTERBALL'S

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.983
GONNA DROP RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.119
- OH, HEY, MIKEY.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.987
HEY, COACH TEACHER.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.489

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.759

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.730
- WELL, MWAH.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.065

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.733
WORK MY SHIFT AT
THE JUNIOR NEEDLE EXCHANGE.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.535
YOU BE GOOD,

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.404
- THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND,

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.873
- OH, I GOTTA GO.
PEACE OUT, TOONS.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.875
- PEACE OUT.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.217
- HEY, COLLETTE,
I DON'T KNOW

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.852
IF WE'VE EVER FORMALLY
BEEN INTRODUCED,

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.386
BUT MY NAME'S MIKEY.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.521
- GOSH, I THOUGHT
YOUR NAME WAS LEGS.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.189
- OH, NO, THAT'S
MY CASUAL GOOF NAME

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.091
THAT EVERYONE CALL ME
'CAUSE THEY HATE ME.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.893
- WELL, YOU JUST TELL THEM
TO HUSH UP.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.695
- MAYBE I WON'T BE SO HARSH,
BUT I'LL DO THAT.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.430
- SAY, I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND CHAT, EH,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.565
BUT I HAVE MINUTES
TO PROOFREAD, SO--

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.268
- OH, NO DOUBT,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.237
HEY, I WAS WONDERING,
COLLETTE,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.105
