00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.655
In this last lesson of the course,
I want to provide a brief and

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:08.160
high-level overview of some of the
technical challenges and technologies

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.870
that are relevant to today's internet
scale applications that are popular.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.000
And the underlying data center
systems that support their execution.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.980
Please note my emphasis on brief and
high-level.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.872
The space of data center technologies is
so vast and so dynamic, that there is no

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:30.910
way we can cover it in sufficient
technical depth in just one lesson.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.930
In fact, there are a number
of courses at Georgia Tech

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.540
that devote a substantial percentage
of their content to these topics.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.890
Instead what I want to achieve with this
lesson, is to make sure I provide you

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.940
with some context so that you can
understand how some of the mechanisms

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.720
that were discussed earlier in this
course, apply to those problems,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.290
to those technologies that
are in popular use today.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.660
Specifically we will describe
the typical multi-tier architectures for

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.470
supporting internet skill services and
applications, and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.850
their related management challenges.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850
Next we will talk about cloud computing.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.430
We will explain what it is and
what is the role that it plays

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.440
in addressing the limitations of some
of these traditional approaches.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.240
And finally we will briefly comment on
some of the key technologies that shape

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.620
the cloud computing landscape, and
that enable us, with scale and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.680
flexibility, in how we process
large amounts of information.
