and then you have to make sure that the
timing is right to enable them to get

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
timing is right to enable them to get
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.980
timing is right to enable them to get
off the stage so the parts in the novel

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990
off the stage so the parts in the novel
 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.380
off the stage so the parts in the novel

not very interesting stuff for you to
 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.130
not very interesting stuff for you to
write those are the parts I don't like

and and if you're competent enough they
won't be able to tell which those parts

won't be able to tell which those parts
 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.139
won't be able to tell which those parts
are we hope we're always hoping we're

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149
are we hope we're always hoping we're
 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.389
are we hope we're always hoping we're
always hoping that a the hard parts

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399
always hoping that a the hard parts
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.229
always hoping that a the hard parts
won't be found out if you like the other

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239
won't be found out if you like the other
 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.699
won't be found out if you like the other
hard part of course is when you've

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:57.709
hard part of course is when you've
 

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:00.910
hard part of course is when you've
written the spectacular passage with all

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
written the spectacular passage with all
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.979
written the spectacular passage with all
kinds of wonderful words in it and it's

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989
kinds of wonderful words in it and it's
 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.100
kinds of wonderful words in it and it's
just great but it doesn't fit and you

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
just great but it doesn't fit and you
 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.020
just great but it doesn't fit and you
have to take it out too bad

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030
 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.109
I write both because nobody ever told me

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
I write both because nobody ever told me
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.090
I write both because nobody ever told me
not to do it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100
not to do it
 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.530
not to do it
whereas I understand that for people who

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540
whereas I understand that for people who
 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.690
whereas I understand that for people who
go to creative writing schools and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
go to creative writing schools and
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.910
go to creative writing schools and
things are they're told they really

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
things are they're told they really
 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.950
things are they're told they really
should specialize in one or the other

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960
should specialize in one or the other
 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.100
should specialize in one or the other
but since I never did that I'm too old

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110
but since I never did that I'm too old
 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.030
but since I never did that I'm too old
to have done that it never occurred to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040
to have done that it never occurred to
 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.170
to have done that it never occurred to
me that I shouldn't be writing whatever

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
me that I shouldn't be writing whatever
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.090
me that I shouldn't be writing whatever
I felt like writing that said I think

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100
I felt like writing that said I think
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.900
I felt like writing that said I think
it's partly a matter of wavelength that

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910
it's partly a matter of wavelength that
 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.109
it's partly a matter of wavelength that
is in a poem everything is very

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119
is in a poem everything is very
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.960
is in a poem everything is very
condensed so the waves are very short

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
condensed so the waves are very short
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.050
condensed so the waves are very short
the things that are being rhythmically

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
the things that are being rhythmically
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.870
the things that are being rhythmically
connected are quite close together in a

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
connected are quite close together in a
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.450
connected are quite close together in a
short story they're a bit further apart

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460
short story they're a bit further apart
 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.440
short story they're a bit further apart
and then a novel the waves can be my

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
and then a novel the waves can be my
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.240
and then a novel the waves can be my
shot and something that you set up on

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250
shot and something that you set up on
 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:18.120
shot and something that you set up on
page 100 and representatives from my

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
page 100 and representatives from my
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.210
page 100 and representatives from my
line for reprising line one and then

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220
line for reprising line one and then
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.330
line for reprising line one and then
connecting with line eight poems are

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340
connecting with line eight poems are
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.030
connecting with line eight poems are
very condensed lyric poems if you're

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
very condensed lyric poems if you're
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.620
very condensed lyric poems if you're
writing a long narrative poem that's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630
writing a long narrative poem that's
 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.949
writing a long narrative poem that's
different it's more like a novel so

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
different it's more like a novel so
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.229
different it's more like a novel so
that's about all I can tell you about

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
that's about all I can tell you about
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.140
that's about all I can tell you about
that except that the structure is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
that except that the structure is
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.460
that except that the structure is
different because of length and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
different because of length and
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.110
different because of length and
obviously in a novel you have a lot more

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
obviously in a novel you have a lot more
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.560
obviously in a novel you have a lot more
time in fact novels are about time

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570
time in fact novels are about time
 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.080
time in fact novels are about time
whereas lyric poems are not necessarily

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
whereas lyric poems are not necessarily
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.300
whereas lyric poems are not necessarily
about time novels are always about time

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
about time novels are always about time
 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.319
about time novels are always about time
you have a lot more time to develop

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329
you have a lot more time to develop
 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.240
you have a lot more time to develop
people's characters and take them

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250
people's characters and take them
 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.730
people's characters and take them
through changes novels are about change
