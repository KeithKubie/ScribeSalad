(bubbly and funky pop music)

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.315
- 1913 is a year that is so associated

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.203
with the Armory Show in New York,

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:10.155
breakthroughs in the world of Cubism,

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.445
of Futurism, that people often forget

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.766
that extraordinary things
were happening in Chicago.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.148
In 1913, Frank Lloyd
Wright, one of America's

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:20.409
great architects, gets two commissions

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.837
of a scale that he had
never experienced before.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:26.235
Midway Gardens, represented in this model,

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.062
a great pleasure ground,
beer garden, in Chicago,

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.978
and one of the other seminal
buildings of his career

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:32.700
that represented a whole new scale,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.178
the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:38.108
Neither exist today, and
therefore many forget

00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:41.005
that in 1913 Wright was experimenting,

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.709
pushing his search for
an abstract architecture

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.625
of intersecting spaces
to a whole new dimension.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.049
(bubbly and funky pop music)

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.212
At first glance, Midway Gardens

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:53.596
appears almost, especially
if we see its red roofs

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:56.167
and its pavilion system,
and its monumental

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:59.511
symmetrical axes around
a great courtyard space,

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:03.256
almost to be a re-creation
of an Asian palace.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:05.981
One might think of Chinese
or Japanese palaces.

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.347
But one would be hard-put to find anywhere

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:10.252
in the history of architecture a building

00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:13.693
that interweaves indoor and outdoor spaces

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:16.616
in such complex and exciting ways.

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:19.452
And in every direction, space and material

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:22.025
is pierced to allow the light to come down

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.519
through the building,
it originally would've

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:26.135
also sported an enormous system of vines

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.976
and come into flower in
the spring and summer.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:31.257
No longer an architecture of walls,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.478
but an architecture of
piers and columns that allow

00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.514
the eye to gravitate and
move through the space.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.183
(bubbly and funky pop music)

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:41.528
He was in quest of what
he called the organic.

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:43.324
By this he meant not only an architecture

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:44.640
that might grow and change,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.449
but an architecture in
which all of the parts,

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:50.693
from the smallest fragment
to the overall composition,

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.389
were interrelated to one another.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.839
And he begins to introduce
precast concrete panels,

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:58.650
thinking about architecture
in relationship

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.949
to the machine, which was a major theme

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:03.324
of the 20th century and a
preoccupation of Wright's,

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:04.918
but at the same time he realizes,

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.101
if he's going to cast, he can incorporate

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:09.227
many of the geometrical experiments

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:12.002
of the larger composition
into the single piece.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.454
So the single piece becomes
a kind of microcosm,

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.451
with this incredible
play between symmetries

00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:19.267
and dynamisms, different
spaces, different depths,

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.662
so that the material
itself becomes penetrated.

00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:24.973
These panels actually would have lined,

00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:27.224
and in a certain sense, dematerialized,

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:30.587
into a filigree of light and shade,

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:34.918
in almost a textile way,
this entire intermediary zone

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:38.113
of the pavilions and the main building.

00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:40.513
So this is a building that simultaneously

00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:43.463
culminates almost 20 years
of Wright's experiment

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.845
in the so-called Prairie Style, but also

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.569
the opening of a new period
in material exploration

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.183
in which this industrialized
concrete will be introduced

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:56.447
into the more traditional
system of building with brick.

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:58.282
