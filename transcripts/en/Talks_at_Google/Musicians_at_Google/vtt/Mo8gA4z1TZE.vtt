[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.880
ANDREW RALLES: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.730
My name is Andrew Ralles,
and it's a thrill for me to--

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:14.140
hey, Johnny.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.532
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Hi.

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:16.990
ANDREW RALLES: It's
a thrill for me

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.680
to host our guest today, jazz
pianist and vocalist Johnny

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.800
O'Neal.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.370
And a little bit about Johnny--

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.500
he's originally from
Detroit, Michigan

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.600
and got a start playing
some different kinds

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.049
of music, gospel and R&amp;B, before
turning his attention to jazz.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.790
But he worked as a
professional musician

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.310
from a very young age
in Detroit, but also

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.850
in Birmingham, Alabama,
as well as St. Louis.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.400
He caught the attention
of some jazz masters

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.620
at a young age, which
opened up a lot of doors,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.250
people like Barry Harris,
as well as Ray Brown.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.880
But Johnny moved to New
York City in the early 1980s

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.520
and performed with Clark Terry.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.890
He also joined Art Blakey
and The Jazz Messengers

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.780
during that time.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.930
In 1985, he performed
at Carnegie Hall,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.970
opening for one of his
idols, Oscar Peterson,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.070
playing solo piano.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.680
But he left New
York City in 1986

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.410
and spent the next 25 years
living in different places,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.910
like Atlanta,
Georgia, spending time

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.030
back in his hometown of Detroit,
Michigan, and back in St. Louis

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.706
as well.

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:19.330
Just a couple of more
accomplishments--

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.490
he was inducted into the Alabama
Jazz hall of Fame in 1998.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.990
That was one of the first Jazz
Hall of Fames in the country,

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.890
I'm told.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.920
And in 2004, his
career hit new heights.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.790
He made it to the silver screen.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.480
He was in the movie
"Ray" with Jamie Foxx,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.030
playing the role of Art Tatum,
who was one of the greatest

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.800
pianists of all time--

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.880
I believe at the recommendation
of Oscar Peterson.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.910
But he's been back here in
New York City since 2010

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.400
and he has what are
called residencies

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.440
or recurring gigs at different
clubs throughout the city.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.294
One is Smoke Jazz and Supper
Club on 106th and Broadway.

00:01:58.294 --> 00:01:59.960
His new album is
called "In the Moment."

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.110
It's on the Smoke
Sessions label.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.570
And quickly, just my
connection to Johnny--

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.080
I've been a huge fan
since the first time

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.380
I heard him play at Smoke
about five years ago.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.414
I was just completely
overwhelmed.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.330
And I should also mention
that my friend Damon

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.240
Smith is the associate
producer of Johnny's new album.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.250
And together with
producer Paul Stache,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.041
they found a way to
make this event happen.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.310
So I'm very thankful.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.989
So, welcome.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.530
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well,
welcome as well.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.876
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:33.550
ANDREW RALLES: So again,
the name of the new album

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.580
is called "In The Moment."

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.080
JOHNNY O'NEAL: "In
the Moment," yes.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.170
And for a while, we had
thought about the title

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.070
of this new recording.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.700
Actually, it's
Paul Stache's idea

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.130
to come up with "In the Moment."

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.890
I think I had a couple
of different titles.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.880
I believe there was
first tropical breeze,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550
being in love with you.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.650
Then "In the Moment"
was the best solution

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.622
because that's the way I like
to perform, is in the moment.

00:02:59.622 --> 00:03:01.580
I think we all like to
do things in the moment.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.715
We don't want to plan
everything we do.

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:06.760
Had to be spur of the moment.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.080
You tend to have a little more
love and excitement for it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.566
when it's in the moment, bam!

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.358
[LAUGHS]

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.510
ANDREW RALLES: It's just very
representative of your sets--

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.080
JOHNNY O'NEAL: And also,
it wasn't really planned.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.260
Actually, the repertoire
wasn't really planned

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.724
that what we were going to
play, as my guys could tell you.

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:30.640
We went in the studio.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.830
I mean, I had songs in
mind that I wanted to play,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.750
but as the session went
on, then I would just

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.940
add more tunes
right in the moment

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.490
that we hadn't
talked about playing.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.270
Is that not right, guys?

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.770
Yeah.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.228
ANDREW RALLES: I
heard Ben speaking

00:03:45.228 --> 00:03:47.860
before about learning
a tune the day

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.340
before right there on the spot?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.190
JOHNNY O'NEAL: They told me I
always put them on the spot.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.850
They tell me at
times, listen, Johnny,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.390
we've never played
this tune before.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.930
Really?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.425
I thought we had.

00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:58.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:00.440
ANDREW RALLES: So you
keep them on their toes.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.648
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well, they
keep me on my toes as well.

00:04:02.648 --> 00:04:04.150
The future belongs to the youth.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.030
I strongly believe that it's a
reciprocal kind of admiration

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.100
you have for the young people.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.750
And the reason I
feel that way is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.760
because I was tremendously
blessed when I was young.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.380
Fortunate enough to
play with the masters--

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.589
to Dizzy Gillespie,
Milt Jackson, Blakey's.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.750
So when all these young
artists play with me,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.070
they play on all my experience.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.620
They play on all
the great masters

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.330
that I was graced to
play with, you see.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.210
It's my destiny to
keep this music alive.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.630
No America, no jazz.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.420
It's only true art form.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.670
And jazz musicians can
go anywhere in the world

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.520
where other musicians can't go
because it's the only true art

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.630
form--

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.710
the highest level of performance
on a musical instrument.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.590
That's right.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.400
ANDREW RALLES: I know you've
been traveling a lot recently.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.774
Tell us about some of the
places you've been to.

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:56.202
[LAUGHS]

00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:59.530
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well, just this
year, we've been in New York

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.300
twice.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.960
We went to Israel, Russia, Nice.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.800
Where else, guys?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.960
SPEAKER 3: Detroit.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.644
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Detroit, yes.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.060
ANDREW RALLES: How was that,
coming back to your hometown?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.380
JOHNNY O'NEAL: It had been
about three or four years

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.980
since I played there, so they
really welcomed me back home.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.480
And having these wonderful young
gentlemen represent me there,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.184
it was great.

00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:25.100
Give them a nice hand.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.488
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:34.065
I actually travel quite a bit.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:36.690
And I guess both of the guys and
I have been in the band a year

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.320
now.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.630
A year for you and how
long for you, Itay?

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.890
Almost a year.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.590
And they're wonderful
man and it's so blessed

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.080
to just see their
faces in Europe

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.340
and seeing all those audiences,
concert houses, audiences

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.940
just so in awe with the young
talent, more so than myself.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.250
Oh yes, absolutely.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.070
ANDREW RALLES: So we
were talking a little bit

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.220
before about some
of the pianists that

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.870
have influenced you.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.140
And I know you're
able to incorporate

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.580
so many different styles
and make them your own.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.710
And I was thinking maybe we
could go over to the piano

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.850
and you could demonstrate
some of those people that

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.564
have influenced you.

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:25.230
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well,
first for starters,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.860
I started out playing gospel.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.510
And I would have to give
all the praise and glory

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.910
to the great Aretha Franklin.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.390
She was actually the first
one I heard play gospel piano.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.160
And so I would
like to demonstrate

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.110
a little bit of her style.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.740
When I first heard this rhythmic
style with no rhythm section,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.350
just piano, and just
hear the rhythm--

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.480
this is a gospel hymn
entitled "While The Blood is

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.740
Running Warm in Your Veins."

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.240
Here it is.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.649
[MUSIC - "WHILE THE BLOOD RUNS
 WARM"]

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.532
And they use this as the rhythm.

00:07:07.532 --> 00:07:08.490
You can hear the pedal.

ANDREW RALLES: Wow.

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:47.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.690
How about Art Tatum?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.169
I know he was one of the
greatest of all time.

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:56.460
And he was able to play a lot--

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.835
JOHNNY O'NEAL:
Well, I will play.

00:07:57.835 --> 00:07:58.839
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.630
JOHNNY O'NEAL: I can't
play like Art Tatum,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.780
but I try to conceptually
think like him, which I'm still

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.990
trying to figure it out.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.000
OK well, actually in the
movie he mentioned earlier,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.792
I've played four songs,
but only one tune

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.250
made it to the
silver screen, which

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.020
is Jerome Kern's "Yesterdays."

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.521
So here it is.

00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:19.020
You'll never hear
his version again.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.770
I don't know what I'm
going to do with it,

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.220
but this is influenced
by the great Art Tatum.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.660
Also with the eye, the
whole-- remember the photos

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.800
when he had one eye.

beautiful tune I believe-- is it

the composer of that

tune, "The Folks Who
Live on the Hill."

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.780
Is it [INAUDIBLE]?

how you discovered the piano.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.110
Was it the instrument you
always knew you wanted to play?

that's a good question.

The first time, actually,
I was introduced

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:15.500
to the piano I was at the
age of 13, believe it or not.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.630
I heard my father
play at a house party.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:20.937
And we didn't have a piano.

00:44:20.937 --> 00:44:22.770
He had so many kids he
had to get a day job.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.311
He couldn't make
money playing music.

have a-- yeah, I said it!

Let me, let me, let me just
demonstrate what I heard

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.450
my father play the first time.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.420

away at 13 years old.

play this verbatim.

doing the roll,

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.430

your influences with us

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.970
of some famous jazz musicians,
one of whom is Thelonious Monk.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.550

be willing to demonstrate

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.000
some of his stylistic playing.

JOHNNY O'NEAL: OK.

a very personal connection

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:02.880
to him.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.660
I wonder if you
could share that.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.243
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well, actually,
my very first visit to New York

00:46:06.243 --> 00:46:09.810
was actually January of '79.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.590
Previous to that, I had
just met Barry Harris.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.960
And Barry said,
when you come to New

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.480
York I have a surprise
for you, but he

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.090
wouldn't tell me who it was.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.850
So finally, I went to New York.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.380
I drove there actually.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.005
Trying to find him
was just impossible.

00:46:27.005 --> 00:46:28.620
It took me three
hours to try to find.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.090
But he was there waiting for me.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.280
So I picked him up.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.459
We drove over to Jersey.

00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:38.250

view of the Hudson River.

00:46:56.699 --> 00:46:57.990
Does that answer your question?

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.406
You want me to demonstrate
something a little bit of Monk?

00:47:00.406 --> 00:47:03.080
OK, let me just a half a chorus.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.540
Now, you know, Monk,
no one else had

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.179
been able to really duplicate
that sound because sitting

00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:11.595
there watching him
play the piano,

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:15.870
it was so amazing to just
see how he sat and he played.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.621
And he didn't curl his fingers.

he played for you?

"Ruby, My Dear", "Pannonica".

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.500

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.819
oh, man, he played a lot.

And I just sat there
and watched him.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.520
I was like amazed.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.360
See, that's why, you
know, technique--

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.930
people always say the
technique is just how fast,

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.350
it's how you articulate
what you do is what sound.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.940
Monk was a perfect example.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.860
He didn't he didn't
sound real technical,

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.830
but what he did was
highly technical.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.320
It was hard to duplicate
what he played.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.380
And all his
intricate voicings, I

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.500
guess what you would
tri-tones and substitution.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.870
No one's been ever to be able
to come up to that level.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.380
You know, I don't think--
in my humble opinion.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.520
Yes.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.710
He had flawless technique.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.510
At one time, I heard an
early recording of him

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.806
where someone played
a trick on me.

00:48:56.806 --> 00:48:58.430
They said, Johnny,
who is this playing?

00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.880
I'm listening.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.290
I said, well, no, it
said it's Teddy Wilson.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.520
No, that's Art Tatum.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.910
I'm just going on with the
high level piano players,

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:09.520
as far as facilities.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.400
He said, no, that's
Thelonious Monk.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.220
I was shocked.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.350
He could play like
that at one time.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.030
You know?

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:19.670
So I mean, he was
one of the greatest

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.550
composers of the 20th
century, I think so.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.000
You have to know his music.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.500
You know?

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.570
You can't sit there and
shout through his music.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:33.830
You would fall in a
ditch and can't get out.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:34.520
Really.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.790
It's happened to me many times.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:38.874
ANDREW RALLES: Did he
have any advice for you?

00:49:38.874 --> 00:49:39.790
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Pardon?

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.200
ANDREW RALLES: Did Thelonious
have any advice for you?

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.770
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well, he told
me that I have a magic touch.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.440
He said, you know, I'm a
world class piano player.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.730
That's what he said.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.960
Keep continue doing
what I'm doing.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.470
And you know, that was great.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.030
At that time, I
was really young.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.350
I didn't really think of it.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.000
But I'm really blessed now.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.490
Much older now and
for him to say that.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.800
And that's what keeps
my humility in check.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.456
You know?

00:50:04.456 --> 00:50:05.270
Yeah.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.730
When I think about all the
great ones that came before me,

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.990
people called me great
and call me a king.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.540
No, no, no, no.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.140
I'm a student.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.200
Just like today, as soon as I
got up from his great Steinway,

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.840
it said to me, that's all
you got, Johnny, left?

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.550
Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.860
Oh, yes, perfection
is steady growth.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.630
You always reaching and
striving to be better.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.130
You know?

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.340
As for me, every time I sit
down is a learning experience

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.300
for me.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.230
Absolutely.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.330
I'm sure all you all being
creative in networking and all,

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.820
there's always something.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.320
You can't feel like
you have arrived.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.240
Then you won't grow.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.512
You know?

00:50:40.512 --> 00:50:42.010
ANDREW RALLES:
That's great advice.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.051
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Thank you.

00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:44.034
All right.

00:50:44.034 --> 00:50:45.950
ANDREW RALLES: Do we
have any other questions?

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.960
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Don't be
scured, as they would say.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.376
ANDREW RALLES:
Please use the mic.

00:50:50.376 --> 00:50:51.900
Yeah.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.490
JOHNNY O'NEAL: You all free to
ask my gentlemen questions too

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.930
as well, because we do clinics.

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:56.780
And, all over.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:02.309
And people tend to interview
sometimes my youngsters.

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:03.710
JOHNNY O'NEAL: They have
a lot they want to say.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:04.030
Yes.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.490
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.660
Hi.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.470
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Yes.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:09.250
AUDIENCE: I was just
curious, how many takes

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.620
do you typically do for the
album when you're recording?

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.700
And when do you know
when you're finished?

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.040
JOHNNY O'NEAL: How many takes?

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.665
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.490
JOHNNY O'NEAL: No more than two.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:20.830
Usually, the first take
usually is the best one.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.810
The thing about recording,
of course, you're

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.570
never going to feel satisfied.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:28.990
So as long as it feels
good and it sounds good,

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.130
then you can live with it.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.540
Then it's OK.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:37.160
People go in the studio and
take one tune and do 10 takes.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.800
You milking it.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.800
How you going to get
something out of that tune?

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.250
So I think one or two
takes are the best.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.560
It's best to record.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.090
Don't listen to it right away.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.382
Play a couple songs, then
go back and listen to it.

00:51:48.382 --> 00:51:50.590
Because if you listen to it
once, you're going to go,

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:51.550
oh, I don't like that.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:52.590
Let's do it over again.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.080
No, no, let it pass.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.190
No, let it pass.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.660
And go back and listen.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.980
And then, like I said, if it
feels right, then it's OK.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.800
That's some of the
greatest records

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.270
were all recorded in one room.

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.540
They didn't have all these sound
booths and all that back then.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:14.040
Everybody in one room,
a lot of times one take.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.420
(RASPY VOICE) Let's play
"Along Came Betty" one take.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.370
Out.

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.230
Yeah.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:24.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.191
JOHNNY O'NEAL: All right.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:32.260
Are there any musicians out
there as well sitting out

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.027
there?

00:52:34.027 --> 00:52:36.522
OK.

00:52:36.522 --> 00:52:40.020
All right.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.250
Yes?

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.670
Oh, I thought I saw someone.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.462
AUDIENCE: So how do you pick
your tunes that you play?

00:52:47.462 --> 00:52:48.420
JOHNNY O'NEAL: You say?

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.566
AUDIENCE: How do
you pick your tunes?

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.045
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Ooh,
how do I pick my tunes?

00:52:51.045 --> 00:52:52.385
AUDIENCE: There are so many.

00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:53.760
ANDREW RALLES: You
should mention, I mean,

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.530
how many tunes are
in your repertoire?

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.610
JOHNNY O'NEAL:
Well, that varies.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.750
It depends on the personnel.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.670
I think perhaps
with this trio maybe

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:05.010
we have 200 songs
in a book maybe?

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.730
Something like that?

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:10.427
But the last list,
the last count

00:53:10.427 --> 00:53:12.510
after all lot the songs I
accumulated at one time,

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:18.090
I had a song list about 1,587
songs, something like that.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:19.920
But you know, that's
not a lot of tunes

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.920
when you think of the
great American songbook.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.490
Ella Fitzgerald had a
repertoire, I was told,

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.950
[INAUDIBLE] Ella Fitzgerald had
a repertoire over 5,000 tunes

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:34.290
that I know of.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.321
Plus all the verses.

00:53:36.321 --> 00:53:37.299
You know?

00:53:37.299 --> 00:53:37.840
That's right.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.006
ANDREW RALLES: That's a lot.

00:53:39.006 --> 00:53:41.300
JOHNNY O'NEAL: That's
a lot of tunes, yeah.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.740
And you know, it's
so many tunes that I

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.160
forgot that I know because
sometimes I have tunes in mind

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.000
that I want to play.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.670
And as soon as I get
on the bandstand,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.246
they just kind of escape me.

00:53:52.246 --> 00:53:54.120
And you know, I never
get around to playing--

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.310
I say, dog, I should have
played that last night.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:57.480
That's the way it happens.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.240
It's just endless when
it comes to repertoire.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:00.990
You know?

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.906
ANDREW RALLES: Do you!

00:54:01.906 --> 00:54:04.080
Remember the last
tune you added?

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.760
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Well, no.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.710
JOHNNY O'NEAL: No, I don't.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:14.250
ANDREW RALLES: We
have another question?

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:16.534
So you're from Detroit.

00:54:16.534 --> 00:54:17.700
JOHNNY O'NEAL: From Detroit.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.530
AUDIENCE: And I lived in
Ann Arbor for two years.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:19.830
JOHNNY O'NEAL: OK.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:21.880
Ann Arbor, we call that
right down the street.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.080
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.990
And Detroit is currently
going through sort

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:29.282
of like a revitalization,
rebirth, gentrification,

00:54:29.282 --> 00:54:30.240
if you want to call it.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.770
You know, it's
re-growing, et cetera.

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:36.280
And I was wondering if you feel
as though jazz and blues, et

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.520
cetera, have a place in sort
of that rebirth of Detroit

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.520
and that revitalization?

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.311
JOHNNY O'NEAL: Yes.

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:45.180
Well, just being there this past
summer at the jazz festival,

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.740
yes.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.960
Detroit is on a
tremendous comeback.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.530
And of course, some of your
most influential musicians

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.450
in the world come from Detroit.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.580
I'm not trying to
sound braggadocios,

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.200
but that's just the truth.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.170
I mean, when it comes to all
types of music from Motown

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.820
to the soul music, Detroit,
Philly, and Pittsburgh,

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.370
that's the category of
all of your innovators.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:11.370
You have innovators,
imitators, and simulators.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:14.170
And those guys were the
innovators of all this music.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:14.670
You see?

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:18.014
And Kansas City
too, number four.

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:20.324
Yeah, right.

00:55:20.324 --> 00:55:22.180
OK?

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.530
Did that answer your question?
