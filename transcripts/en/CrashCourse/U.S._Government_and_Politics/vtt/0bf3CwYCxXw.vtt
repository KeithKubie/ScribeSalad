00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.359
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics. Today, I'm going to try to explain

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.750
two fundamental concepts of American government
that students and citizens often confuse.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.130
Team Jacob and Team Edward. No. Separation
of powers and checks and balances. Team Jacob!

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.590
[Theme Music]

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.300
So separation of powers is really simple.
The national government is divided into three

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.070
separate branches: the legislative branch,
the executive branch, and the judicial branch.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.200
I put them in this order because that's the
way the Constitution has them. And I'm not

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.460
going to argue with the Constitution, except
for that stupid 3/5ths of a person thing.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.030
So the legislative branch comes first, because
it's supposed to be the most important branch,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.730
and Article I is the longest and most detailed
of the 7 Articles in the Constitution. The

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.829
main job of the legislature is to make laws.
The secondary job is to say, "No, it's your

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.190
fault." "No, it's your fault!" "No, it's your
fault! I'm going home, I have to campaign."

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.590
Then we have the executive branch, and here
the Constitution is a little less helpful.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.719
Article II Section I states "The executive
power shall be vested in a President of the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.590
United States of America." The executive branch
is obviously more than one guy or girl. The

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.159
executive branch is in charge of executing
the law, which basically means carrying them

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
out. The President is like the CEO of the
US, making sure that the government governs.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.000
Interestingly, the President's power as executive
is found in the Oath of Office. "I do solemnly

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.549
swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute
the office of the President of the United

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.670
States, and will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.320
of the United States." Ruh ruh ruh!

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.560
Wait, Stan, I just gave the Presidential Oath
of Office, so I'm President now, right? Totally.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.640
Oh, elections, yeah, we didn't have those.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.040
Last and, in the eyes of many, least, is the
judicial branch. The job of the judiciary,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.070
also sometimes called "the Courts," which
I'm going to also call "the Courts," because

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.290
judiciary is really hard to say, is to interpret
the law, to explain what it means. Article

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.090
III, which describes the judicia- the courts
is even shorter than Article II. It only has

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.520
3 sections instead of 4, and the courts today
don't really look like this description.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.299
Here is the first sentence of Article III
Section I: "The judicial power of the United

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.319
States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,
and in such inferior courts as the Congress

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.440
may from time to time ordain and establish."
At least the Framers realized that the entire

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.200
United States would probably need more than
one court. But notice right there in the sentence,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.750
that Congress has the power to create all
other courts.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.160
And this lead us nicely into the second important
concept of American government - checks and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.110
balances. Yeah, that was a segue right into
it. It was a nice job, by me. I'm going to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.050
need a little help explaining checks and balances,
so let's do that part in the Clone Zone.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.280
Checks and balances is a confusing term because
it implies two things. But really, it would

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.610
be better to think of them as checks that
balance, although that might be confusing

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.349
to people who actually try to balance their
checkbooks. Anyways, the point here is that

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.030
each of the branches has the power to limit,
or check, the other two and this creates a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.599
balance between the three separate powers.
In the same way that the Constitution lays

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.959
out the legislature in the greatest detail,
it also gives the legislature the greatest

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.999
number of checks on the other branches. Legislative
clone...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.820
Legislative Clone: So the Framers of the Constitution
were really concerned about the President

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.739
becoming a tyrannical figure a la King George
III. That guy was a jerk. So the Constitution

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.830
gives the legislature a lot of power over
the Executive. The House of Representatives

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.379
can impeach the President, then the Senate
can remove the President from office, but

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.970
only if two thirds of the Senators vote for
impeachment. The Senate can also check the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.910
President's appointment of judges and officials
by rejecting them. This is known as advice and consent.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.510
Either branch of Congress can investigate
executive activities and officers. If the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.960
President vetoes a law, Congress, with a two
thirds vote in both houses, can override the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.099
veto. Congress can also refuse to pass laws
that the executive wants, and probably most

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.690
important, they can refuse to appropriate
funds for executive programs. You might think

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.610
that since the judiciary is the third and
presumably least important branch, Congress

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.090
would have fewer checks on it. But that would
be wrong!

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.060
Here are the ways that the legislative branch
can limit the judicial branch: Congress can

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.830
impeach and remove judges as it can do with
the President. Congress can be a bunch of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.110
jerks sometimes. Huh, that's me. Heheheh.
Senates can reject judicial nominees, which

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.400
is a check on judges before they even get
there. Congress can change the federal court

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.379
system by adding or taking away courts like
it says in Article III. And it can change

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.269
the jurisdiction of federal courts. Congress
can pass new laws that override the Supreme

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.150
Court decisions, as long as the decisions
aren't based on the Constitution. Don't want

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.299
to do that, no. And as a very last, super
drastic resort, Congress can propose Amendments

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.959
to the Constitution, as it did with the 13th, 14th, and
15th Amendments, overruling the Dred Scott decision.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.690
Craig: Wow, legislative clone. Looks like
the Framers were so scared of an all-powerful

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.590
super president that they gave Congress most
of the power. Executive Clone, you know, I'll

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.370
be Executive Clone because I'm basically president
of the clones.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.890
The executive branch can check the power of
the legislature in the following ways: the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.220
president can veto Congress' laws so that
they don't go into effect. The president can

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
call Congress into a special session, but
he can't make them pass new laws. The executive

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.750
branch carries out the laws, and may do so
in ways that are contrary to what Congress

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.580
wanted. Although this rarely happens, the
vice president is given power to break ties

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.210
in the Senate, which is one of his only real
powers other than embarrassing the president.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.259
The president nominates Supreme Court justices,
and this can change the way the courts work.

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.320
He also nominates federal court judges, and
this shapes the entire court system. The president

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.120
can pardon people convicted by the courts,
which cancels out their judgments. The president

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.360
can also, in his capacity to carry out the
laws, refuse to carry out court decisions.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.980
So you can see, even with a number of checks that it
has, the executive branch is weaker than the legislature.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.009
Judiciary Clone: But not as judiciary branch.
Many political scientists consider the judiciary

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.610
the weakest branch because without
legislative and executive action, it doesn't

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.330
have a whole lot to do. Being the weakest
branch, the judiciary also has the fewest

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.280
checks on the other two branches.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.229
Here's what it can do: The judiciary checks
the legislature by declaring its laws unconstitutional.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.270
The Chief Justice presides over impeachment
trials, and sometimes he gets to wear a special

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.580
robe when this happens. Perk of the job, it's
a perk of the job. It's really nice.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.340
And the judiciary checks the executive branch
by declaring executive actions unconstitutional.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.160
A really good example of this was Youngstown
Sheet and Tube Company vs. Sawyer, a super

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.820
important case. Look it up, look it up!

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.039
The court also issues warrants in federal
crime cases, and again presides over impeachment

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.819
trials in the Senate. But the big check that
the courts have is invalidating laws and executive

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.979
actions. We'll talk about how courts actually do
this and where they got this power in a later episode.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.759
Craig: No, I'll talk about it in a later episode,
okay? Let's go back to the regular desk.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.199
Judiciary Clone: You're out of order!

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.220
Craig: Thanks clones. Now some of you are
probably saying, Craig, this is very helpful

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.000
information but why do we have checks and
balances in the first place? To you I say,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.850
"Stop talking to your computers, that's weird!"
I also say, "Let's go to the Thought Bubble."

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.289
So the Framers of the Constitution were terrified
of a tyrannical central government that would

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.860
destroy people's rights like they felt the
British had. The powers of the national government

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.580
are separated, and each branch are able to
check others because this makes it more difficult

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.949
for the government to act in ways that harm
the acts and interests of the citizens.

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.630
One of the best explanations of this comes
from, you guessed it, the Federalists Papers.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.550
In this case, Federalist 51, which was written
by James Madison, who also wrote a lot of

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.699
the Constitution and became president, so
he kind of knows what he's talking about.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.490
And really, it's kind of a shame that he's
not on our money because Americans would pay

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.650
him more attention, and they would also pay
him, literally.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.080
In Federalists 51, the title which also contains
the phrase, "checks and balances," Madison

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.520
wrote, "But the great security against a gradual
concentration of the several powers in same

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.259
department, consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary constitutional

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.619
means and personal motives to resist encroachments
of the others. It may be a reflection on human

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.240
nature, that such devices should be necessary
to control the abuses of government. But what

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.800
is government itself, but the greatest of
all reflections on human nature."

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.520
That's right, he wrote with an accent. Don't know
how that's possible. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.819
Madison was talking about checks and
balances; I'll leave it up to you to decide

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.039
if human nature requires that we build safeguards
into our government to protect us from

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.880
our leaders. But Madison thought so, and I think so
too. But this isn't about me; this is about government.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.180
And it's helpful to remember that when people
tell you that the Framers of the Constitution

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:56.289
were infallible, James Madison actually that
they were outfallible, or just fallible. Anyways,

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.669
see you next time. I'm so fallible.
