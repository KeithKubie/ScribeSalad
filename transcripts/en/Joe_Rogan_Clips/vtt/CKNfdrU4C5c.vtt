1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
When you were making $5 a night,
literally $5 thousand night as a comedian.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.110
I was so much happier than when I had a day job.
Oh yeah.
Making real money.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.153
Once the,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
I remember the feeling of being able to make a living with just stand up.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.730
Yeah.
Like what?
Like holy cow and not a good living.
Just getting by.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.650
In my beginning it was super shaky.
Yes,
super shaky.
Right?

7
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:30.030
Like I started making money.
I was making like a little bit of money in Boston,

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.960
but I always had day jobs when I moved to New York and then Jeff started

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.510
managing me.
Then I started making money,

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.940
like he get me booked in places and I was doing,

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.450
I was working pretty much every weekend.
Who Is Jeff?
Jeff Sussman.
Sussman.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.040
Longtime manager started managing me when I was an open miker.
Oh,
nice.
Yeah.

13
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.210
We've been together forever.
Well,
he's the best.
He's still with them.
Yep.
Wow.

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
That's amazing.
Best.
That's amazing.
He's the best.
I love the guy.
That's great.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.760
He's an awesome person too,
and just brilliant at his job.

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.240
Super Low key.
Doesn't give a fuck about Hollywood just so that's great.

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.620
But you know,
he's,
he's,
he understands it right to do right.
He doesn't care.

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.500
He's like to do what makes you happy once he just wants you to be happy.

19
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.450
It's awesome.
So he picked you up when you're doing open mikes too.
Dude,

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.530
I'll just scrub it wasn't even supposed to go on stage that night.
Really?

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.390
He came into town.
He had managed some other comedians.
I remember Bob Nelson.
No,

22
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.110
Bob Nelson.
Jeffy Jeff football guy.
Yeah.
You may have that.
Oh my God.

23
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.550
He can manage him.
Oh really?
Yeah,
and he produced his HBO special.

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.790
Wow.
And um,
they were partying ways and uh,

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.430
they were parting ways and Jeff was like,
well,

26
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
maybe I've seen everybody that I've seen in New York,

27
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.690
maybe I'll take a trip to Boston.

28
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.440
So he took a trip to Boston and just fucking dumb luck when I was driving limos,

29
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.280
I wrote a joke that day.
I had this joke and I called up my friend Oliver,

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.560
who was the manager at the club and I said,
hey man,

31
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.800
can I come in and do like five minutes cause I have this joke,
I want to try out.

32
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.520
I said,
sure,
come on in.
And he liked me.
So he hooked me up.
And uh,

33
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.160
I went on stage and I didn't even know Sussman who was in the room when,

34
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.090
cause I didn't know he was in the room.
I didn't give a fuck.
I was super loose.

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.040
You knew who he was at that point?
No,
I didn't know who he didn't know.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.720
So it just didn't,
it wouldn't,
but I knew that there was a manager from New York,

37
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.420
right.
That handled Bob Nelson.
I'd be like,
Holy Shit,

38
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:19.630
I probably freak out and sure I'd choke
shop,

39
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.640
act as shaky as fuck back then anyway,
you know,
I'm only like,

40
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.120
of course we wouldn't have three years in a colony or something like that.

41
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.200
I was terrible happened anything did often.
It was really interesting.

42
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:34.130
Like he took me to New York to,
um,

43
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.340
he saw me there and then he took me into New York to try out.

44
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.760
He wanted to see me perform in some other clubs.
So he said,
we,

45
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.890
are you willing to come down in New York?
So I said,
sure.
Yeah.

46
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.960
I've always wanted to,
I was so nervous about performing in New York.
Of course.

47
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.360
I thought New York City was different.

48
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.320
There was like more nervous than when he came to see me the second time in

49
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.800
Boston.
I was more nervous to perform in New York.
I was like,

50
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.530
I can't believe I was one of at catch a rising star,
which doesn't exist anymore.

51
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.170
Just legends.
Forget it.
Your head.
Yeah.
That's a big thing.

52
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:05.530
It's on because you don't know it yet.
Yeah.
Well,

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.100
it was like the New York comics were always like the smart ones.

54
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.230
Yeah.
That was the thought process.
They insert your thought process in Boston.

55
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.400
The audiences are smarter.

56
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.070
They're not going to buy your bullshit smarter over there.
Yeah.
No,

57
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.880
you're not funny.
You're going to know.
They're gonna know.
And uh,

58
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.830
it's really funny.
He's like Sussman.

59
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.740
We were talking about like clean comedy versus dirty comedy and there was no

60
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.750
really real decision like you know like,

61
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.540
because back then people would like decide to be clean.

62
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.620
It wasn't like you're a clean comic because that's how you think.
It's like,
well,

63
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.790
if you want to get more work,

64
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.130
the smart moves through clean as a business decision,

65
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:45.080
as a business decision should dress nice and act clean.

66
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.120
Took me to this place called,
we went to a bunch of places,

67
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.500
did eat side comedy club,

68
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.960
which is a cool comedy club that used to be in long island.

69
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.580
Then he took me to this place called fast eddies and Huntington and it was a,

70
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.370
it was a local bar that had a comedy night.
Wow.

71
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.740
We went upstairs and it was so,

72
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.450
the crowd was so fucking rowdy and so drunk and there was a dude on stage.

73
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:12.451
His name was George Gallows hilarious dude who was doing a reverse shit with a

74
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:18.310
banana.
It's like as you're waiting to go on,

75
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:22.660
so you had a banana that he was like,
he was somehow or another slurping,

76
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.340
like there was a reverse shit and he's doing this in front of,
you know,

77
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.040
these people are hammered.
It's like a Wednesday night or some shit,
right?

78
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.190
And sustenance says he grabs her.
By the time you don't have to perform here,

79
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220
we're going to,
we're going to get out of it.
And I said,
no fucking way.
I go,

80
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:40.660
listen man,
I'm going to be to my people.
I go,

81
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:44.770
just trust me.
Let me go out my paper.
I'm like,
this is what I do,
man.

82
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:48.610
All the gigs that I got in bosses were all bargains.
Course handle them.
