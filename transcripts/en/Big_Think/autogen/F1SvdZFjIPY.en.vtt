but I can put them in a laboratory I

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500
but I can put them in a laboratory I
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.750
but I can put them in a laboratory I
could put them in a studio so that

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760
could put them in a studio so that
 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.000
could put them in a studio so that
they'll play back immediately and if I

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010
they'll play back immediately and if I
 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.340
they'll play back immediately and if I
can touch a key and have something

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350
can touch a key and have something
 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.010
can touch a key and have something
happen I should be able to make my own

something where I can squeeze something
 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.000
something where I can squeeze something
or you know the way I touch something

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.010
or you know the way I touch something
 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.550

should be able to change the sound so I

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560
should be able to change the sound so I

started thinking about either leveraging

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
started thinking about either leveraging
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.670
started thinking about either leveraging
off of existing instruments or making

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680
off of existing instruments or making
 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.990
off of existing instruments or making
new instruments that would take what

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000
new instruments that would take what
 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.470
new instruments that would take what
people do well in mastering an

people do well in mastering an
 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.100
people do well in mastering an
instrument but multiplying the effect

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.110
instrument but multiplying the effect
 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.930
instrument but multiplying the effect
that you could produce with that

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:55.940
that you could produce with that
 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.720
that you could produce with that
instrument so I didn't actually build a

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:58.730
instrument so I didn't actually build a
 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.120

interactive music and with the hyper

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.510
interactive music and with the hyper
 

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.140
interactive music and with the hyper
instrument the idea was how to take the

instrument the idea was how to take the
 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.500

they're playing what the interpretation
is and let that interpretation be the

like writing a computer program not like

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:09.209
like writing a computer program not like
 

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.879
like writing a computer program not like
working with the machine but just like

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:10.889
working with the machine but just like
 

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:12.920
working with the machine but just like
playing naturally so that's what I

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:12.930
playing naturally so that's what I
 

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.030
playing naturally so that's what I
wanted a hyper instrument to be

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040
wanted a hyper instrument to be
 

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:20.210
wanted a hyper instrument to be
especially for trained musicians

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220
 

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.110
so one of the interesting things about

so one of the interesting things about
 

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.370
so one of the interesting things about
inventing these instruments and actually

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380
inventing these instruments and actually
 

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.130
inventing these instruments and actually

sounds you think of the more radical the
technology is that you're trying to

technology is that you're trying to
develop for music in particular the more

develop for music in particular the more
 

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.110
develop for music in particular the more
likely it is that something unexpected

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120
likely it is that something unexpected
 

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.100
likely it is that something unexpected
is going to come out of it that you

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.110
is going to come out of it that you
 

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.860
is going to come out of it that you
didn't expect at the beginning so it's a

perfect case we built this hyper cello

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300
perfect case we built this hyper cello
 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.790
perfect case we built this hyper cello
for yo-yo MA and you know I wanted to

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800
for yo-yo MA and you know I wanted to
 

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.560
for yo-yo MA and you know I wanted to
keep it as close to a regular cello as

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:51.570
keep it as close to a regular cello as
 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.690
keep it as close to a regular cello as
possible so had a regular fingerboard

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700
possible so had a regular fingerboard
 

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.870

Stradivarius he didn't like that idea
 

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.990
Stradivarius he didn't like that idea
too much so so we made a physical

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000
too much so so we made a physical
 

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.700
too much so so we made a physical
instrument from scratch so we could put

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:09.710
instrument from scratch so we could put
 

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.930
instrument from scratch so we could put
measurement devices and sensors right in

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940
measurement devices and sensors right in
 

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.750
measurement devices and sensors right in
the instrument so you play this cello

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760
the instrument so you play this cello
 

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.390
the instrument so you play this cello
you plug it in it can sound like a

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:17.400
you plug it in it can sound like a
 

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.270
you plug it in it can sound like a
regular cello but it's also measuring

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:20.280
regular cello but it's also measuring
 

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.100
regular cello but it's also measuring
everything that's happening then we took

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.110
everything that's happening then we took
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.040
everything that's happening then we took
a regular bow because measuring the

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.050
a regular bow because measuring the
 

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.960
a regular bow because measuring the
Boeing for cello is is like breathing

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:26.970
Boeing for cello is is like breathing
 

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.570
Boeing for cello is is like breathing
for a singer so we had to measure

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:29.580
for a singer so we had to measure
 

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.950
for a singer so we had to measure
everything about the you have a

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:30.960
everything about the you have a
 

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.170
everything about the you have a
horsehair on the string and the how the

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180
horsehair on the string and the how the
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.090
horsehair on the string and the how the
pressure and how fast it's moving in the

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100
pressure and how fast it's moving in the
 

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.430
pressure and how fast it's moving in the
angle we found out the best way to do

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440
angle we found out the best way to do
 

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.870
angle we found out the best way to do
that was to put two computer chips on

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880
that was to put two computer chips on
 

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.360
that was to put two computer chips on
either side of the bow to send

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.370
either side of the bow to send
 

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.800
either side of the bow to send
electricity through the chips into the

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:45.810
electricity through the chips into the
 

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.640
electricity through the chips into the
air to put a little antenna on the cello

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:49.650
air to put a little antenna on the cello
 

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.950
air to put a little antenna on the cello
the antenna picks up the electricity and

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:51.960
the antenna picks up the electricity and
 

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.410
the antenna picks up the electricity and
it can tell if you write software which

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420
it can tell if you write software which
 

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.180
it can tell if you write software which
side of the bow the electricity is

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.190
side of the bow the electricity is
 

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.310
side of the bow the electricity is
coming from and by doing that you could

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320
coming from and by doing that you could
 

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.170
coming from and by doing that you could
tell where the bow is how fast it's

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180
tell where the bow is how fast it's
 

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.700
tell where the bow is how fast it's
moving how much bow you're using which

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:01.710
moving how much bow you're using which
 

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.840
moving how much bow you're using which
part of the bow you're on the angle

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:02.850
part of the bow you're on the angle
 

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.970
part of the bow you're on the angle
everything you need to to have a kind of

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980
everything you need to to have a kind of
 

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.520
everything you need to to have a kind of
language of the gesture of bowing so we

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:07.530
language of the gesture of bowing so we
 

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.710
language of the gesture of bowing so we
did that it worked well I wrote some

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720
did that it worked well I wrote some
 

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.830
did that it worked well I wrote some
pieces for yo-yo he played them and so

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:12.840
pieces for yo-yo he played them and so
 

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.480
pieces for yo-yo he played them and so
that kind of hyper cello started taking

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.490
that kind of hyper cello started taking
 

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.260
that kind of hyper cello started taking
off at the same time we were rehearsing

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.270
off at the same time we were rehearsing
 

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.500
off at the same time we were rehearsing
and we found that when yo-yos bow got

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:21.510
and we found that when yo-yos bow got
 

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.930
and we found that when yo-yos bow got
close to the cello when his hand got

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940
close to the cello when his hand got
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.240
close to the cello when his hand got
close to the cello the measurement went

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.250
close to the cello the measurement went
 

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.340
close to the cello the measurement went
all wacky it wasn't supposed to do that

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:28.350
all wacky it wasn't supposed to do that
 

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.770
all wacky it wasn't supposed to do that
so we went back to the lab we found out

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:30.780
so we went back to the lab we found out
 

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.200
so we went back to the lab we found out
that sure enough his body was absorbing

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.210
that sure enough his body was absorbing
 

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.100
that sure enough his body was absorbing
electricity from

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.110
electricity from
 

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.050
electricity from
this circuit which is kind of a drag

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060
this circuit which is kind of a drag
 

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.449
this circuit which is kind of a drag
because you know it became unpredictable

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459
because you know it became unpredictable
 

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:41.180
because you know it became unpredictable
so first we figured out how to modify it

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:41.190
so first we figured out how to modify it
 

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.790
so first we figured out how to modify it
so you could predict it but then I

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800
so you could predict it but then I
 

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.470
so you could predict it but then I
started thinking oh gee if this electric

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480
started thinking oh gee if this electric
 

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.710
started thinking oh gee if this electric
circuit is is measuring where you know

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720
circuit is is measuring where you know
 

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.360
circuit is is measuring where you know
how much electricity is hand is

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.370
how much electricity is hand is
 

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.460
how much electricity is hand is
absorbing it actually knows what I could

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.470
absorbing it actually knows what I could
 

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.470
absorbing it actually knows what I could
tell where his hand is and if I could do

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480
tell where his hand is and if I could do
 

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.750
tell where his hand is and if I could do
that I can actually throw away the cello

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760
that I can actually throw away the cello
 

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.060
that I can actually throw away the cello
and throw away the bow and just make an

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.070
and throw away the bow and just make an
 

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.560
and throw away the bow and just make an
instrument that measures the way

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:03.570
instrument that measures the way
 

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.290
instrument that measures the way
somebody moves their hands and so a

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300
somebody moves their hands and so a
 

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.910
somebody moves their hands and so a
light bulb went off and I started

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920
light bulb went off and I started
 

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.650
light bulb went off and I started
thinking my gosh all the sophisticated

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660
thinking my gosh all the sophisticated
 

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.960
thinking my gosh all the sophisticated
software for measuring how yo yo plays

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:11.970
software for measuring how yo yo plays
 

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.840
software for measuring how yo yo plays
and how he moves and this technique of

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:14.850
and how he moves and this technique of
 

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.780
and how he moves and this technique of
the bow I should be able to use similar

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:17.790
the bow I should be able to use similar
 

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.900
the bow I should be able to use similar
techniques for measuring the way anybody

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:20.910
techniques for measuring the way anybody
 

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.639
techniques for measuring the way anybody
moves and so somebody who's not a

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:22.649
moves and so somebody who's not a
 

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.110
moves and so somebody who's not a
professional or trained musician I

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120
professional or trained musician I
 

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.790
professional or trained musician I
should be able to make a musical

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
should be able to make a musical
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.350
should be able to make a musical
environment for them so the first

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360
environment for them so the first
 

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.090
environment for them so the first
instrument we made after the hyper cello

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100
instrument we made after the hyper cello
 

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.400
instrument we made after the hyper cello
was a chair we made something called the

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.410
was a chair we made something called the
 

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.990
was a chair we made something called the
sensor chair and we actually made this

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000
sensor chair and we actually made this
 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.389
sensor chair and we actually made this
with for the magicians Penn and Teller

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399
with for the magicians Penn and Teller
 

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:37.160
with for the magicians Penn and Teller
because they were following the work and

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.170
because they were following the work and
 

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.019
because they were following the work and
we kind of had this idea so he took a

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:39.029
we kind of had this idea so he took a
 

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.519
we kind of had this idea so he took a
chair put a piece of metal on the chair

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:40.529
chair put a piece of metal on the chair
 

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:43.460
chair put a piece of metal on the chair
when you sit on the chair your rear end

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.470
when you sit on the chair your rear end
 

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.439
when you sit on the chair your rear end
touches the metal and your body becomes

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:45.449
touches the metal and your body becomes
 

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:46.939
touches the metal and your body becomes
part of this electric circuit just like

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:46.949
part of this electric circuit just like
 

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:49.220
part of this electric circuit just like
the the bow was so electricity is

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.230
the the bow was so electricity is
 

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.439
the the bow was so electricity is
streaming out of your body you put two

00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:51.449
streaming out of your body you put two
 

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:53.000
streaming out of your body you put two
poles in front of the chair and the

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.010
poles in front of the chair and the
 

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.880
poles in front of the chair and the
polls have sensors in them with little

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:55.890
polls have sensors in them with little
 

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.939
polls have sensors in them with little
lights so when I move my arms I'm

00:13:58.939 --> 00:13:58.949
lights so when I move my arms I'm
 

00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:00.740
lights so when I move my arms I'm
electricity's coming out of my arms and

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:00.750
electricity's coming out of my arms and
 

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.019
electricity's coming out of my arms and
these sensors can tell how much

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:03.029
these sensors can tell how much
 

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.910
these sensors can tell how much
electricity is in the air so again if I

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920
electricity is in the air so again if I
 

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.590
electricity is in the air so again if I
write software it knows exactly where my

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600
write software it knows exactly where my
 

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.960
write software it knows exactly where my
hands are and it also if I'm smart

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:08.970
hands are and it also if I'm smart
 

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.910
hands are and it also if I'm smart
enough i can write software it knows am

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920
enough i can write software it knows am
 

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.060
enough i can write software it knows am
i moving in it jagged way am i moving

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.070
i moving in it jagged way am i moving
 

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.819
i moving in it jagged way am i moving
smoothly am i moving continuously am i

moving discontinuously so there are all

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:19.230
moving discontinuously so there are all
 

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.170
moving discontinuously so there are all
kinds of qualities I can pick up so we

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180
kinds of qualities I can pick up so we
 

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.120
kinds of qualities I can pick up so we
made actually a musical instrument and

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.130
made actually a musical instrument and
 

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.400
made actually a musical instrument and
then a little opera magic trick for Penn

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:25.410
then a little opera magic trick for Penn
 

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.230
then a little opera magic trick for Penn
and Teller which was based on sitting

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240
and Teller which was based on sitting
 

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.210
and Teller which was based on sitting
sitting on this chair and playing

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220
sitting on this chair and playing
 

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.400
sitting on this chair and playing
melodies and harmonies and rhythms just

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.410
melodies and harmonies and rhythms just
 

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.740
melodies and harmonies and rhythms just
by moving your hands and it was it was

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:33.750
by moving your hands and it was it was
 

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.210
by moving your hands and it was it was
great I sort of thought of it as a

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220
great I sort of thought of it as a
 

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.509
great I sort of thought of it as a
virtuosic instrument for anybody I mean

00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519
virtuosic instrument for anybody I mean
 

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:41.030
virtuosic instrument for anybody I mean
everybody can move their hands but you

started a company right near MIT it's

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:15.059
started a company right near MIT it's
 

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:16.489
started a company right near MIT it's
still there companies called harmonics

00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:16.499
still there companies called harmonics
 

00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:19.909
still there companies called harmonics
and they started you know taking these

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:19.919
and they started you know taking these
 

00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:21.529
and they started you know taking these
same especially this idea of a driving

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:21.539
same especially this idea of a driving
 

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:23.629

through a series of roads they actually

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:25.439
through a series of roads they actually
 

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:29.059
through a series of roads they actually
took some joysticks and had a piece of

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:29.069
took some joysticks and had a piece of
 

00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:31.099
took some joysticks and had a piece of
music that would play and depending on

00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:31.109
music that would play and depending on
 

00:16:31.109 --> 00:16:32.900
music that would play and depending on
how you moved if you moved the right

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:32.910
how you moved if you moved the right
 

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.629
how you moved if you moved the right
joystick it would push this music to

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639
joystick it would push this music to
 

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:37.579
joystick it would push this music to
different harmonies if you move the left

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:37.589
different harmonies if you move the left
 

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:39.919
different harmonies if you move the left
joystick it would make the rhythm more

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:39.929
joystick it would make the rhythm more
 

00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:42.109
joystick it would make the rhythm more
complex so just by moving the joysticks

00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:42.119
complex so just by moving the joysticks
 

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:44.689
complex so just by moving the joysticks
anybody could modify this music and they

00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699
anybody could modify this music and they
 

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.029
anybody could modify this music and they
did work like that for about seven or

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:47.039
did work like that for about seven or
 

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.970
did work like that for about seven or
eight years now they made some games

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980
eight years now they made some games
 

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.329
eight years now they made some games
that were kind of okay I mean there are

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339
that were kind of okay I mean there are
 

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:54.529
that were kind of okay I mean there are
actually very good games they didn't

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:54.539
actually very good games they didn't
 

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.419
actually very good games they didn't
sell all that much and then somebody

00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:56.429
sell all that much and then somebody
 

00:16:56.429 --> 00:16:57.559
sell all that much and then somebody
came to them and said you ever think of

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:57.569
came to them and said you ever think of
 

00:16:57.569 --> 00:16:59.809
came to them and said you ever think of
using you know making a plastic guitar

00:16:59.809 --> 00:16:59.819
using you know making a plastic guitar
 

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:00.889
using you know making a plastic guitar
and

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899
and
 

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:02.150
and
what would it be like if it took exactly

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160
what would it be like if it took exactly
 

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.960
what would it be like if it took exactly
the same software and had somebody with

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:05.970
the same software and had somebody with
 

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.399
the same software and had somebody with
the qatari interface instead of these

00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:07.409
the qatari interface instead of these
 

00:17:07.409 --> 00:17:09.679
the qatari interface instead of these
joysticks so we all talked about that

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:09.689
joysticks so we all talked about that
 

00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:11.419
joysticks so we all talked about that
they made this game called guitar hero

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:11.429
they made this game called guitar hero
 

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:14.329
they made this game called guitar hero
and nobody expected it to be a success

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339
and nobody expected it to be a success
 

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.130
and nobody expected it to be a success
and actually when guitar hero first came

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140
and actually when guitar hero first came
 

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.210
and actually when guitar hero first came
out the big like Best Buy and Target in

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220
out the big like Best Buy and Target in
 

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.399
out the big like Best Buy and Target in
all those places bought very few of them

00:17:22.399 --> 00:17:22.409
all those places bought very few of them
 

00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:25.639
all those places bought very few of them
but the fact that it was a guitar

00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:25.649
but the fact that it was a guitar
 

00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:27.679
but the fact that it was a guitar
interface and not joysticks people had

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:27.689
interface and not joysticks people had
 

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:30.260
interface and not joysticks people had
imagined so many people had imagined

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:30.270
imagined so many people had imagined
 

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.279
imagined so many people had imagined
what it would feel like to play guitar

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:31.289
what it would feel like to play guitar
 

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:35.389
what it would feel like to play guitar
and the gameplay the idea that it wasn't

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:35.399
and the gameplay the idea that it wasn't
 

00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:38.060
and the gameplay the idea that it wasn't
just moving music around with joysticks

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.070
just moving music around with joysticks
 

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.130
just moving music around with joysticks
but you were being graded at how

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140
but you were being graded at how
 

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.840
but you were being graded at how
accurate you were and it was very easy

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:41.850
accurate you were and it was very easy
 

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.480
accurate you were and it was very easy
to tell how well you were doing you know

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:44.490
to tell how well you were doing you know
 

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.130
to tell how well you were doing you know
we did as we know it became a success

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140
we did as we know it became a success
 

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.130
we did as we know it became a success
very fast so so that came directly out

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140
very fast so so that came directly out
 

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.139
very fast so so that came directly out
of the out of the work on the bow and

00:17:51.139 --> 00:17:51.149
of the out of the work on the bow and
 

00:17:51.149 --> 00:17:53.570
of the out of the work on the bow and
the cello and that turning into this

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580
the cello and that turning into this
 

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.419
the cello and that turning into this
sensor chair and all that softer went

00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:56.429
sensor chair and all that softer went
 

00:17:56.429 --> 00:17:58.430
sensor chair and all that softer went
into harmonics and is now out there was

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440
into harmonics and is now out there was
 

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.909
into harmonics and is now out there was
guitar hero in rock band
