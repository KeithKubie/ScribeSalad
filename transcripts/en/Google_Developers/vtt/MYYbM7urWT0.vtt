Hey, everybody.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.554
I'm David East, a developer
advocate on the Firebase team.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:08.470
And today, we have a big
announcement for you.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.090
We're launching a brand new
Firebase YouTube channel that's

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.240
going to cover the new Firebase
with content like screencasts,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.279
talks from I/O, stories
from our partners,

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.570
and getting-started videos
that'll teach you everything

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.528
that you need to know to
be successful with app

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:21.150
development.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.020
Don't forget to

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.380
And I will see you on the
next season of Firecasts

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.940

Firebase YouTube Channel.
