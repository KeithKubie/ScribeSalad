well the cynic would say ha solar energy

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320
well the cynic would say ha solar energy
 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.740
well the cynic would say ha solar energy
that's for Hollywood millionaires and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750
that's for Hollywood millionaires and
 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.690
that's for Hollywood millionaires and
I've heard that so often that we're

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700
I've heard that so often that we're
 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.640
I've heard that so often that we're
gonna live in solar houses and it never

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650
gonna live in solar houses and it never
 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.330
gonna live in solar houses and it never
happened so ha well you see there's a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340
happened so ha well you see there's a
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.460
happened so ha well you see there's a
reason that we don't live in the solar

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470
reason that we don't live in the solar
 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.950
reason that we don't live in the solar
age and it doesn't have anything to do

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960
age and it doesn't have anything to do
 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.769
age and it doesn't have anything to do
with solar cells at all you see there's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779
with solar cells at all you see there's
 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.410
with solar cells at all you see there's
a missing link that's what we don't have

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420
a missing link that's what we don't have
 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.810
a missing link that's what we don't have
wind power and solar power everywhere

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
wind power and solar power everywhere
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.640
wind power and solar power everywhere
and the missing link is something we

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650
and the missing link is something we
 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.569
and the missing link is something we
forget and that is storage the battery a

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579

hundred years ago Thomas Edison and

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129
hundred years ago Thomas Edison and
 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.680
hundred years ago Thomas Edison and
Henry Ford were friends they would

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690
Henry Ford were friends they would
 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.720
Henry Ford were friends they would
vacation together and they were rivals

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730
vacation together and they were rivals
 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.240
vacation together and they were rivals
of course and they had a bet what would

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
of course and they had a bet what would
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.189
of course and they had a bet what would
energize the 20th century

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199
energize the 20th century
 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.819
energize the 20th century
well Edison said the battery well

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829
well Edison said the battery well
 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.760
well Edison said the battery well
Ford said no it's gonna be the internal

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770
Ford said no it's gonna be the internal
 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.540

well people said the solution to that is

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489
well people said the solution to that is
 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.580
well people said the solution to that is
obvious the the internal combustion

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590
obvious the the internal combustion
 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.680
obvious the the internal combustion
engine is dangerous because gasoline

engines will explode batteries will not
 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.440
engines will explode batteries will not
explode but gasoline will and having a

gas station on every block that's

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700
gas station on every block that's
 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.560

that's stupid so many people said that

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119
that's stupid so many people said that
 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.870
that's stupid so many people said that
it's obvious Edison is gonna win we're

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880
it's obvious Edison is gonna win we're
 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210
it's obvious Edison is gonna win we're
not gonna have gas pumps on every block

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220
not gonna have gas pumps on every block
 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.340
not gonna have gas pumps on every block
and we're not gonna have explosions take

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350
and we're not gonna have explosions take
 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.160
and we're not gonna have explosions take
place in our highways well guess what

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170
place in our highways well guess what
 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.590
place in our highways well guess what
happened the opposite happened and that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600
happened the opposite happened and that
 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.719

so that when the Sun doesn't shine and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
so that when the Sun doesn't shine and
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.050
so that when the Sun doesn't shine and
the winds don't blow you can still have

he's also marketing these batteries for
industries because what happens if you

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740
industries because what happens if you
 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.100
industries because what happens if you
can't necessarily make peak summer and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
can't necessarily make peak summer and
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.350
can't necessarily make peak summer and
peak winter demands of power

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
peak winter demands of power
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.200
peak winter demands of power
why should a utility have to generate

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210
why should a utility have to generate
 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.570
why should a utility have to generate
this gigantic infrastructure to generate

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
this gigantic infrastructure to generate
 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.360

electricity just for peak summer and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
electricity just for peak summer and
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.030
electricity just for peak summer and
peak winter that's where the super

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040
peak winter that's where the super
 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.610
peak winter that's where the super
battery comes in and so with the price

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
battery comes in and so with the price
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.130
battery comes in and so with the price
of batteries dropping I think we're

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140
of batteries dropping I think we're
 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.260
of batteries dropping I think we're
going to see the economics of solar and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270
going to see the economics of solar and
 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.410
going to see the economics of solar and
wind turn the other way so they are

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420
wind turn the other way so they are
 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.250
wind turn the other way so they are
competitive with fossil fuels

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
