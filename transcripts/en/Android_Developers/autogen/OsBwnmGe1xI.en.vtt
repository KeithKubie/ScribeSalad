so one of the main things that was

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
so one of the main things that was
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.219
so one of the main things that was
discussed in this workshop was one very

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
discussed in this workshop was one very
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520
discussed in this workshop was one very
obvious one that obviously you all you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
obvious one that obviously you all you
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.800
obvious one that obviously you all you
do like this on this on board onboarding

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
do like this on this on board onboarding
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080
do like this on this on board onboarding
and conversion is in order to get

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
and conversion is in order to get
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810
and conversion is in order to get
lifetime value outperforming the cost

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
lifetime value outperforming the cost
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.620
lifetime value outperforming the cost
per install right it's an obvious one

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630
per install right it's an obvious one
 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.300
per install right it's an obvious one
and then when you looked into lifetime

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
and then when you looked into lifetime
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.069
and then when you looked into lifetime
value and that's one thing that really

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
value and that's one thing that really
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749
value and that's one thing that really
resonated with a lot of the people it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
resonated with a lot of the people it
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.420
resonated with a lot of the people it
really depends on three things heavily

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
really depends on three things heavily
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.539
really depends on three things heavily
that is engage retention engagement in

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
that is engage retention engagement in
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.139
that is engage retention engagement in
monetization I'm not going to go too

monetization I'm not going to go too
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760
monetization I'm not going to go too
much into monetization because we have a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
much into monetization because we have a
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100
much into monetization because we have a
full session on that just after this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
full session on that just after this
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.990

it's such an important driver to your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
it's such an important driver to your
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010

business and the question that came out
of the crowd really I aligned this so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
of the crowd really I aligned this so
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240
of the crowd really I aligned this so
therefore for me this is really the new

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
therefore for me this is really the new
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.580
therefore for me this is really the new
black and it's really interesting to see

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
black and it's really interesting to see
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530
black and it's really interesting to see
the conversation I've been having over

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
the conversation I've been having over
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720
the conversation I've been having over
the last couple years in this job has

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
the last couple years in this job has
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.729
the last couple years in this job has
shifted from Oh have that many downloads

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
shifted from Oh have that many downloads
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.699
shifted from Oh have that many downloads
to have that many installs to over

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
to have that many installs to over
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.059
to have that many installs to over
really do this to really engage a user

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
really do this to really engage a user
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.970
really do this to really engage a user
so it's quite a key topic before we do

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
so it's quite a key topic before we do
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.190
so it's quite a key topic before we do
that there is one thing that's kind of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
that there is one thing that's kind of
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.350
that there is one thing that's kind of
the antagonist of retention engagement

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
the antagonist of retention engagement
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.470
the antagonist of retention engagement
can anybody guess what that is its churn

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480
can anybody guess what that is its churn
 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.509
can anybody guess what that is its churn
right the users that are not engaged in

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
right the users that are not engaged in
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.610
right the users that are not engaged in
there are not retained is that users

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
there are not retained is that users
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.020
there are not retained is that users
that are churning so I very quickly want

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
that are churning so I very quickly want
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490
that are churning so I very quickly want
to take a deeper look into what churn

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
to take a deeper look into what churn
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.110
to take a deeper look into what churn
actually means before we move on into

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
actually means before we move on into
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.390
actually means before we move on into
the next session where I want to show

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
the next session where I want to show
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.390
the next session where I want to show
some ways we're so easy fixes on how to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
some ways we're so easy fixes on how to
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.220
some ways we're so easy fixes on how to
actually engage and retain your users

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
actually engage and retain your users
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.319

before we get Marcus on stage and share
some of the insights they have so let's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
some of the insights they have so let's
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.339
some of the insights they have so let's
face it churn really happens to the best

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349
face it churn really happens to the best
 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.920
face it churn really happens to the best
of us it doesn't really matter I mean it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930
of us it doesn't really matter I mean it
 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.630
of us it doesn't really matter I mean it
doesn't matter but even if you build the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640
doesn't matter but even if you build the
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.610
doesn't matter but even if you build the
greatest product out there even if

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
greatest product out there even if
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.340
greatest product out there even if
you're in one of the top 10 developers

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
you're in one of the top 10 developers
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.440
you're in one of the top 10 developers
on the place your most successful you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
on the place your most successful you
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.140
on the place your most successful you
will still lose a lot of you like good

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
will still lose a lot of you like good
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.509
will still lose a lot of you like good
portion of your users and I think that's

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
portion of your users and I think that's
 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.819
portion of your users and I think that's

third one it kind of goes along with

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:25.840
third one it kind of goes along with
 

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.730
third one it kind of goes along with
number one and two what are the

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:26.740
number one and two what are the
 

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.580
number one and two what are the
corresponding KPIs like whenever we have

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:29.590
corresponding KPIs like whenever we have
 

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.530

where I have conversations with partners
 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.640
where I have conversations with partners
and I think that's probably the same

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:32.650
and I think that's probably the same
 

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.260
and I think that's probably the same
when you have conversations among each

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.270
when you have conversations among each
 

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.200
when you have conversations among each
other you compare a lot of KPIs but it's

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.210
other you compare a lot of KPIs but it's
 

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.530
other you compare a lot of KPIs but it's
not necessarily that the same KPIs are

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.540
not necessarily that the same KPIs are
 

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.720
not necessarily that the same KPIs are
as relevant for for everybody in the

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:42.730
as relevant for for everybody in the
 

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.060
as relevant for for everybody in the
room right if you let's say a document

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.070
room right if you let's say a document
 

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.520
room right if you let's say a document
storage app and that really helps me

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:47.530
storage app and that really helps me
 

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.800
storage app and that really helps me
secure all my important documents then

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:49.810
secure all my important documents then
 

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.860

actually retaining me over a year and
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.110
actually retaining me over a year and
having these login once a year maybe a

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120
having these login once a year maybe a
 

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.870
having these login once a year maybe a
super important KPI well if you build a

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880
super important KPI well if you build a
 

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.430
super important KPI well if you build a
social app on the other hand you want to

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440
social app on the other hand you want to
 

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.470
social app on the other hand you want to
look into sessions per day that I

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480
look into sessions per day that I
 

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.590
look into sessions per day that I
generate right so be really aware of

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600
generate right so be really aware of
 

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.700

what KPIs are important to you

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:10.710
 

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.820
number two is again I think it's

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:14.830
number two is again I think it's
 

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.140
number two is again I think it's
somewhat obvious one but I want to give

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.150
somewhat obvious one but I want to give
 

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.020
somewhat obvious one but I want to give
you a certain angle to it it's to fully

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.030
you a certain angle to it it's to fully

you actually optimize against that goal

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:40.580
you actually optimize against that goal
 

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.639
you actually optimize against that goal
for retention or engagement that you

way to make a decision another point you

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:52.970
way to make a decision another point you
 

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.990
way to make a decision another point you
may recall from the list we showed of

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000
may recall from the list we showed of

reasons why users churn is that your app

00:20:59.019 --> 00:20:59.029
reasons why users churn is that your app
 

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:01.149

and what with what the competitor is

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960
and what with what the competitor is
 

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.010
and what with what the competitor is
offering one really cool way to counter

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:06.020
offering one really cool way to counter
 

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.560
offering one really cool way to counter
this is to personalizing the experience

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:08.570
this is to personalizing the experience
 

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.610
this is to personalizing the experience
so to make the user feel at home and I

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:12.620
so to make the user feel at home and I
 

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.019
so to make the user feel at home and I
think there are two main way of doing

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:14.029
think there are two main way of doing
 

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:17.049
think there are two main way of doing
this number one is where you basically

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:17.059
this number one is where you basically
 

00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:20.529
this number one is where you basically
give the user all kinds of manual ways

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:20.539
give the user all kinds of manual ways
 

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:24.100
give the user all kinds of manual ways
to design the experience right you may

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.110
to design the experience right you may
 

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.899
to design the experience right you may
like let them toggle and stuff in the

00:21:25.899 --> 00:21:25.909
like let them toggle and stuff in the
 

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.120
like let them toggle and stuff in the
home screen switch stuff on and off and

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.130
home screen switch stuff on and off and
 

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.880
home screen switch stuff on and off and
so on and I think all of that is great

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:29.890
so on and I think all of that is great
 

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.440
so on and I think all of that is great
just what I think happens quite a lot of

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.450
just what I think happens quite a lot of
 

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.909
just what I think happens quite a lot of
what we hear happens quite a lot that

00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919
what we hear happens quite a lot that
 

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.860
what we hear happens quite a lot that
that really remains something that

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:35.870
that really remains something that
 

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.350
that really remains something that
mostly power users do and it's really

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360
mostly power users do and it's really
 

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.820
mostly power users do and it's really
hard to get like average of the broad

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:39.830
hard to get like average of the broad
 

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.740
hard to get like average of the broad
range of users actually to do that

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:42.750
range of users actually to do that
 

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.920
range of users actually to do that
so another way to do this is by actually

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:46.930
so another way to do this is by actually
 

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.050
so another way to do this is by actually
doing personalization by using business

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:49.060
doing personalization by using business
 

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.540
doing personalization by using business
intelligence and to individualize the

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:51.550
intelligence and to individualize the
 

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.370
intelligence and to individualize the
product experience and I will show you

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:53.380
product experience and I will show you
 

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.090
product experience and I will show you
what that means am a great example for

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:57.100
what that means am a great example for
 

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.620
what that means am a great example for
this that was shared with me actually

basically anticipate user or they use
 

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.680
basically anticipate user or they use
user behavior to anticipate users needs

and provide the relevant experience in
 

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.390
and provide the relevant experience in
the right moment so what does I mean

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400
the right moment so what does I mean
 

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.300
the right moment so what does I mean
they try to map various scenarios for

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:15.310
they try to map various scenarios for
 

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.390
they try to map various scenarios for
users coming into the app one is one

sign in when a user actually comes back
 

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.420
sign in when a user actually comes back
to the app so it's a returning user has

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.430
to the app so it's a returning user has
 

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.280
to the app so it's a returning user has
searched before and they may show them

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.290

actually allows them to move around
 

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.930
actually allows them to move around
content and modules to react to this

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:12.940
content and modules to react to this
 

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.010
content and modules to react to this
broad range of scenarios and then the

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.020
broad range of scenarios and then the
 

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.000
broad range of scenarios and then the
third one is that they actually

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.010
third one is that they actually
 

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.340
third one is that they actually
exhaustively map the context instead of

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:20.350
exhaustively map the context instead of
 

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.930
exhaustively map the context instead of
content or action the user was left in

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:21.940
content or action the user was left in
 

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.280
content or action the user was left in
so that when you leave and you come back

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:23.290
so that when you leave and you come back
 

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.310
so that when you leave and you come back
you really feel like you continue where

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320
you really feel like you continue where
 

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.130
you really feel like you continue where
you left off so I think that's a great

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:29.140
you left off so I think that's a great
 

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.800
you left off so I think that's a great
example of using data and a

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:31.810
example of using data and a
 

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.900
example of using data and a
sophisticated technical approach to

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:33.910
sophisticated technical approach to
 

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.640
sophisticated technical approach to
actually provide personal user

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:35.650
actually provide personal user
 

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.480
actually provide personal user
experience for a broad range and you

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:39.490
experience for a broad range and you
 

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.980
experience for a broad range and you
know some of you may probably think now

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:40.990
know some of you may probably think now
 

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.080
know some of you may probably think now
oh you said easy fixes this seems very

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.090
oh you said easy fixes this seems very
 

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.570
oh you said easy fixes this seems very
complex yes this is probably one of the

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:45.580
complex yes this is probably one of the
 

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.220
complex yes this is probably one of the
things that are not that straightforward

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.230
things that are not that straightforward
 

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.970
things that are not that straightforward
an easy to set up but once you have it

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:50.980
an easy to set up but once you have it
 

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.910
an easy to set up but once you have it
it's actually a very neat way to to you

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:53.920
it's actually a very neat way to to you
 

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.910
it's actually a very neat way to to you
do that personalization so I think it's

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:55.920
do that personalization so I think it's
 

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.890
do that personalization so I think it's
really worth the effort of looking into

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900
really worth the effort of looking into
 

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:04.790
really worth the effort of looking into
that the second last I want to talk

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:04.800
that the second last I want to talk
 

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.350
that the second last I want to talk
about is having a great communication

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360
about is having a great communication
 

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.880
about is having a great communication
strategy and it ties very much into the

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:07.890
strategy and it ties very much into the
 

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:12.140
strategy and it ties very much into the
personalization bit so push

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.150
personalization bit so push
 

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.970
personalization bit so push
notifications is what I'm going to focus

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980
notifications is what I'm going to focus
 

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.920
notifications is what I'm going to focus
on and they have become somewhat the

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:15.930
on and they have become somewhat the
 

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.980
on and they have become somewhat the
standard on the platform and as an

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:18.990
standard on the platform and as an
 

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.930
standard on the platform and as an
engagement tool and rightfully so right

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940
engagement tool and rightfully so right
 

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.580
engagement tool and rightfully so right
they work great if you do a great job on

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:22.590
they work great if you do a great job on
 

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.430
they work great if you do a great job on
them however there's also a fine line

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440
them however there's also a fine line
 

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.770
them however there's also a fine line
between using them to drive engagement

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780
between using them to drive engagement
 

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.350
between using them to drive engagement
on the one hand or to actually make

interesting side effect is that they
 

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.240
interesting side effect is that they
really learned about the users and the

but again starting off with a very broad

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.050
but again starting off with a very broad
 

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.350
but again starting off with a very broad
range and basically just showing you is

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360
range and basically just showing you is
 

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.760
range and basically just showing you is
that you value that they are there and

I'm from lie some and I think that

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120
I'm from lie some and I think that
 

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.350
I'm from lie some and I think that
retention and engagement is probably the

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360
retention and engagement is probably the
 

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.420
retention and engagement is probably the
most the most interesting topic because

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:00.430
most the most interesting topic because
 

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.990
most the most interesting topic because
it basically tells you like how good is

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000
it basically tells you like how good is
 

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.760

your product I mean if your users are

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:05.770
your product I mean if your users are
 

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.830
your product I mean if your users are
coming back it's a good product so

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840
coming back it's a good product so
 

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.170
coming back it's a good product so
that's the one metric that should be

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:10.180
that's the one metric that should be
 

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.300
that's the one metric that should be
above everyone else I think so so just

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:15.310
above everyone else I think so so just
 

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.470
above everyone else I think so so just
going to give you sort of a bit of an

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480
going to give you sort of a bit of an
 

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.480
going to give you sort of a bit of an
insight around how we think around

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:18.490
insight around how we think around
 

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.240
insight around how we think around
retention at like some and engagement so

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.250
retention at like some and engagement so
 

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.280
retention at like some and engagement so
starting off with a little bit about us

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:23.290
starting off with a little bit about us
 

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.580
starting off with a little bit about us
but also what retention engagement means

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:26.590
but also what retention engagement means
 

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.370
but also what retention engagement means
to health in specific then a little bit

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:29.380
to health in specific then a little bit
 

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.220
to health in specific then a little bit
of what we track and why we track it and

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.230
of what we track and why we track it and
 

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.070
of what we track and why we track it and
then I have two examples one will be

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080
then I have two examples one will be
 

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.010
then I have two examples one will be
tested and fail miserably and the other

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.020
tested and fail miserably and the other
 

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.540
tested and fail miserably and the other
one where we tested and actually

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:39.550
one where we tested and actually
 

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.820
one where we tested and actually
succeeded it's nice that you can set up

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:41.830
succeeded it's nice that you can set up
 

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.620
succeeded it's nice that you can set up
this a gambler because then it makes it

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:43.630
this a gambler because then it makes it
 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.180
this a gambler because then it makes it
looks like it's a 50/50 split there

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:45.190
looks like it's a 50/50 split there
 

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.460
looks like it's a 50/50 split there
which might not always be the case

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:48.470
which might not always be the case
 

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.380
which might not always be the case
and then I'm running up with a few sort

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:50.390
and then I'm running up with a few sort
 

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.130
and then I'm running up with a few sort
of take aways so start with a bit about

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:54.140
of take aways so start with a bit about
 

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.710
of take aways so start with a bit about
us I think three few things within

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720
us I think three few things within
 

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.560
us I think three few things within

sick and then you get treated but
 

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.159
sick and then you get treated but
instead it should be that you do a lot

00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:09.169

the best either but for us it's like
 

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:16.659
the best either but for us it's like
it's definitely the number one company

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:16.669
it's definitely the number one company
 

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:18.430
it's definitely the number one company
goal is to work with retention it's this

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440
goal is to work with retention it's this
 

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.810
goal is to work with retention it's this
is the stuff that we talk about every

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:19.820
is the stuff that we talk about every
 

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.480
is the stuff that we talk about every
day it's definitely the key for us so we

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:22.490
day it's definitely the key for us so we
 

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:24.040
day it's definitely the key for us so we
haven't figured out what we are trying

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.050
haven't figured out what we are trying
 

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.180
haven't figured out what we are trying
to do a lot of stuff around it so little

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:28.190
to do a lot of stuff around it so little
 

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.520
to do a lot of stuff around it so little
bit about what we track and why we track

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:30.530
bit about what we track and why we track
 

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.680
bit about what we track and why we track
it so we have a few standard metrics

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:32.690
it so we have a few standard metrics
 

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.149
it so we have a few standard metrics
that we follow on a daily basis so we

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159
that we follow on a daily basis so we
 

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.550
that we follow on a daily basis so we
look at seven-day retention we look at

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560
look at seven-day retention we look at
 

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.010
look at seven-day retention we look at
week five retention and look at week 53

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:39.020
week five retention and look at week 53
 

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.139
week five retention and look at week 53
retention so of course we do our deep

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:41.149
retention so of course we do our deep
 

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:42.849
retention so of course we do our deep
dives etc within those with these are

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:42.859
dives etc within those with these are
 

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:45.159
dives etc within those with these are
the ones that are standard so what we

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:45.169
the ones that are standard so what we
 

00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:46.839
the ones that are standard so what we
know this was that when the user is

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:46.849
know this was that when the user is
 

00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:49.300
know this was that when the user is
coming to the live some app a lot of

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.310
coming to the live some app a lot of
 

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.530
coming to the live some app a lot of
them hasn't actually decided that they

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.540
them hasn't actually decided that they
 

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.639
them hasn't actually decided that they
want to change something with their

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:51.649
want to change something with their
 

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:53.320
want to change something with their
lives they want to become healthier so

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.330
lives they want to become healthier so
 

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.020
lives they want to become healthier so
they're super engaged in that very first

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.030
they're super engaged in that very first
 

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.030
they're super engaged in that very first
moment when they come into the app but

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040
moment when they come into the app but
 

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.170
moment when they come into the app but
then what we've seen is that they

00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.180
then what we've seen is that they
 

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.730
then what we've seen is that they
rapidly drop

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:00.740
rapidly drop
 

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.040
rapidly drop
during the first seven days so for us

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.050
during the first seven days so for us
 

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.079
during the first seven days so for us
the number one metric to follow has been

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:05.089
the number one metric to follow has been
 

00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:08.349
the number one metric to follow has been
the seven-day metric but then most

00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359
the seven-day metric but then most
 

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:10.030
the seven-day metric but then most
recently we've started to think a little

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040
recently we've started to think a little
 

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.339
recently we've started to think a little
bit different around retention that you

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:12.349
bit different around retention that you
 

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:14.500
bit different around retention that you
shouldn't really treat it the same way

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.510
shouldn't really treat it the same way
 

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.720
shouldn't really treat it the same way
for all users because it's kind of

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:16.730
for all users because it's kind of
 

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.190
for all users because it's kind of
different depending on what you want to

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200
different depending on what you want to
 

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.829
different depending on what you want to
achieve so we looked at the data and we

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839
achieve so we looked at the data and we
 

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:22.120
achieve so we looked at the data and we
see that we have basically like four

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.130
see that we have basically like four
 

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.609
see that we have basically like four
different types of users the master

00:35:24.609 --> 00:35:24.619
different types of users the master
 

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:25.420
different types of users the master
defocused

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:25.430
defocused
 

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.609
defocused
the dieter and the long term and named

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:27.619
the dieter and the long term and named
 

00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:30.070
the dieter and the long term and named
them so let's let's take the dieter for

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.080
them so let's let's take the dieter for
 

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.980
them so let's let's take the dieter for
example you have like in the US the

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:32.990
example you have like in the US the
 

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.810
example you have like in the US the
average American goes on a diet about

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:34.820
average American goes on a diet about
 

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.680
average American goes on a diet about
four times a year which is quite a lot

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:37.690
four times a year which is quite a lot
 

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.430
four times a year which is quite a lot
it's crazy I know

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440
it's crazy I know
 

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.640
it's crazy I know
and that diet will last from anywhere

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:42.650
and that diet will last from anywhere
 

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.750
and that diet will last from anywhere
between a few days to a few weeks so for

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760
between a few days to a few weeks so for
 

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.070
between a few days to a few weeks so for
us then it's important so instead of

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:48.080
us then it's important so instead of
 

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.589
us then it's important so instead of
trying to force the dieters behavior to

00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599
trying to force the dieters behavior to
 

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:52.690
trying to force the dieters behavior to
become the master which is like tracking

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:52.700
become the master which is like tracking
 

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.180
become the master which is like tracking
every day for several months we should

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:55.190
every day for several months we should
 

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.740
every day for several months we should
just recognize okay this person is on a

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:56.750
just recognize okay this person is on a
 

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.200
just recognize okay this person is on a
diet we need to make the app as good as

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.210
diet we need to make the app as good as
 

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.790
diet we need to make the app as good as
possible for them to come back for the

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800
possible for them to come back for the
 

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.910
possible for them to come back for the
next diet so hot rods that sort of

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920
next diet so hot rods that sort of
 

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.980
next diet so hot rods that sort of
thinking like okay if we can put these

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:05.990
thinking like okay if we can put these
 

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.660
thinking like okay if we can put these
people in different buckets we should

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:07.670
people in different buckets we should
 

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:12.690
people in different buckets we should
treat them differently so two examples

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:12.700
treat them differently so two examples
 

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.589
treat them differently so two examples
we'll start with with a sad one so we

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599
we'll start with with a sad one so we
 

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.120
we'll start with with a sad one so we
have this yeah well as knowledge about

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:19.130
have this yeah well as knowledge about
 

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.099
have this yeah well as knowledge about
the users are very motivated in their

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:21.109
the users are very motivated in their
 

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:23.109
the users are very motivated in their
first disk so we thought that if we can

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119
first disk so we thought that if we can
 

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.210
first disk so we thought that if we can
get them to invest a lot of time and

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:25.220
get them to invest a lot of time and
 

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.570
get them to invest a lot of time and
energy in the app at first they will be

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:28.580
energy in the app at first they will be
 

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.120
energy in the app at first they will be
coming back so we basically created this

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.130
coming back so we basically created this
 

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.660
coming back so we basically created this
massive health test of 41 questions we

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:34.670
massive health test of 41 questions we
 

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.880
massive health test of 41 questions we
brought in consultants nutritionists etc

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:36.890
brought in consultants nutritionists etc
 

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.920
brought in consultants nutritionists etc
we built it into the onboarding flow we

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:38.930
we built it into the onboarding flow we
 

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.440
we built it into the onboarding flow we
put it on the profile page we prompted

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:41.450
put it on the profile page we prompted
 

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.020
put it on the profile page we prompted
it several times it was a massive

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.030
it several times it was a massive
 

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.760
it several times it was a massive
project it took us months to develop and

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:47.770
project it took us months to develop and
 

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.079
project it took us months to develop and
and then when we released it of course

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:50.089
and then when we released it of course
 

00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:51.700
and then when we released it of course
we were super excited like this is going

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:51.710
we were super excited like this is going
 

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.770
we were super excited like this is going
to have a massive impact on seven-day

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:53.780
to have a massive impact on seven-day
 

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.359
to have a massive impact on seven-day
attention and while everyone's just

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:55.369
attention and while everyone's just
 

00:36:55.369 --> 00:36:57.310
attention and while everyone's just
waiting for the data and when it came

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:57.320
waiting for the data and when it came
 

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.930
waiting for the data and when it came
was like it was the sound of no hands

00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:58.940
was like it was the sound of no hands
 

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.280
was like it was the sound of no hands
clapping like nothing happened so of

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.290
clapping like nothing happened so of
 

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.020
clapping like nothing happened so of
course it wasn't it was it was a big

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.030
course it wasn't it was it was a big
 

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.359
course it wasn't it was it was a big
failure but then of course with failures

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:07.369
failure but then of course with failures
 

00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:09.970
failure but then of course with failures
usually get some stuff out of it for us

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:09.980
usually get some stuff out of it for us
 

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.430
usually get some stuff out of it for us
suppose I think first we managed to

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440
suppose I think first we managed to
 

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.260
suppose I think first we managed to
confirm

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.270
confirm
 

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.300
confirm
we have very high initial motivation so

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.310
we have very high initial motivation so
 

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.000
we have very high initial motivation so
are other people starting the test we

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.010
are other people starting the test we
 

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.340
are other people starting the test we
had about 90 percent completing all 41

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:20.350
had about 90 percent completing all 41
 

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.040
had about 90 percent completing all 41
questions so within a few weeks we had

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.050
questions so within a few weeks we had
 

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.960
questions so within a few weeks we had
like a million of these test results and

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:24.970
like a million of these test results and
 

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.170
like a million of these test results and
that data is kind of valuable so I mean

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.180
that data is kind of valuable so I mean
 

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.400
that data is kind of valuable so I mean
first of all it's infinite you can see

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:29.410
first of all it's infinite you can see
 

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.440
first of all it's infinite you can see
like okay how many percent is vegetarian

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:31.450
like okay how many percent is vegetarian
 

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:32.820
like okay how many percent is vegetarian
in London compared to Stockholm for

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:32.830
in London compared to Stockholm for
 

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.790
in London compared to Stockholm for
example but also referring to the

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800
example but also referring to the
 

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.960
example but also referring to the
buckets that I talked about we can

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:36.970
buckets that I talked about we can
 

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.970
buckets that I talked about we can
actually profile users now based on this

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:38.980
actually profile users now based on this
 

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.220
actually profile users now based on this
data so it's something that you're not

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:41.230
data so it's something that you're not
 

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.109
data so it's something that you're not
doing it yet that the way we should be

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119
doing it yet that the way we should be
 

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:44.670
doing it yet that the way we should be
doing it but it's a really interesting

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680
doing it but it's a really interesting
 

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.830
doing it but it's a really interesting
source but of course from a retention

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:46.840
source but of course from a retention
 

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.230
source but of course from a retention
perspective it wasn't it wasn't good and

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240
perspective it wasn't it wasn't good and
 

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.790
perspective it wasn't it wasn't good and
I think what we learned from that is

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800
I think what we learned from that is
 

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.230
I think what we learned from that is
also what the guys have been talking

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240
also what the guys have been talking
 

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.300
also what the guys have been talking
about before is that I mean you need to

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:54.310
about before is that I mean you need to
 

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.240
about before is that I mean you need to
find ways of testing stuff before you

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:57.250
find ways of testing stuff before you
 

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.980
find ways of testing stuff before you
put a lot of effort into it so what

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:01.990
put a lot of effort into it so what
 

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.050
put a lot of effort into it so what
would the oxygens does did stops that

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:04.060
would the oxygens does did stops that
 

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.280
would the oxygens does did stops that
was working out so if you going back a

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.290
was working out so if you going back a
 

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.690
was working out so if you going back a
few months we didn't really have any

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:09.700
few months we didn't really have any
 

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.450
few months we didn't really have any
sort of social interaction in the app

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:12.460
sort of social interaction in the app
 

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.730
sort of social interaction in the app
and I think the reason for that was that

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:14.740
and I think the reason for that was that
 

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.890
and I think the reason for that was that
we didn't really know what people wanted

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:16.900
we didn't really know what people wanted
 

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.599
we didn't really know what people wanted
to share because when it comes to your

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:18.609
to share because when it comes to your
 

00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:20.790
to share because when it comes to your
personal health especially around weight

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800
personal health especially around weight
 

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.710
personal health especially around weight
loss it's not that you want to like oh

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720
loss it's not that you want to like oh
 

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.180
loss it's not that you want to like oh
this is you don't want to share

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.190
this is you don't want to share
 

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.000
this is you don't want to share
everything on Facebook let's put it away

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.010
everything on Facebook let's put it away
 

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.710
everything on Facebook let's put it away
so what we did here is that we created

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720
so what we did here is that we created
 

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.040
so what we did here is that we created
this very small intimate social feature

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:32.050
this very small intimate social feature
 

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.590
this very small intimate social feature
like very simple and we ran a test in

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:34.600
like very simple and we ran a test in
 

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.599
like very simple and we ran a test in
Sweden so it's basically that you could

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:36.609
Sweden so it's basically that you could
 

00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:39.210
Sweden so it's basically that you could
invite up to five friends to become your

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:39.220
invite up to five friends to become your
 

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.190
invite up to five friends to become your
sort of team and within that team you

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200
sort of team and within that team you
 

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.710
sort of team and within that team you
could basically push each other and

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720
could basically push each other and
 

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.460
could basically push each other and
motivate each other

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:44.470
motivate each other
 

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.440
motivate each other
you could also remind people if they

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:46.450
you could also remind people if they
 

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.820
you could also remind people if they
were dropping off so um when we got that

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:50.830
were dropping off so um when we got that
 

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.830
were dropping off so um when we got that
out we saw that people on social

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:52.840
out we saw that people on social
 

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.680
out we saw that people on social
actually had a 2x increase in seven-day

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:55.690
actually had a 2x increase in seven-day
 

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.720
actually had a 2x increase in seven-day
retention which was of course fantastic

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:57.730
retention which was of course fantastic
 

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.700
retention which was of course fantastic
I mean but if you think about it's like

00:38:59.700 --> 00:38:59.710
I mean but if you think about it's like
 

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.340
I mean but if you think about it's like
if you have if you have five people and

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:02.350
if you have if you have five people and
 

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.500
if you have if you have five people and
three of them drop off and they have two

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:04.510
three of them drop off and they have two
 

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.660
three of them drop off and they have two
more that can keep reminding them that's

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:06.670
more that can keep reminding them that's
 

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.980
more that can keep reminding them that's
always going to be better than if you

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:07.990
always going to be better than if you
 

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.650
always going to be better than if you
have like five cielos where no one can

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.660
have like five cielos where no one can
 

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.740
have like five cielos where no one can
talk so from that perspective it was

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:13.750
talk so from that perspective it was
 

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.260
talk so from that perspective it was
really good what we had some issues with

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:16.270
really good what we had some issues with
 

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.480
really good what we had some issues with
here was though the adoption rate like

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.490
here was though the adoption rate like
 

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.700
here was though the adoption rate like
we didn't really got that many users to

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:20.710
we didn't really got that many users to
 

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.000
we didn't really got that many users to
be on social so we pop the survey for

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.010
be on social so we pop the survey for
 

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.140
be on social so we pop the survey for
them that would decline and the

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.150
them that would decline and the
 

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.750
them that would decline and the
we'll still like a privacy I don't want

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760
we'll still like a privacy I don't want
 

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.029
we'll still like a privacy I don't want
to share my data so this is this is

00:39:31.029 --> 00:39:31.039
to share my data so this is this is
 

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:32.650
to share my data so this is this is
still a big challenge for us to try to

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:32.660
still a big challenge for us to try to
 

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:37.410
still a big challenge for us to try to
figure out but also massive potential

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:37.420
 

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.390
so yeah wrapping up a little bit I think

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400
so yeah wrapping up a little bit I think
 

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.880
so yeah wrapping up a little bit I think
I mean looking at your own users

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:44.890
I mean looking at your own users
 

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.010
I mean looking at your own users
retention is interesting so not just

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:48.020
retention is interesting so not just
 

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.599
retention is interesting so not just
like treating retention the same way

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:49.609
like treating retention the same way
 

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.490
like treating retention the same way
across different apps or even across

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:51.500
across different apps or even across
 

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.769
across different apps or even across
your own users to try to find like what

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:53.779
your own users to try to find like what
 

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:55.660
your own users to try to find like what
are your patterns for us it might be

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:55.670
are your patterns for us it might be
 

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.700
are your patterns for us it might be
very high initial motivation or that we

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:57.710
very high initial motivation or that we
 

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.410
very high initial motivation or that we
have lot of dieters in there but it

00:39:59.410 --> 00:39:59.420
have lot of dieters in there but it
 

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.190
have lot of dieters in there but it
might be different for you and then

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200
might be different for you and then
 

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.140
might be different for you and then
social is key I mean if you can get your

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:05.150
social is key I mean if you can get your
 

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.529
social is key I mean if you can get your
own users to help you with retention

00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:07.539
own users to help you with retention
 

00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:10.380
own users to help you with retention
that is it's always going to be be good

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:10.390
that is it's always going to be be good
 

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.839
that is it's always going to be be good
and then also that like referring to the

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:13.849
and then also that like referring to the
 

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:15.130
and then also that like referring to the
health test that we did and I think that

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.140
health test that we did and I think that
 

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.260
health test that we did and I think that
everyone is saying this but it needs to

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:17.270
everyone is saying this but it needs to
 

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.029
everyone is saying this but it needs to
be said over and over again is that you

00:40:19.029 --> 00:40:19.039
be said over and over again is that you
 

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:22.029
be said over and over again is that you
try you need to find easy quick ways of

00:40:22.029 --> 00:40:22.039
try you need to find easy quick ways of
 

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:25.029
try you need to find easy quick ways of
testing radius before you spend hundreds

00:40:25.029 --> 00:40:25.039
testing radius before you spend hundreds
 

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:28.750
testing radius before you spend hundreds
and thousands of billing them cool so

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760
and thousands of billing them cool so
 

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.910
and thousands of billing them cool so
