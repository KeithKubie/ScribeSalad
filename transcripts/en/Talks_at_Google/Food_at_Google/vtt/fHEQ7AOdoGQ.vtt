00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Today, I will talk about things related to wine

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.000
First thing, I would like to introduce myself, and what my company does

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.000
I've written down a couple of things here

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.000
We run wine shops

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.000
and we deal with restaurants and hotels, whole sale, with department stores

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.000
Around Japan, including Tokyo, we transact with about 2,000 stores

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.000
We also have restaurants in Asakusabashi and Kiyozumishirakawa

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.000
In Osaka, we have about 8 restaurants and wine shops

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.000
What makes us different from others is that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.000
we grow in our own vineyard which is about 2.5 hectares wide

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
Including the grapes we grow and the grapes we buy from other farmers

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.000
We produce about 60,000 bottles of wine a year

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.000
When you say 60,000 bottles, it sounds like a lot

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.000
but one bottle is sold for 2,000 yen

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.000
So, when you do the math, the numbers aren't that big

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.000
We also import wine and beer

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
Also, wine school, this is where we met with Shinobu-san at the academy Du Vin

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.000
We also run the Tsuji Culinary Institute

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.000
We also do lectures and talks such as this

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.000
We also do written work for the Japan Sommelier Association Quarterly journal and the culinary press

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.000
What's unique with us is that no other company has all of these things included

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.000
Companies are usually divided into different sets of companies

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.000
Most of them do specialized work for each field

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.000
In our case, we specialize, but from producing wine and consuming it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.000
we manage all of it. Just think of us as an odd company that does all these things

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.000
Today, what we would like you take home is this

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.000
I actually always jump to different places in the country to see contract farmers and purchasing

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
And to be honest I think every place I go to except for Tokyo is in the province

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.000
Osaka, you may think that it's bigger in size

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.000
but what I realized after spending most of my time in Osaka

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
Osaka is just another province

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.000
I really think so

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.000
From Osaka city, by car about 40 minutes

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.000
By train that would be 30 to 40 minutes in this kind of scenery

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.000
There are many that find this surprising, but at the beginning of the Showa era

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.000
there was a time that it was number one, surpassing Yamanashi in the most produced grapes

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.000
During the time that it had the most wineries

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.000
How many do you think there were Shinobu-san?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.000
When Osaka had the most wineries in the Showa era, how many do you think there were?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.000
How many wineries do you think there were?

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.000
About 10?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.000
At its peak there were 119 wineries

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.000
According to the taxation office, there were 119 fruit wine brewing licenses

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.000
Santory which has become a household name, used to be called Kotobukiya

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.000
My friend's family used to run a successful winery, and started with beer, then they failed

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.000
And they sold this to Kotobukiya

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.000
Suntory also has their main office in Osaka

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.000
but the winery in Osaka was originally the main one

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.000
Then they started to get into beer, and from there they would get into whiskey

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:06.000
Now they are 3rd in production quantity of Delaware grapes, which is the 7th most produced grapes

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.000
There is still a 450 hectares of vineyard

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.000
and 90% of these are Delaware

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.000
In terms of generation, around up to my generation

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.000
Delaware is usually associated with the summer

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.000
It was often put in a box and on top of the table in the summer

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.000
The grapes that particularly reminded of summer was Delaware grapes

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.000
So, where is this made?

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.000
This is Osaka prefecture, and Nara is here, then there is Kyoto

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.000
Around the the boundary with Nara, number 5, 6, and 7 are within this Kawachi region

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.000
You may have heard of Kawachi wine

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.000
but it's actually now a name of a winery

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.000
It used to refer to the wine produced in this Kawachi region

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.000
and this grape was often made at number 6 and 7

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:16.000
Nakakawachi region, Minamikawachi region, Yao city, Kashiwara city, Habikino, Taishi are the main vineyards

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.000
Please take a look at this map

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.000
This is within Osaka city

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.000
Here, Kashiwara city is very close, then there is Habikino, and Taishi

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.000
Thanks to the highway

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.000
our winery is actually in the city and it's close to the Matsuyamachi station

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.000
For example, around this area

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.000
if Nanba was Roppongi, then maybe 1 or 2 stations away would be Matsuyamachi station

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.000
Around this area, the grapes are transported from here to here

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.000
It's quite close

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.000
In a 30 to 40 minute drive you will see this kind of scenery

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:06.000
A scenery covered in vineyards, it still exists

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.000
I'd like everyone to keep in mind that many grapes and wine are still locally produced

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:24.000
Our main work happens in the 2.5 hectare vineyard in Kajiwara city inside the Nakakawachi region of Osaka

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.000
What we are known to be unique for is

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.000
that we do not have our winery close to the vineyard

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.000
It’s been 11 years since I started the company

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:47.000
I came from a typical family, and it’s been almost 12 years since I started my business

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.000
Since I came from not having much money, I started a business where I wouldn't need to spend much

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.000
This’s the philosophy that I had

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.000
I wanted to make wine for a long time, even going abroad to train, and I started as a wine shop

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.000
From there I headed to creating a winery

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:20.000
Originally, I asked the 103 year old Katashimo winery by outsourcing the cultivating and brewing

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.000
We borrowed and used their place and their facilities

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.000
And from there, we moved on to our own winery

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.000
This

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.000
When you look at it, it looks like any other forest

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.000
This is what is called an abandoned farmland

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.000
Japan used to be the top producer of grapes

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:49.000
Flatlands have all turned residential, and since there are other ways of livelihood, there is no one to inherit them

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.000
When you are commuting for 30 to 40 minutes, you can make it to Osaka city

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.000
Since there aren't any manual laborers

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:04.000
These areas were originally vineyards, and there are framings called trellis training

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:11.000
On top of this, after a year or two, it goes back to being a forest, which we call abandoned farmland

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.000
Once you go inside

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.000
there is a grape tree, and wires, and scraps

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.000
This place has different things growing from it called an abandoned farmland

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.000
Abandoned farmlands are a big concern in agriculture in Japan

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:39.000
Not only in Osaka, but from Hokkaido to Okinawa, there are more and more that have such concerns

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.000
Why is this?

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.000
It’s because there is no one else to do it

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.000
Why is it that there is no one else to do it?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.000
To be honest, it’s because it's not profitable

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:55.000
For young people, it's very important if they can survive from it or not

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.000
Most of the people who are in agriculture, except for our team

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.000
Are seniors, that are around 24 years older than us, and most of them are in their 60s

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.000
Most of them are pensioners

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.000
The farmers around us are mostly pensioners, and top of that, they would have income from the grapes

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.000
They are somewhat being able to enjoy their life

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:25.000
But if a younger generation were to do it, the current state of the industry is that it does not pay well

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.000
In this kind of vineyard, we would spend about a month, and work on it like this

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.000
For myself, I studied a bachelor of arts degree, and I had a typical middle class family

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:46.000
I didn't have the experience in agriculture, and I had not studied chemistry either which was needed for brewing

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.000
It was mostly self-taught, and that was my background before jumping into the winery

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.000
We also spent about 1 month in this, and mostly on my own, and in this state

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.000
After 2 months, we would make a terraced field, and we would plant trees

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.000
This would take up to about 3 months

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:12.000
We mostly only use our hands in working to recover the vineyards from being abandoned farmlands

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.000
This is what it looks like

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.000
I am a complete stranger in this area

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.000
And even when I asked around to lend us farmlands

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.000
The reality was that we would only receive lands like this that were tough to work on

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:38.000
Actually, at the back of this land there was land that had a very beautiful grape tree planted on it

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.000
We had asked to rent it out

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.000
After planting a grape tree, it takes about 4 to 5 years to bear fruits

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.000
When you make it to wine, it takes about 1 to 2 years to brew

00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:02.000
It actually has a very bad cashflow that will only start making money after 6 years since you start working on it

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.000
I think it's number one in the list of jobs you shouldn't take

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.000
This and whiskey, I personally don't think you should touch those 2

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.000
It really takes 4 to 5 years for it to bear grapes after planting it

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.000
At the back of this, there is a tree planted that will start bearing this year

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.000
We asked to rent that land but one of the problems with Japanese agriculture is that they don't lend to strangers

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.000
Even if there was someone that wanted to rent, they will not lend it to strangers

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.000
I think that has resulted to many things

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.000
During this time, about 5 years ago

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.000
I was very passionate, not that I am not now

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.000
But during this time, I was young and very passionate

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.000
I would visit the landowner every day

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.000
And I would tell them that I would work hard to make very good wine from it

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.000
I would pay for it, so please lend it to me

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.000
I had done this every day

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.000
And after going in every single day, I thought that that would solve the problem

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.000
I thought that my feelings and passion would translate

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.000
But the landowner had grown annoyed of me, and they had cut all the trees　

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.000
That was it

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.000
That is the first time I realized that there are times that you cannot translate passion

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.000
Ultimately, what I learned from this incident was

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.000
As long as I don't gain trust in this area, nothing would move forward

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.000
One of the reasons we rented this land was

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.000
That it has the closest farm seen from the town

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.000
The reason why we chose to rent this is

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.000
When we look out we can see the town

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.000
And from the town they can see the mountain

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.000
From seeing a mountain filled with farms that had rotted away

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.000
From this, when it becomes like this

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.000
The scenery seen from the town also changes

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:07.000
When the scenery from the town changes, people start to gossip and ask who is working on that land

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.000
And you continue to do this, and continue to improve the farm

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.000
People will start to know that we will not runaway from the responsibilities, and their perception changes

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:25.000
By changing the scenery from the town, the people from this area start to think that "there are strange ones that has come"

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.000
But they can see that we are working very hard on the vineyard

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.000
And as a result, from around the 3rd year

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.000
We started to receive inquiries from farmers if we were interested in renting out their vineyard

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:47.000
The name abandoned farm has a very negative connotation

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.000
But it sounds as if it's a heavy baggage

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.000
But for myself, I consider it as oil

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.000
I see it the same way as oil

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.000
And when it's processed properly, and made well

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.000
Just like fuel oil, gasoline, or gas

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.000
It's a type of resource

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.000
What we are working on now is

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.000
It isn't simply agricultural

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.000
But we are utilizing farm land that have been abandoned

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.000
Our project is to creating something new

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:31.000
The main result of one of the projects is wine

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.000
There are times that the moment we restore the land and snow comes

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.000
For some reason, when it snowed very hard in Osaka that was out of season, the farm was gone in one night

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.000
Many things happen, and there are also land that are at steep areas like this

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.000
Because we would get land that no one wanted to work on

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.000
There are land that doesn't have any streets around them

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.000
Places where cars can't get by

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.000
These are the types of abandoned farms that we would get

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.000
There was a time when we were doing it between houses

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.000
The land owner sold it in the midst of it, so now there are places where there isn't a vineyard anymore

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.000
There are many troubles or happenings that occurred

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.000
Despite them, we just kept continuing

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:21.000
We worked hard to turn them to wine, and actually turn it into a business

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:29.000
At the beginning, we started with 0.1 hectare for our wine

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.000
In 5 years, we now have 2 hectares, and have grown 20 times in size

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.000
There isn't anyone else to do it, so most abandoned lands would come to us

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.000
There aren't young people

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.000
A lot of different farmers would ask us to do theirs

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.000
In 5 years, 2 hectares

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.000
During this time, we had still been asking the old winery to lend us a space in their winery to make the wine

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.000
At a corner

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.000
After a year we were making 1 thousand bottles, and then 3 thousand the following year

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.000
On the 3rd year, we have about 5 thousand and at this point

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.000
The winery had told us that it wasn't a small corner anymore

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.000
The next year, we estimated that it would go over 5 thousand

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.000
So, they told us to move out, they didn't tell us this in a straight-forward way but

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.000
But they had this aura

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.000
Then, we decided to make our own winery

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.000
We looked for locations that would be good for our winery

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.000
Assuming that it would be bringing in a big amount of grapes

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.000
We wanted to turn these grapes to our own wine

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.000
So, we had made this decision

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:48.000
In the map I showed earlier, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes by train to get to Osaka city

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.000
It's about the distance until Yokohama

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.000
Actually, Kajiwara which is right next to the vineyard is a bedroom town

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:07.000
The prices of land are very high, and it's not a provincial rate, but the rate of a normal residential quarter

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.000
We looked for land that was close to the vineyard

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.000
After 3 months, we still couldn't find a place

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.000
No matter how much we looked, we were starting to wonder why

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.000
Then, I read an article in a magazine

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.000
That talked about a juice factory inside an apartment in New York

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.000
So that's it

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.000
This juice factory had the same kind of press machine that we needed

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.000
For a moment, the idea came to us that we could do it inside the city too

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:48.000
We thought about the reason the vineyard had to be close to the winery in the first place

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.000
The moment the vineyard and winery connect, is only during harvest

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.000
The only thing needed is to transport the grapes during harvest

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:02.000
If it takes about 1 hour, this is a typical distance even in Europe

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:08.000
From the vineyard, we drew a one hour radius, and within it fell Osaka city

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:15.000
Before we talked about Osaka city

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.000
The type of winery I wanted to do was something that worked along a restaurant

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.000
The reason is that when I visited Australia for a working holiday

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.000
There was a great winery and restaurant

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.000
It left a lasting impression on me

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.000
This was in the province

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.000
And I thought to myself that I wanted to do something like it

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:45.000
But then Kajiwara was an expensive bedroom town, and also considering other things

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.000
When we mixed all our other ideas, we came up with Osaka city

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:58.000
We moved the idea from the suburbs to the city, towards renting property

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.000
When we came up with the idea of doing it in an apartment

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.000
There were issues regarding building a winery

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:12.000
But eventually, all came to place

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:20.000
For a small winery, it takes about 30 million yen to make

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.000
And half of that is usually the land costs and building costs

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:33.000
But since we have a rental winery

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.000
Those fees cost close to nothing

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.000
But, of course it will become costs later on, but it doesn't cost as much

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:47.000
First thing is, as the issue in creating a winery was the equipment, there are points about money written here

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.000
First thing is that there are only about 250 wineries in Japan

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.000
It's very few

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:00.000
250 means that the industries around it aren't as developed

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.000
I wouldn't say that the companies are ripping us off, but they are making a profit

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.000
Compared to Europe, the equipment are more expensive

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.000
I wanted to make wine that was easy to drink and that was cheap

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.000
These are the types of wine that you have in front of you

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:22.000
In other words, drinking refreshing wine within the year

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.000
That is our stance

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.000
We weren't able to buy the heavy equipment

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.000
We weren't able to buy it, you will see it later on

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.000
There is a huge press machine

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.000
Normally, people would bring it in from Europe

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.000
When you import this, one equipment would cost about 8 million to 9 million Yen

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.000
Then we thought, if the Italians can make it, maybe the Japanese can also make it

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.000
I went to the local metal factory in Osaka, and I asked them to make the same kind

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.000
Then, it only cost 2.5 million Yen

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:03.000
The delivery time was also one-third of the time, and they would come and fix issues with a call in 15 minutes

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.000
We also had other equipment made there

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:12.000
In actual, when you just look at the winery, it had cost us less than 10 million Yen

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.000
We were able to start

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.000
During this time, there weren't a lot of people that were doing it

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.000
Even up to now there weren't as many

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.000
There are only up to 250

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.000
And 250 isn't a big number for breweries

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.000
There aren't many people who have done it

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.000
There aren't many information, not like information for restaurants

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.000
The control is with the tax office

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:43.000
From not being able to tell what is okay and what isn't

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.000
It was very hard

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:52.000
As I have said earlier, as it takes money and time

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.000
For small companies like us, it was very heavy

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.000
The approval of the the tax office was very hard

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.000
At that time, rental wineries did not exist

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:10.000
So, when I was learning law in college, I remember my professor teaching me

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.000
Things that aren't said you cannot do, are things that you can do

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.000
If you search what school I went to earlier then I might get in trouble

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.000
I remembered about this

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.000
They didn't say that it was not allowed, so we thought that renting was okay

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.000
When we applied at the tax office

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.000
They had turned us away

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.000
At first, we brought all the requirements

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:42.000
The documents were perfect, but they wouldn't approve it, and they had turned us down about an odd reason

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.000
Later on, they had been very cooperative in helping us

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:55.000
This is the kind of problems we had, but eventually, we were able to move to Matsuyamachi station that was 1 minute away

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.000
To start our winery

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.000
This is during the event, and you can see the tank

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.000
It's usually inside

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:07.000
The first floor is the winery, and the second floor is the restaurant

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:15.000
By making the 2nd floor a restaurant, the rental for this is paid for the 2nd floor

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.000
It might sound like the restaurant is ripping off the customers

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.000
But we do set the price very reasonably

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.000
We always made sure to rent at very cheap

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:30.000
What we are often asked about it that if the condition of the grapes are still good if it's a winery in the city

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.000
They ask if it doesn't go bad quickly

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.000
As we mentioned earlier, we also run a wine shop, and deliver ourselves

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.000
From the vineyard to the winery, we can delivery in about ???

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:51.000
Compared to wineries around, it can be delivered in a very good state and condition

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.000
It's only 50 meters away on the big road called the Nagahori street

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:02.000
I am washing the tank here, and at the back, there are many cars passing by, this is where we make wine

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:08.000
This winery was born in 2013

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:14.000
When you try to search our name in the media

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.000
You will find many stories about it being the first urban winery

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.000
But it wasn't that we were targeting to have this kind of title

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:29.000
We weren't able to buy land or building for the winery close to the vineyard

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.000
But the truth is that we weren't able to do it close the vineyard, so we had no choice to make it an urban winery

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.000
This is the press machine I was telling you earlier

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.000
This is Japan made

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:50.000
Many of these are Japan made, for example this tank is also Japan made, or Osaka made rather

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.000
They are all hand made, and most of the harvested grapes are sent to the winery in refrigerated vehicles

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.000
Each grape is picked by hand

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.000
And the winery in Japan often performs chaptalization

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.000
They often add sugar, or adjust the sour taste

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.000
We do not do much, actually we do not do any of these

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.000
Especially this acid can add to the sourness

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.000
We have never performed chaptilization

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.000
There are also oxidation inhibitors

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.000
The wine we have can be muddy

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.000
This is because we don't filter it

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:34.000
There is also the preservatives, that is called oxidation inhibitors

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.000
If less than half of the winery is used

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.000
The oxidation inhibitor is what holds it longer

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.000
Our wine is something that you should finish in a year

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.000
So, it doesn't matter

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:55.000
By doing so, it gives a refreshing taste to the wine, as you might have noticed

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.000
It's this kind of step

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.000
There is a press machine that is hand made

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.000
That means that is only 30 tsubo worth of area

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:11.000
Here, we make about 30,000 bottles for Osaka

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.000
Our own wine that was made with our own hands

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.000
The restaurant in the 2nd floor uses ingredients taken from neighboring areas

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.000
Especially in Osaka, the best ??? In Osaka???

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.000
Osaka also shows up here

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.000
This kind of farm is also in the neighborhood

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.000
There are these kinds of cattle ranch and pig farm

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.000
We also provide Italian cuisine with ingredients from around the area

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.000
It says that it's a "The way of drinking at a wine region"

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.000
As you see on the picture there is a beer keg here

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:52.000
Let me share the reason why I decided to make cheap but good tasting wine

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.000
It's when I was at my reunion

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.000
When all of my classmates got together and had drinks

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.000
I think you might have wine after beer

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.000
But no one wanted to order wine

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.000
It was because it was expensive

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:14.000
For salarymen these days

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.000
When they are married, they are usually on allowance

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.000
Is there anyone here on allowance?

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.000
May there aren't any from Google

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:31.000
I came from a normal school, and I had friends that were on a 30,000 Yen per month allowance

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.000
When you consider this, wine is too expensive to drink

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.000
They won't be able to drink a bottle that costs 3,000 to 4,000 Yen

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.000
Or even 700 or 800 Yen per glass is too expensive

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.000
It was sad that I couldn't drink wine when I was drinking with my classmates

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.000
There weren't good wine that was affordable, the cheap ones tasted the price

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.000
I considered many things

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.000
As our company also goes by the concept of the "Everyday Wine"

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.000
To make it an everyday wine

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:05.000
If we didn't fix the price, it would only simply be lip service

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.000
In the current Japanese market

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.000
There actually weren't many local wine that had tasted well

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.000
Our main work was a wine shop

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.000
As we were marketing these wine, we were able to identify what was lacking in the market

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.000
And it started from when I had seen my classmates

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.000
When we thought of what was the daily alcoholic beverage

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.000
In Japan, this is typically beer

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.000
So, what is the price range of beer

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.000
The price of beer at restaurants, even if it was expensive, it would still be around 500 Yen

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.000
I think a glass of draft beer is around 500 Yen

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.000
So, if you could drink good wine for 500 Yen a glass

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.000
We thought that people would drink it

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:54.000
We made the computation to make good wine from local grapes that only costs 500 Yen per glass

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.000
No matter how we computed it, making it 500 Yen was impossible

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.000
We thought about it for a long time, and we wrote down all the costs

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.000
The bottle, labels, caps, seals, and even cardboard boxes

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:15.000
When we listed them down, the price would go up when we put any of those in

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:23.000
For the initial cost of the grapes, for example 1 bottle of wine uses around 1 kilogram of grapes

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.000
750ml to a kilogram of grapes is used

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:35.000
This 1 kilogram, and the price of the content of the wine and the materials outside of it were about the same costs

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.000
This means that when you buy a bottle of wine, you are spending half of it on waste

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:48.000
Even with other drinks, the reality is that the content does not cost as much

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.000
The costs are mostly on the container and the transportation

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.000
In the case of wine, it's the same, for the 250 Yen Delaware

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:02.000
The materials including the bottle, the label, and all are about 250 Yen

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:08.000
As long as we don't cut all of these, a 500 Yen glass cannot be served

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.000
So, what we came up with was

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:17.000
Because we only transport from the winery at the 1st floor to the restaurant upstairs, we cut everything

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.000
We made a beer keg that we could use semi-permanently

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:28.000
And when this became empty, we would bring it downstairs

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.000
We would put this kind of nozzle on it, and put it directly on the glass

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:40.000
We created wine that didn't produce any waste

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.000
We call it the draft barrel wine

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:50.000
This is actually pushed out by carbon dioxide, so it does not use electricity, for the one we offer in Osaka

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.000
This is also home made

00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:02.000
These are the things we can do because we are a winery, and isn't very suitable for oxidant inhibitors or delivery

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:11.000
But if it just sending from the 1st to the 2nd floor, it's the perfect refreshing wine

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:17.000
This restaurant serves wine that can be consumed because it's a wine region, and because it's a winery

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:22.000
This is how we see the role of a winery

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:31.000
With farm produced in Japan, it works the same as a restaurant in that, the only way to make a sale is through seats multiplied by through customer transaction

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:40.000
The same way with farms, the sale is made by "the crops taken from the farm" multiplied by "the unit price", that's why they do not have much profit

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:47.000
By adding value to this, by adding value to the agriculture will allow it to continue to work

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:54.000
Talking about prices may not be the best way, but a kilogram of grapes is 250 Yen

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.000
The moment it turns to wine, it becomes 2,500 Yen

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.000
This is how you can add value to it

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:07.000
If agriculture becomes something that makes profit, we think that the younger generation will start to come back to it

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.000
By doing this, if we increase the number of followers, agriculture will continue to prosper

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.000
Another is suggesting different ways of drinking wine

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:21.000
Wine usually has the image that there are only certain types of people that drink it

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.000
But in actual, there aren't much rules to it

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.000
For example, the Delaware wine that you have been trying as a type of grape for wine

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.000
In Europe, it's not accepted as a grape for wine

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.000
For example, if we put a label on it and said it was Delaware

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.000
We wouldn't be able to export it

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.000
It's because in Europe, it would not be considered as wine

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.000
But it's wine

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:50.000
There is this strong stereotype among Japanese about the world of wine

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.000
Eliminating these prior ideas, and by putting importance in the current

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.000
Wine and alcoholic drinks can be very enjoyable

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.000
It can be used as a communication tool

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.000
We want to spread this more

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.000
In most cases, it ends here

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:17.000
It usually ends here, but a new problem has arisen

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.000
The increase in abandoned farmlands in Osaka isn't stopping

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:27.000
This year, many farms have contacted us requesting for their land to be rented out

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:35.000
Our weakness as a leasing winery is that we cannot expand

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:41.000
If you had land you can increase the number of facilities

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:48.000
Because we cannot increase in number of production quantity, when the farms increase, it has to stop at some points

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.000
Also, our own grapes are all for white wine

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.000
For example, we buy black grapes from other areas

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.000
For example, we also purchase grapes from Yamanashi, Nagano, and Yamagata prefecture

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.000
But the transportation takes very long

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.000
It's too much to bring grapes taken from the East and bringing it to the West

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.000
And the abandoned farmlands in Osaka keep increasing

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:21.000
After 5 years time, our winery will be too full with our own grapes

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.000
It wouldn't be able to accommodate any more

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.000
If Yamagata, Nagano, Yamanashi has the same issue as Osaka

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.000
If there were issues in abandoned farmlands

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:35.000
And if we stop buying these grapes, the contract farmers that we bought from

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.000
What will they do when we stop buying from them

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.000
When you look at Japan as a whole

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.000
Just because we saved the abandoned farmlands in Osaka

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.000
This may cause to create abandonment in other areas

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:53.000
We finally realized that it would be meaningless

00:34:53.100 --> 00:35:01.000
We had to overcome the transportation costs and time issues

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.000
As a result

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:10.000
There was only the option of expanding or creating another winery

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:17.000
As a solution, we decided to create a new branch

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.000
Then, we thought about where we were gonna have it

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.000
Our contract farmers at that time were scattered in Yamanashi, Yamagata, and Nagano

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:35.000
What is most interesting is, the most efficient place to collect grapes from all these 3 places was

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:41.000
When we take out the common denominator for these, the most efficient location was Tokyo

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.000
This is because the transportation network is spread within the city in the middle of it all

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.000
For example, we have a contract farmer in Ibaraki and Chiba prefecture

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:55.000
When I try to go from the contract farmer in Chiba to the one in Ibaraki

00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:00.000
Normally, you would just go to the upper right, or to North East

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:06.000
When you use your car navigation, it will use the highway, and go back to Tokyo first

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.000
It goes back to Tokyo first, and go out of it again

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.000
In Yamanashi and Yamagata, it's the same way

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:17.000
So we realized that the place that you can collect grapes the fastest is Tokyo

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:24.000
We thought that we could take the urban winery plus restaurant model to Tokyo

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.000
From this idea, the Kiyosumishirakawa Fujimaru brewery was born

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:36.000
It's in Koto ward, and as long as you don't get the exit wrong it's 5 to 6 minutes away from Kiyosumishirakawa station

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.000
It's just a typical looking house

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.000
The landlord lives in the 3rd floor, this is also a leased winery

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:50.000
1st floor is the winery, 2nd floor is the restaurant, and the 1st floor looks like this

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.000
Within the area, there is an apartment

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.000
And a residential house on this side

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:03.000
It's really right in the middle of the residential area in Koto ward right at the back alley

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.000
We created a winery in the middle

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.000
We decided to bring in the grapes taken from our contract farmers we had been buying from

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:20.000
We decided it do it in a way that doesn't cut the income of farmers and without decreasing the production quantity

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.000
The 1st floor looks like this, and it was originally a steel factory

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.000
We remodelled the existing steel factory like this, and you can see someone peek here

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:32.000
She's sitting right there, and she is the wine maker

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.000
We use good equipment here

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:46.000
In the Kiyosumishirakawa branch, the headquarters of the company that handles equipment is close by

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:54.000
They said that they can come right away if we needed help, the same equipment from Osaka isn't used, and imported equipment is mostly used

00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.000
We created here a winery that was exclusively for purchased grapes

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.000
At the 2nd floor, there is a tasting room like this

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:12.000
In this restaurant, colorful dishes such as this are served

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:21.000
Currently, the chef is Italian, and he creates unique dishes

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.000
Let's talk about the things that we do here

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:32.000
After starting an urban winery, we thought what our next step was

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:38.000
In Japan today, we have declining birth rates and avoidance of alcohol issues

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.000
These are recent concerns in the alcohol industry

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:48.000
I think that many here do not smoke anymore

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.000
When I was young, a lot of people were smoking

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.000
Our fathers and mothers

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.000
But after 10 to 20 years

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.000
Cigarettes have turned into the evil

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.000
There are many who want it to disappear from this world

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:08.000
As alcohol and cigarettes being the same kind of indulgence

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.000
What we most fear of is

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.000
To be the evil in society

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:18.000
There really are cases where they are obliterated from the world

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.000
With this said, we have to find a way to be an existence that is needed in society

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.000
As an industry, we have to be much bigger

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.000
This generation isn't about drinking a lot

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:35.000
But, having 1 glass a day is just fine

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.000
This is the kind of activities that we are trying to do

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:43.000
Do you know the consumption of wine in Japan is?

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.000
I only know Shinobu-san's name so

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.000
How much do you think it's?

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.000
Japan as a whole

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.000
How many bottles of wine do you think we consume?

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.000
In a year

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.000
Adults that are of legal age, how many bottles a year do you think?

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.000
About 2 bottles? In a year?

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.000
Good guess

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.000
In average it's about 4 bottles

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.000
4 bottles is in a year

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.000
Don't we drink that amount in a week?

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.000
That is the numbers

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.000
That means, that the gap between those who drink and those who don't is very wide

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:23.000
Of course, there are those that are financially restricted even if they wanted to

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:28.000
That is why I think it has become a drink that only a few people enjoy

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:33.000
I would like to reach out to those that do not drink now

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:39.000
What we came up with is to put children into the mix

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.000
They will be our customers and 10 to 20 years time

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:47.000
We want to show that wineries can be fun, and it's about craftsmanship

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:55.000
We want them to understand that it isn't anywhere scary, or harmful, but it's something that is fun and enjoyable

00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:00.000
We thought that they could be on our side in the future

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.000
We also have hand squeezing experiences that we offer with parents

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:13.000
They are taught to take out the stems, and squeeze it through the press machine

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.000
The juice comes out, and goes into the fermentation tank

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:23.000
After this, they go to the 2nd floor to have a meal, and we charge around 500 to 1000 Yen for this, so it's in the red

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:30.000
In the restaurant, they would use knives and forks together and eat with their kids

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.000
They can also drink the juice, and after finishing the fermentation

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:40.000
They can be packed in the bottle, and a label is put on it

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:48.000
While the children can put anything they want on it, and they paste in the bottle as a memorabilia for the parents and kids

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.000
When we do this, you cannot drink it that easily, right

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.000
But the parents want to drink, so they usually buy another bottle

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.000
When they come to buy, that is when it makes a profit

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.000
This is the kind of activities and events we have

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:08.000
By doing so, we want to increase our fans for the future

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:20.000
And convey the beauty of wine to the younger generations like yourself, and this is something we do regularly

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:26.000
The other day, this is something I talked about a lot at a university

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:32.000
Craftsmanship from now on isn't simply processing

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.000
The time where selling is the most important thing is over

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:42.000
What the government is working on now is the 6 sectors of economy

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.000
We typically have the primary for the farmers and fishery

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.000
And manufacturing in the second, and the tertiary section as the services

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.000
When you add up 1, 2, and 3 together, you have 6, and this is where the new movement comes from

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:59.000
It boils down to asking someone to make something who doesn't know what sells

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.000
The end product will not match the needs of society

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:08.000
What we are doing is, people from the tertiary section doing primary and secondary work

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.000
It's marketing mixed with secondary and primary

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.000
We understood what was lacking in society, and we found the wine that was lacking

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:25.000
This way of thinking has brought us much attention that has obviously increased our opportunities to speak about it

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.000
What we always think is that

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.000
We believe in the power of wine

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.000
The reason why we can receive this kind of opportunity is because of the power of wine

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.000
A glass can strike up a conversation

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.000
Even if the wine tasted good or bad, it's a drink that brings out conversations

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.000
Even if you like it or not, it's a type of drink that will bring out some kind of word

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.000
And finally

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:57.000
In the wine that you are drinking now has Osaka and Yamagata Delaware in them

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.000
It's also a good way to draw interest in these local areas

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:09.000
By making it into wine, it can instantly connect the land and and the consumer 

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.000
I think this is the kind of work it does

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:20.000
From the national classification, a winery is a food processing factory

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.000
When it's a food processing factory

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:29.000
It falls in the same as packing canned goods, and bottling drinks

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.000
But we always direct our attention to agriculture, when we work

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.000
Winery usually uses a large amount of grapes

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.000
We use, 60 tons of grapes

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:42.000
60 tons of grapes influences a large space of farm

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:49.000
When there is one winery, only that amount of grapes is needed, and that amount of farm will be kept

00:44:49.100 --> 00:45:54.000
As long as we work hard in delivering to the customers
574
00:45:54,100 --&gt; 00:45:01,000
We can start to see the new shape of agriculture

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:06.000
It can be the interaction between customers and drinkers

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.000
It can be the interaction between the drinker and the creator

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.000
It can provide different situations

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.000
From a simple food processing factory

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.000
When it changes to a winery

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.000
In this time we are in, it's not simply about making something

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:30.000
A little extra something must be added, if not, I think there isn't a way to survive

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:37.000
It was a long talk, but these are the efforts we are working on

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.000
Thank you
