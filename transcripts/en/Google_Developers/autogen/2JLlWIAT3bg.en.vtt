what is to be an Android app how you
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.420
what is to be an Android app how you
design an Android app to kind of look as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

are you saying there's one way to build
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.190
are you saying there's one way to build
apps only ah no I'd say there's many

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
apps only ah no I'd say there's many
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.350
apps only ah no I'd say there's many
ways you can build an app but i'd say

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
ways you can build an app but i'd say
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.549

customized like to bring your own
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189
customized like to bring your own
personality to your application so if

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
personality to your application so if
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.660
personality to your application so if
you look at you know a variety of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
you look at you know a variety of
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.740
you look at you know a variety of
applications out there look at something

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
applications out there look at something
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110
applications out there look at something
like the expedia wrap to the google play

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
like the expedia wrap to the google play
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240
like the expedia wrap to the google play

music application it was the food like
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.190
music application it was the food like
the alarm clock application like they

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
the alarm clock application like they
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230
the alarm clock application like they
look very very different they all have

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
look very very different they all have
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.050
look very very different they all have
their own feel to them but they follow

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
their own feel to them but they follow
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179
their own feel to them but they follow
certain rules so an interaction patterns

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
certain rules so an interaction patterns
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.200

which means that when a user picks it up

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
which means that when a user picks it up
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920
which means that when a user picks it up
they'll know how to use it right so that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
they'll know how to use it right so that
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.260
they'll know how to use it right so that
that's absolutely key so um I'm an

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
that's absolutely key so um I'm an
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.350
that's absolutely key so um I'm an
Android developer ah should I also be

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
Android developer ah should I also be
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.100
Android developer ah should I also be
the designer does that even make sense

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110
the designer does that even make sense
 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.420
the designer does that even make sense
if you want to do both if you can do

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430

like if you if you're working on a big

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
like if you if you're working on a big
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.950
like if you if you're working on a big
project and you can have a dedicated

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
project and you can have a dedicated
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109
project and you can have a dedicated
design resource that's awesome and I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
design resource that's awesome and I
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.130
design resource that's awesome and I
think a lot of the most polished

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
think a lot of the most polished
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410
think a lot of the most polished
applications I like that if you're a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
applications I like that if you're a
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539
applications I like that if you're a
one-man band who is just kind of like a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
one-man band who is just kind of like a
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249
one-man band who is just kind of like a
developer interested in design then

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
developer interested in design then
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990
developer interested in design then
hopefully there's a lot of resources we

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
hopefully there's a lot of resources we
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639
hopefully there's a lot of resources we
putting out there that you can get up to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
putting out there that you can get up to
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980
putting out there that you can get up to
speed so things like the Android design

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
speed so things like the Android design
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.240
speed so things like the Android design
guidelines which have been around for

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
guidelines which have been around for
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.560
guidelines which have been around for
about a year now and have kind of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
about a year now and have kind of
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660
about a year now and have kind of
progressively got more and more we're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
progressively got more and more we're
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160
progressively got more and more we're
actually upgrading those with the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
actually upgrading those with the
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109
actually upgrading those with the
releases of right right right with each

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
releases of right right right with each
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.330
releases of right right right with each
release and as each new pattern so every

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
release and as each new pattern so every
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
release and as each new pattern so every
now and then such as when the navigation

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
now and then such as when the navigation
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229
now and then such as when the navigation
drawer gained popularity we started

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
drawer gained popularity we started
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.330
drawer gained popularity we started
documenting it and saying we

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340
documenting it and saying we
 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.650
documenting it and saying we
think this is the best way you can use

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660
think this is the best way you can use
 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.570
think this is the best way you can use
this pattern add adaptive design site

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580
this pattern add adaptive design site
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.420
this pattern add adaptive design site
and as well as the show that I do once a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430
and as well as the show that I do once a
 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.740
and as well as the show that I do once a
month or so called Android design in

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
month or so called Android design in
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.259
month or so called Android design in
action which is all about how to design

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269
action which is all about how to design
 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.390
action which is all about how to design
for Android so hopefully were putting

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400
for Android so hopefully were putting
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.650
for Android so hopefully were putting
the resources out there that if you're a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
the resources out there that if you're a
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.479
the resources out there that if you're a
developer who's interested in design

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
developer who's interested in design
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.030
developer who's interested in design
that you can get up to speed so how hard

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
that you can get up to speed so how hard
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440
that you can get up to speed so how hard
is it to start I mean there's the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
is it to start I mean there's the
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.059
is it to start I mean there's the
Android design guidelines do you need to

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069
Android design guidelines do you need to
 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.740
Android design guidelines do you need to
read all of it and implement all of it

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
read all of it and implement all of it
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.690
read all of it and implement all of it
or you have it all wrong or is there a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700
or you have it all wrong or is there a
 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.640
or you have it all wrong or is there a
way like you don't have like a too high

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650
way like you don't have like a too high
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.500
way like you don't have like a too high
of a bar to start with yeah it's my

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
of a bar to start with yeah it's my
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.000
of a bar to start with yeah it's my
favorite thing about the Android design

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010
favorite thing about the Android design
 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.580
favorite thing about the Android design
guidelines is how short they are like

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590
guidelines is how short they are like
 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.979
guidelines is how short they are like
it's not a massive tome of human

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989
it's not a massive tome of human
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.839
it's not a massive tome of human
interface guidelines written in very dry

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849
interface guidelines written in very dry
 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.000
interface guidelines written in very dry
language that is a you know hard to get

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
language that is a you know hard to get
 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.559
language that is a you know hard to get
through you can actually read the entire

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569
through you can actually read the entire
 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.289
through you can actually read the entire

we're all a huge amount of content so I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
we're all a huge amount of content so I
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.699
we're all a huge amount of content so I
would recommend yeah read it like this

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709
would recommend yeah read it like this
 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.500
would recommend yeah read it like this
is the basis of what it is to be an

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
is the basis of what it is to be an
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.240
is the basis of what it is to be an
Android application like how you should

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
Android application like how you should
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.800
Android application like how you should
should operate so I'd say it's a great

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
should operate so I'd say it's a great
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.900
should operate so I'd say it's a great
start to read that and then go from

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
start to read that and then go from
 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.030
start to read that and then go from
there so then go from you know to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
there so then go from you know to
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.650
there so then go from you know to
there's a flourishing community of

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660
there's a flourishing community of
 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.330

apps which are nicely designed tend to

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280
apps which are nicely designed tend to
 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.750
apps which are nicely designed tend to
have a higher rating as well as on the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760
have a higher rating as well as on the
 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.740

google play store there's obviously

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750
google play store there's obviously
 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.020

things like the top lists and as well as

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030
things like the top lists and as well as
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.640

there's a collection of applications

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120
there's a collection of applications
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520
there's a collection of applications
called the beautiful design and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530
called the beautiful design and
 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.250
called the beautiful design and
application list core collection I guess

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260
application list core collection I guess
 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.800
application list core collection I guess
so you can't get into those kind of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810
so you can't get into those kind of
 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.600
so you can't get into those kind of
things without having you know and there

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610
things without having you know and there
 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.980
things without having you know and there
should be good inspiration if you look

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
should be good inspiration if you look
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.560
should be good inspiration if you look
at those this I mean if they got there

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570
at those this I mean if they got there
 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.080
at those this I mean if they got there
right probably if you get do something

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090
right probably if you get do something
 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.040
right probably if you get do something

the design guidelines cat for me is a

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680
the design guidelines cat for me is a
 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.770
the design guidelines cat for me is a
maturing of the design guidelines so I

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780
maturing of the design guidelines so I
 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.140
maturing of the design guidelines so I
think that means a small strange though

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150
think that means a small strange though
 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.330
think that means a small strange though
exactly I don't think we've radically

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340
exactly I don't think we've radically
 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.890
exactly I don't think we've radically
changed direction but we've refined all

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900
changed direction but we've refined all
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.270
changed direction but we've refined all
over the place it's all about polishing

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280
over the place it's all about polishing
 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.490
over the place it's all about polishing
it's all about delivering a better

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500
it's all about delivering a better
 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.290
it's all about delivering a better
experience so color like we touched on

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300
experience so color like we touched on
 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.800
experience so color like we touched on
earlier on we backed away from having

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810
earlier on we backed away from having
 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.779
earlier on we backed away from having
these kind of very very strong accent

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789
these kind of very very strong accent
 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.580
these kind of very very strong accent
colors so by default the user interface

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
colors so by default the user interface
 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.900
colors so by default the user interface
used to use a lot of this kind of like

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910
used to use a lot of this kind of like
 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.090
used to use a lot of this kind of like
you know blued it was kind of like jolt

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100
you know blued it was kind of like jolt
 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.820
you know blued it was kind of like jolt
of contrast in your application and it

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830
of contrast in your application and it
 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.350
of contrast in your application and it
didn't particularly leave a lot of room

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360
didn't particularly leave a lot of room
 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.000
didn't particularly leave a lot of room
for your app to have its own personality

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
for your app to have its own personality
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.159
for your app to have its own personality
because if you or you know your color

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
because if you or you know your color
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.570
because if you or you know your color
was like your branding was red for

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580
was like your branding was red for
 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.550
was like your branding was red for
example you have all these like blue

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560
example you have all these like blue
 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.440
example you have all these like blue
stop controls in there it can be quite

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450
stop controls in there it can be quite
 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.930
stop controls in there it can be quite
quite clashing actually so what we try

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940
quite clashing actually so what we try
 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.450
quite clashing actually so what we try
to do the OS is back that away so by

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460
to do the OS is back that away so by
 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.650
to do the OS is back that away so by
default you'll get more of a neutral

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660
default you'll get more of a neutral
 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.900
default you'll get more of a neutral
experience but the reason is to leave

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910
experience but the reason is to leave
 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.850
experience but the reason is to leave
room for apps to innovate so an app can

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860
room for apps to innovate so an app can
 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.469
room for apps to innovate so an app can
then express its own personality can

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479
then express its own personality can
 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.050
then express its own personality can
then customize on top of that so things

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060
then customize on top of that so things
 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.370
then customize on top of that so things
like that i think is showing a maturing

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380
like that i think is showing a maturing
 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.779
like that i think is showing a maturing
of the platform so the platform is kind

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789
of the platform so the platform is kind
 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:08.920
of the platform so the platform is kind
of getting out the way to let the apps

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930
of getting out the way to let the apps
 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.960
of getting out the way to let the apps
really shine great and then would you

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970
really shine great and then would you
 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.790
really shine great and then would you
recommend people actually changing

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800
recommend people actually changing
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.860
recommend people actually changing

well there are some other features as

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930
well there are some other features as
 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.180
well there are some other features as
well which I'm quite excited about so

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190
well which I'm quite excited about so
 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.469
well which I'm quite excited about so
one thing I'm really excited about for

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479
one thing I'm really excited about for
 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.420
one thing I'm really excited about for
designers is in the immersive mode yeah

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430
designers is in the immersive mode yeah
 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.760
designers is in the immersive mode yeah
you now get now you now get access to

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770
you now get now you now get access to
 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.230
you now get now you now get access to
the entire screen so if you have these

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240
the entire screen so if you have these
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.010
the entire screen so if you have these
on-screen buttons you can outdraw

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
on-screen buttons you can outdraw
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.320
on-screen buttons you can outdraw
behind them or hide them temporarily or

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
behind them or hide them temporarily or
 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.529
behind them or hide them temporarily or
persistently so that you know unleashes

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539
persistently so that you know unleashes
 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.439
persistently so that you know unleashes
a whole new kind of interaction modes I

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449
a whole new kind of interaction modes I
 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:43.580
a whole new kind of interaction modes I
think if you look at google play books

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590
think if you look at google play books
 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.800
think if you look at google play books
for example which is a beautiful job of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810
for example which is a beautiful job of
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.480
for example which is a beautiful job of
like hiding all the system chrome and

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490
like hiding all the system chrome and
 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.249
like hiding all the system chrome and
getting other way and really focusing on

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259
getting other way and really focusing on
 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.779
getting other way and really focusing on
the experience of reading and then

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789
the experience of reading and then
 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.219
the experience of reading and then
coming back and making it really really

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229
coming back and making it really really
 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.779
coming back and making it really really
easy to navigate again when you need to

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789
easy to navigate again when you need to
 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.369
easy to navigate again when you need to
I think those are the kind of

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379
I think those are the kind of
 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.260
I think those are the kind of
opportunities that KitKat provides for

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270
opportunities that KitKat provides for
 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.629
opportunities that KitKat provides for
designers and developers to kind of have

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639
designers and developers to kind of have
 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.909
designers and developers to kind of have
a really rich interface ok cool so

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919
a really rich interface ok cool so
 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.999
a really rich interface ok cool so
before we close um you know I have a nap

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009
before we close um you know I have a nap
 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.420
before we close um you know I have a nap
on the play swords doing ok I have a 3x

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
on the play swords doing ok I have a 3x
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.219

something breathing which is not bad but

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229
something breathing which is not bad but
 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.070
something breathing which is not bad but
I want to improve that design guidelines

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080
I want to improve that design guidelines
 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.899
I want to improve that design guidelines
is where I go is there this one trick

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:14.909
is where I go is there this one trick
 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.260
is where I go is there this one trick
with give me that one flip to switch to

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270
with give me that one flip to switch to
 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.129
with give me that one flip to switch to
get a better design ok so i would say

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139
get a better design ok so i would say
 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.020
get a better design ok so i would say
the one thing you can really do is focus

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030
the one thing you can really do is focus
 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.089
the one thing you can really do is focus
on your information hierarchy i think

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099
on your information hierarchy i think
 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.860
on your information hierarchy i think
the one thing that people i know is

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870
the one thing that people i know is
 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.149
the one thing that people i know is
they're going to coming from a developer

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159
they're going to coming from a developer
 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:30.320
they're going to coming from a developer
background i'm really excited to dive

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330
background i'm really excited to dive
 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.999
background i'm really excited to dive
into app and create it and i use the

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:32.009
into app and create it and i use the
 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:34.339
into app and create it and i use the
latest you know buttons and libraries

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:34.349
latest you know buttons and libraries
 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.649
latest you know buttons and libraries
and so on but i think the biggest

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659
and so on but i think the biggest
 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.330
and so on but i think the biggest
benefit you can get in designing is it

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340
benefit you can get in designing is it
 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.620
benefit you can get in designing is it
could really think about the information

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630
could really think about the information
 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.870
could really think about the information
hierarchy and use that to create your

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880
hierarchy and use that to create your
 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.580
hierarchy and use that to create your
navigation so that it makes you out

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590
navigation so that it makes you out
 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.350
navigation so that it makes you out
easier to navigate around i think the

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360
easier to navigate around i think the
 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.450
easier to navigate around i think the
kind of the visual stuff can add a lot

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460
kind of the visual stuff can add a lot
 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.300
kind of the visual stuff can add a lot
on top but if the if the fundamental

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310
on top but if the if the fundamental
 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.439
on top but if the if the fundamental
kind of information hierarchy isn't

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449
kind of information hierarchy isn't
 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.719
kind of information hierarchy isn't
there then you know you need to start

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
there then you know you need to start
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.640
there then you know you need to start
from from the beginning so I'd say yeah

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650
from from the beginning so I'd say yeah
 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.050
from from the beginning so I'd say yeah
look at information hierarchy then look

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060
look at information hierarchy then look
 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.790
look at information hierarchy then look
at on navigation and interaction

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800
at on navigation and interaction
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.379
at on navigation and interaction
patterns and use that and then once you

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:00.389
patterns and use that and then once you
 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.149
patterns and use that and then once you
kind of there then apply the visual

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159
kind of there then apply the visual
 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:03.800
kind of there then apply the visual
stuff and the one top tip one thing that

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.810
stuff and the one top tip one thing that
 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.269
stuff and the one top tip one thing that
really bugs me of applications is touch

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:05.279
really bugs me of applications is touch
 

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.769
really bugs me of applications is touch
feedback just make sure you do that

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:06.779
feedback just make sure you do that
 

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:08.360
feedback just make sure you do that
properly as well it's like the simplest

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370
properly as well it's like the simplest
 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.529
properly as well it's like the simplest
thing but if an application doesn't

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539
thing but if an application doesn't
 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:11.779
thing but if an application doesn't
respond when I touch it then it feels

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:11.789
respond when I touch it then it feels
 

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.719
respond when I touch it then it feels
slow it feels laggy feels buggy so

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:14.729
slow it feels laggy feels buggy so
 

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.100
slow it feels laggy feels buggy so

know a stable production release

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040
know a stable production release
 

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.680
know a stable production release
so if you're doing these kind of

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.690
so if you're doing these kind of
 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.210
so if you're doing these kind of
refinements you can like push them to a

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:48.220
refinements you can like push them to a
 

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.670
refinements you can like push them to a
smaller slightly more kind of a less

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680
smaller slightly more kind of a less
 

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.199
smaller slightly more kind of a less
risk-averse kind of group and get

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:52.209
risk-averse kind of group and get
 

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:53.999
risk-averse kind of group and get
feedback from them quite quickly without

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:54.009
feedback from them quite quickly without
 

00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:55.290
