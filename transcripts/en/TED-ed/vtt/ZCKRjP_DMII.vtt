00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:08.911
Rising temperatures and seas,

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.357
massive droughts,

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:12.069
changing landscapes.

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.897
Successfully adapting to climate change
is growing increasingly important.

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:20.625
For humans, this means using
our technological advancement

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.140
to find solutions,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.419
like smarter cities
and better water management.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.161
But for some plants and animals,

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:32.082
adapting to these global changes
involves the most ancient solution of all:

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:33.735
evolution.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:38.751
Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs
along time scales of thousands

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.195
to hundreds of thousands of years.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:46.218
But in cases where species are under
especially strong selective conditions,

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:48.857
like those caused 
by rapidly changing climates,

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:52.202
adaptive evolution 
can happen more quickly.

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:53.302
In recent decades,

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.580
we've seen many plants,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.391
animals,

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:57.832
and insects relocating themselves

00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:00.253
and undergoing changes
to their body sizes,

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:03.495
and the dates they flower or breed.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:05.202
But many of these are plastic,

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:09.461
or nonheritable changes
to an individual's physical traits.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:13.223
And there are limits to how much
an organism can change its own physiology

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:15.768
to meet environmental requirements.

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:20.045
That's why scientists are seeking
examples of evolutionary changes

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:23.262
coded in species' DNA that are heritable,

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:24.579
long-lasting,

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.414
and may provide a key to their future.

00:01:27.414 --> 00:01:29.286
Take the tawny owl.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:33.404
If you were walking through a wintry
forest in northern Europe 30 years ago,

00:01:33.404 --> 00:01:36.500
chances are you'd have heard,
rather than seen,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.452
this elusive bird.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:39.939
Against the snowy backdrop,

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.798
its plumage would have been
near impossible to spot.

00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:46.444
Today, the landscape is vastly different.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:47.916
Since the 1980s,

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:51.076
climate change has led to significantly
less snowfall,

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.194
but you'd still struggle 
to spot a tawny owl

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:57.024
because nowadays, they're brown.

00:01:57.024 --> 00:02:02.405
The brown color variant is the genetically
dominant form of plumage in this species,

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:03.785
but historically,

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.683
the recessive pale gray variant triumphed

00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:11.225
because of its selective advantage
in helping these predators blend in.

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:15.284
However, less snow cover reduces
opportunities for camouflage,

00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:17.373
so lately, this gray color variant

00:02:17.373 --> 00:02:20.561
has been losing 
the battle against natural selection.

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.418
The offspring of the brown color morphs,
on the other hand,

00:02:23.418 --> 00:02:25.991
have an advantage in exposed forests,

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.734
so brown tawny owls are flourishing today.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.625
Several other species have undergone

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:36.296
similar climate-change-adaptive 
genetic changes in recent decades.

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:38.937
Pitcher plant mosquitoes 
have rapidly evolved

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:41.388
to take advantage 
of the warmer temperatures,

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:44.892
entering dormancy later 
and later in the year.

00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:47.171
Two spot ladybug populations,

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:51.972
once comprised of equal numbers
of melanic and non-melanic morphs,

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:56.223
have now shifted almost entirely
to the non-melanic color combination.

00:02:56.223 --> 00:02:59.668
Scientists think that keeps them
from overheating.

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:03.302
Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted
to warmer waters

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:07.620
by spawning earlier in the season
to protect their sensitive eggs.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.837
And wild thyme plants in Europe
are producing more repellent oils

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:14.374
to protect themselves 
against the herbivores

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:17.304
that become more common when it's warm.

00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:21.747
These plants and animals belong to a group
of about 20 identified species

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:25.898
with evolutionary adaptations
to rapid climate change,

00:03:25.898 --> 00:03:27.314
including snapping turtles,

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:28.601
wood frogs,

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.697
knotweed,

00:03:29.697 --> 00:03:32.849
and silver spotted skipper butterflies.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.488
However, scientists hope to discover
more species evolving

00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:41.704
in response to climate change
out of 8.7 million species on the planet.

00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.980
For most of our planet's astounding
and precious biodiversity,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.465
evolution won't be the answer.

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.133
Instead, many of those species
will have to rely on us

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:53.902
to help them survive a changing world

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:56.324
or face extinction.

00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:58.864
The good news is
we already have the tools.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:01.689
Across the planet, we're making
on-the-ground decisions

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.820
that will help entire ecosystems adapt.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.679
Critical climate refuges 
are being identified and set aside,

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.507
and projects are underway to help
mobile species

00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:13.795
move to more suitable climates.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:18.528
Existing parks and protected areas
are also doing climate change check-ups

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:20.878
to help their wildlife cope.

00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:23.479
Fortunately, it's still within our power

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.571
to preserve much of 
the wondrous biodiversity of this planet,

00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:30.467
which, after all, sustains us
in so many ways.
