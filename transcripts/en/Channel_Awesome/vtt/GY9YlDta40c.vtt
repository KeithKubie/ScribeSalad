00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.400
MORNING !

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.400
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up !

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.900
It's Saturday morning !

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
Ugh, Critic, we didn't get much sleep.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.700
Too excited for your bowl of Lucky Frosted Cocoa Trix ?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.800
It's part of a complete breakfast.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
From where, Dairy Queen's dumpster ?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.600
Now, don't be like that. I poured you each a bowl
of that last Saturday in preparation for this.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.200
You mean this has been out for a week ?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.600
It helps open up the flavors.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.600
I had a big dinner.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.560
And I'm vegetarian. I'm pretty sure that used to be alive.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Eh, suit yourself.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.100
OK, Critic, can you explain why we're up
at dick o'clock in the morning ?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.140
Ohohohohoho, I forgot that you're at humble age.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.860
You're not aware of the ritual of Saturday morning.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.680
You see, Saturday morning used to be a special time for kids.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
We'd often have friends sleep over the night before

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.900
and then wake up to the majesty
of television's Saturday morning cartoons,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.100
each one filled with brain-rotting material
coaxing us to buy teeth-rotting material.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
Unfortunately, TV did its job too well
and the following generation said,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
"Let's just have this shit raise our kids 24/7!"

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.200
Thus, every second of every goddamn day
was Saturday morning cartoons

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.180
and they got rid of them years later. Society sucks.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.600
OK, we're not 10 years old.
We had Saturday morning cartoons, too.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.800
We're just wondering why we're here
this Saturday morning.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.900
Oh, well, that's because we're paying homage to one of the best in Saturday morning awesomeness, Fox Kids !

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.000
In 1990, the then-still young Fox Network aired
its Saturday morning lineup of shows called Fox Kids.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.400
It included bumpers, PSAs, catchy songs, and of course, some of the best kids' shows to ever air on TV.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.920
Eventually branching out to Monday-Friday as well,
Fox Kids lasted 12 years,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.500
an unbelievable run when you consider its counterpart, the Disney Afternoon, lasted only 7 years.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.000
While half of these shows can still be viewed today, some of them have sadly never gotten a DVD release
or were never aired again.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.500
So keep in mind we're not gonna look
at every single show that aired on Fox Kids

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.000
because like I said, this is 12 years of material.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.500
We're just gonna look
at the most unique, inspired, and...

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.200
memorable parts of the greatest
Saturday morning lineup there was.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.500
So, with our sugar-coated poison in hand...

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.900
Younger kids wanting to watch what
the older kids are watching...

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.640
Hey, guys !

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.000
Can we watch the shows, too ?

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.200
And an overprotective parental who thinks
if it's not Sesame Street, it's bad for them...

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.600
I'm sorry, kids, but you're too young
to see this kind of stuff.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.200
I'm older than half of them over there !

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.800
I hate you ! You're not even my real father !

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.200
Kids, are you enjoying Saturday morning ?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.600
Yes, Dad.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.320
That's good. I'm gonna go make
some waffles on the stove just for you.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780
Do... Do we have a stove ?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.660
Well, we'll figure out how that happened later.

It was complicated. We'll get to it when we get to it.

It's on Fox !
♫ It's on Fox ! ♫

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.600
Let's start with one of
their earliest staples, Bobby's World.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.200
Oh, I've seen this. It's like if Calvin and Hobbes
were made by Ned Flanders.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.000
Hey, it's a lot more than that.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.500
Sounds pretty accurate.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.200
Yeah, OK, it's pretty accurate.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.300
Bobby's World was based off of the little boy voice that comedian Howie Mandel did for his popular standup.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.600
♫ If my parrot Fred can't sing... ♫

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.080
"I'm gonna kill that one, too !"

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.920
That's my name ! Hehehehehehehe !

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.200
And because the 90's were a strange time where
crude comedians got kid-friendly shows,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.600
he was given one of his own.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600
Just look at how awkward he is
in the live action openings.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.100
Hi, everybody, I'm Howie. Welcome to Bobby's World !

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.140
And you know what I really hate ?
Of course you don't because you don't know me.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.800
You know what I hate ?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.200
"Germs ! God, I hate germs !"

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.400
Though certainly aimed at a younger demographic
than the other Fox Kids shows,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.700
Bobby's World showcased the imagination
of a little boy misinterpreting what adults say.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.300
Either that or he swallowed all of his mother's NyQuil.
Either way, neat.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.020
The characters included Howie as his father
with the Jew-fro rat-tail haircut...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.140
Common ?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.600
the cast of Fargo as his mother...

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.600
You need to go upstairs and wash your face and hands before we leave for Aunt Ruth, don't you know.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.320
His older brother representing the 90's
trying to kill the 80's,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.200
and his older sister representing the 80's refusing to die,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.700
along with Uncle Ted to give his obligatory fart joke.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.000
How come you can make bubbles
without putting your face in the water ?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.100
Tell you what, Bobbo,
let's just keep that our little secret, OK ?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.840
POOP !

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.600
Bobby had children's fantasies often based on movies
a kid his age wouldn't see yet.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.900
Looks like somebody read the kid-friendly
version of Die Hard.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.500
So was it any good ?

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.100
It was...

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.800
hypnotizingly unoffensive.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.700
It's for little kids, so it's simple but imaginative.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.700
It even had possibly the first Saturday morning character to get pregnant

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.800
and we actually see her progression
throughout the season.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.400
Little touches like that make it stand out just enough.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.200
And I guess kids thought the same thing because
it was suprisingly one of Fox's longest running shows.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.200
Add a catchy-as-hell theme song and you have
a decent start to the Fox Kids lineup.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.700
That's cool and all, but how about
some more violent stuff ?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.300
Well, you're in luck 'cause this network
also had Tom and Jerry !

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.960
Yes !

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.600
Kids.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.660
I retract that yes.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.700
♫ Talkin' bout the Tom and Jerry Kids ♫

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.400
Yeah, another strange trend in kids' shows for a while was just making famous characters younger.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.000
Because if there's anything better than seeing someone brutally dismembered and maimed, it's...

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.700
seeing it happen to them as children ?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.340
Finally, somebody gets it !

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.860
I have issues.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.300
It was pretty much the same thing as the regular
Tom and Jerry cartoons, except it was done with kids,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.900
so the slapstick wasn't nearly
as violent and therefore, not nearly as funny.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.120
Granted, it had other characters,
too, like Spike and his son Tyke,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.600
Droopy and his son Dripple-

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.800
In fact, how are Tom and Jerry younger
if their counterparts are the same age ?

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.500
And how is Skyfall a prequel if M is in Goldeneye ?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.780
Also, how did Minions exist with dinosaurs
millions of years ago ?!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.960
This is a road you don't wanna go down.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.460
OK, I'll never bring it up agai-

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.960
Ever.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.900
Much like Bobby's World, this was obviously
meant for smaller children,

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.800
so it was tamer and more gentle than previous versions.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.620
So not good ?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.180
Yeah.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.700
But for little kids, it gets the job done, I guess.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.900
I mean, it is better than other outings Tom and Jerry have had recently.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.980
NEVER FORGET THOSE FACES !

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.900
It lasted a few seasons, though,
so it obviously had its fans.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.300
It's not the cat and mouse team we remember,
but it's not obnoxious, either.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000
It wasn't harmful enough to be Tom and Jerry,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.200
but it was harmless enough to be
a decent distraction for little kids.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.000
♫ Tom and Jerry Kids ! ♫

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.400
♫ The Tom and Jerry Kids New Show ! ♫

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.700
But let's get to something more grizzly and adult :

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.000
Peter Pan and the Pirates.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.700
Let me explain.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.900
We all know the classic book, play,
Disney film, and childhood scarring,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.200
but few adaptations of Peter Pan ever capture

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.500
the darker and surprisingly more adult take
of the original J.M. Berry story than this one.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.700
I know this sounds strange,
but this was actually a really great show.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.800
They were ideas that took concepts from
the original book and pushed them even further.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.300
For example, Peter steals
the Pirates' shadows and what happens ?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.400
They walk upside-down because they've lost
their anchor to the ground.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.660
That's so creatively strange, but it weirdly makes sense.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.820
In another episode, Peter is gone for too long
and forgets about everybody

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.440
because he's distracted by Wendy's future
daughter in the real world,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.900
who he brings to Neverland to meet her future mother despite them being the same age.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.600
Bye, Uncle Michael, Uncle John.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.800
Why are you sad ?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.360
Because I learned today that I shall have
to leave Neverland sometime.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.200
But I'm happy, 'cause when I do, I'm going to have
a daughter as wonderful as you.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.000
It's super surreal, but it's also surprisingly adult.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.900
It's kinda like the ending of Return to Neverland,
where young Peter meets older Wendy.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.800
That's a lot of people's favorite part of that movie,
and this show is mostly comprised of scenes like that.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.600
The characters all have fleshed-out personalities
with Peter always hungry for mischief,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.600
the Lost Boys and Pirates
all having distinct character traits,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:13.400
and in my opinion, the best Captain Hook ever portrayed, played by the only actor who could perfectly portray him.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.020
Literally the first perfect thought that comes
into your head is who plays him.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.600
Tim Curry ?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.260
You're goddamn right, Tim Curry !

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:26.000
If I must die, I will encounter darkness
as a bride and hug it in my arms.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.600
This is the first Captain Hook that has dimension to him.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, he's an angry screamer and a scoundrel, but he prides himself on being a gentleman and a sophisticate.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.340
One minute, he's ready to stab your heart, but the next,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.600
he might let you go if you make him laugh
with a reading of Shakespeare.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.000
Ugh, dear Bard, they give you death by inches.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.100
Oh, Shakespeare, give thanks that you aren't here to witness this atrocity.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.300
He was an egotist, but still valued his bizarre ethics.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.600
It made him both funny and intimidating
at the exact same time.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600
And nowhere is the series' complexity shown
best than in its series finale,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.000
where Peter decides he does want to grow up,
and he starts to wither away into an old man,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.600
unaware that he's actually taking Neverland with him.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.000
So you could argue Hook was portrayed
even before Hook was doing it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.400
It's surprisingly intense and unbelievably well done.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.500
It lasted for only one season, but it resulted in a ton
of episodes and had a pretty good life in reruns.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.000
Criminally, though, there is no DVD release of it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.700
If you're able to find it on YouTube or anywhere else, definitely watch as many of them as you can.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.000
It's a cannonball of imagination waiting for you.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.560
That's all fine and good, but what about the poor people who demanded a series about demonic fruit ?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.580
I had no segue into the show.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.000
♫ Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ! ♫

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.200
So, um...

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.100
Because we apparently demanded it, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was given its own cartoon series.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.480
Based on the B-movie comedies, it did have some
of the original characters like Igor,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.200
Terra,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.360
that parachute guy,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.500
and even Jon Astin reprising his role as the mad scientist who made the evil vegetables.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.020
Fruit.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.040
It's 2018, nobody uses that term anymore.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.700
It certainly had the strangeness of the films down,
but it didn't have much more beyond that.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.100
The plot is similar to the movies,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.100
in that, a mad scientist wants to take over the world
with the tomatoes and his failed experiments,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.800
Tara and F.T., and Tomato War veteran,
Wilbur, tries to stop them.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.100
He gets help from the main lead, a boy who was not
in the movies, and you can clearly see why.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.800
He's pretty bland and forgettable, and the animation doesn't do him or any of the other characters any favors.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.680
You know you're supposed to stay away from salt !

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.800
If someone sees you-

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.900
What is up with this girl ?
Is the binary code on her neck being hacked ?

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.800
Must blackmail George Clooney with Return of the Killer Tomatoes footage.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.800
Yo, zucchini !

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.000
Look at this scene : she has to lean over to talk to F.T., but look how she does it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's Igor ! Dr. Gangreen-

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.260
What the hell ?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.200
Is this part of the joke, or is it just poorly animated ?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.000
The whole show is kind of like this, leaving you
with no idea what's intentional and what isn't.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.600
Even the dialogue you can't figure out what
they're aware of and what they're not.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.100
Being a luscious, ripe tomato can be hard on a girl.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.000
Whatever you're thinking, erase it from your heads.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.100
I had a line about her being saucy, but never mind.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.620
I guess on a level of bizarre awkwardness,
I can see this entertaining a few,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.200
but for many kids, the most memorable part of the show was the theme song.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.420
But goddamn, that's a catchy theme song.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.200
♫ Attack of the Killer Tomatoes !
Tomatoes ! Tomatoes ! Tomatoes ! ♫

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.760
But not all of the Fox Kids shows started off on Fox Kids.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.600
A charming story about a dead man who befriends
an underage girl he was going to marry...

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.220
Finally, somebody who gets it !

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.200
Do I have to worry about you ?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.900
You might.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.800
Beetlejuice had only the slightest
connection to the movie,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.200
which was surprisingly welcomed as it allowed
for a lot of wild and inventive designs.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.600
Granted, in the movie, everyone in the movie looks
the way they do because they died that way.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.500
Here...

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.400
I don't know how the shit they were supposed
to die to look like this.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.400
Tim Burton helped design the show, and it certainly shows in all the strange people and creatures.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.700
It had little in terms of plot, but it had a lot
in terms of visual and gross-out humor.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.500
At a time especially when there wasn't much
in terms of dark or macabre cartoons,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.400
this one gave us a small but still memorable
taste of the enjoyably morbid.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.580
It was a waste of time, but it was a fun waste of time.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.900
But I know what you're thinking: "If Beetlejuice
got a cartoon, why not Little Shop of Horrors ?"

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.200
Because no one was thinking that.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.600
Just for that, the plant raps.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.160
NOOOOOO-

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.540
- YEEEEEE-
- NOOOOOO-

♫ Little Shop, Little Shop. Take me to the-- ♫

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.700
Little Shop is based on the musical interpretation
about the man-eating plant,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.900
except Seymour is now a little boy, the plant raps instead of sings, and absolutely none of it looks completed.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.600
♫ You got boxes on rubber that skid on snow !
If this place weren’t so sorry, it’d be a big joke ! ♫

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.600
♫ That's why I'm outta here !
You know what I'm sayin' ? ♫

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.300
This looks more like the bumpers you see
before they go to commercial.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.500
You don't give those bumpers enough credit.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.000
The focus of the show is the plant is trying to get Seymour to win the girl and defeat the bully

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.500
while also running a plant shop that's constantly
infested with bad musical numbers.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.500
♫ My business is a bust ! ♫

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.800
♫ Business, what a joke ! ♫

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.900
♫ Shoobie-doo-ba ! ♫

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.300
God, I wish this had the original cinematic ending.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.000
Why is he even shocked the plant is talking ?
The flowers act as backup singers all the time.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.000
I'm not even sure the plant is talking,
his lips move so rarely.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.700
C is for commuter train ; many parts are edible.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.400
I guess I can give credit that for a show
that had a budget of monkey feces,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.000
the backgrounds are at least creatively simple.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.400
I mean, I'm sure the layout artist had two minutes
to color these on Mario Paint,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.600
but there is at least a little structure
in between the poorly animated sections.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.600
Oh, God, he's having a stroke...nope, it's just a bad show.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.000
♫ Now something's gone bad, it's a crime and disgrace
You got stones for ground, walls in your face ♫

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.700
The writing doesn't make any sense either.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.800
The girl in the show is obsessed with a refrigerator.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.200
I'm going to repeat that.
The girl in the show is obsessed with a refrigerator.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.300
And they never explain why.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.200
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen !

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.100
I think it's really cool.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.300
Women...

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.200
Hey, my love of refrigerators
has nothing to do with my gender !

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.600
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.900
I love you so much.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.700
Yeah, you're so good to me.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.160
I love you so much.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.360
Clearly, Little Shop of Horrors was ahead of its time.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.400
Like I said, this has little redeeming value, but I'm sorry,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.900
I have to reference a Little Shop of Horrors cartoon show in the 90's where the plant raps.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.800
I know you think it's a crime it exists, but it's an even bigger crime to act like it doesn't exist.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:53.040
The show lasted only 13 episodes before it was yanked, and you can see why this fertilizer didn't get far.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.500
♫ Word ! Little Shop ! ♫

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.780
I'm noticing a pattern of characters that
most likely wouldn't make a good show...

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.120
Not making a good show ?

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.960
Were there any existing characters that allowed for clever writing or intelligent dialogue ?

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.360
Yes, really.

♫ Taz in Taz-Mania !
Down in Taz-Mania ! Come to Taz-Mania ! ♫

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.700
Warner Brothers was given the task of turning
one of their most profitable Looney Toons,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.800
the Tasmanian Devil, into a hit show.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.200
How do you do that, though,
when his dialogue is mostly...

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.300
Well, they ingeniously make
everyone else very well-spoken,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.000
even to the point of it being ridiculously overwritten.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.900
Accumulate a portfolio, start with a net yield no less
that 36 percent per annum...

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.200
There's nothing like a paper in a recliner craft chair

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.800
for a man after a tough day of doing
whatever it is I do for a living.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.500
To rekindle the lost flame that connects our souls
with the true harmony of the universe.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.100
Now I am in a quandary.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.700
Technology's the culprit here.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.000
Science be blamed.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.400
Because of this, not only did Taz-Mania
have a distinct sense of humor,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.800
but its writing was surprisingly ahead of its time,
along with other shows like Duckman and Simpsons.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.500
Yes, really.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.700
Based in the land down under where
Wakko Warner sings the theme song...

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.200
♫ Welcome to the land that's way under, down under ♫

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.500
Taz lives with his talkative family, interacting with his talkative friends

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.100
and partaking in the conversations as little as possible.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.900
Much like the other Warner Bros. shows,
there's a lot of fourth wall breaking,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.600
a lot of slapstick and like I said,
surprisingly a lot of talking,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.400
again, from a show
where the main character talks like this.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.500
Though not talked about by many,
Taz-Mania still had an impressive four-year run.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.200
It had good animation, good timing

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.300
and actors who had to talk a surprising mouthful
for a show about a Tasmanian Devil.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.600
Ferociously intense, not that he's likely to make much progress, given his choice of methodology.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.500
Got a house to show, a career seminar to attend,
some charity work to do and a dinner party to prepare,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.200
so my schedule's pretty much open.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.200
It's so strange this would be both
as funny and as worthy as it is,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.600
but maybe that's part of a bigger joke in general.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.600
That the most dialogue-focused slapstick
children's show was around this guy.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.200
Shall we pause to consider this irony ?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.000
Maybe later.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.600
Sadly, there's only a few DVD releases of this show ;
it honestly deserves a lot more.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.900
The episodes you can find, though, are a ton of laughs

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.000
and had a lot more work put into them
than they probably deserved.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.500
To put it short, Taz-Mania is a heck of a spin.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.300

Oh, Tiny Toons is up next.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.200
But what did that have to do with it ?

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.660
Because that scene always bothered me.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.680
It wasn't on Nickelodeon, it was on Fox Kids.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.100
And they didn't do stuff like sing The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.900

I never had an outlet to talk about that clip
and it always bothered me.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.780
It always bothered me.
They got so many things wrong about that clip.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.800

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.320
It's not your fault.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.740
I know.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.780
It's not your fault.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.800
Don't do this to me, man.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.720
It's not your fault.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.460
Don't do this to me, man ! Not you, not you, man !

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.260
It's not your fault.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.700
Stop it, not you !

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.420
It's not your fault-

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.200
Tiny Toons.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.900
♫ We're tiny ! We're toony ! ♫
♫ We're all a little loony ! ♫

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.000
Though having a very successful run in syndication,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.300
Fox Kids bought Tiny Toons
and ran it from its third season on.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.500
It was one of the few shows based on
the younger version of popular characters

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.400
that branched out not only to be successful and funny,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.100
but also obtain its own identity over time.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.600
Characters like Elmyra, Montana Max, and Furball
were all very different from their counterparts,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.800
Elmer, Yosemite Sam, and Sylvester.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.100
The nice thing is while in syndication, there was definitely a lean towards being more kid-friendly,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.000
but when it went to Fox, they broke out more of the classic Looney Tunes humor

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.900
with celebrity jokes, in-jokes, satire, a Buster
that sounded eerily close to the Cryptkeeper.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.000
Toons from the Crypt !

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.180
It played well.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.500
So well that one of their most popular characters,
Plucky Duck, was given his own show that same year.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.100
Yeah, so what was that ?

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.000
Its...complicated.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.100
You see, the first episode of the spin-off
was...actually hilarious.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.000
They're acknowledging he's getting his own show,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.600
but he abandons it to try and be Batman
in Tim Burton's next movie.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.900
It's amazing how funny it is.
The violence, the satire, the celebrity in-jokes.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.800
Tim, I should be Catwoman ! You know it !
Look at me ! Roar, roar !

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.300
It had a ton of viewers rolling
on the floor with laughter, it was so good !

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.300
That sounds great, what happened ?

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.500
That was the only new episode !

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.600
They weirdly just started showing clips from other
Tiny Toons episodes where Plucky Duck was the focus,

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.540
so what was supposed to be The Plucky Duck Show
just became the best of Plucky Duck, a clip show.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.400
Maybe this was filler for a show
they didn't make in time,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.600
maybe they only animated the pilot, but pulled the plug like what they did with The Elmyra Show ?

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.400
Whatever they did, it faded quickly,
resulting in only 13 episodes.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.100
Regardless, we still got a pretty funny first episode

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:12.000
and a ton of great material from the original Tiny Toons, giving it a memorable and hilarious run.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.100
♫ It's Tiny Toon Adventures, come and join the fun ! ♫

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.500
♫ And now, our song is done ! ♫

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.660
But not every show gets the attention it deserves.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.700
I know what you mean.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.420
That masterful work will have its day.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.700
But I was talking about Eek the Cat.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.800
In a world filled with Ren &amp; Stimpy knockoffs,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.400
Eek! The Cat was arguably one of the first.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.400
But just like those other shows, it had a similar style,
but still, its own hilarious identity.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.400
The opening sums it up perfectly :

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.280
he has a dream about helping someone,
wakes up to reality, and everything tries to kill him.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.100
That's basically the plot of every episode :

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.700
The world is trying to punish him
for all the good deeds he does.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.600
Eek is always kind and optimistic, always helping people no matter what's thrown at him.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.240
It never hurts to help !

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.020
And indeed, a lot of strange things are thrown at him.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.560
It's a world where snacks can blow up in your head...

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.720
The cereal that pops in your head, not in your hand !

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.100
Cuddly bears are greeted with machine guns...

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.320
♫ We're the Squishy Bears, and we're right over here- ♫

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.680
And Ross Perot was commander-in-chief.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.100
Back when THAT was the craziest person
who could be President.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.560
There was a mean-spirited creativity to it that was held together by just how gentle and helping Eek is.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.820
Hey, no swimming for an hour after you eat,
you don't wanna get a cramp !

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.380
No matter what, he always wanted to help,
even if it meant getting pummeled.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.440
Well, at least the beautiful
planet of Earth has been spared

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.620
and those bad aliens will never do
such bad things again, and

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.840
someone will be here to get me soon,
I'm...I'm just sure of it.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.480
Hell, the biggest curse word
he ever used was "kumbaya".

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.040
Kumbaya, wait !

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.560
Granted, as the show went on,
they seem to run out of ideas,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.740
so they started putting him in several movie parodies.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.100
They were fine, I guess,
but it was a little odd, even for this show.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.860
To make things even stranger, the timeslot was
suddenly being shared with another show.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.820
Suddenly, it was called Eek! Stravaganza and
half the running time was dedicated to Thunderlizards,

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.760
a series about dinosaurs who were trying
to wipe out a new species called Man.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.560
At the moment, there's only two of them,
and they're constantly screwing up trying to evolve.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.620
I invented this. I call it a washing machine.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.500
I figured it out. The fire washes things, okay ? Watch.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.300
These guys are like the prototype
for SpongeBob and Squidward,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.780
except the sexual tension might be
a little greater with them.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.700
When does the hurting stop ?

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.160
The show was pretty funny, but not as good as Eek!

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.440
Nobody minded too much that
the shows were cut in half,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.720
as we still got our daily dose of strange,
and the show had a good run of five seasons.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.660
Sadly, again, though, there's no DVD release,
hence the watermark.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.720
With the rise of even more surreal humor
and Internet culture,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.580
this really should be more available to the public.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:04.000
It was mean, violent, cruel, relentless, yet, funny enough, had a good heart at the center of it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Eek! definitely needs to make a comeback,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.860
and hopefully, somebody out there
can make it happen in the future.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.400
But there's stuff for dog lovers, too.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.660
Jim Henson's Dog City, for example,
lasted for three seasons.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.580
Based on Henson's short film from another TV series,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.100
the show opened in the puppet world
where an animator created a private eye show

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.980
about a detective named Ace Hart.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.120
It then jumps into animation, as Ace constantly
battles the gangster Bugsy Vile,

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.380
with the help of chief Rosie O'Gravy
and paper pup named Eddie.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.800
As you'd imagine, there's a lot of dog puns in this,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.000
which is usually annoying, but after a while,
there's so many of them,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.400
you're kind of floored so many could exist.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.060
I did some sniffing around trying
to get a leg up in the case.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.260
Pavlov Brand Beef Biscuits !

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.440
Bernard St. Bernard.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.820
Shake paws !

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.820
Not much bark, but what about her bite ?

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.360
Station WFIDO...

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.340
Sometimes, he's one table scrap short
of a full doggy bag.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.640
I'm...annoyingly intrigued.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.580
Like many Jim Henson projects,
there's a charm in how kid-friendly it wants to be.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.080
For example, the animator hates violence, so guns
are usually replaced with rolled-up newspapers,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.820
and when guns do eventually make their way in,
he switches it out for a senseless showdown.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.380
It's... kind of adorable.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:22.440
Diving into unknown waters is senseless,
but is it as senseless as running with scissors ?

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.180
I think not !

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.480
The strange thing is, Fox would do another
dog detective show called Droopy: Master Detective.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.340
What was up with this concept ?!

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.820
They had the same obsession
Disney Afternoon had over ducks !

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.800
Did they just think this would be the next big thing ?

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.900
Did they even watch this show ?

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.360
While Droopy was canned pretty quickly,
Dog City had a pretty decent run.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.300
So, I guess if you're a dog detective person...

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.980
I'm a cat detective person myself.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.080
Dog City is cute enough to give a viewing.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.800
You know, Critic, I gotta admit, these shows are fine,
but they're not really mind-blowing.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.060
Yeah, where's the really cool stuff ?

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.560
Well, over the next three years,
Fox Kids would have their highlights.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.920
They would give us the most incredible, awesome, badass shows any kid's ever seen at the time !

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.780
DAAAAD ! Stop butting in !

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.460
I'm just trying to help.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.200
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends ! Go away !

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.200
Okay.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.800
I love you, son.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.180
Love you, too.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.840
I didn't quite hear that.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.520
Love you, too.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.520
I can't hear you !

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.660
I love you, too !

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.660
Critic loves his dad !

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.240
Get out of here, Dad ! You ruin everything !

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.900
STOP IT ! I DO NOT ! SHUT UP ! SHUT UP !

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.220
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BADASS !  I'M BADASS ! STOP IT !

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.460
STOP IT ! ALL OF YOU ! I HATE YOU ALL !

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.960
I'M NEVER HAVING YOU BACK !
OKAY, seriously, stop, stop.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.020
I'm sorry.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.000
So, even though Fox Kids was growing, it still wasn't
the dominant force in Saturday morning or kid shows.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.820
But year 3 is when all that started to change.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.380
Fox Kids expanded from Saturday morning to weekday afternoons, which was a risky and expensive move.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.300
If they wanted kids to constantly be watching, they needed some kick-ass shows to keep them hooked.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.380
Thankfully, they had little gems like this...

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.740
and this...

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.120
and this.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.280
Now, I've talked to death about these shows in the past,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.440
so I'll do my best to talk about something different
about the impact that they had.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.420
First, Batman: The Animated Series.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.600
After two wonderfully dark Batman movies,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.020
an animated version of the Dark Knight
not only won both kids and adults over,

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.220
but it served as a game-changer for Batman in general.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.740
A lot of writers went on to several other
Batman canon projects,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.340
several characters and backstories created for the show made their way to the official Batman lore,

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.160
and even to this day, when most people
read Batman comics,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.240
the voices that pop in their heads are always Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.800
It's hard to read them without making that connection.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.680
Wherever you go, I'll be right behind you.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.140
A-dee-ba-dee-ba-deep, that's all, folks !

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.760
Unlike other kids shows at the time,
Batman took years to develop,

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.520
resulting in a unique style not often seen
in many animated series.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.520
The backgrounds always started off on black paper
to keep the dark environment of the show consistent.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.040
The characters and buildings had an Art Deco style
as opposed to pulp comic style like all the other shows.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.240
And the atmosphere in general was more adult,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.300
allowing for quieter moments, slower pacing,
and more realistic acting.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.400
There was no other animated action series
that looked like this at the time.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.420
And now, every animated action series
is trying to look like this.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.560
It walked the perfect tightrope between too playful
and funny between too dark and gritty.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.560
It seemed like it incorporated everything.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.180
It felt true to the comic roots,
worked in the adult side of the movies,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.880
had a good laugh at the campiness of the situations,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.060
and yet somehow also felt like its own unique vision.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.600
It's just as good today as it was when it first premiered, and no other Batman show has ever topped it.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.880
Think about it, after all these years
and all the other incarnations that have come out,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.800
no other show has done Batman as well.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.040
It's just as clear today as it was years ago
why this was a huge game-changer.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.340
But Warner Bros. was breaking new ground
with another game-changer...

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.340
What ? I was just talking about Animaniacs.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.300
Oh, I see. You guys think I talked about it too much, huh?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.000
If Animaniacs was a prostitute,
you'd have paid off five of her house loans.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.140
Yeah, what ? Did they save your cat or something ?

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.100
No. But through the magic of wishful delusions...

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.320
Now they have !

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.060
Fine, fine ! I'll keep it short.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.740
Seen as the follow-up to Tiny Toons, Animaniacs was
a variety show that stepped up its game.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.340
Every episode had a plethora of great songs,
memorable characters,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.100
hilarious animation,
but most important of all : brilliant writing.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.960
It was truly the closest we ever came to experience
the fresh comedy of the original Looney Tunes.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.660
They have the great comebacks, the violent slapstick,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.140
the imaginative take on the world
we all wanted to experience.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.920
This must have been similar to when people saw a Bugs Bunny cartoon for the first time on the big screen.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.680
There was just an excitement that
you were gonna see something clever,

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.640
funny, and filled with so much energy, they felt alive.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.240
Along with Batman and Tiny Toons, it was one of the few shows that had an entire orchestra providing the music.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.600
And speaking of which, the brilliant songs are still being used by kids today to pass countless school exams.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.940
In fact, they even keep updating the songs
to coincide with the constantly changing world.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.980
In fact, these songs even went on tour,

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.760
with songwriter Randy Rogel and actor Rob Paulsen singing their infectious earworms.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.760
They're still that popular.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.820
It seems the show was so popular,
that it's even being rebooted.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.080
In 2020, these characters are coming back to give
their take on modern day insanity.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.220
Imagine the shots they could take
with the Internet, trends, politics.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.940
It's crazy exciting to see where this can go.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.560
Will it be as good as the original ?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.120
I guess only time will tell. But one thing's for sure,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.860
we'll always have these timeless, classic,
hilarious characters to look back on.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.560
♫ Animaniacs ! Those are the facts ! ♫

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.780
Now, on to a show I know
I've barely talked about: X-Men !

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.780
Will you two knock it off ?!

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.360
You knock it off ! You've talked about this show
so many times, there's nothing left to cover !

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.060
Oh, yeah ? I bet I can find something new to talk about !

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.360
- Prove it !
- Fine !

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.940
Apparently, it was the passion project of the head of Fox Kids.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.560
Margaret Loesch, ironically, used to be the head of Marvel television,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.700
producing hit after hit except in one category :

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.500
funny enough, the Marvel characters
never caught on in TV.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.420
Every attempt seemed to bomb, including an early version of X-Men where Wolverine was Australian.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.480
Wait, she's not joinin' the X-Men, is she ?
She's just a kid !

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.640
That's almost too ironic.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.140
She went from studio to studio trying to get X-Men made, but they all said the same thing :

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.340
it was too adult and nobody would watch it.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.820
Margaret then went on to be the president of Fox Kids

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.700
and cared so passionately about getting X-Men
a TV series, that she put her job on the line.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.080
They knew if this was gonna be good,
a lot of money had to be thrown at it,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.720
so she took the gamble, but picked the right producers, writers and actors to make it work.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.500
The only downside is, there was not
much time to make it work.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.580
In fact, the tone and animation were so campy
and off-key in the first season,

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.080
that they only had two episodes
for the big October premiere,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.900
that being the two-part pilot.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.220
What the hell do you do when you need months
and months to rework your show ?

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.580
You present the first two episodes as a preview.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.360
Yeah, it pissed off the advertisers and cost a fortune,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.940
but Margaret and showrunner, Eric Lewald, knew
they had to get this right if they were gonna have a hit.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.760
The preview, thankfully, went over incredibly well
and left people wanting more.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.680
So, after a redo of the show with better animation
and more adult atmosphere,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.500
it finally premiered with
no other new shows being put on.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.120
That's right, because they waited until spring, it got more attention because everything else was reruns.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.880
As you'd imagine, the numbers were through the roof.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.480
X-Men was suddenly Fox's biggest hit.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.820
It represented more than cool heroes with powers,
it grasped the prejudice and torture character arcs,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.420
as well as the all-around badass nature
people loved from the comics.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.120
After being told no over and over from several studios and even ignoring advice from Stan Lee

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.880
to make it more kid-friendly, the creators stuck
to their guns and turned in a huge payday.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.280
Much like the X-Men who had to fight for human dignity,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.000
so did the creators who wanted to see
their timeless characters done right.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.920
X-Men would go on for five seasons,
one of Marvel's longest running series.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.960
It launched them into the mainstream more than before, leading to several reboot series,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.900
comic spin-offs and, of course,
a beautifully inconsistent movie franchise.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.420
This was a gamble that paid all the way to the X bank.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.280
So, with those three gigantic hits,
Fox Kids was moving on to their next big-

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.000
Um...aren't you forgetting another hit show ?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.800
No. Don't think so.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.540
Yeah, yeah, one that makes like
a butt-ton of money, even today.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.080
No, no, no, there were no other hit shows at that time.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.520
Ahem !

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.920
Fine. There might have been another
teeny-insy-winsy hit of a show called...

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.960
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.920
♫ Go, go, Power Rangers ! ♫

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.740
It's no secret I never got into this show, even as a kid.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.380
It was just...so dumb

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.140
The same time Batman and X-Men were on, we had...

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.140
About that double date we talked about !

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.000
Yeah !

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.980
So dumb !

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.600
But, okay, let's talk about it.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.380
Because, on the one hand,
it is a brilliant marketing strategy.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.540
Five teenagers-

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.540
With attitude !

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.040
...are summoned by Jabba the fuzzy mouth to stop a space witch named Rita

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.980
for her crimes of bad lip syncing.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.480
They first do a martial arts fight
against the monster of the week,

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.760
and then they grow in size and use giant robots
in a fight against Los Angeles Japanese mountains.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.640
So, yeah, the setup was pretty obvious :
shoot American actors for dirt cheap,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.080
and then cut to Japanese stock footage
from another hit show in Japan.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.560
Power Rangers, of course, turned into a huge hit, which meant as long as they were still making shows in Japan-

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.560
Oh, God, they'll never stop !

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.200
...they could keep making shows here.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.720
Power Rangers was not only the longest-running
series on Fox Kids, but it surpassed it.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.220
Even after Fox Kids shut down, the show still continues to have an impressively long lasting life.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.600
It had many spin-offs, storylines, reunions, callbacks, and tons of B-movie monsters to fight.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.860
On the one hand, I really wanted to like this show.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.840
Because, hey, martial arts, giant robots, killer monsters, that could be some fun shit.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.480
But...

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.060
Guess you finally flipped over me !

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.480
So dumb !

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.460
It was clearly past my time and not for me,

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.760
but that doesn't mean they didn't tap
into something that excited a shit-ton of kids...

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.220
And some very disturbed adults years later.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.900
Power Rangers, whether you liked it or not,
was, and still is, an impressive spectacle.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.000
♫ Power Rangers ! ♫

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.320
But it wouldn't be the 90s unless
we forcibly had to teach you shit !

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:14.160
♫ Where is Carmen Sandiego ? Carmen Sandiego-- ♫

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.480
Thankfully, some shows were better at it than others.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.480
Like Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego ?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.780
♫ Rockapella- ♫

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.040
Nope !

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.180
This was a different kind of Carmen Sandiego, one that was on a kids' computer game that tried to educate you.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.400
That's exactly what Carmen Sandiego is.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.200
Okay, maybe not that different.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.620
The onscreen player always had to pick
two characters to go after Carmen,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.820
and he always picked the sister
and brother duo, Ivy and Zack.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.420
Oh, God ! Tell me he didn't... ship them ?

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.420
It's a kid who's always at his computer!

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.420
So probably.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.200
Probably.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.360
Hello, player. Thanks for picking me.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.800
Yeah, that sounds weird.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.720
There's a freaky-ass chief who seemed to be a mix between Max Headroom and the Genie.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.820
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, you simply must learn to accessorize !

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.120
Regrettably so.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.660
And the duo had to chase Carmen around the world

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.280
to get back the famous monuments that they'll inevitably home school us about.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.180
Okay, listen up, gumshoes, you'll be heading to Holland !

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.420
It's the home of wooden shoes, tulips
and the world-famous windmills !

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.800
On the one hand, it doesn't work
as well as the game show,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.600
because the investment came from having to know the information to get further.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.480
Here, the show just kind of comes
to a halt to teach you something.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.480
He used bold colors and violent brushstrokes,
often slashing at the canvas as he painted.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.600
On the other hand, though,
it did have a story to each one,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.320
and Carmen herself was just as stylish and cool
a villain as you would want her to be.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.800
In fact, a lot of the time, she would leave the clues on purpose, because she loved the thrill of the chase.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.580
At first I thought this was kind of lame,
but then the more I thought about it,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:42.980
how clumsy is Carmen in the other versions
to always leave something behind !

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.480
Here, she's at least owning up to her stupidity.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.480
The show lasted a good while with four seasons, and even though the education stuff did feel a little forced,

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.040
it was still cool seeing
the queen of thieves do what she does

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.160
and I guess help us get a little smarter watching it, too.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.660
It was decent enough for what it was.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.320
♫ Where on Earth can she be ? ♫

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.120
Hey, kids !
What's more awkward than movie Spider-Man ?

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.700
Other movie Spider-Man ?

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.600
Aaaand ?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.880
Cartoon Spider-Man ?

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.840
Aaaand ?

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.340
Other cartoon Spider-Man ?

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.160
YES !

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.940
Riding the tails of X-Men, heck,
even doing a crossover with them later,

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.480
Spider-Man tried capturing the same complex characters and ideas their other hit Marvel show had.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.480
Did they ?

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.260
It’s complicate-

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.960
- No ?
- No.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.600
Spider-Man was great if you wanted
the experience of the comic,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.060
but it didn't segue into an emotional TV series.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.520
It might have been surprisingly over-ambitious,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.060
as every second, it's either explaining what's going on,

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.720
explaining the emotions,
explaining the inner monologue,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.380
it could never take a break.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.500
Then we have to assemble those of use who are left
and go protect the site of the Doomsday complex.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.960
I feel like I'm witnessing a part of this country's history !

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.320
After seeing the beacon, we always assembled here.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.820
I had to crack open a map to remember
where this building was.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.200
How have you been, Madeline ?

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.260
Oh, my God, breathe !

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.220
You guys are going faster
than the dialogue in The Social Network !

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.920
The CG city wasn't a bad idea at the time,
but now, it just sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.060
In other instances, the CG background matches
the look of the painted background.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.640
This just looks like he's swinging into a screensaver.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.420
But those are just little details.
Maybe it could still work if the writing was sharp-

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.980
Anyway, this lizard thing 
is probably just an urban myth...

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.760
Wait a minute ! Looks like I was mythtaken.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:33.780
But again, to its credit, it did take a lot from the comics, trying to cram in as much as you can in a kid show.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.960
I just think it did it too damn much.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.820
It wasn't Power Rangers silly, but it wasn't X-Men
serious either, it was something in-between.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.300
But it seemed to be enough,
as this Marvel show lasted five seasons,

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.180
so I guess it must have made a big connection
with a lot of fans.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.840
And, granted, there were some really cool things to see,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.300
like Tony Jay as the Kingpin,
Mark Hamill as the Hobgoblin,

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.220
Not Topher Grace as Venom...

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.840
And to think, we thought this would be the greatest Marvel team-up we would ever see on any screen.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.420
Power of lightning, strike again !

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.020
Uh, power of web-shooters, get real sticky !

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.720
Sure, these days, it sounds a little corny.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.100
Looking back, it's not as bad as I remember,

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.860
but its pacing is still way too fast for us
to absorb every adventure.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.180
It's got its fans, though, and I can see why.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.400
It was a huge hit, and anything that makes this a little less awkward must be doing something right.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.980
But for my money,
the best superheroes always shouted-

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.760
Oh ! Can I say it ? I've always wanted to say it.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.960
Go ahead.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.460
Fork !

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.260
It was one word. It was one goddamn word !

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.660
With five letters !
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SAY FIVE LETTERS !!!

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.880
This is nice.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.880
While there were comedic takes on superheroes in the past, none were quite as funny or odd as The Tick.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.940
Again, leaning its writings
towards the adults rather than kids,

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.580
The Tick told the story of a nigh-invulnerable,
absent-minded superhero

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.300
and his voice of reason sidekick, Arthur.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.940
You can't fight evil with a macaroni duck !

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.040
I'll be the judge of that.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.300
While the idea for the cult comic went through
several different incarnations in the future,

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.400
most people agree this is the one
that was the most faithful to the source.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.120
They did what many superhero parodies do : adding
a big slice of reality to our comic book fantasy,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.940
but the biggest-punching lampoon is just
how many damn superheroes there are.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.120
Particularly now, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Tick addressed what would happen

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.960
if so many of these side characters and spinoffs
really did exist in the same universe.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.160
This is all the superheroes you could find ?

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.380
Well, it's such short notice !
These people have lives, too, you know.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.300
Though sometimes, the animation could be a little choppy and the timing a hint off,

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.740
The Tick still had original writing
with very enthusiastic characters.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.540
But what really pursued us ?

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.960
Where were we really trapped ?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.760
Come on, Arthur, get meta with me !

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.680
Tick himself is infectiously positive ; he just loves being the hero, but he never came across as egotistical.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.520
He really believes his corny speeches and one-liners,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.540
thinking they inspire people
just as much as they inspire him.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.860
What pursued us were our own obsessions !

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.160
I'm good, you're evil. I'm a woman, you're a man !

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.880
What does it all mean ? Nothing.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.120
He never felt cynical or mean-spirited.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.620
He doesn't think much about what he's saying,
but rather the way he's saying it,

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.820
to a point where even silverware
can serve as a battle cry.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.720
SPOON !

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:34.200
It had a modest run of three seasons and continued to run in syndication, only increasing its cult following.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.840
Though there would be many
variations on this crazy idea,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:42.000
by far the one who came the closest in strangeness
and comedy was the one on Fox Kids.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.600
That's cool, but...

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.520
Can I have a series based on a book series
where the scariest part was the cover ?

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.900
No.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.380
Oh...

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.820
But you can have a show that's less scary than
Are You Afraid of the Dark ?

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.600
Goosebumps was based on the hugely successful
book series by R.L. Stine.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.700
It was wild, imaginative, and not the least bit scary.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.220
Hey !

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.720
You know I'm right. You ALL KNOW I’M RIGHT !!!

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.400
When I was younger, I was always pissed off
that all the scary shows I watched were never scary.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.900
Goosebumps, Are You Afraid of the Dark?,
even Tales from the Crypt I never found frightening.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.840
But, as I got older, I realized
that's not really what they were about.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.180
The intent wasn't to scare you,
the intent was to have fun in a classically spooky setup.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.420
One of these episodes is about
a killer sponge, for God's sake !

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.100
The hokey acting, the over-the-top writing only add
to the B-movie quality that, honestly,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.760
kinda gets better every time I see it.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.700
That doesn't mean they weren't trying,

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.480
it just means it should be enjoyed
on a different level than you might expect.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.520
It's like getting angry if a Scooby-Doo episode isn't scary,

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.980
it's just not what you're supposed to be looking for.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.680
Every show had a new monster or a new scenario

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.600
that would tie into the characters' persona or fears, similar to The Twilight Zone.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.940
Except, you know, laughably stupid.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.400
It took me a while to warm up to this series, but now,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.200
watching it with the intent of having a good time,
that's exactly what I get out of it :

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.180
a good time.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.600
It's one of those kooky kids shows I, weirdly enough,

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.980
like even more as an adult than I do as a kid.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.900
Just for entirely different reasons.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.940
Sadly, though, this is when Fox Kids
began their downward spiral.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.380
Aw, geez, how long did they last after that ?

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.140
Just a mere six years.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.620
That's... stupid long.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.760
I know, but here's the thing.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.400
Warner Bros. was starting their own network
with their own kids programming called Kids WB,

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.880
and when they started up,
guess what they took with them ?

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.500
Animaniacs, Looney Tunes, and Batman.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.740
They even did spin-off shows like Superman, Pinky and the Brain

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.900
and their own little Japanese import that was dirt cheap to make and would run for years and years.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:46:00.000
In fact, even the first Animaniacs episode on Kids WB was a parody of Fox's biggest show, Power Rangers.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Hey, what's wrong with your mouth ?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.580
It's all fuzzy.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.600
Fox would still do well, but this was a big bite for them.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.900
And many of their upcoming shows did well,
but not nearly as well as before.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:15.880
Another Spielberg show called Toonsylvania tried capturing a darker tone on the Animaniacs formula,

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.980
but sadly, the writing wasn't on point,
and it didn't last very long.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.120
I talked in great detail about
Sam and Max in another episode.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.820
It was creative, but a little too unfocused,
earning only one season.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.060
And then, of course, there's this.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.620
That's like summing up the Titanic in one sentence.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.660
I need a full episode to go into what's wrong with that.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.260
Yeah.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.720
Good call.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.040
After that, Fox Kids went the same route Kids WB went :

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.800
importing more and more Japanese shows
after seeing not only how easier they are to put out,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.460
but also how cheap they are to do.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.280
And sadly... I stopped watching after that.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.480
If we were gonna go into this in more detail, we would need people that actually grew up watching this.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.420
Okay, go ahead.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.380
Hey, kids, remember this incredible writing ?

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.740
That's a lot of fish.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.060
They made a show out of it !

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.280
OH, GOD !

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.800
Godzilla: The Series was a direct continuation
of the 1998 Godzilla movie.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.480
It featured some actors from the film
lending their voices to reprise their roles.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.180
Including Bart Simpson ?

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.020
Thankfully, Matthew Broderick wasn't one of them,
but his character...

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.020
What ? Nick...

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.160
Nick Tatopoulos.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.580
It's Greek, ha-ha !

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.700
...did return.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.360
The only surviving offspring of the Godzilla
that attacked New York in the movie

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.160
imprinted onto Nick as its parent, and thus,

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.780
they used him as a government sponsored
Pokémon to fight other giant monsters.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.540
That's so stupid, I'm surprised it wasn't in the '98 film.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:47:59.600
So am I.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.180
The series was received pretty well
by fans of Godzilla, but honestly,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.760
following the '98 film, there was nowhere to go but up.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.360
We did get some great kaiju fights in the show, though.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.480
So I guess I can look past Godzilla's Dick Tracy chin.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.340
I guess it's better than any of the Power Rangers shows-

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.880
And then there's Power Rangers
in Space and Lost Galaxy !

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.400
♫ Set controls to outer space, now-- ♫

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.320
Power Rangers in Space wrapped up the series' initial run and was supposed to be the series finale.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.680
As we know, that didn't happen.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.140
Much to our regret.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.300
I don't like it back here.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.760
What on the surface seemed like Star Trek Lite

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.000
actually became one of the most popular and
well-received seasons in the show's history.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.160
They went much further with character development than they did in most of the previous seasons.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.240
There were decently deep arcs for a kids show that featured the Red Ranger's long lost sister

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.060
being brainwashed as the Power Rangers' main enemy,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.060
and even more multidimensional villains.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.540
There's plenty more to talk about with this season,

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.140
which finished the Zordon era
and ended up saving the franchise.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:06.360
But some of you may just know it for their crossover with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.660
Cowabunga... I guess.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.380
Hey, we have a deal :
no Next Mutation unless he's fully being tortured.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.740
It's okay, just the mention of the idea hurts me.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.060
The next season, Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy,
kept the outer space theme,

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.520
but began a new phase in the PR legacy.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.660
Starting here, every season introduced
a new cast with new powers, Zords, etc.,

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.720
and that became the status quo
for the series moving forward.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.000
Saban's big plan to get this phase going ?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.960
Sword in the Stone in space !

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.920
Whoo ?

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.360
Actually, this season's pretty good, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.160
But I know what you're thinking, "Those shows
needed a lot more Ryan Gosling as young Hercules."

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.160
It's actually amazing how much we weren't thinking that.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.840
Well, Fox Kids was !

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.320
I was thinking that.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.660
Yup. There was a spin-off of the Kevin Sorbo show starring a young Ryan Gosling.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:02.140
I always speculated this was just another
Goosebumps episode he was in.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.480
It is scary enough.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480
What else do you need to know about this show ?

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.640
Well, I think this clip says it all.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640
What is a performance that you've given ?

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.480
Something that you're insanely proud of ?

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.000
My work on Young Hercules.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.500
Really ?

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.960
I had a fake tan.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.700
Leather pants.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.740
Was fighting imaginary monsters, they weren't really there, but I was acting like they were there.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.680
My God ! I think we're all in a Goosebumps episode !

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.780
We also can't forget about Beast Wars.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.820
This was one of my favorite childhood shows.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.160
It traded in cool cars, trucks and
jets for animals, like rats and ants !

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.560
Believe me, it's way cooler than it sounds.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.540
This was my generation's Transformers show,
and I absolutely loved it.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:48.000
Beast Wars, along with ReBoot,
was among the first all-CG animated series.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.440
The early computerized look
doesn't hold up all that well, but for the time,

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.360
it was revolutionary and set the show apart
from most other things on TV.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.960
The stories were great, the characters were great,
it was just a really solid animated series.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.780
That being said,

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.300
YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS, MICHAEL BAY !

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.720
YOU HEAR ME ?! DON'T YOU DARE DEFILE
RATTRAP, TIGATRON OR OPTIMUS PRIMAL !

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.700
For more on this series, you can check out
my top 5 best episodes, right here on the channel.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.700
If my face isn't on it, I don't watch it.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.780
Like I haven't heard that before.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.420
Beast Machines: Transformers was
the less popular sequel series to Beast Wars.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.300
It took place almost immediately after and was dark, sobering and kind of depressing at times.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.500
You know, for the kids.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.720
The change in tone and design wasn't
something anyone was asking for,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.500
but it did end all the stories that started in Beast Wars

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.560
and has gained a small,
dedicated following over the years.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.160
Blah-blah-blah, get to the more hardcore stuff !

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.160
Oh, you mean like... Frank Miller ?

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.900
YEA- wait, what ?

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.620
Yeah, there was a show based on a Frank Miller comic.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:47.620
♫ Watch the skies, coming at you. A hero-- ♫

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.960
Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot was a show based
on a short comic written by Frank Miller.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.900
There really isn't too much crossover
between the show and the comic,

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.660
with the show actually being
more fleshed out than the comic.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.200
Is Samuel L. Jackson in a Nazi uniform ?

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.760
No.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.520
It's a good start.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.560
Rusty is the most advanced robot ever made, with a complicated A.I. and the ability to feel emotions.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.620
He was meant to be the successor to Big Guy,
an advanced robot that protects Earth.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:16.540
However, Rusty's emotional circuits and A.I. are young, and he, therefore, acts like a child.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.660
Rusty needs to learn how to be the protector of Earth.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.100
Big Guy is recommissioned so he can teach Rusty.

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:26.300
Big Guy and Rusty was one of the more complex
and mature shows in the year 10 lineup.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.300
It was pretty interesting and unique.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.000
Although it was never my favorite show,

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.820
I do remember being engaged by it
and wanting to see what happened next.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:37.980
♫ The Big Guy and Rusty ! ♫

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.460
Well, it's good to know not everything
was a Japanese import-

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.100
- And then there was Digimon !
- Yeah, okay.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:48.480
♫ Digimon. Digital Monsters.
Digimon are the champions. ♫

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.320
When Pokémon became a smash hit,

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.840
Fox Kids tried to capitalize on that market and
trend by introducing the world of Digimon.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:00.120
Seven kids at a summer camp are transported
to a digital world, creatively called the "DigiWorld".

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.420
There, they discover they are the DigiDestined,

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:08.180
who must save the digital and real world with the help
of their partner digital monsters or "Digimon".

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:12.980
They are also given DigiDevices, which transport them
between the real and digital worlds

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.460
and can help their Digimon digivolve into other forms.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.340
Say "digi" again ! I dare ya ! I double dare ya !

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:19.980
Digi.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.140
Now I'm mad !

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.640
The show was actually a lot of fun.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.740
Although it never really reached the fever pitch of Pokémon, it was received well by audiences.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.460
Although there was fan demand that the anime
be shown in its entirety as the Fox Kids version

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.800
was edited and changed to fit a more humorous tone than the original Japanese show.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.580
And who could ever forget that theme song ?

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:46.420
♫ Digimon. Digital Monsters.
Digimon are the champions. ♫

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.720
You know, I just got that damn song out of my head
and you put it right back in there !

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.480
Oh, I thought you were still humming, "DuckTales ! Woo-"

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.780
Because of Digimon's success,
we also got Monster Rancher.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.080
Another monster show that was meant
to compete with the success of Pokémon.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.720
Monster Rancher was first a video game before
being made into an anime that Fox Kids picked up.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:09.560
In the game, you used discs to unlock monsters
that the player trains to compete in tournaments.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.200
In the show, a boy named Genki
receives a disc to use while playing.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.600
The disc ends up transporting him to a different world

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.200
where monsters are real and created
by scanning stone discs in temples.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.220
Like Digimon, Monster Rancher was edited
to make it more suitable for audiences,

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.640
removing more dramatic elements from the series.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.540
I remember loving this show as a kid, but honestly, it was a bit bland and basically an overglorified commercial.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.180
So...an anime ?

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.900
Oh, Christ, I hit a nerve.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.500
Fox did give Spider-Man another go
with Spider-Man Unlimited,

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:48.100
a loose sequel to the '94 series, while having
a strange and somewhat confusing plot

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.400
that sends Spider-Man to a duplicate world
on the far side of the sun called "Counter-Earth".

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.000
Normally, this would be like
a parallel dimension or something,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.140
but apparently, that's not exactly
what Unlimited was going for.

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:04.820
Instead, we got a really weird futuristic planet
for Spider-Man to fight Venom and Carnage on,

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.820
while freeing humans from oppression.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.000
Wow, this is making his deal
with the devil almost sound credible.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.980
Due to legal issues, this series couldn't draw
from any of the decades of source material

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.320
that came before it or even use the standard
Spider-Man suit for most of its run.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.100
There have been some awesome designs for alternate spider suits made over the years, but a web cape ?

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.480
Unique, to say the least.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:30.280
The opening theme sounds like it's trying to be Batman Beyond, but comes off like its goofy, clubbing cousin.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.500
Like clubbing a seal, I think you mean.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.220
I get that Spider-Man: The Animated Series
is an insanely tough act to follow,

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:41.100
but Spider-Man Unlimited was a mess from the beginning, both behind and on the screen,

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.900
that is best skipped over by fans of the web head.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.480
And then there's Angela Anaconda.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.140
♫ My name is Angela, hey, hello, ♫

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.180
♫ welcome to my very own show. I'll introduce you-- ♫

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.360
Did any of us actually watch this show ?

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.120
No !

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.460
I can see why !

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:07.400
By year 12, Fox Kids was losing momentum, and pulled back weekday scheduling to only Saturday mornings.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.640
By then, the writing must have been on the wall,
because the following year,

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.900
Fox Kids stopped airing programs and never returned.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:18.620
Though many of these shows would exist in reruns and there's more than enough kid shows everywhere now,

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:24.940
that magic collection of the right talent for the right age group at the right time never seemed as prominent.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.500
Every Saturday morning built
an anticipation like no other.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.760
Every visit home from school
wrapped up excitement every kid could feel.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.980
For a pretty awesome time in our childhoods,
we had a cool clubhouse that lived in our TV.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:43.820
And they told us great jokes, classic stories,
the latest comics, and even taught us a thing or two.

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.600
It was everything you thought of
when you heard the word "Saturday morning".

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.580
It was a perfect experience so much of us
were so happy to have.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:54.200
And we couldn't be more
thankful to the awesome people

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:59.200
who gave us some absolutely wonderful
Saturday mornings on Fox Kids.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:09.020
Speaking of which, we should probably
start getting ready for bed.

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.820
Oh, yeah. I guess we have been watching
well over twelve hours of shows.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.160
So what do we do now ?

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:17.100
Well, protocol says we should be playing
video games past our bedtime....

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.460
Laugh and scream at basically nothing...

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.860
And have deep philosophical talks
while trying to go to sleep.

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.060
Sounds good.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.000
Oh, my God, Duck Season is the best.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.200
Shoot the dog ! Shoot the dog !

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.360
Oh, yeah !

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.100
Will Smith !

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.100
Malcolm ?

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.820
Hmm ?

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.940
Do you believe in God ?

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.260
Believe... or see ?

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.360
D-do you see God ?

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.940
Well, yeah.
I was thinking about that, and it had me thinking.

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.380
What if Bowser's the good guy ?

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.380
Wow.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.060
You know, yeah.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.020
And Mario's really the bad guy ?

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.320
Exactly.

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.380
But is, then... Is Satan Waluigi ?

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.060
No.

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.020
That's just not true. That's a dirty lie.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:18.460
Well, if Mario is the bad guy, then Luigi is Satan.

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.340
Oh. Wait-

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.860
I'm totally lost.
How do we go from God to Bowser ? I missed that.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.200
Video games are...

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.060
...our God.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.120
Well...okay.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.560
It's my religion, actually. Thanks.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.900
Yeah. So, like, if video games equal God...

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.240
There's all different, you know, denominations...

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.220
- Yeah, right, right.
- Like sex...

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.460
Like, Tamara believes in
the denomination of...  of PlayStation, but, like,

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.460
Walter and I are Nintendo-ites...

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.860
So, like, it can be awkward sometimes.
I have a PlayStation, like...

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.660
Don't... don't tell Nintendo, but I, like, I have a PlayStation

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.200
because, like sometimes, just... Get explore things, man.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.540
Yeah, you gotta do stuff, well, while you're young.
You know what I mean?

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.060
I think I'm an atheist, 'cause I have a Dreamcast.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.480
Oh, Dreamcast... Oh, man...

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.100
No way.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.380
I started with the Dreamcast, man. It's fine.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:58:59.880
Yeah ?

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.900
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.040
I don't know, man. I don't think my mom's gonna
let me sleep over here anymore.
