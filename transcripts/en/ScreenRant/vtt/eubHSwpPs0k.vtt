00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.680
There are tons of obstacles the can derail
a movie, and it can happen at any time.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.860
Saying the wrong thing to the wrong person
can sometimes be all it takes to get shut

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860
down.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.350
Other productions are difficult from the get-go,
with cast and crew battling the elements,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.720
and each other over the course of a shoot.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.430
And even if everything goes smoothly during
production, some last minute players call

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.150
“foul” and interrupt the whole game.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.280
These are Screen Rant’s 10 Most Controversial
Movies You Almost Didn’t Get To See.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.390
The Wolf Of Wall Street
When Scorsese sets out to do a movie about

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.660
excess, he thinks big.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.320
The Wolf Of Wall Street is a twisted ode to
extravagance, and crowded with morally reprehensible

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320
conduct.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.559
And while lots of people were blown away by
the spectacle, some audience members resented

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.559
it.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.649
The filmmaker argues that the movie is supposed
to be upsetting.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.949
Not sure what to be upset about?

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.109
Take your pick: sex, drugs, religion, politics,
there’s something for everyone.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.450
The movie underwent massive cuts in order
to be deemed appropriate for showing in some

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.929
countries, while others like Malaysia, Kenya,
and Nepal have banned it outright.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.080
Despite the controversy, the movie did well
at the box office and was nominated for a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.720
slew of trophies come award season.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.460
The DaVinci Code
It seems like there are some stories filmmakers

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.119
are just fundamentally not allowed to mess
with.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.170
Ideas so sacred, they’ve been passed on
from generation to generation and form the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.640
basis of many religions.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.680
Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code shakes
up the story of Jesus.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.969
And when it turned into a full-blown phenomenon
after Ron Howard brought it to the big screen,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.280
some audiences were pissed.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.509
They argued that the film was an attack, and
that- because of it’s popularity- it was

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.950
spreading misinformation on a massive scale.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
Some countries required a disclaimer reminding
everyone that the story was a work of fiction.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.040
While others like Egypt, Pakistan, and The
Philippines had it flat out banned on the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.009
charge of blasphemy.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.460
Jaws
Put simply, Jaws is a movie that came dangerously

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.579
close to not getting made.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.759
And while the final result makes for a terrifying
movie, the real-life implications of the story

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.130
they sought to tell was the REAL nightmare.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.700
Shot during the age of practical effects,
the entire production revolved around three

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.210
robotic sharks named Bruce that were high
maintenance to say the least.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.490
Their internal mechanisms had to be replaced
often, thanks to the saltwater.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.710
The Bruces also had to be repainted every
single day, and sank more often than they

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.710
worked.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.720
The shoot was behind schedule, over-budget,
and director Steven Spielberg worried that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.090
if he ever left the set, he might be too traumatized
to ever return.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.220
Shooting in Martha’s Vineyard proved to
be a challenge in itself, as the community

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.360
has incredibly high aesthetic standards.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.951
Which often left crew members scrambling to
set up and tear down all the sets fresh every

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.920
single day.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.860
Apocalypse Now
The filming of Apocalypse Now was so out of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.840
control that the documentary about how the
movie was made (Hearts of Darkness) is almost

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.500
more interesting than the film itself.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.820
Francis Ford Coppola and co.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.850
fought an uphill battle from beginning to
end.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.920
A typhoon destroyed parts of the set, forcing
delays in the production.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.360
When the shoot resumed after the typhoon,
Marlon Brando looked completely different

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360
than when he left.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.640
He didn't know any of his lines, and the movie
was stalled again while he learned them.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.560
The original lead, Harvey Keitel, was fired
early on and replaced with Martin Sheen- who

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.110
would later suffer a heart attack while working
on the film.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.790
Cast and crew were constantly getting sick.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.220
And the production even got robbed.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.941
Everyone involved suffered somehow, but the
end result is one of the greatest movies of

00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.941
all time.

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:04.740
Marlon Brando remains less-than-impressed.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.340
The Exorcist
Considered by many to be among the greatest

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.840
films of all time, The Exorcist has an effect
on everyone who discovers it.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.790
For the cast and crew, that meant enduring
more than a few extreme circumstances.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.720
The production was notoriously troubled.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.600
At one point or another, the director had
pissed off every single actor, on top of freezing

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.840
them half to death with a sub-zero set.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.210
Studio bigwigs were convinced the movie would
fail and were constantly threatening to pull

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.890
the plug, but somehow it survived.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.490
When it was released in 1973, audiences had
never experienced anything like it before.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.860
People were vomiting, fainting, and in hysterics
because of what they were seeing on screen.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.330
Some groups felt the film was spreading pro-Satan
sentiments, and Linda Blair received more

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.680
than one death threat because of it.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.080
Borat
You’ be hard-pressed to find a section of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.740
society that hasn’t been offended by Sacha
Baron Cohen at one time or another.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.740
It’s his schtick.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.190
The performer is famous for putting his subjects
on the spot, which almost always leads to

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.610
an uncomfortable situation.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.600
The police were called almost a hundred times
during the filming of Borat.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.970
And after its release, the actor’s real
life got even more tense than his fake one.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.560
The majority of the people who appeared in
the movie took legal action against him.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.080
Some of the film’s least-liked characters
were also its most vocal opponents, and tried

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.830
to have the DVD release cancelled.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.130
The Anti-Defamation league even got involved,
characterizing the movie as being anti-semitic.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.930
And the higher-ups in the Kazakh government
were furious.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.190
At one point the film was banned in multiple
countries, but it’s restriction has since

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.590
loosened everywhere except Russia.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.910
Aladdin
Disney has been a constant in discussions

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.561
about casual racism in children's movies,
and there is a seemingly endless amount of

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.920
conspiracy theories related to every move
they make.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.570
The studio has released some of the most successful
films of all time, and have an intensely loyal

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.570
fanbase.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.510
That kind of following, coupled with their
wholesome kid-friendly branding, comes with

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.510
a lot of responsibility.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.210
And according to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, Aladdin vilified elements of their

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.210
culture.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.200
They pointed to stereotypical lyrics and the
white-washing of Aladdin and Jasmine as evidence.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.140
Whereas, they argued, all other citizens looked
“greedy” and “villainous”.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.010
For the video release, Disney changed the
offensive lyrics, but the first round of soundtracks

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.889
still have them.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.380
The Interview
Sometimes a movie makes it all the way through

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.990
production and gets shut down just before
crossing the finish line.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.400
Directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg experienced
this exact thing with their 2014 offering,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400
The Interview.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.200
The story follows a T.V. host (James Franco)
and his producer (Seth Rogen) as they travel

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.440
to North Korea.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.950
After the C.I.A. find out the two are going
to meet Kim Jong-Un, they task the two men

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.440
with murdering the dictator.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.130
As you can probably imagine, when the real
Kim Jong-Un caught wind of the storyline,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.810
he was pretty ticked-off.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.380
And threatened retaliation if the movie were
to be released- arguing that its publicity

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.990
would be an act of terrorism.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.950
Sony databases were hacked shortly after the
incident, and hundreds of internal documents

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.070
were released to the public.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.631
Shortly after, the F.B.I. named North Korea
as the country responsible for the leak.

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:49.360
The Passion of the Christ
Sometimes, no matter how the story is told,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.720
someone is going to be mad.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.210
Mel Gibson’s take on the last 12 hours of
Jesus’ life is no exception.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.040
The Passion Of The Christ sparked all sorts
of controversy, despite his assertion that

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.580
he was remaining true to the gospels.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.680
Accused of being violent to excess, critics
also claimed the depiction was anti-Semitic

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.460
and again the Anti-Defamation league got involved.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.710
Religious leaders argue that filmmakers have
an obligation to treat the subject matter

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.841
with care given the potential influence of
their work.

00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:15.740
In fact, there are entire rulebooks that govern
how religious likenesses should be tailored

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.780
for the big screen.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.760
Gibson has stated that his intention in making
the film was to inspire people, but a lot

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.310
of them were insulted instead.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.330
Deadpool
If you’re looking or an alternative to the

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.169
squeaky-clean super-folk that have come to
dominate the industry over the past few years,

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.600
Deadpool is the character for you.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.210
He’s got a quick-wit and a filthy mouth,
and we can think of no one better to play

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.210
him than Ryan Reynolds.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.150
There’s a good mix of sex, violence, and
curse words- and the movie crosses the line

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.490
in all categories.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.871
While many western audiences ate it up, the
censors in China were not as impressed.

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:47.800
It seems the film pushed the envelope a little
too far, and was banned.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800
It seems he’s not alone though.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.730
The list of movies banned in China is a pretty
long one, and Deadpool isn’t the only costumed

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.730
crusader on the list.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.250
He joins The Dark Knight and V for Vendetta
in the doghouse.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.419
What do you think of our list?

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.169
