00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.450
Studies has shown that, on average, developers produce between

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.030
50 and 100 lines of code a day. And that

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.530
might not seem much. Why, why only 50 to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.580
100 lines of code in a whole day? And the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.350
answer is because coding is not everything. When you

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.020
develop a system writing code is not the only thing

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.890
you have to do. It's not the only activity that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.800
you have to perform. And that's a very important point.
