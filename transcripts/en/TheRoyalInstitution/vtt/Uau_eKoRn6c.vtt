00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.960
Okay Josh do you want to see something cool?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.140
Yeah!
Okay, so I'm gonna light this candle

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.360
and what should happen is the wick burns...

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.100
And what happens now?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.720
It will melt?

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.280
See, it melts

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.000
Oh yeah you're right so once
it's got a little wax around I'm going

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.740
to blow it out and I want you to watch
very very carefully

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.280
After 3.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.360
1...2...3

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.800
You didn't touch it! That's right I didn't touch it!

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.900
Candles are made of wax. When you light
the wick the heat melts the wax and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.140
turns it into a liquid. This liquid is
drawn up through the wick.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.580
As it travels up the wick the liquid gets hotter and
evaporates. It turns into a gas

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.150
The gas mixes with the oxygen in the air and
catches fire from the original flame

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.420
Once this happens the candle flame comes
from the burning wax gas not the burning wick.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.350
When you blow out the
candle the wick stays hot for a while so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.449
the wax continues to evaporate.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.020
This means there's still some gas above the wick.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.800
So when you bring a flame close to
the wick this gas catches fire and relights the candle

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.500
Okay Josh now I've
got a jar here I'm going to put it over

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.620
the top of the candle what do you think
will happen?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.300
It'll go out. It will go out

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.039
Why do you think it would go out? Because the air doesn't come in

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.590
I wonder how long it will take for it to
go out? Immediately! Immediately okay well

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.680
let's have a go.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.260
A candle flame is a
result of a chemical reaction between

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.760
the gas from the wax and the oxygen in
the air when you trap a candle under a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.410
jar it only has a limited amount of
oxygen. When that runs out the candle

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.320
can't burn anymore so the flame goes out.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.270
Do you think it changes if I change the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.500
size of the jar? Yeah.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.372
Let's have a go

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.920
It takes a longer time! That's interesting

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.336
And it goes out slower

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.888
Should we have a go with a
bigger jar? Yeah!

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:50.560
Do you think we can time it?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.700
Yeah!

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.080
Science experiments often involve
changing one thing and seeing what

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.360
happens. We can learn about the world
just by looking at things but scientists

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.650
usually go beyond just looking and
measure things

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.200
Measurements help describe things more
precisely and make scientific results

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.160
more useful

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.640

activity check out the worksheet and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.480
remember you can subscribe to more great
experiments and don't forget to send us

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.800
your photos and your videos

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.320
That is so cool!
