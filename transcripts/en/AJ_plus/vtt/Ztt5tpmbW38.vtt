00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
I'm in San Diego, on my way to the border
with Mexico during a time of heated

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
debates about president Trump's proposed border wall. But today, I'm joining a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.179
group of musicians from both countries
who are coming together to play a

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:26.919
cross-border concert in a show of major
solidarity.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.519
The U.S.–Mexico border is a heavily
militarized area with permanent

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.010
surveillance and enforcement. But on this
day, there are also drums, cymbals and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.290
flutes. Percussionists on both sides
brought music out of the concert hall

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.769
and into one of the most politically
charged zones in the country. The U.S.-based

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.120
musicians are students and members of
the San Diego Symphony Orchestra.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.640
Before the concert, some of them held rehearsals with the Mexican percussionists on the other side.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.200
Today, though, the glaring wall dividing them was hard to ignore.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.100
This is a really
unique part of the border right now

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.640
called Friendship Circle. And every
weekend, the U.S. opens that first gate

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.210
over there for four hours to allow
people from the U.S. side to come speak to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.020
their loved ones and talk to them on the
Mexico side, which you can see right there.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.830
People on either side of the
border travel for hours in order to have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.940
this rare opportunity to talk to each
other and to touch each other's hands, if possible.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.820
The circle is within an area
called "Friendship Park," which was

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.720
established in 1971 by first lady Pat
Nixon as a symbol of friendship between

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.280
the U.S. and Mexico. Nixon said at the time that she hoped the fence wouldn't be

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.229
there for long. It was the idea of
friendship across borders that inspired

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.620
conductor Stephen Schick to organize the
concert.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.959
Well, sound is this great unifying factor, right? And it is, for me, the interconnectedness of human beings

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.459
is what makes us human. And so the fact
that we can't really see through the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.569
border fence, but we can hear through the
border fence, and we can play with our

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.009
friends. The fact that we can play and
communicate through sound, no matter what

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:20.480
anybody else in some other city in the
world decides, is the great message.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.140
While watching, I wondered what the
experience felt like on the other side.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.920
Musicians from all over Mexico came to
take part in the concert, the first ever of its kind.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.940
There are currently barriers along the
U.S.–Mexico border that stretch for 653 miles.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.760
Trump is still pushing for money
to fortify the border and build a 722-mile barrier.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.660
He's said that any immigration deal must guarantee funding for the wall, and is asking for $18 billion.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.840
Meanwhile, in a desert outside San Diego, US Customs and Border Protection is testing

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.800
wall prototypes created by private
companies to see how well they can

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.870
withstand attempts to climb, smash or
tunnel under. If Trump gets the money

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.580
he's requested, the agency will award
contracts for construction to the best designs.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.860
Any changes to the wall will
likely be felt here at Friendship Park, a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.890
place Adriana Jasso comes to regularly.
She's part of an immigrant-rights

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.900
advocacy group that tries to ensure
access for families to meet.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.500
Are you worried that, everything going on with the Trump administration right now,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.120
we're only gonna see a bigger wall and more fortification along this border?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.460
It is concerning this is a political context
never seen before. At the same time, I

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.400
think that what you witnessed today and what we saw today is also a manifestation of hope.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.780
And it's also opening the hearts
and the minds of people who never thought about it.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.200
Billions of dollars go
into making this fence a reality, enforcing

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.030
immigration law, but also, I think today
was a manifestation of those San Diegans

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.780
that perhaps haven't thought about that there is a fence and the fence divides families.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.340
For some of the musicians, like Daniel Chavarin, today’s concert was personal.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.320
Do you have a message to the Mexicans on that side

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.560
who weren't able to cross over and see the full performance here?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.920
I'm Mexican myself, and you know I have
family on the other side as well, and I

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.160
just wish that they could experience the
other side.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.000
Do you think President Trump needs some more music in his life?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.640
Oh, I think so. I think so. Something to keep him calm.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.780
Hey guys, it's Dena and I'm on the U.S.–Mexico border.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.980
Make sure you check out more of our videos in the Direct From playlist

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.980
