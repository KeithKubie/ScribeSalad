00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.860
(Disneycember theme music)

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.100
(High pitched Doug laughter)

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.140
Girl! You go girl!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.100
Cheetah-riffic!

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.180
Did that annoy you the everlasting piss out of you?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.000
Well then you're really gonna hate Cheetah Girls.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.200
The most obnoxious of these Disney Channel films I've seen so far.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.260
Jesus Christ, is this film annoying.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.780
Imagine the Jem and the Holograms movie mixed with the Mama Mia Movie.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.520
Yeah, it's that bad...

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.860
...that manipulative and that annoying.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.400
Look, I try to give these Disney Channel movies the benefit of the doubt...they're for kids.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.320
You gotta kinda look at them from a different point of view.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.700
But I swear to God I have never shouted 'shut up' so many times at a screen in my life.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
It's so ear-grating, so pandering, so...

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's just see what it's about.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.760
Four girls named Aqua, Bubbles, Chanel, and Doe

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.020
yes, that's the names they go by

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.800
perform at a kid's birthday party,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.860
though you would never guess it, because they just sing to the floor half the time.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.860
Like there's a wide angle lens there, and move like they're being edited. And...

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.360
Yeah, it's almost like this is trying to be more of a music video than a coherent story, but whatever.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520
Disney kids fantasy, we'll  give them a little lee way.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.480
Bubbles, ok I'm gonna call her by her other name cause I think of the Powerpuff girls when I hear that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.400
Galleria, played by Raven, wants her band, The Cheetah Girls to compete in this big contest.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.440
Apparently a lot of the winners go on to get record deals and so on and so forth

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.600
When auditioning for the contest held by this teacher that just seems to like to quote other songs

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.580
A record producer just happened to drop on by, saw them perform, and said he wants to make them stars.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.580
But her mother says they're not ready.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.600
They're just kids, she says and shouldn't get attention this fast.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.360
Even though they were entering a contest that would get them that attention, that fast.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.800
After a little bit of an argument, the mother finally agrees and the girls go to be made stars.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.340
But the Big Bad Music Label doesn't want to represent "Cheetah-riffic" Girl Power

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.980
They just want to do what's popular and change their image and their songs and totally redo everything.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.620
But wait, that's not the Cheetah Girl way!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.080
Apparently this doesn't matter that much, though, because Galleria is already getting a really big ego and thinks she's in charge of everything.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.240
No, really, like, to an unlikeable degree.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.440
It's kind of amazing how self-centered and punch-in-the-face-able this character can be.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.040
This causes the girls to kick her out of the group, and thus she has to sulk and think about where she went wrong.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.380
Will the Big Bad Music Company get their way by having the girls wear animal masks

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.960
Because... um...

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.760
some chart somewhere said that was cool?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.880
Or will the girls get back together to use their own manipulative marketing to sucker people?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.340
Okay, so you've heard this story a million times, it's bullsh*t, let's move on to the other problems.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.540
Fifty percent of this movie is just giggling, screeching, yelling, and saying catchphrases.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.300
"Cheetah!"

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.140
"Oooooh"

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.940
"Pura vida"

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.460
"Go Cheetahs" (gasp)

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.960
(bird screech)

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.840
(fart noise)

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.880
(giggling)

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.400
(screeching)

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.760
Oh, except for one dramatic scene where a girl admits she lives in a foster home, and it's actually like, a tear-jerking scene that comes right the h*ll out of nowhere.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.360
Um. Yeah. Don't actually try to be a real movie about the problems of growing up you piece of sh*t.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.760
Right after that scene it goes into them trying on different clothes and looking all glamorous

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.240
and singing about how they're the real deal, there isn't one iota real about you.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.540
You are fake, you are manipulative,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.720
You are everything you're claiming this Big Bad Music Industry is trying to turn you into.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.020
Just because before you do a song you self-righteously shout Girl Power

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.600
No, really, they do that.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.980
"Now you're talking. Cheetahs, Girl Power."

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.400
Ooh she's standing up for girls everywhere.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.040
It's a movement guys!

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.120
A movement about being the independent artist when really, it's all about getting attention.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.140
You are the most attention hungry little pains in the asses I ever saw!

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.140
You can't even walk on the street without giggling, shouting, doing a dance number,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.780
and having a crowd circle around you all applauding because 'Wow! wasn't that amazing!'

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.880
'Hoho this just happens all the time, we're just walking down the street, start dancing and 'Oh, we can't help it if we're incredible!'

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.600
Yeah, f*ck this sh*t. This is all just an excuse to get a band going

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.820
which, by the way, this was a band! A very successful one too!

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.440
So, kind of a dumb question, but why the h*ll didn't you just be a band?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.620
Why did you have to make this dumbass movie?

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.460
Have you ever seen movies based on dumbass bands?

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.040
They're usually really bad!

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
But they come after the band!

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.460
I mean, you can sing, you can dance, at least in that way that's probably autotuned and edited and such.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.540
But, you know, that's the business, I get it.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.400
Kids want their band, and that's clearly what they want here, they want the band, they want the girls, they want the singing and the songs.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.640
But that's not what we get.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.880
We get this loud, dumb, obnoxious movie

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.300
Trying to make you think it's about being independent when really all they want to do is control you.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.080
They want to control what you buy, what you listen to,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.360
And yeah, I know that kind of the business , and marketing, and I've been a victim of it too, and,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.360
even proud of it in some ways,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.720
but the way this one has the balls to mock what it is obviously doing itself,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.040
and not being clever about it, in fact, being lazy about it.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.160
And instead replacing what could be challenging commentary

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.540
with just giggling and squeeing and dumb lines on top of cliches on top of cliches

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.140
all wrapped up in one of the worst endings I've ever seen in these damned films.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.820
Which yeah, let's talk about that.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.640
I'll give you a fair warning, I'm going into spoilers, but, jesus christ who gives a sh*t if any of this is spoiled.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.840
Whatever, you've been warned.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.340
After the girls split up, Galleria loses her dog,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.960
Yeah, it's pretty much her fault, and the dog gets stuck in something, I don't know, a sewer,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.020
someplace he can't get out

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.240
She calls the police, there's like this big major deal about it with this crowd getting together, news groups are there

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.380
C'mon, it's a damn dog stuck.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.000
But of course, the girls see it and rush down to the rescue, because, of course,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.080
the dog will only come out if they all sing together.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.600
Okay, this is dumb enough, but then the boyfriend says 'hey, now that the girls are all together, maybe you can make up!'

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.160
And how do they make up?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.940
Through singing of course!

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.240
And, by the way, this is not a musical. Like in High School Musical, where the songs are worked in to the story,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.160
No, no, they were just singing songs when  somebody says 'sing a song'

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.660
Like, for their album or whatever.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.980
But suddenly she starts singing to her girls,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.160
They start singing back, I'm kind of amazed you can hear each other in the middle of New York

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.540
And hey, since we got a crowd, let's do a totally choreographed musical number on the spot.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.240
How the hell would the crowd even hear them?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.240
How the hell would it be this organized?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.260
Just... ah... okay.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.760
As if this wasn't dumb and stupid enough, they all go to that contest, which appears to be over and they missed,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.040
because yeah, they were getting the dog and everything.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.700
We see the empty theater, people leaving, it's clearly over.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.680
But wait, the teacher comes out to make an announcement that the winners

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.560
What, what, wait a minute, it's clearly over, there's nobody in the theater, what the, why are you announcing the winners now?

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.200
But screw that it gets dumber, the winners are the Cheetah Girls!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.080
For that dance they just did outside, even though they didn't make the competition, and they didn't enter

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.580
Euh, they win!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.600
Yeah, sorry all the other groups that worked really hard and got the sound equipment together and showed up on time

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.100
You know, stuff that... musicians are supposed to do?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.100
All your responsibility doesn't mean shit

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.840
because these four little idiots did a dance in the back.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.180
Mainly because one of those idiots lost her dog and the other idiots came together

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.880
to say 'hey, we were all idiots'

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.260
You are all idiots! You're idiotic idiot idiots!

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.580
(deep sigh) Why wasn't this just a band? It would have been fine!

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.120
This is a terrible kid's film. It's insulting, it's degrading.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.360
There is so little passion or need to actually give you a story, or characters, or meaning.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.360
It is just an excuse for a controlled industry to advertise their band,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.700
while saying a controlled industry advertising their band is bad somehow.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.540
This one was tough, guys. It was so hard to get through.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.060
You can have your fluff, you can have your junk food, but, even junk food has to taste good!

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.440
This just tastes like a screeching slap in the face,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.120
trying to pretend it has a meaningful message.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.600
(sigh) If you grew up with it, great. We all know why you watched it.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.340
You watched it to hear the songs and see them dance and find a reason to go see their concerts.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.560
Okay, cool. I'm sure their concerts were fine.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.240
It's debatable whether or not this is so manipulative that it's bad for kids, I would actually make an argument that it is.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.600
But I've seen kids films that had much worse messages and done in far worse ways.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.660
But as Disney Channel movies go, this is the one to beat for hatred.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.140
I couldn't stand it.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.220
I hated every embarrassing, humiliating, ear-bleeding moment of it.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.300
If you want a better experience of it, buy their CD's, listen to their songs. That's what they're meant to be doing.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.740
But if you want an actual good kid's movie?

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.680
I say throw this hunk of dead meat to the cheetahs.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.120
(Cheetah Girls theme)
