00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.220
Now going back to our mani-core challenges we have

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.870
seen that the number of cores as it grows

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
makes the coherence traffic grow and we looked at

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.190
solutions to deal with that. We then looked at

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.180
the problem of the off-chip traffic also growing with

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.680
the number of cores. And we just saw that

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.120
a large shared but distributed last level cache can

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.170
help with this problem. The next problem we face

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.598
is that the coherence directory that we need is just way too large to fit

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:36.150
on-chip. Because we have a scalable on-chip network and no longer a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.340
bus, we need directory coherence. But a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.820
traditional directory has one entry for each

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.680
possible memory block. The memory can be

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.410
many gigabytes in size. That might require

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.130
even billions of directory entries and that won't fit

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.750
on chip. So how do we deal with that problem?
