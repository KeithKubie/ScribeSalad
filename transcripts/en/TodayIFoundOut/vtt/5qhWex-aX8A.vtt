00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:15.009
Have you 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.680
ever sat next to a woman on a bus who lost
her sense of smell? Or, at least, you assume

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.980
so as the eye-watering fragrance wafting from
her perfume is so overpowering that the nausea

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.980
it induces makes you appreciate the subtle
scent of a dryer sheet… If so, you might

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.680
wonder, what causes a person to become blind
to their own smell?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.620
Technically referred to as olfactory fatigue,
olfactory habituation, or odor adaptation,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.460
being “nose-blind” might appear to be
something of a defect, but the ability to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.480
have the scent of a specific fragrance (such
as your own) dwindle over time is very beneficial.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.970
Imagine tip-toeing through the tulips, enjoying
the lovely aroma around you along with your

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.120
own equally lovely stench. If these smells
didn’t diminish over time, you might miss

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.831
the new smell of a cougar about to use you
as a tasty meal. Or, perhaps you’re the

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.930
hunter and are trying to pick up the scent
of your prey. In these sorts of scenarios

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.990
that our sweaty, hunter-gatherer ancestors
with deodorantless armpits frequently found

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.850
themselves in, scanning for new smells was
much more useful than continuing to experience

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.610
their own. The drawback is, of course, in
more modern times perfume-Peggy doesn’t

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.320
realize the overpowering nature of her cougar-scent…

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.660
But how does this work?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.450
To begin with, in the back of your nasal cavity,
about 2 ¾ inches or 7 centimeters above and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.230
behind your nostrils, lies a special grouping
of cells called olfactory epithelium. These

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.450
cells are attached to the olfactory bulb within
the brain by olfactory neurons. At the end

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.420
of each neuron lies a receptor cell. When
microscopic molecules circulating within the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
air or molecules broken down in the act of
chewing your food come into contact with a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.830
receptor cell, they attach. The process is
called protein-ligand binding. Once attached,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.549
it will cause an electrical signal to be transmitted
down the neuron to your brain. The signal

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.770
your brain receives gives us the perception
of smell.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.810
There are around 350 genes (from the nearly
1,000 olfactory genes) that make olfactory

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.370
receptors. Each gene produces a different
type of receptor. Each specific receptor will

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.140
react to a specific group of structurally
similar molecules- molecules from coffee,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.670
tomatoes, or Peggy’s generously applied
perfume, for example. A combination of several

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.860
different receptors being activated will also
be perceived as a different type of smell.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.170
In this way, your body can distinguish countless
number of different odors.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.060
(And note: it was once thought that humans
were only able to recognize around 10,000

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.930
different fragrances. Dr. Leslie Vosshall
and her colleagues at Rockefeller University,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.660
however, have recently shown humans are actually
able to detect at least 1 trillion different

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.890
smells, and this number might be too low by
a long shot. Dr. Vosshall’s study only used

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.160
128 different types of odor molecules to achieve
the nearly 1 trillion different sensations

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.060
of smell. She points out that there are many
more odor compounds found in nature than just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.780
the 128 she used.)

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.090
In any event, now that we know how our brains
perceive smell, we can better understand olfactory

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.849
fatigue. When an odor molecule attaches to
a specific protein on a receptor cell (guanine

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.550
nucleotide protein-coupled receptors), it
causes a rush of sodium and calcium into the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.989
cell. This will create an electrical differential
across the cell membrane that creates the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.840
impulse your brain perceives (depolarization).
This rush of sodium and calcium (ions) goes

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.160
through pathways known as CNG channels (cyclic
nucleotide-gated ion channels).

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.080
The rapid influx of calcium will begin a cascade
of chemistry that causes CNG channels to close.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.110
Once closed, similar odor molecules will be
unable to activate the receptor and it will

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.520
no longer send the electrical signal for the
brain to perceive as smell. Specifically,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.940
the CNG channels associated with olfactory
adaptation are CNGA4 and CNGB1b.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.330
And for those who like the ultra-technical
description, Dr.’s Jonathan Bradley, Dirk

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.600
Reuter and Stephan Frings in their 2001 report
published in the journal Science, explain:

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.230
We find that only in the presence of CNGA4
and CNGB1b, the two modulatory CNG subunits

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.799
of the olfactory CNG channel, can Ca2+-CaM
bind rapidly to the open state…… In ORNs,

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.960
where CNG channels reach high levels ofP o,
the CNGA4 subunit facilitates Ca2+-CaM binding

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.910
to open channels and, hence, transforms the
negative feedback by Ca2+-CaM into the rapid

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.870
and state-independent control mechanism that
is needed for olfactory adaptation…

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.650
So, in more layman’s terms, olfactory fatigue
occurs such that when you sense a specific

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.180
odor, the receptors associated with that molecule
can no longer be stimulated by similar molecules

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.059
because the channels that create the electrical
impulse will ultimately close. The result

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.220
leaves only receptors that get stimulated
by other molecules (different types of odors)-

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.949
thus, your propensity to sense new smells
more strongly, and the ones you get consistently

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.800
bombarded with eventually no longer being
detected at all. Congratulations, you’re

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.210
now nose-blind.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.669
This brings up the question of how one can
rapidly reverse the effect of nose-blindness?

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.909
Well, this is easier said than done reliably.

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.619
You might have seen that perfume shops often
have bowls of coffee beans that they say will

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:26.810
help reset your nose- a nasal-palate-cleanser
so to speak. The theory behind this seems

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.650
legitimate. If attached odor molecules cause
nose-blindness, simply knock off those molecules

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.330
and you should be good as new. There are around
28 different types of molecules associated

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.379
with coffee odors. If one or more of these
odorants are stronger than the ones causing

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.309
the nose to be blind, then maybe they will
help reset the neurons.

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:48.020
Unfortunately for perfume shop coffee bean
suppliers, studies on the effectiveness of

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.319
coffee on odor adaptation have shown that
coffee is no better at reducing the effects

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.949
of olfactory fatigue than simply taking in
a deep breath of fresh air.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.270
Another theory on reversing olfactory fatigue
revolves around returning your olfactory receptors

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.219
to their baseline, namely, the smell of your
own skin. You achieve this by inhaling unscented

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.529
portions of your skin. Once the system is
more or less “reset,” this should allow

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.889
for the new smell to be better perceived.

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.820
While this oft’ suggested method seems reasonable
enough, unfortunately, there doesn’t seem

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.169
to be any studies looking at how well this
works, or if it actually works at all. You

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.440
will, however, find countless anecdotal accounts
advocating for its effectiveness.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.650
In the end, being nose-blind can be both helpful,
as in the case of filtering out your own garlic

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.509
breath (see: Why Does Garlic Make Your Breath
Smell Bad?) so you don’t have to smell it,

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.969
or annoying, as in the case of other people
having to smell your garlic breath because

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.860
you aren’t aware of it… or on a similar
note, perfume-Peggy and her incessant need

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.729
to bath in Chanel #5 because she’s become
immune to the scent. And if you want to reverse

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.800
the effect to actually be able to smell a
noxious odor about yourself (so-as not to

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.319
become perfume-Peggy or garlic-Greg), unfortunately,
it appears at least for now that there isn’t

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.819
any scientific silver bullet method to reliably
achieve this.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.689
This once again leaves us with the age-old
method of just asking someone nearby, “Do

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:05.550
I smell bad?” and hope they ignore normal
social graces and answer honestly. Perhaps

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:29.270
in future our robotic personal assistants
will have the necessary sensors built in to

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:41.759
be able to help us out there without concern
for committing a social faux pas.
