00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.800
&gt;&gt; Welcome back. It's great to see you again.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.315
&gt;&gt; Welcome back. It's great to see you again.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.270
&gt;&gt; Today we'll be talking about repetition.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.695
&gt;&gt; Today we'll be talking about repetition.

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:10.629
&gt;&gt; Many programs do the same types of actions over and over again. For example, if

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.424
you're working with a big piece of data, your program will repeatedly read and

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.625
process each piece of the input.

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:18.555
&gt;&gt; I really like to write programs that do this.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.622
&gt;&gt; Because it means that I don't have to do the same thing over and over. The

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.976
computer does it for me. Let's get started learning how to do this.

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.252
&gt;&gt; Let's get started learning how to do this.
