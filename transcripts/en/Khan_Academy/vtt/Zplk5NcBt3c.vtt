00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.820
We're on problem 115.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.450
Mary's income is 60% more
than Tim's income.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.650
So that's 1.6 times
Tim's income.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.920
You could write it as Tim's
income plus 60% of Tim's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
income, but hopefully it's
second nature that this is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.170
just 1.6 times Tim's income.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.270
So if Mary's income is equal to
1.6 times Tim's income, and

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.430
Tim's income is 40% percent
less than Juan's income.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.070
So Tim's income, if it's 40%
less than Juan's income, that

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.560
means that it's 60%
of Juan's income.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.110
You can do that as Juan's income
minus 40% percent of

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.230
Juan's income.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.920
That's 0.6 times
Juan's income.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.850
What percentage of Juan's
income is Mary's income?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.540
So let's just do a little
substitution.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.230
Substitute this T over here.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:07.150
So you get Mary is equal to
1.6 times 0.6 times Juan.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.820
And then what's 6 times 16?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.770
60 plus 36.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.470
96.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.090
We have 2 numbers to the
right of the decimal.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.860
So it's 0.96 times
Juan's income.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.700
So what are they asking?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.910
What percentage of Juan's
income is Mary's income?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.280
Mary's income is 96%
of Juan's income.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.820
And that's choice C.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.110
0.96 is 96% of.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.350
Problem 116.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.470
Looks like something
I have to draw.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.150
Each dot in the mileage table
above represents an entry

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.100
indicating the distance between
a pair of five cities.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.810
Let me try to draw
this out quickly.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.425
So we have five cities.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:18.870
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.920
And then we have to do
it the other way.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.595
1, 2, 3, and then 4.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.160
They have the same cities
on both axes.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.670
City A, B, C, D, and E.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.560
City A, B, C, D, and E.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.660
And they have some dots.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.030
That's a dot, a dot, a dot, a
dot, then dots down that way.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.730
Each dot in the mileage table
above represents an entry

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.840
indicating the distance
between a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.440
pair of the five cities.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.360
If the table were extended to
represent the distances

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.690
between all pairs of 30 cities,
and each distance were

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.660
to be represented by only one
entry, how many entries would

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.910
the table then have?

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.440
So they're saying, OK, this
is essentially the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.480
case with five cities.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.110
You don't want to care about the
distance between A and A.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.450
They want the distance between
all pairs of 30 cities.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.990
So this is the case when you
have n is equal to 5.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.058
And the reason why you could say
the distance between A and

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:38.010
B is this dot, you could have
also said the distance between

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.800
B and A is this dot down here.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.480
But they didn't draw a dot
there, because they said and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.090
each distance were to be
represented by only one entry.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.120
So they don't want to double--
if this was 5, this

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.790
would also be 5.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.730
They only want to write
it there once.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.670
So relative to 5, how would
we figure this out?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.900
So if you think about it, what
you're going to have is-- no

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.790
matter how big this table
is, the diagonal

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.910
is going to be empty.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.400
You don't have to fill out
the distance between

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.840
the city and itself.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.530
And then if you just continue
the trend that they did, out

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.840
of what's left over, you're just
going to fill out half of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.690
them, because the other half is
just redundant information.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.340
So for example, if you have 5
cities, you're going to have 5

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.830
times 5 is equal
to 25 squares.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.380
How many squares are going
to be in the diagonal?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.880
We're going to have exactly
5 squares in the diagonal.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.480
So you're going to subtract 5.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.700
So you're going to have
20 boxes left that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.740
aren't in the diagonal.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.620
And then you are going to have
to to fill out half of those.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.430
So you're going to fill out
exactly 10 boxes, so 1, 2, 3

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.680
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680
So let's do the same
exercise with 30.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.750
If you have 30 cities, you're
going to have 30 times 30

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.380
boxes, which is equal to 900.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.400
You're going to take out the
30 boxes that are in the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.460
diagonal, so minus 30.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.050
So that's equal to 870.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.600
And then you are only going to
have to fill out half of

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.390
those, because you don't want
redundant information.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.060
So you are only going to fill
out the top half they way they

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.700
did it in this diagram.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.660
So if you divide this by 2,
you're going to get to what?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.160
870 divided by 2 is 435.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.250
And that's choice B.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.390
Next question, 117.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.690
Which of the following has
a value less than 1?

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.630
So choice A is 2 times 7/13.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.780
2 times 7 is 14, so that's
greater than 13.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.040
So it's not A.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.100
B, square root of 10/2.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.620
The square root of 10, that's
going to be 3 point something,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.140
which is greater than 2.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.850
So that's not right.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:11.980
Choice C is 2 over the
square root of 2.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.770
The square root of
2 is less than 2.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.880
It's 1 point something.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.930
So this is going to also have
a value greater than 1.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.670
So it can't be this.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.600
We're looking for less than 1.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.520
Choice D says 1 divided
by 1/2.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.340
That's equal to 1 times 2,
which is equal to 2.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.040
So I can already tell you the
choice is going to be E.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.310
Let's look at it.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.430
So they have 9/10 squared.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.190
That's 81/100, which
sure enough is

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.275
definitely less than 1.

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.890
So the choice is E.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:51.580
Problem 118.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.540
The ratio of the length to the
width of a rectangular

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.920
advertising display is
approximately 3.3:2.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.390
So the length is 3.3
and the width is 2.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.150
At least that's the ratios.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:14.620
If the width of the display
is 8 meters, what is the

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.600
approximate length of the
display in meters?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.350
So they tell us the length to
the width is approximately

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.190
3.3:2, which is approximately
equal to

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.440
the length to 8 meters.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.010
They say the width of the
display is 8 meters.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.580
So we just have to solve this
as best as we can for L.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.130
The easiest way to think about
it is to go from 2 to 8, you

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.530
multiply by 4.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.200
So to go from 3.3 to L we
have to multiply by 4.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.690
So L is equal to 3.3 times 4.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.250
What's that?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.810
33 times 4, or 3.3 times 4.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.980
4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.150
One number behind the
decimal point.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.160
13.2.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.340
So they say approximate,
and the closest one

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.750
is choice C, 13.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:15.280
Problem 119.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.830
The average salary of 15
people in the shipping

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.060
department of a certain
firm is $20,000.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.530
So the average of 15 people
is equal to $20,000.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.110
The salary of 5 of the employees
is $25,000 each, so

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.470
we can even say the average of
those 5 is going to be $25,000

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.390
because all of them
make $25,000.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.913
And the salary of 4 of the
employees is $16,000 each.

00:08:39.913 --> 00:08:44.440
The average of 4 of the
employees is $16,000 each.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.870
That's the salary, but if you
average 4 people making

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.280
$16,000, the average is
going to be $16,000.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.860
What is the average salary of
the remaining employees?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.260
Let's think about this.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.860
Let's try to find the average
of all of the employees.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.420
So if we find the average of all
15 employees, we're going

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.920
to sum up all their salaries,
divide by 15.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.950
And we know that that is going
to be equal to $20,000.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.860
Now we have these 5 guys making
$25,000, so the sum of

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.940
their salaries is going
to be 5 times $25,000.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.890
And then you have these 4 people
making $16,000, so it's

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.760
plus 4 times 16.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.710
I'm just trying to sum up
everyone's salaries up here in

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.830
the numerator, and I'm going
to divide by 15.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.880
And then I'm going
to have what?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.440
The average of the
remaining people.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.740
How many people are remaining?

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.430
I've already done 9 people, so
there's 6 people remaining

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.460
because there's a total
of 15 people.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.310
So the average of the 6
remaining people times 6.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.670
Whatever their average is, times
6, that'll give you the

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.760
sum of their salaries.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.730
And now we just solve for
the average of those 6.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.280
Let's see what we can do.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.970
So 5 times 25, that's 125.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.420
Plus 4 times 16 is 64.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.310
Plus 6 times-- let's
call it A-- 6A is

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.170
equal to 20 times 15.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.430
So what's 20 times 15?

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.370
20 times 10 is 200.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.120
20 times 5 is 100.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:29.380
So it's equal to 300.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:38.670
125 plus 64 is 189 plus
6A, is equal to 300.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.600
Subtract 189 from both sides.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.040
You get 6A is equal
to 300 minus 189.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:54.790
That's 111.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.330
89, add 11 to it,
you get to 200.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.540
And then you have to add
another 100 to get to

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.290
300, so it's 111.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.150
300 minus 189.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.540
And then how many times
does 6 go into 111?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.890
Divide both sides by 6.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:13.800
6 goes into 111-- 6 goes
into 51 eight times.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.610
8 times 48.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.960
18.5 times.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.950
$18,500 is the average
of their salary.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.350
And luckily enough, that's
one of the choices.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.780
That's choice B.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.430
$18,500.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.030
We did everything in
[? thousandths ?]

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.530
so we got 18.5, but
that's $18,500.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.590
