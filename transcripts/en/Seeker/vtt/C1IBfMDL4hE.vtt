00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.610
What can spiders teach us?

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.410
Aside from abject fear.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.440
Hi spider men and women, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
There’s a widely circulated factoid that
claims spider silk is 5 times stronger than

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.360
steel, which is true, in a way.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.700
There are a lot of different spider silks
and a lot of different grades of steels.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.290
Some of the strongest silk can withstand over
1 GPa of tugging before it snaps.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.790
By comparison a steel wire the same thickness
can have a tensile strength almost twice as

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.420
high, but when you consider that spider silk
is much lighter than steel, then, yes, it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.850
can have about 5 times the tensile strength
of steel by density.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090
Not as pithy as the factoid, but more accurate.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.500
The area where spider silk really beats steel
is toughness.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.730
Spider silk is extremely ductile, meaning
it can really stretch out.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.470
That, combined with the amount of force needed
to break it when it won’t stretch anymore

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.410
means it can absorb 3x as much energy as kevlar
before breaking, which explains why Cap couldn’t

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.410
get his hands free.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.470
Obviously if we could replicate spider silk
synthetically it could have a lot of applications,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.170
but we’re still untangling its secrets.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.940
(See what I did there?)

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.429
There have been a few mechanisms that scientists
believe contribute to the silk’s ductility.

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.530
In 2012 Dr Markus Buehler of MIT reported
to the journal Nature that he had found four

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.990
stages the silk underwent as it stretched.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.600
First the thread is pulled tight, then the
proteins themselves start to unfold, the thread

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.149
then stiffens, and finally when it starts
breaking, it does so a little bit at a time.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.500
When the hydrogen bonds holding the proteins
together break, some of them immediately reform.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.450
It does this repeatedly, with fewer bonds
coming back together each time, until they

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.819
can’t reform anymore and the thread snaps.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.009
The protein stretching and hydrogen bond failsafes
are hard to replicate in a cost effective

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.009
way.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.369
Multiple attempts have failed, including one
that used genetically modified goats that

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.649
made a protein in their milk that could be
spun into spider silk.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.409
But scientists have recently made a discovery
about spider silk that makes it’s stretchiness

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.679
more replicable with the materials we already
have.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.499
Scientists at the University of Oxford and
the Université Pierre et Marie Curie noticed

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.200
that the orb spider’s silk is always taught.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.280
Bend it, shape it anyway you want it, as long
as you tug it, it’s alright.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.340
Not only that, but when it’s compressed
it still stays taught.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.510
On closer examination they found thousands
of watery glue droplets along the strand,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.650
each a tenth of a millimeter across.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.980
The glue is useful for trapping prey, but
on top of that it helps give the thread its

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.980
elasticity.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.019
When the the filament shortened, these droplets
would reel in the slack.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.299
When pulled on, they would spool it out again.

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.560
The silk could be elongated and shortened
as many times as the researchers liked and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.800
it would still behave just the same.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
With that model in mind, the scientists placed
a droplet of oil on a plastic filament and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
viola, they made themselves a “liquid wire.”

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
It stretched out like a solid, but contracted
like a liquid, making it a hybrid material.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800
Though the droplet was much bigger than the
spider’s glue and the plastic was much simpler,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800
they still managed to mimic some spider silk
properties, and they didn’t have to use

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800
a single spider goat to do it.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
The researchers are optimistic their discovery
can be used when microfabricating complex

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
structures, reversible micromotors, or other
tiny systems that need to be able to stretch

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
and retract themselves.

Spider webs are fascinating.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.090
Spider sex is terrifying.

head all day, check out Trace’s video here.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.900
Is learning how to mimic a spider web’s

one in the dark?
