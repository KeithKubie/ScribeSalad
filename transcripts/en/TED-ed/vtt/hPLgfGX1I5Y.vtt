00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:16.190
Feathers are some of the most remarkable things

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.112
ever made by an animal.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.422
They are gorgeous in their complexity,

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.361
delicate in their construction,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.311
and yet strong enough to hold a bird

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.357
thousands of feet in the air.

00:00:26.357 --> 00:00:27.940
Like all things in nature,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.562
feathers evolved over millions of years

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.610
into their modern form.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.483
It could be hard to imagine

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:36.609
how this could have happened.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.488
After all, what did the intermediate forms look like?

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:40.864
What good is half a wing,

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:43.272
festooned with half-feathers?

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:44.413
Thanks to science,

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:47.740
we now know that birds are living dinosaurs.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.743
You can see the kinship in their skeletons.

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:54.373
Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:57.790
found in no other animals, such as wish bones.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.333
And in the late 1990s,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.716
paleontologists started digging up

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:03.346
some compelling support for that idea:

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:04.966
dinosaurs with bits of feathers

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.051
still preserved on their bodies.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:08.470
Since then, scientists have found

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.429
dozens of species of dinosaurs

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.308
with remnants of feathers.

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:14.349
Some were as small as pigeons,

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.061
and some were the size of a school bus.

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.862
If you look at how they are related on a family tree,

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:20.994
the evolution of feathers

00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:23.333
doesn't seem quite so impossible.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.339
The most distant feathered relatives of birds

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.532
had straight feathers that looked like wires.

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:30.420
Then these wires split apart,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.079
producing simple branches.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.418
In many dinosaur lineages,

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:35.045
these simple feathers evolved

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.670
into more intricate ones,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.152
including some that we see today on birds.

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:40.024
At the same time,

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:42.673
the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs,

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.259
turning from sparse patches of fuzz

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.218
into dense plumage,

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:49.471
which even extended down to their legs.

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.220
A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.842
that give feathers color.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.150
They reveal a beautiful range of colors:

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.855
glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows,

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.505
alternating strips of black and white,

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.242
or splashes of bright red.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:08.003
Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.071
and others had long, dramatic tail feathers.

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.619
Now, none of these dinosaurs

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.618
could use their feathers to fly -

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:15.712
their arms were too short

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.798
and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy.

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:21.071
But, birds don't just use feathers to fly.

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.760
A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.311
with its forest backdrop.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.558
An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest

00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.027
to shade its young.

00:02:29.027 --> 00:02:31.734
A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:33.152
to attract peahens.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.648
Feathers could have served these functions

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:36.258
for dinosaurs too.

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.627
Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.454
is still a bit of a mystery.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:42.538
But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.072
its arms as it ran up an incline,

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:47.067
its feathers would have provided extra lift

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.787
to help it run faster.

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.174
This accident of physics might have led

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:53.619
to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms,

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.376
which would let them run faster

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.292
and even leap short distances through the air.

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:01.707
Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings.

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:04.126
Only then, perhaps 50 million years

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:06.964
after the first wiry feathers evolved,

00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:10.716
did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.
