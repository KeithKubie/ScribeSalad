00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.880
Please welcome Hugh Acheson.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.270
[Applause].

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.740
&gt;&gt;Hugh: Thank you.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.740
Good to be here.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.740
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.810
I'm so tell me how does a guy from Canada
end up becoming the poster child for Southeastern

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.810
cooking?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.030
How did you end up there and how did this
happen?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.030
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Lost in the south.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180
When I was like ten I lived there for two
years.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.290
My stepfather was teaching at Emory and then
he was teaching at Clemson University in South

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.100
Carolina so we lived two years each place
then I decided to go move back to Canada.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.059
But within that four year time frame I kind
of got exposed to the south and what it was.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.729
At times, I was bored hitting my head against
the wall at the sort of surrounding community.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.329
But other times you sort of revel in it.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.979
You begin to see the food and everything that's
happening and things that gel.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.380
So learned a lot about food at a young age
there.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.999
So I went back to Canada and it was sort of
immersion in French kitchens after school

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.159
and doing all these things, building some
sort of culinary reputation.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.509
Slowly but surely went off to university dropped
out of that for political philosophy.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.579
Good choice.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.579
And then.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.789
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Could have gotten you a job at
Google actually.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.789
[chuckles]

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:40.789
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Sounds right.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.439
Then I continued with that and finally move
down and my wife is from the south.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.609
We moved down to Athens, Georgia so she could
pursue her graduate degree.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.840
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So what sort of really drove the
passion for southern cooking.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.689
You really have become--.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.650
You are one of the chefs.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.380
&gt;&gt;Hugh: I'm a really big believer, regardless
of what your community is, in being immersed

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.380
in it.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.399
And the south is very much community.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.060
Athens, Georgia is very much community.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.300
To be immersed in that agrarianism around
that city is pretty amazing.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.760
There's so many farms right there.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.960
I thought it would be a waste of my time to
not be infatuated with what was around us

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.950
right there because there's so much.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.280
And there's so much--.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.120
Southern food is such a tome-like history.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.760
Other cultures don't really have – other
geographical areas in the United States don't

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.040
have that depth of history that southern food
has.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.350
So southern food is this topic.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.710
It's my endless topic and I can learn about
it every day and just be infatuated with it.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.200
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So was there one dish, during your
time when you were younger living in the south

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.730
or maybe when you got older, that really inspired
you to become a chef?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.870
&gt;&gt;Hugh: It was probably more Northern dishes
at that point because when I was pretty young

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.211
in Canada I was really into the food there
at that time.

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.000
But you know I was just working after school.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.660
I just happened to be working at really good
restaurants.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.160
And you know sometimes we don't even notice
where we are and what we're doing and then

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.630
five years later you look back and you're
like that restaurant I worked at was awesome.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.980
I wish I had been paying more attention but
I was 15.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.480
So there are plenty of examples like that
where you learn.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.870
The cuisine of Canada is not very deep in
identifiable dishes when we talk about.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.170
&gt;&gt; Anjali: What are you talking about when
you talk about cuisine of Canada; no offense

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.450
to my northern neighbors.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.450
[chuckling]

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.540
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Most famously poutine and then tourtière;
things like that, which is a pork pie, essentially

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.480
ground meat pork pie, heavily seasoned.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480
Apart from that there's not much.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.860
But what they do have, is long before the
co-optable terms of 'sustainable' and 'local'

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.910
and, you know, 'artisan' had been widely used,
the mountain range between the Gatineau, or

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.660
between the mountain ranges of the Gatineaus
and the Laurentians Mountains is this amazing

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.990
bastion of food producers.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.970
And that was the food we were raised on.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.130
Cooking a French restaurant in Ottawa or Hull,
Quebec, the guy who shows up at the back door

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.930
to bring your venison, is also bringing you
shitake mushrooms that he raised on his little

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.019
logs outside.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.139
Then his wife, Helene, brings these beautiful
aged goat cheeses.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.430
This is 1992.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.449
This is way before, you know, it was cool
to be that way.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.479
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Before CSAs and before farmer's
markets.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:41.830
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Before artisan and organic was really
a term that was co-opted by the Wal-Marts

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.979
of the world.

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.249
So it was really interesting time to be immersed
in food there and learning a lot.

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.449
But there wasn't that sort of pomp and circumstance
around the food.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.360
It was that's just what they ate.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.510
So going shopping in Montreal was totally
different from going to the Kroger in the

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.510
south.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.510
But I think that's changing too.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.889
But going shopping in Montreal, when I was
in university, there you grab your bags up

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.039
the street in Saint-Laurent.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.750
You go to [inaudible] for produce and you
go across the street and buy rye bread at

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.750
[inaudible].

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.039
Then you go around the corner to [inaudible]
bagel then you buy smoked meat at Schwartzes

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.379
by the pound and you go and buy coffee at
[inaudible] go to the cheese monger up the

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.379
street.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.020
So it was just that very Europeanized idea
of shopping.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.370
And so, food was very much in the psyche of
what we were doing all the time and my apartment

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.860
was always a fun apartment to be at because
that was always the kid cooking dinner parties

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.210
when I was 18.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.210
Come on over.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.210
[laughter]

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.240
&gt;&gt; Anjali: That's not what we were doing when
I was 18.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240
[laughs]

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.340
&gt;&gt; Hugh: We spent our fair share of time not
wanting to leave the bars because it was just

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.400
so cold outside.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.219
But, you know, but there was just that sense
of really cool community in the plateau of

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.930
Montreal and just where we lived.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.330
That area has been really hip for food in
the last five years.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.229
But it's always been hip and they didn't know
it.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.409
&gt;&gt;Anjali: Sort of ahead of the trend

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.460
&gt;&gt;Hugh: The epitome of hipness -- you don't
even know it.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.610
&gt;&gt; Anjali: [laughing] Well so I had a chance
to meet a couple weeks ago down in Atlanta

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.639
and I had this extraordinary meal if any of
you are ever in Atlanta, --or in Athens, Georgia,

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.270
I would assume, too-- definitely check out
Chef's restaurants because it was pretty awesome

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.270
meal.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.270
&gt;&gt;Hugh: Good.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.270
&gt;&gt;Anjali: And yeah I know.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.270
It was really delicious.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.020
I'm still dreaming about those little hot
dogs with the bourbon mustard.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.539
It's pretty extraordinary.

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.219
And we had a chance to chat a little bit about
CSAs and the resurgence of all of that

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.300
&gt;&gt;Hugh: Right, Right

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.960
&gt;&gt;Anjali: and that trend which it seems like
it's more here to stay not a trend anymore.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.719
&gt;&gt;Hugh: It's not longer a trend.

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.599
&gt;&gt;Anjali: You had a lot of opinions about
that how it's being done in the states,how

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.930
it could be done better and that kind of thing
and I'd love if you could talk to us about

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.930
that.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.419
&gt;&gt; Hugh: I talked to you on this book but
I talk in a lot of speeches give.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.879
First, to reiterate the community is not just
a matter of--.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.009
Community doesn't stop; it takes effort from
all of us to make it go and be the cycle of

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.879
economy and culture and sort of compassion
within your community and understanding of

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.570
different cultures and economic echelons.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:19.349
And within that, I think the best way to look
at food is to not to be a full locavore because

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:25.900
I think that's sort of a zealot's standpoint
of -- . You want to take small steps towards

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.840
goodness.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.930
But I think we just need a nest in our community
and buy locally as much as we can and take

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.300
the inconvenient route.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.169
The convenient route is this sort of beige
highway of Chick Fil A and McDonald's and

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.129
the easy shopping.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.569
But if we take the time out of our day to
sort of commit to understanding who we're

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.990
buying from, the names of the people we're
buying from and all this, then it becomes

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.659
a better source.

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:54.869
I'm just in big favor--.

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:56.599
Well, is that sustainable?

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:02.060
Well local begets sustainable which allows
organic.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.139
But unfortunately, the only term on those
which can't be co-optable is local.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.340
Because the other ones can just be grabbed
by anyone to say, "well, we're organic and

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:18.999
we bought into this idea though it's organic
from Chile and the carbon footprint and the

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:23.159
social ramifications of buying from there
as opposed to an apple from Ellijay, --which

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:27.770
is 45 minutes away from Athens -- why would
you buy an apple from Chile?

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.190
So it's just that idea and that consciousness
you go into.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.990
I want to get away from food being a commodity
and food being a product into food being a

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.969
relations ship with your community.

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:46.410
But I don't want to sound sort of airy-fairy
about it either I want it to be really clear

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.310
this is -- it doesn't matter who you are.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.670
It's just a investment in "hey Celia grew
those beets".

00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:00.480
This other couple raises my lambs and pork
and beef at Riverview Farms 45 minutes away.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.350
It's just that idea and that understanding.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.240
&gt;&gt;Anjali: So do you source mostly locally
for the restaurants.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.860
&gt;&gt; Hugh: We do as much as we can and we always
have but, you know, I'm really wary about

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.529
sort of the badge of green restaurants and
stuff like that because I think it's been

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:20.380
misused a lot in the past five years.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:26.120
So, you know, we never litany of farms on
our menu or we try not to be.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:32.420
Where you go Green Dale Farms parsley with
Newport Farms arugula.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.180
It gets to be a little bit ridiculous after
awhile.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:41.540
So I want to make sure, I think that there's
-- there should be natural tendency for great

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.509
restaurants to always be buying local.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:44.509
It's just better.

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:47.130
&gt;&gt;Anjali: As much as they can
&gt;&gt;Hugh: Because they have developed the relationships

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.920
with people and they can guide those farmers
to growing what they want over the years.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.519
They're saying to that cheese monger, "I want
this style of cheese.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.519
Can you do this?

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.920
Can you do an ashen-layer pyramid for me for
this event?"

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.790
And that's the relationship and then it gets
rid of the middlemen and people can be paid

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.740
more and there's a economic viability to things.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:14.120
When we're talking about farming in the south,
it's really hard.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.420
Everything's been stripped from farming.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.660
Every possible savings has been made with
large farms.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.410
But as we go into more organics from tomatoes
from Florida which has been written a lot

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.649
about lately in a book called Tomatoland.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:31.980
The only thing that can be cinched is labor.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.120
So we end up fully exploiting a whole classes
of workers to get those tomatoes off the ground.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:45.079
But if I can pay the same price for tomatoes
without any middlemen, then Dan Miller, who

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:49.220
grows a lot of my tomatoes in Athens, he can
make a living doing that.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.269
As long as there aren't those other ten hands
taking a piece of the profit.

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:58.959
So it's basically, community to me has ended
up being having a pretty good understanding

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.730
of where my dollar is going.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:06.340
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So I think of, you know, the idea
this is obviously very appealing to chefs

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.160
and certainly to a lot of consumers and folks
who can afford it.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.110
Frankly, so if I can afford to go to my local
green market living in New York, then I might

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.699
make that decision although I'm certainly
-- I don't know if guilty is the right word

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:22.650
but I certainly have gone to the market and
bought things that were sourced in from other

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.139
places because I want the mango in February
and they don't grow in February.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.460
&gt;&gt;Huge: And I love mangoes

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.460
&gt;&gt; Anjali: And I love mangoes.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.460
Who doesn't want a mango.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.580
I'm Indian and I'm allowed a mango in February.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.620
It's growing somewhere.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.370
But the point that I'm sort of getting at
is it's also kind of a luxury, arguably, unfortunately,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.850
a luxury to be able to eat that way.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.850
&gt;&gt; Hugh: But it shouldn't be.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.369
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So talk to us about that.

00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:51.610
&gt;&gt; Hugh: It shouldn't be because when we think
about local ideas and seasonality.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.029
If something is local and say it's collard
greens right now.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.920
Okay, collard greens should be at their lowest
price point in season, right, locally?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.630
So the price should be kept down.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.779
But, you know, there's always been a certain--.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.060
It's like people.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.889
People are opening up organic farms and local
farms and in a lot of different areas and

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:19.139
they still want a price premium based on that
because they were disgruntled investment bankers

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:22.910
[laughter] who think they can still make the
same type of wage.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.570
It's like the person who buys a vineyard in
North Carolina.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.839
&gt;&gt;Anjali: I was just thinking that

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:33.080
&gt;&gt;Hugh: You open up a winery in North Carolina,
having not great wine but you're still charging

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.529
26 dollars a bottle for it.

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:37.140
[laughter] Eventually the novelty is going
to wear off and eventually you're going to

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.079
have not so many tourists willing to pay for
your plonk.

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:48.500
I think the new economic realty is having
honest price points for the product of what

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500
it is.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.940
But, you know, at the end of the day I just
-- I never want to be supportive of that preciousness

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.629
of the local farmer's market.

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:02.060
It should be what it once was which was the
place of abundance to sell stuff to everyone

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.279
regardless of class and income.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:08.459
The most forward thinking group in sort of
helping that argument is Wholesome Wave which

00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:10.220
is actually based out of Connecticut.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.459
It was started by Michel Nischan.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:17.820
Michel Nischan was a chef here in early 90s
and late 80s with a restaurant called Heartbeat.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.170
It was in Midtown.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.089
Really health conscious; really interesting
restaurant.

00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:23.400
It wasn't vegan or vegetarian.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.120
It was just healthy.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:31.089
And a lot of it was reaction by Michel and
his family to one of his sons being diagnosed

00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:32.339
with diabetes.

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:36.379
And so, he started a Wholesome Wave with a
number of other people.

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:40.740
Michael Batterberry who was the elite editor
in chief of Food Arts magazine who passed

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.060
away recently.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.740
Just really amazing group of foodie, chef-driven
people.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.759
So their initiative and their mandate is to
get great food on the tables of the less fortunate

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.470
hopefully local food.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.920
Their biggest thing -- this was brilliant
-- is they got corporate and tax dollars to

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.500
match funds of food stamps and WIC dollars.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.100
So for lower income people.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.420
So if you bring four dollars in WIC money
to the farmer's market, it's worth eight dollars.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.209
So they doubled the worth of it.

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:18.010
So that means that bundle of beets is affordable
to the population.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:24.230
Now, the next big thing is they've been doing
a prescriptive vegetable program much like

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.220
a CSA delivering to lower income households
boxes of vegetables.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.610
So if we can get these folks eating more vegetables
then we'll have an

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.910
immediate impact on our locality.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.470
Kids pay attention in schools.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.699
They eat better.

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.339
Diabetes rates going down.

00:14:39.339 --> 00:14:40.339
People are well-fed.

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:41.339
They pay attention.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.580
The money stays within the community.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.610
And that's the key.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:50.470
As long as we don't have this colander of
money leeching out to things way far away

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.449
that don't support our schools, don't provide
local employment.

00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:59.720
I'm not saying we have to be naval gazing
and sort of insulate ourselves and no longer

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720
be worldly.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.720
I'm just saying we need to make sure we're
taking care of our community in every way

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.779
possible and eating is one of the major things
we can do.

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:11.649
&gt;&gt; Anjali: The theme of Community has come
up a lot in our discussions and sort of threads

00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:12.740
through the book.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.720
And we also had a chance to talk about the
idea of community and the community and the

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.720
table.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.660
So where there's a lot of communities building
online through things like Google or various

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.029
social networking tools.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.290
And that that creates a wonderful type of
community.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.850
But is there a way to bring people back to
face to face conversation and community this

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.850
way.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.860
So there is this community in this room.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.379
There's this community out on YouTube and
there's wonderful extensions of community

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:44.990
but what about bringing people back to talking
one on one in person and around the table.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:50.740
&gt;&gt; Hugh: And that's such an age old topic
of saying how can I get my family to sit around

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.350
the table and have dinner.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:59.790
You know, we live in a world that you guys
all work, you know, 70 hours a week and, you

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:05.449
know, your days of being at your apartment
and you guys use your kitchen cabinets as

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:06.690
place where you store your clothes.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.269
&gt;&gt;Anjali: Yeah, it's shoe closet [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Hugh: That's a different world.

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.500
But we're always searching for that.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.630
There's no real answer to having it.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:20.779
It's basically just like people who regularly
come to one restaurant as a point of solace

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:24.149
in their life where it's their joining point
with friends.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:29.310
Let's go there like we do every week have
dinner on Sunday.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.189
To me that's everybody said I mention that
I run community restaurants to people to somebody

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:37.569
the other day and they're like kind of like
a socialist gathering place?

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:38.860
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anjali: You're like "yes, that's what I

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.860
do" [laughs]

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.210
&gt;&gt;Hugh: What's wrong with you?

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:46.880
[laughs] So yeah, my guerrilla restaurants
planning the revolution.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.620
So it's -- to me, you know, I make it a point
to try and sit down with my kids and have

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.899
dinner a lot.

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:55.959
Just because it's the calming point.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:58.699
Like we all group over food.

00:16:58.699 --> 00:16:59.699
History always has.

00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:01.110
Food can provide that.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.110
It's more than sustenance.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.140
It's dorky but it's breaking the bread whole
thing.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.400
And it's important.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.750
And it's that one point in the day where we
can all -- family meal is the most important

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.709
thing of the day for us in restaurants.

00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:23.900
It's the point where the dishwasher and the
head Maitre d' are sitting side by side conversing

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.530
about what's going on.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:30.730
We kind of have a mandate at restaurants that
we're not allowed to talk about the restaurant

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.060
as we're having staff meal which is really
important to me because I just want to be

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.809
talking about other things.

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:39.240
We talk about work all the time like you guys
do.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.910
So to have the break of your cafeteria here
is a wonderful thing.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.289
And I think it's very, very thought through
on how that happens.

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:50.960
You know, we all have to eat but if we can
just sit together and talk about new ideas

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.690
that aren't on the table and different ideas,
good things come.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.030
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Agreed.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.929
Well, so what was your inspiration for the
book.

00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:00.960
&gt;&gt; Hugh: You know.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.080
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Apart from the south.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080
And home cooking.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.039
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Just so I'm from Canada.

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:09.790
I wanted to write the interloper's guide to
southern food.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.409
No, it's just my vision of southern food so
I approach things from a standpoint of not

00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:18.520
being jaded by my grandmother's collard greens.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.250
You talk to other southern people, "those
aren't as good as my grandma's."

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.960
[Anjali laughs] Give me a chance -- did you
try it?"

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960
So.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.600
You know I came from French technique and
background and I can enter into this scenario

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.330
with just a little different sort of viewpoint
on it.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.200
Sometimes I'll read like--, 10 years ago I'd
read like chicken and dumplings and not even

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.500
read the recipe and just be like "let's make
something like that."

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.800
So I can sort of genesis a new idea around
it.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.400
So I can replace the sort of leaden dumplings
with beautiful, pillowy, gnocchi.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.860
And do a brined chicken breast on top of stewed
chicken with beautiful clean vegetables around

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.070
it and sort of reinterpret and re-envision
that food.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.270
Everybody's like, "do you do comfort food?"

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.050
I do comforting food.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.320
[laughter] I don't want to be termed as --. Comfort
food to me is grilled cheese with a little

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.320
pile of ketchup.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320
Don't ask.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.320
[laughter]

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320
&gt;&gt;Anjali: Me, too

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.320
&gt;&gt;Hugh: It was what I was raised on.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.440
So it's a strange thing.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.740
But so yeah -- I just wrote the book to kind
of pinpoint for a home cook, A: my idea of

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.070
what it means to be living in community and
being somebody that people look up to culinarily

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.340
within that community.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:35.190
And my experience of providing a place that
people are proud of that they talk about and

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.390
what that means to me.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.860
And then just this staples, ideas, of what
I do when it comes to southern food.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.590
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So do you have a favorite recipe
in the book?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.200
&gt;&gt; Hugh: You know, there's lots of favorite
recipes in the book because the recipes are

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200
all so different.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.540
I like things like sweet breads.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.960
And I love the Frogmore Stew which is a low
country boil.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.330
I love some of the simple sides recipes.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.070
I love the beet and carrot salad which is
in the beginning.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:06.570
But all I ever want to do in a cookbook and
cooking classes and things like that is give

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.799
people little bricks of knowledge in cooking.

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.950
So then they can rearrange them into whatever
they want.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.799
You guys have Lego everywhere.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:17.260
And to me cooking is exactly like that.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.960
It's like little pieces of technique and understanding
of food that you can put together in a zillion

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.720
different ways.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.360
Some people out there in food know how to
cook like three recipes.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.720
And that's not understanding all the little
bricks.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.390
Because what I want you to do is look at the
recipe and go, "yeah, but I can do this because

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.679
that's in the market I saw this in the farmer's
market and that looked a lot better There

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.929
weren't any carrots but there were beautiful
turnips."

00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:48.500
I want you to have the wherewithal and understanding
to rebuild the Taj Mahal [laughter] which

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.880
this building is much bigger.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.460
It's a big building.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.029
&gt;&gt; Anjali: [laughing] It is a big building.

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:57.640
I do.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.720
Well, the opposite of big would be most of
our kitchens I think in New York.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.770
So apart from shoe storage, they're also just
very tiny to begin with.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.440
So are there any recipes you think work well
in a New York kitchen.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.940
&gt;&gt; Hugh: I think the key in season or even
in winter.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.669
Right now is lettuce season.

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:20.630
You can probably reduce what you spend at
restaurants by 200 dollars a week in New York

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.140
if you just make a really good vinaigrette
and have it in the door of your fridge.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.910
That's that cooling device.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.630
[laughter] And then just have some different
vegetables and fun things like that that you

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.440
can make into a really simple salad.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.730
That with a great piece of bread great piece
cheese from your local deli or local Whole

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.700
Foods or whatever it is you're shopping.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.419
That is a great meal Save some time and effort
in not going out to eat.

00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:48.370
Am I saying don't go out to eat as a restaurateur?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.370
I'm torn.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.370
[laughter]

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.440
&gt;&gt; Anjali: You're saying don't go out to eat
in New York, but when we go to Athens--

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.950
&gt;&gt; Hugh: When you go to Athens and Atlanta
you have to eat out all the time because you're

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.950
traveling.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.399
So those type of things staples.

00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:07.280
My kids are 7 and 9.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.840
And they -- they are not -- this makes them
sound like the best kids in the world.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.500
But they like taking salads to school with
little things of vinaigrette.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:22.730
Clementine like her greens, lettuces with
cucumber and cut tomatoes and pepperoncini.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.409
Kid's weird.

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:29.480
[laughter]
Beatrice like olives and cheese and Salumi

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.529
and lettuces in hers with a little dijon vinaigrette.

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:38.320
I don't know where they came from [laughter]
but trust me they're 80 percent great and

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.289
20 percent like evil.

00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:42.120
But that's what kids are.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.670
So but they're eating really well.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.760
So it's like if we can -- if I can give them
that type of skill set to take for the next

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:56.210
20 years and have in college to A, eat economically
and then B, actually be sustaining themselves

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.690
in a really good way, then we taught well.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:04.330
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Well, so the restaurants -- getting
back to what sort of started this whole journey

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.330
for you.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.180
How did the first one come to be?

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.180
It was Five and Ten.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.010
&gt;&gt; Hugh: I worked in Athens, Georgia for two
years while Mary, my wife, did graduate work

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.159
in art history there.

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:15.260
Then we moved to San Francisco.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.549
Loved San Francisco.

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:18.330
Adored it.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:23.960
My dad, when we were very young, we lived
in Palo Alto.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:30.159
When I was two, my dad was -- I had very academic
parents-- they were University professors.

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:35.020
So back in the day when you could go away
for two years and teach somewhere else, my

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.900
dad used to teach at Stanford and then later
on at Claremont Grad.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.010
So we were very young in Palo Alto.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.950
We had a great pool; this really cool house.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.549
That house is probably worth 10 billion dollars
now.

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:47.570
&gt;&gt;Anjali: About that.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.910
[laughing]
&gt;&gt;Hugh: And we had a great time.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.760
But then being in San Francisco in the second
iteration, it was just like the time of food

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760
in San Francisco.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.120
It was the middle of the bubble.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.330
Things were really wealthy and fun.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:07.880
The only trouble was that sort of era in San
Francisco was, as a young chef, it was virtually

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.610
impossible to live there economically.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.990
San Francisco is the one city it's so wonderful
to visit.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:19.360
It is so rich and so poor at the same time
and there's this clamoring in the middling

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.549
of people trying to figure out how to live.

00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:23.929
And it's hard.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:28.030
After two years I worked at great restaurants
and had a lot of fun.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.640
It was arduous but I learned a ton.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.309
It was just a really interesting time.

00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:37.570
Came back after I got a call from a friend
who owned another restaurant in Athens and

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.029
she was like, "well, do you want to come and
open up and be a partner with this?"

00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:43.240
You would run the restaurant.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.169
I'll sit at home and count money.

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:48.269
So I did that.

00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:51.659
And the restaurant -- people tell you it's
about counting money.

00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:55.059
It's actually about counting pennies because
the margins in restaurants are tiny.

00:24:55.059 --> 00:25:00.190
People are like, "what's your margin?" "seven
or eight percent."

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.190
"really?

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.669
You work that hard for seven or eight percent?"

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:04.669
It's true.

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:09.090
I mean, and a lot of it has to be kept in
the business, because fridges break and da,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.590
da, da, whatever.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.789
So I open up Five and Ten in 2000.

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:17.490
I wanted to bring -- and even then I kept
saying and reiterating-- I wanted to bring

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.650
a restaurant to a community I really enjoyed.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.769
But community restaurant to me meant being
very wide spectrum.

00:25:25.769 --> 00:25:30.380
In San Francisco, you can have like bullet
point precision of a style of restaurant.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:38.260
You know, they do 75 to 100 dollar menu category;
they do six courses with a fine burgundy list.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.789
You know, I can't do that in Athens.

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:44.130
[Anjali laughs] It's 100,000 people and I
have to appeal to a lot of them all the time.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.419
So I wanted a pretty accessible, pretty price-conscious,
and have it be a place where people could

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:53.020
go once a year if they could barely afford
it, then save up, and have their birthday

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.160
there because we're the only moderately fine
dining restaurant in the town.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.970
Or we'd be the cafeteria for people more economically
endowed could come and frequent our places.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.169
So it was a really good time to do that and
it latched on really well.

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:10.240
It did great.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.770
And it was a success in a zillion ways but
never in profit margin.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.000
[laughter] But that's okay.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
We make money.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.320
&gt;&gt; Anjali: And then what was the evolution
to empire south.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.520
&gt;&gt; Hugh: So the second restaurant I did in
Athens was called the National.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.010
One of the things we're really good is retaining
people.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:31.620
And providing great people -- providing great
people a great place to work over the years

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.830
much like we see here.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.990
And that's done in a number of ways.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.530
It's done by compassion and understanding
what people are doing every day; how hard

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.539
they work for you.

00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:45.700
Giving them a sense of ownership of their
day-to-day routine.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.310
And basically everybody was always like, "well,
you don't really have managers.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.570
You don't have a lot of rules."

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.340
And I was like, "yeah, I just want people
to act their age and be professional and take

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.240
pride in what they do."

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.210
So I was the electrician and the plumber and
the bottle washer and the chef.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.970
And I think that skill set in showing people
that I was willing to do that every day and

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:14.070
work 16 hours a day doing that, made the other
people really want to follow suit and do whatever

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.510
it took to get the restaurant off the ground
all the time.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:23.560
And so I think in that way -- I had a guy
who came.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:30.140
He was working in Washington, D.C., in politics,
in some congressman's office and he called

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.200
me and he said, "well, I'm from Athens, Georgia,
but I live in D.C. right now.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.210
His name was Peter Dale.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.470
He's like, "I have an interest in cooking
but I never cooked professionally."

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.470
So I was like, "well, come on down.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.419
If you liked it, you can stick around."

00:27:41.419 --> 00:27:44.320
He worked for me free for a year.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.240
And Peter, later, became the executive chef
in my second restaurant called the National

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.160
after working for me for six years.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.860
He's so quiet.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.950
He's calm.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.899
He's just thinking chef.

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:55.899
He's well-traveled.

00:27:55.899 --> 00:27:56.950
He's really smart.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.919
And these are the type of people we revel
in.

00:27:58.919 --> 00:28:05.610
Normally chefs are so brash and egotistical.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.990
My main job in San Francisco at one restaurant
-- I kid you not, like this was laid out in

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.900
front of me -- your job is to make people
cry.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.900
And that was my job.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.900
[laughter]

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.290
&gt;&gt; Anjali: That's my job too.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.460
I'm very good at it.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.460
Can you tell?

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.630
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Oh yeah, I see it [laughter] But
it was like me at 25 years old making 45-year-old

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.500
men like cry.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.740
Cry, cry, cry.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.740
You think that's good?

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.860
[makes crashing noise] Break it on the floor
type of thing.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.110
I mean, it was insane.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.149
Finally I was like, "I can't do this anymore.

00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:36.149
This is gross."

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:39.950
[laughter] And I'm not going to name the chef,
but whatever.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.380
So I left that job saying, "I don't want to
be anybody's little soldier.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.299
I don't want to be an arse in this industry.

00:28:47.299 --> 00:28:52.470
I think there's a room for this industry to
be smart and compassionate and caring and

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:58.440
understanding and still do well economically
and still be viable not be some hippie dippy

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.410
restaurant of no merit.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.120
We can excel in the industry by changing the
paradigm in how people are treated.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.460
I'm really tired of people looking at restaurateurs
and employers such as myself and being "your

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.740
industry is full of exploiters therefore you
must be an exploiter, too."

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.481
I want to make sure we can put a wedge between
ourselves and them and say "We're not like

00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:20.030
that.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.610
We provide as well as we can for all of our
people and that's what we do."

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.760
We are going to help them and support them
till the bitter end.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.760
So Peter took over and did the National.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.899
He's a partner there now.

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:33.900
It's very Mediterranean.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.300
He's a very, very well traveled kid.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:41.409
He's got a lot of family in Spain and he's
got a lot of family in northern Africa, in

00:29:41.409 --> 00:29:45.059
Morocco, and then over into Syria.

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:47.590
So he's really well traveled on food in that
area.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.500
So it's very Mediterranean.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.960
From there, we opened up Empire State South
in Atlanta.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.840
Everybody was always like, "you need to open
up in Atlanta."

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.019
And it's a big city.

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:56.960
I mean, it's not New York but it's a big city.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.880
It's 5 million people and it's an exciting
place to be.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:07.500
We went into a neighborhood, midtown Atlanta,
that was once very hustle bustle in the 60s.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:13.990
Every person I meet with a beard who's 65
years old are like, "I used to buy a lot of

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.990
dope here."

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.410
[laughter] I'm like, "okay.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.440
I don't really get it."

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440
It's answer interesting area.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.059
It's genuinely at the center of the city.

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:25.049
It attracts from all sorts of neighborhoods
and all sorts of angle.

00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:28.769
And we get a wide range of people.

00:30:28.769 --> 00:30:36.110
It had a great landlord who benefited a lot
from a sale of a certain building to a certain

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.600
large company -- this one.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.170
[laughter] My landlord is Jamestown Properties
who used to own this building.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.419
Sold it to y'all . And they've been great.

00:30:46.419 --> 00:30:47.640
They're the awesome as landlord.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.529
So we have a simpatico with a large group
who is very giving of the idea of we don't

00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:58.450
have the funds to build this out like you
think it needs to be.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.710
Give us money.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.429
And it's very simple relationship.

00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:06.769
So we opened it up as initially as a "meat
and 3" restaurant.

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:11.860
So the old school idea of meat and 3 is, I
go to one called Peaches in Athens, Georgia,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.880
and you walk in.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.659
The wonder about a meat and 3 is, you walk
in and you're in line up.

00:31:16.659 --> 00:31:20.330
The line up is the municipal court judge is
first in line.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.059
Not always first; sometimes he's last.

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:23.549
There's no order to this.

00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:25.649
Second is the guy who collects your garbage.

00:31:25.649 --> 00:31:29.530
Third is the nurse at the local hospital and
there are three of them.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.059
Then there's me.

00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:33.320
It's just this amazing array of different
people.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.381
And it's 6 dollars for lunch.

00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:35.381
You line up.

00:31:35.381 --> 00:31:36.720
And they go, "What do you want?"

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.029
And you pick fried chicken or pork chop.

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:42.809
This is not food you should eat every day.

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:44.620
[laughter] You will die.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.210
Or whiting or something on Friday.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.409
There's always fish on Friday.

00:31:47.409 --> 00:31:57.611
Then you have collard greens and succotash
and mashed potatoes and a piece of cornbread.

00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.611
And that's it.

00:31:58.611 --> 00:31:59.611
You get to pick your three.

00:31:59.611 --> 00:32:00.611
I started this idea in fine dining.

00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:01.611
I was like, "yeah!

00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:02.611
We'll do that."

00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:04.510
I didn't really do my history though.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:09.490
There's another guy who's very famous, who
I work now on Top Chef, Tom Colicchio, Craft

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.510
initially was this same idea.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.710
You would pick red snapper.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:18.410
You could then pick it broiled, pan sautéed,
fried, whatever.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.700
Then you would pick an array of four different
sauces.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.179
Then you would pick what sides you wanted.

00:32:22.179 --> 00:32:23.549
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So you knocked him off.

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:24.549
&gt;&gt;Hugh: OK.

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:27.380
A number of you guys deal with these options
equations.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.299
My dad is an economist and statistician.

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:31.299
I'm not.

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:33.690
Do you know how many choices there are in
that?

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.690
[laughter] It's insane.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.860
So we get these orders the first week.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.080
Oh my.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.940
So many different plate configurations that
it was virtually impossible to keep up.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.630
So we changed it to "it's a meat and three
but we planned out your dish for you."

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.810
You can change it if you really need to but
nobody really changes it.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.759
It went through a difficult two months at
the beginning but now that restaurant -- it's

00:32:54.759 --> 00:33:01.090
awesome and it's fun and it's beautifully
designed and it is really done really, really,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.960
well in a large city.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.970
That is still seeking authenticity.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.000
Atlanta is this amazingly historically interesting
city.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.899
It's got amazing array of people in it.

00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:22.850
It's got an amazing black culture there that's
empowered and artistic and beautiful but still

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.659
there's just this massive segregation that
continues.

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:30.650
And Empire State South has been this beautiful
place, this beautiful natural meeting point

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:35.179
for everybody in the city just because of
its locality just because of its appeal to

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:36.340
all these different people.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.020
So it's been really fun to be there.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.309
I'm hanging out with a guy in the bar.

00:33:40.309 --> 00:33:43.919
There's this artist who has this huge show
at the Hyde Museum just up the street from

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:49.870
the restaurant, named Radcliffe Bailey who
does a lot of art about being black in the

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.300
south.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.390
And they're beautiful amazingly abstract and
layered pieces.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.990
I mean this guy is like renowned artist now.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.200
So if he can be sitting in the bar next to
two secretaries from up stairs.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.390
I seek that mix.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:07.779
I seek that diversity always in the restaurants
that I run because I don't want to be ostracized

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:10.429
or ostracizing to different people.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.000
I want to be inclusive of everyone.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.450
And I think that's what the new south is all
about.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:23.560
We've got this amazing array of artists and
culturally interesting people and academics

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.520
and scientists who were all choosing to be
in the south now.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.679
We choose to be in Athens,s Georgia because
we can go an hour and 15 minutes away and

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:37.280
fly to New York and do what we need to do
or go away on vacation or whatever.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.089
But the sense of society down there the sense
of historical merit that's there all the time

00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:44.869
is pretty profound.

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:46.869
And it's a really good place to be.

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:53.240
And that mostly my culture my community in
Athens just it sure makes us proud every day.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.440
I can hang out with, you know, Bertis Downs
who wrote the forward in the book who's the

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.869
the manager of REM.

00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:05.370
And you know we have Jim Fiscus and Susan
Hable.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.560
Jim famous photographer who's name is verb.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.750
To Fiscus-ize a photo is to do this certain
depth field and he still lives in Athens;

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.140
he's a friend of mine.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.970
Susan Hable, of Hable Construction who's a
textile designer.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.910
And all these people have chosen to live there.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:27.310
And Williamsburg is a great community too.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.950
And you know the lower east side is a great
community too.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.050
I'm not saying it's better.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.349
It's just interesting and it's my community.

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:38.240
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Well, let's switch gears a little
bit before we get into Q and A. Top Chef.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.010
You were on Top Chef Masters.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.050
What was that like?

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.800
It seems kind of crazy.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.380
&gt;&gt; Hugh: You know Top Chef Masters is the
spin off of Top Chef where you're invited

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.849
to be on the show if you're some household
name chef.

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:58.140
I realized I was a household name within my
household and that was about it.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.910
[laughter] So I had no idea they were calling
me because I used to get the calls from Top

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:04.910
Chef.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:10.400
It's a little risky to be on Top Chef because
you're sequestered with all the other people.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.500
You don't have the use of your cell phone.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.950
You can't use your computer blah, blah, blah.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.819
And they're not -- I wouldn't say encouraging.

00:36:18.819 --> 00:36:23.250
But you know if so and so sleeps with so and
so and so and so is fighting with so and so

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.560
this is a good thing for reality TV.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.330
[laughter] Masters is a different story.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.089
We live in our own hotel rooms.

00:36:30.089 --> 00:36:32.740
We can do whatever we want.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:36.400
There's a professionalism and we all made
our careers already.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400
It's good.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.510
It's all for charity.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.510
That's good, too.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.840
I can raise money for Wholesome Wave, Michel
Nischan's group and was happy to do so.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.690
So I go down there and was promptly get kicked
off in the first episode.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.690
Poof!

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:48.910
Out, done.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.760
Then they call me up and through some obscure
moment in Top Chef history I think it's happened

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.160
once before in all the different series of
the show.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.430
I got invited back because somebody dropped
out.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.320
So we go back on and do really well on the
show.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.820
And I get known as pretty much the person
who I am which is this very sarcastic, very

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:16.470
acerbic, goof ball to half of the world who
likes me and ass hole to the other half who

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.520
doesn't like me.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520
[laughter] That's fine.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.720
My personality splits through.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.690
People quickly realize on national TV that
I have one eyebrow.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.230
This is a big issue in America.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.290
[laughter] I don't know why.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:35.060
Prompting me to make mono-brow preservation
society T-shirts for the restaurants.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.800
But you know I had fun on the show.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.250
And I think what I tried to do was it's TV
and I wanted to make sure that people saw

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.460
that I was having fun.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.720
That I do relish in what I do.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.230
That everything -- and I do this at work,
too.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.440
There is an innate professionalism to what
we do and to what you guys do and you see

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.670
that walking through these hallways.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.230
But you're having fun doing it.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:03.920
And I think people are so much more productive
and so much more happy and that is a big circle

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920
right there.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.260
If you're happy, you're productive.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.849
Clap your hands.

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:11.569
[laughter] So if we can encourage that.

00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:16.069
So I don't stop when I get on TV with that
persona, that's who I am.

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:20.680
But everybody else was like serious, competitive,
and weird.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.250
And so, it was fine.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.420
They're wonderful people but it was a good
experience.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.570
That came out fine.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.220
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Who was a bigger pig than you expected
on Top Chef?

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.190
Who was a bigger eater?

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.490
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Pig?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:41.859
I mean, you know, little James Oseland, the
editor in chief of Sauveur, that man can pack

00:38:41.859 --> 00:38:43.810
away some food.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:49.180
He dresses like he's a fourteen-year-old from
Williamsburg but he can get some food in those

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.520
skinny jeans.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:59.089
[laughter] And so, then I went on Top Chef:
Just Desserts as a guest judge.

00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:01.790
I literally went into a sugar coma the first
day.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.510
[laughter] I went back to my hotel room and
slept for seventeen hours.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.130
My body was like, what?

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.130
I don't eat many sweets.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.130
It was totally screwed up.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.930
So I did it next day and I was fine.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.970
Right after that show one of the executives
from Bravo came up to me and she was like,

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.480
or magical elves, the production team who
works on Bravo for Top Chef, "you know we

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:27.099
really like your personality and we'd really
like you to come to Top Chef as judge."

00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:28.619
Which was great.

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:29.830
It's a good timing.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.190
You know it's good for me.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.190
It's good for the book.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:38.030
It's good for the restaurants and my kids
can be like "my dad is that weirdo on TV".

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.869
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anjali: And that's the new season that's

00:39:39.869 --> 00:39:40.869
debuting in like a week.

00:39:40.869 --> 00:39:44.150
&gt;&gt;Hugh: And that's the new show on Top Chef
Nine, which is Texas.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:48.710
So it's Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and bunch
of other places in Texas.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:49.710
And we had a great time.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.500
It was filmed in July; it was very, very hot
there and dry.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.760
But Texas is awesome.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.530
Austin is such a wonderful city.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.540
So we did that.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.569
And we're having fun with it.

00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:06.040
We still got a bunch of finale episodes to
film but it's been fun.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:11.630
To this day you meet chefs in this world,
"you do TV; you're not really a chef, now."

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.110
"no, I do something you were never offered
to do.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.400
What do you want me to say?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400
Sorry."

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.500
[laughter] I don't know.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.580
I have a bad and good capacity to say exactly
what I feel.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.710
And I'm still going to do it on TV.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.710
Yeah.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.220
&gt;&gt; Anjali: So it's great for reality TV.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.490
Okay, so my last question before I open it
up to the audience for questions.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.980
This is a 2-part question.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.890
How would you describe Padma?

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.210
&gt;&gt; Hugh: That's two parts.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.730
&gt;&gt; Anjali: The second part is do you like
me better? [laughter] I'm just teasing.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.980
You don't have to answer that because I already
know the answer.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.290
&gt;&gt; Hugh: I'll answer that.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.290
Padma's great.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.690
She has built a amazing force in TV.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:54.250
And she's, you know, she can do a lot of good
in that world.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.810
So she has the cutest daughter.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.290
Krishna was her name.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.349
&gt;&gt;Anjali: You haven't met my daughter but
that's alright.

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:01.349
&gt;&gt;Hugh: Okay.

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:02.349
She has a cute daughter.

00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:03.349
Not the cutest.

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:04.349
&gt;&gt; Anjali: No competition.

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:05.349
More accurate statement I'm sure.

00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:06.780
&gt;&gt; Hugh: She's awesome.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.540
She's great to work with and is a lot of fun.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.210
Tom's great.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:18.059
Tom is just one of these people who's so sort
of gruffly serious in a teddy bear like weird

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:19.059
way.

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:23.109
But I mean he's the type of guy in my industry
I can ask questions of that guy for days on

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:24.869
end and never get bored.

00:41:24.869 --> 00:41:26.400
He's been through this.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.579
And so I can take advice from him much like
you guys -- you guys dreamed up all this on

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:34.530
your own so you're fine.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:38.250
[laughter] But there's people I love to talk
to in the industry.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:43.450
Emeril Lagasse is one of the judges as well
and then Gail Simmons who is proudly Canadian,

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.670
who is from Toronto but went to McGill.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.710
So it's a small world.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.779
Yeah, I like you better.

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:52.150
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Thank you.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.150
Good answer.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.150
&gt;&gt; Hugh: No.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.890
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Well thank you for this and love
to open it up to questions if anybody has

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:58.890
any.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.960
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Have though got any?

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.650
I'll be nice.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:06.920
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So I guess you sort of mentioned
this when you talked about the meat and three.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.380
I'm from Virginia; I lived in DC for a long
time so I'm pretty familiar with southern

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.380
food.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.720
Was flipping through your book and it looks
wonderful but everything is really heavy.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.180
Everything is really cooked.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.760
Everything is stewed; everything is fried.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.980
How do you sort of square that with, you know,
stuff you'd want to eat every day.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.020
How does the southern food tradition sort
of fit into something you could actually live

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.020
with.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.220
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Hugh: I think that, you know, it's everything

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.790
in moderation as Julia used to say.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:43.160
You know, it is a rich sort of philosophy
of food.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.020
But interspersed with that are going to be
soups and salads that should take more of

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.980
a prominence in a meal than people think.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.829
And on the table.

00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:58.510
But then you look at the use of -- no use
of lard and there is some use of bacon fat

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.710
and things like that.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.010
But everything -- the food I do is generally
much lighter than it appears to be.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:13.030
So I think that, you know -- but southern
food is based around pretty gut-sticking ideals.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:19.410
But I think that idea of southern food takes
into consideration that the sort of Paula

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.690
Deen mentality that southern food began and
ended at a certain time and we need to show

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.220
a reverence to that.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.339
I don't believe that.

00:43:26.339 --> 00:43:27.670
I don't believe it's ended yet.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:33.890
I believe there's a sort of cultural impact
wonderful other communities moving into that

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.030
area that are going to have change on that
food.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.460
There's a health consciousness that happens
slowly but surely and influences that food.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.310
I think it will alter those dishes for the
better.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.890
I just think it's a slow road but I think
you're seeing it.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.770
And I think if you look closely at the recipes
in the book, they're lighter than they appear.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.710
So.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:44:00.840
&gt;&gt; Female #1: What's your favorite thing to
cook at home.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.790
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Mmm it depends on the day.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:11.690
But I mean, we love doing things like -- I
love making soups and things like that at

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:16.250
home that I can then put up if I'm away for
three days and they can continue eating that

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.470
sort of stuff.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.820
I'm relatively simpleton at home when it comes
to cooking.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.099
I'll cook a beautiful dry aged steak or something
like that with simple sides and that will

00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:28.099
be dinner.

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:31.140
So it's, you know, and that's what the kids
like too.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.140
They're carnivores.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.190
I don't know.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.930
I trained them.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.130
[laughter] But so it's pretty straightforward
and simple food.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.100
I love to make grits at home, too.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.100
Simple stuff.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.340
Those are all the things that the kids eat
like mad.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.340
Good for you.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.340
[laughter]

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.340
&gt;&gt; Anjali: Any other questions.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.740
&gt;&gt;Female #2: How do you make your macaroni
and cheese?

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:55.970
&gt;&gt; Anjali: The question was how do you make
your macaroni and cheese, just for the audio

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.750
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Pretty simply.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.920
I usually add leeks and things like that to
it and then just pretty traditional recipe

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.270
outside of that.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:11.280
Simple flour roux with milk, and Gruyeres
and Canadian cheddar.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.700
Simple pasta then baked in the oven.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.569
A little garlic breadcrumbs on the top.

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:16.569
Bubbly-ishes.

00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:18.100
&gt;&gt;Anjali: Getting very hungry.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.050
This conversation is making me hungry.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.350
[laughter] Any other questions?

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.350
Okay great.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.620
Thank you so much chef.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.620
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Awesome.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:25.900
Well thanks for having us.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.220
[Applause]
