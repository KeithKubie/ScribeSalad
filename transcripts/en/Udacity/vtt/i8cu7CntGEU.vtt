00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We have a user who reports that his drawing program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
cannot open a document saved by a previous version.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He attaches the document in question to his bug report.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here is developer Dora.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
She can confirm that the failure actually occurs

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that the bug report is a real bug report.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here is developer Erol.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He fixes the bug and can now properly process the document.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What is the stage of the bug report at this point?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Is it assigned?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is it resolved?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Is it verified?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or is it closed?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Check the correct answer.
