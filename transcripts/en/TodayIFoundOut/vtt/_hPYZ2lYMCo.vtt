00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:21.840
Described 
as “the bravest man you’ve never heard

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820
of”, Captain Humbert Roque Versace’s story
is one that is not as well known as it should

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.820
be.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.009
So allow us to remedy that by discussing how
he spent two years basically being a huge

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.059
pain in the ass for his captors in a Vietnamese
POW camp- so much so that he managed to become

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.829
the first person in the U.S. Army to earn
a Medal of Honor for his conduct as a prisoner

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.879
of war.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.239
Born in 1937 in Honolulu, Hawaii, Versace
was the son of decorated army colonel, Humbert

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.239
Joseph Versace, and famed author, editor,
and pilot Tere Rios, who, among other things,

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.729
wrote The Fifteenth Pelican, which would inspire
popular 1960s TV show The Flying Nun.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.000
The oldest of five children, “Rocky” as
he was known was a smart and headstrong child

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.880
who would later be described by his brother,
Steve, as being “infuriatingly opinionated”

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.950
and “If he knew he was right, he was absolutely
atrocious…”- a trait that played a role

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.200
in his earning a Medal of Honor.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.530
Like his father before him, Versace joined
the army, attending West Point Academy in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170
1959 and graduating with honors.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.979
Over the next two years Versace received training
as both an Army Ranger and a parachutist,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.640
eventually rising to the rank of Captain during
a tour in North Korea as a tank platoon leader.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.290
In 1962, the newly minted Captain Versace
was assigned to serve in a mostly ceremonial

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.580
role with the distinguished Old Guard at Fort
Meyer.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.539
Soon enough, however, he volunteered to serve
in Vietnam.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.179
Prior to being shipped off to Vietnam, Versace
received yet more training, this time to become

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.579
an Intelligence Officer.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.590
As part of his training, he received a crash
course in Vietnamese, a language he was fluent

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.679
in by the time his tour of duty began in May
of 1962.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.070
This, combined with Versace’s fluency in
French, made him an invaluable asset to the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.179
Army and incredibly popular with the South
Vietnamese forces and civilians of the Mekong

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.179
Delta.

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.100
His fluency in Vietnamese was important to
Versace as his dream was to eventually become

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.120
a Catholic priest and missionary to the people
of South Vietnam.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.180
Thus, Versace spent much of his free time
as a soldier there volunteering at local orphanages,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.530
assisting townspeople and securing vital and
not-so-vital supplies to make life a little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.580
easier for the locals.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.910
In regards to the latter, in addition to securing
food and building materials, Versace also

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.080
continually wrote letters to schools in the
United States asking for toys and learning

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.060
materials for the children of the villages
he visited.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.690
A year later, with his tour of duty coming
to an end, Versace applied to stay in Vietnam

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.140
for another 6 months despite receiving news
that his application to seminary had been

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.140
accepted.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.060
As it would later emerge, Versace had decided
that he still wanted to be a priest but his

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.810
decision to embark on a second tour of duty
was born out of an earnest desire to continue

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.580
helping the orphans he’d become so attached
to during his time in the country.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.960
Two weeks before this second tour was set
to end, Versace volunteered for a highly dangerous

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.700
mission to assist South Vietnamese troops
take down a North Vietnamese command post

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.010
located deep in the U Minh Forest.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.810
During the mission Versace and his fellow
soldiers were ambushed and overrun by Viet

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.950
Cong forces.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.930
Hopelessly outnumbered, he called for a tactical
retreat, along with First Leiutenant Nick

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.480
Rowe and Sergeant First Class Dan Pitzer,
covering the exit of South Vietnamese soldiers

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.820
with sustained rifle fire as a hail of bullets
tore overhead.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.510
During the ensuing firefight, Versace was
hit in the back and legs by bullets and shrapnel

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.510
as he stood, completely exposed to the hellstorm
raging around him firing his weapon into jungle.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.950
Running low on bullets, Versace charged the
enemy in an apparent effort to single-handedly

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.160
beat them all to death with the butt of his
rifle.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.370
During his charge, he was injured once more,
falling to the ground and being quickly set

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.820
upon and beaten by the enemy forces.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.480
After being physically overpowered, Versace,
along with Pitzer and Rowe, were stripped

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.750
of their weapons and boots, before all three
were marched barefoot into the jungle towards

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.040
a POW camp….

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.210
Which is when Versace got mad.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.830
For the next two years Versace made life for
his captors hell as they tried and failed

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.110
to do the same to him.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.480
Strikingly handsome with a tall, imposing
frame and a magnetic personality, Versace

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.210
became the pseudo-leader of his fellow POWs.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.790
Frequently tortured and interrogated, he refused
to give them any information and relentlessly

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.100
badgered his captors about their treatment
of his friends and comrades, citing articles

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.940
from the Geneva Convention and using his time
in isolation to think up ever more creative

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.940
insults.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.960
Tired of his antics, in an effort to keep
him away from other POWs, Versace was eventually

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.400
locked inside of a bamboo cage away from everyone
else, which didn’t stop him from boosting

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.720
the morale of everyone around him by cheerily
singing pop songs.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.060
When the Viet Cong locked Versace in an isolation
cage even further away from the rest of the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.190
POWs, he just sang louder.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.410
When they began gagging him so that he couldn’t
speak or sing, he started leaving messages

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.030
of support in the toilet.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.910
Not content to just sit around singing, during
his imprisonment, Versace escaped four times,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.910
each time being captured not long after.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.780
In the first instance, he was so severely
injured at the time that he couldn’t walk,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.590
but instead crawled away from the camp in
agonising pain through marshland.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.340
As you might imagine, it didn’t take the
Viet Cong very long to locate him once they’d

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.780
discovered he’d managed to escape.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.690
Each time he was recaptured, Versace was noted
as telling his captors that he’d do it again

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.380
the first change he got, prompting them to
redouble their efforts to break him.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.950
As you can probably guess by now, these efforts
failed miserably.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.500
At first the Viet Cong tried “re-educating”
Versace, attempting to brainwash him with

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.840
political propaganda.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.150
Versace reportedly spent much of his time
during these sessions loudly arguing with

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.500
his indoctrinators.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.970
Along with inspiring his fellow POWs, this
saw to it that the bulk of his captor’s

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.420
frustrations and anger were directed towards
him, something his fellow POWs were also reportedly

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.960
very grateful for.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.440
As noted by President George Bush some four
decades late, “By focusing his captors’

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.120
anger on him, he made life a measure more
tolerable for his fellow prisoners, who looked

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.500
to him as a role model of principled resistance.”

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.120
In addition to inspiring POWs, Versace’s
tenacity inspired the people of Vietnam; when

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.370
the Viet Cong tried to parade a beaten and
bloodied Versace through local villages, he’d

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.760
offer words of encouragement in Vietnamese
to those gathered.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.669
This was much to the annoyance of the Viet
Cong who’d warned against such insubordination

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.930
by threatening to viciously beat him within
an inch of his life if he did so.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.570
Frustrated with their inability to break this
man, the Viet Cong eventually made the decision

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.570
to execute Versace.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.540
When he was informed of this, he reportedly
responded by singing God Bless America for

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.410
5 hours straight the night before his execution
was to take place.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.060
This song was the last thing any of his fellow
prisoners ever heard from Versace.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.300
Following through on their threat, Rocky Versace
was executed on September 26, 1965.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.210
His body was never recovered, but a headstone
was placed above an empty grave in Arlington

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.480
National Cemetery.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.090
For his conduct as a POW, initially Versace
only received a silver star, the Army’s

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.330
third highest award.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.020
This was something his fellow soldiers didn’t
feel reflected the full extent of his actions

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.660
and sacrifice while a POW, resulting in a
concerted effort from a “hodgepodge group

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.520
of soldiers and civilians” aware of the
full details of what Versace endured to see

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.210
him awarded America’s highest military honor.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.889
In 2002, this request was finally fulfilled,
with one of Versace’s brothers, Dr. Stephen

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.370
Versace, accepting the medal from then President
George Bush.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.760
In his speech, Bush noted:

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.699
In his defiance and later his death, he set
an example of extraordinary dedication that

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.470
changed the lives of his fellow soldiers who
saw it firsthand.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.490
His story echoes across the years, reminding
us of liberty’s high price and of the noble

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.350
passion that caused one good man to pay that
price in full.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.340
In addition to being the first American POW
to earn a Medal of Honor for his conduct during

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.169
his time as a prisoner, Versace is an inductee
in the Pentagon’s Hall of Heroes as well

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.660
as a member of the Ranger Hall of Fame.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.400
Said his former fellow prisoner Sergeant Dan
Pitzer of the man himself,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.690
Rocky walked his own path… for that guy,
duty, honor, country was a way of life.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.260
He was the finest example of an officer I
have known…

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.310
Once, Rocky told our captors they might as
well kill him then and there if the price

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.470
of his life was getting more from him than
name, rank, and serial number…

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.630
He got a lot of pressure and torture, but
he held his path…

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.680
He was brutally murdered because of it…

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.230
I’m satisfied he would have it no other
way….

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.939
[He] valued that one moment of honor more
than he would a lifetime of compromises
