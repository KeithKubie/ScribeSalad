Blurring is an image processing effect. So most of the work is done by the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.560
fragment shader. The vertex shader is the only one that can move vertex

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.670
positions. So is the one that can change an object's shape. Evaluating an

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.770
illumination model can be done on the vertex or pixel level. So both shaders

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.610
can do this work. Gouraud interpolation itself is done in the rasterization

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.350
stage. So neither shader does anything along these lines.
