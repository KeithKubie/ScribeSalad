learned person said we cannot ratify
this Constitution and the reason is the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
this Constitution and the reason is the
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.010
this Constitution and the reason is the
pardon power and it was urged by the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020
pardon power and it was urged by the
 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.710

his advisors then his advisors in legal
trouble and then the president can

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
trouble and then the president can
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.590
trouble and then the president can
pardon the person for engaging in

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600
pardon the person for engaging in
 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.750

Constitution that has that in it that's
 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.730
Constitution that has that in it that's
a fair question and it was stated with

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740
a fair question and it was stated with
 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.920
a fair question and it was stated with
great precision as an objection to the

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
great precision as an objection to the
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.440

at the Constitutional Convention and
 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.270
at the Constitutional Convention and
