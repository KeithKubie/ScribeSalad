00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.460
Mary Jeanne is the
system administrator

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.800
for a big website.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.780
The website requires multiple
web servers and database

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.040
servers to run.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.970
Each web server
costs $40 per month,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.187
and each database
costs $60 per month.

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:19.520
To get an idea of the monthly
bill her company will have

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.730
to pay, Mary Jeanne
makes a little table.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.200
So this is the number of
potential web servers,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.220
and this is the number
of the database servers.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.510
So these are
different scenarios.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.240
What is the expression
that describes

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.090
a monthly hosting bill for n web
servers and m database servers?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090
So let's think about
what's going on right here.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.460
When she has one web server
and one database server,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.800
well, she has to pay $40 per
month for that one web server

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.340
and $60 a month for that
one database server.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.810
Now, when you add that
together, you get $100.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.030
Now, here, in the
second scenario,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.260
she has two web servers
and one database server.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.270
So here, she's
multiplying 40 times

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330
2, because that's how
many web servers she has.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
So she's going to have to pay
$80 a month for the web servers

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.710
and still $60 per month for
the one database server.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.460
Let's skip to one
that's more interesting.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.790
So here she has five web servers
and two database servers.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.690
So she pays $48 per month for
each of the five web servers.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.180
And she pays $60 a month
for each of the two database

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.990
servers.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.240
So if you wanted to write
an expression that describes

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.760
the monthly hosting bill for
n web servers and m database

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.170
servers, well, you see
here, you see this pattern.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.450
She pays $40 per month for
every web server that she has.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.600
So if she has n
web servers, she's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.830
going to pay $40 per month
per server times n servers.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.260
And then she's paying $60 a
month per database server.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.420
So if she has m
database servers,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.660
she's going to pay $60
per month per server times

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.580
the number of servers.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.940
So this right over
here is the expression

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.610
for the monthly
hosting billing cost.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.490
And you could see
that right over here.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.420
If you view this is as n,
the number of web servers,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.669
and this as m, you see that
when n is 20 and m is 10,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.890
then you get 40 times 20
plus 60 times 10-- 40 times n

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.550
plus 60 times m.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.870
And then you would
get your actual value.
