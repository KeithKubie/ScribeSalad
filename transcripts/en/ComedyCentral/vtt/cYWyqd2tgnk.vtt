00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.103
- Hey, come on in.

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.406
(bouncy keyboard music)

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.044 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yes, push and
believe, you got it.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.312 line:0%
I'm here with Dan.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.646 line:0%
Y'know Comedy Central said,

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.382
'you can't do an
interview from bed,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.616
'you gotta be in a table,'

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.084
I go, 'I'm Steven
Brody Stevens.'

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.019
- Yeah.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.754
- I've got a half hour special,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.958 align:start size:94% position:6%
if I wanna do an interview
in bed with a friend

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.292
we do it right here.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.494
- And y'know what, I like this,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.595
this is much more comfortable.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.730
- So Dan, we're here in Boston,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.432
we're here in a
great hotel room,

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.167
I put it down on my debit card,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.770 align:start size:94% position:6%
incidentals, everything's
taken care of.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.940
I do have doughnuts here
from a local establishment

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.077
if you would like, these
are some options here,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.045
we have chocolate.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.279
- I'm gonna go with this one

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:49.215 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause it looks
like it might have.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.954
- Tasty.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.423
- I think it tasted better
'cause you fed it to me.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.290
Can I feed you one?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.124
- I like chocolate.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.626
- You like chocolate?

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.694
- I like chocolate, here
we go, now go slow with me.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.532 align:start position:0%
You did the whole thing at
once, I'm gonna nibble and chew.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.067
- You're gonna nibble and chew?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.535
Alright y'ready?

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.405
Slow, just take, oh that was
much more sensual than my bite.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:14.874
- A little more.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.243
- Lemme rearrange it,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.414 align:start size:97% position:3%
okay now, no, now you're
just kissing it, no, bite it.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.384
Okay you're gonna bite my,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.586
I'm just gonna let the
whole thing go, no, okay.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.921
- Save that for later.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.855
How tall are you?

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:29.989
- I'm 6'4, how tall are you?

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:30.924
- Six two.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.092
- Are you good at basketball?

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.426 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I played basketball
in high school,

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.795
I'm not in to it
so much any more,

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.666
I'm more in to kettle bells,
I'm in to public park workouts,

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.034
I mean can you dunk?

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.103 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, I'm not good
at basketball.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.370
- 'cause you're white.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.005
- Yeah, also 'cause
I'm scared of uh.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:46.840
- Of black people?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.108
- Yes.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You do a lot of
hosting, I'm a host.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.611
Y'know we can both close shows,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.947 align:start size:94% position:6%
obviously we're doing half
hours, we're in Boston,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.483
they wouldn't bring us out
here if we were only hosts.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.118
- Let's lean up for this,

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
'cause I feel like we're
gonna get in to it.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.821
- What skills does
it take to be a host?

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.423
I think there's a lot
of comedians out here

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.025 align:start position:0%
who think when you host you
just get up and tell your jokes

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.260
and you get out of there.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.062
You go outside,
you have a drink,

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.064 align:start size:84% position:16%
you have a little
hit off a joint, no.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.332
- You're working.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You're working, you're
literally working.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.034
- All the time.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.236
- And that's why

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
the host gets more money
than the headliner.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.404
- 'cause they're supposed to.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.706
- I've had anger
issues in the past.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.540
- You did?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.374
- Oh yeah.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.642
- Really?

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.877
- I front kicked a guy
in a 7-11 parking lot,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.879
I flipped out at
the Comedy Store,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.049 align:start position:0%
I went off my meds cold turkey,
and now I'm choking Dan!

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.927
- Hey, hey, there
he is, there he is.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:44.898
You doin' alright bud?

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.432
- You know what calms me down?

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.667
- What calms you down?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I have an app,
y'know applications.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.303
- You have your own
app for your phone?

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.071
- Yeah, check it out.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:57.844 align:start size:97% position:3%
I perform at all, I perform,
I perform, I perform.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're like the
Skrillex of comedians.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.549
(techno music)

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.816
- Lemme see this.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.851
- Give it a shot,
have fun with it,

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.186
it's gonna make you feel better.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.054 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I could throw
eighty-eight with movement.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.757 align:start size:94% position:6%
Eighty-eight with
movement, that's baseball,

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.358 align:start size:88% position:13%
y'know I played baseball
at Arizona State.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.193
- Did you really?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.494
You're a D1 athlete?

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.529 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Play a little
catch, here we go.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.665
One, you got it, try it again.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.333
Right handed, throw.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Y'know this is
the closest I've had

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.272
to having a catch with a dad
since I was five years old.

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.373
This kinda means a lot to me.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.975
- Y'know my father passed away,

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.278
it was either in 1996 or 2005,

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.215
and I would play catch
with my father growing up

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.483
and this kinda reminds me.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.654
Dan I am so happy and pleased
that you came into my room.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.157
- Of course.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.525
- And I'm gettin'
tired right now,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.293
I'm gonna take a
quick power nap,

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.562 align:start size:84% position:16%
be comfortable, make
yourself at home,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.865
if you could wake me up
in about 20, 25 minutes,

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.001
I have to go down
to Dunkin' Donuts.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.569
- Hit it hard buddy.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.571
- You got it, Dan Sodor.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:15.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yes, what a great video,
it's inspired me to exercise,

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
it should inspire you
to click, and subscribe,

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.861
and like, and even tweet at me.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:28.167 align:start size:94% position:6%
Whoo, feelin' good,
laughter makes me exercise

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.004
yes, you got it,
push and believe.
