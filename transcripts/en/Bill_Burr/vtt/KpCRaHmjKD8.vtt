1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.950
Um,
hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.590
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

3
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.290
Monday morning podcast.
And I'm checking in on you,

4
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:17.110
although the way I was just coughing,
you should be checking in on me.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.020
What do you think?
Hey,
what,
are you smoking?
A bunch of guys who had built?
No,

6
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.410
I'm not.
I was just,
uh,
just,
I got a little sick.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.640
I got a little sick but not in tired.
I just got a little sick.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.160
I just wrapped on my general hospital,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.330
my 72 episode arc on General Hospital,

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.380
um,
12 hour days,
six days a week.
And uh,

11
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.250
we knocked it out and I actually got to see a sneak peek of the,

12
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:46.490
obviously it's not journal hospital.

13
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:49.960
I got to see the sneak peek of this thing that I'm going to be a small part of.

14
00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:53.800
As always,
I always pair a troop into things that are really cool.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.780
I'm never the main guy.
All right.
That,
that,
that's not the road from me.
You know,

16
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.640
I'm a bald,
redheaded male.
Okay.
I know the deal.
I'm in the background.
I get it.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.481
All right.
You know,

18
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:08.620
you don't see me cold complaining like some of these fat chicks out here in

19
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.070
Hawaii and I almost said Hawaii out here in Hollywood.
Like,
oh,

20
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.260
how come I'm not start in a,
in a,

21
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:18.460
in a fucking movie because you look like me with a dress.
That's why.

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.110
Okay.
And people invest money and they want to make it back.
Okay.

23
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:27.010
So at some point you're going to have to deal with the fact that you know,

24
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.650
you're in the van,
man.
All right?
You're not picking the fucking safe.

25
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.480
The lock on the safe.
Anyways,
we rapped on it.
I had a great time.

26
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.530
I took some chances as an actor,
I learned some things.

27
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.000
Um,
I,
I learned what I always learned whenever I go on a shoot like that.

28
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.570
Just the sheer,
the sheer amount of fucking work,

29
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.730
how hard everybody works on those things.

30
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.310
And it just kills me whenever these politicians never,

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.200
these politicians run for office.
Who Do they talk about?

32
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.240
Did they talk about people busting their asses?

33
00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:08.890
Like people who fucking write scripts and people got to figure out how to then,

34
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:12.010
you know,
fucking shoot the thing and all these different looks.

35
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:14.860
And now way talk about Joe six pack

36
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.790
Joe six pack.
Fucking putting his pants on one leg at a fucking time.

37
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.370
He's got time to go drink a fucking six pack,

38
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.813
<v 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.990
<v 0>some fucking dope.
Just driving around in an era in a,
you know,</v>

40
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.620
I don't know why no fucking ice cream truck is getting more love from the next

41
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.380
potential president of the United States.
The,

42
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.760
that somebody has got to stand there holding a fucking microphone over some ball

43
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.430
jackass like me for 12 hours a day.
I don't know.

44
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.130
I think these politicians of rock,

45
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.510
maybe if all these fucking Hollywood people would quit shitting on half of them,

46
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.550
maybe the hardworking people in the movie industry,
we get a little more love.

47
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.260
It's just,
just,
I'm just thinking out loud here,
people.
Um,
anyways,

48
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:03.261
I had a fucking awesome time and I got to work with some amazing actors and uh,

49
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.063
you know,

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.050
just great storytellers and all that and I had a great fucking time.

51
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.820
Having said that,
I'm old and I'm exhausted.
Um,
all right.

52
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.820
And I gotta jump on a red eye tonight to go out,

53
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.910
fly direct to fuck in Atlantic city.
Um,

54
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.120
cause I'm doing a Gig at the board.
Got It.
Tomorrow night.
All right.

55
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.720
I'm taking off my acting hat and I'm putting on my standup shirt.

56
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.900
Um,
anyway,
speaking of shirts,
did anybody see that stupid sweater Gucci made?

57
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.210
I'm getting all my news from Twitter by the way.

58
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:43.060
I've just given into the fact that I'm not going to be an informed person.

59
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.820
All right.
You're listening to the wrong bill.
Okay?

60
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:47.430
You want to listen to Bill Maher if you want,

61
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.500
if you want to listen to somebody who knows what the fuck is going on,
okay?

62
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.920
You want to listen to that bill?
All right?

63
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.130
You want to listen to some shit at who reads hashtags or in whatnot.

64
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.190
You're listening to the right podcast.
All right.
Gucci sweater.

65
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.410
One of these fucking idiots,
right,
goes out and he designs his fuck.

66
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.411
He or she all right was either some dumb guy or a strong brave woman.

67
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.900
Is that my,
is that how you supposed to say it politically?
Um,

68
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.550
designed a turtle neck that was black that you feel whatever stupid fucking

69
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:23.370
reason you pulled up over like right up underneath your nose and then your,

70
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:26.680
your mouth came through it.
And then there was these big red lips around it.

71
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.870
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.200
<v 0>So if you seen the picture,
just Google a picture of it.
All right.</v>

73
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.340
African American people,
you know,
not all of them.
I don't even know how many,

74
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:39.160
I don't,
I didn't take a fucking sense of start going.
Jesus Christ,

75
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.720
can we stop with the fucking black face is offensive.
You know,

76
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.750
they said the sweater look like it was black faces and they immediately made it

77
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.210
about themselves rather than the real issue,

78
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.330
which was that it was an unbelievably ridiculous and ugly fucking turtleneck

79
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:03.310
sweater.
That's all it was.
It was an ugly turtleneck sweater or you know,

80
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:06.610
and I don't,
I don't want to get involved in a racial debate here,

81
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.860
but as a privileged white male,

82
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:13.270
I want you to know that I was triggered by the fact that all those black people

83
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:18.271
ignored the fact that there was also half of white face behind that turtleneck.

84
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.720
Okay.
And how do you think I felt to not feel represented

85
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.050
in that sweater scandal?

86
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.780
<v 0>Um,
is it a fucking amazing,</v>

88
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.470
the shit that just get light somehow gets traction on social media?

89
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.700
You know,
what about the fucking eight year old,
you know,

90
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:40.060
who usually goes to bed at three in the morning after?

91
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.730
So in those fucking things together in some sweatshop now we had to stick around

92
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:45.200
for an extra half hour to,

93
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680
so the extra fucking thread to make sure it went up and over your mouth.
Right.

94
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.431
And then what happens?

95
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:52.730
Everybody in the first world country makes it all about themselves.

96
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.370
And everybody forgets about that little fucking kid there.
Right?

97
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.080
Little fucking Joe,
a six pack,
right?

98
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.093
<v 3>MMM.</v>

99
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.180
<v 0>I Dunno,
my wife is really into fashion.
I so much of it is just ugly Shit,</v>

100
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.340
you know?
And then they just have some beautiful woman walked down the,
the,
the,

101
00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:18.910
the runway,
like looking confident,
you know.

102
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.260
But that one,
I swear to God,
that was like something out of the muppets,

103
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.210
wasn't it?
I was like the dumb Donald fucking no dump.

104
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:31.260
Donald had a hat pulled down over his fucking,

105
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.790
I used to know all the fucking Cosby kids who was weird.
Harold,

106
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.960
one of them had a sweater yanked up over its face right over.
It's,
well,

107
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.520
it's a cartoon,
right?
Hold on a second.

108
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.620
Fat Albert kids.
Who were they?

109
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.430
Let's see,
what did you have?
What did you have images?

110
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.200
Um,
there was one.
Was it weird Harold?

111
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.983
<v 3>No,</v>

112
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.490
<v 0>didn't one of them.
No,
I guess they didn't.
It was Russell,
Rudy</v>

113
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.590
blocky bill dumped Donald Weird Harold.

114
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.153
<v 0>When was the last one?</v>

116
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.483
<v 3>Mush mouth.</v>

117
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.950
<v 0>One of those fucking cartoons had somebody with a thing yanked up over its face.</v>

118
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:23.790
I had,
I don't fucking remember.
Um,
anyways,

119
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.820
that was a big scandal.
Everybody.
That was a big fucking scandal,
you know,

120
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.120
but thank God people spoke out.

121
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.510
And those sweaters will not be mass produced.

122
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:40.160
So whatever ones that they have will now be thrown into the ocean and we'll let

123
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.560
the poor pluses in dolphin steel with it,
you know?

124
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.700
I mean it could have kept a lot of half the lower half of a lot of people's

125
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:51.330
faces warm,
you know,
they easily could have died.
It,

126
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.300
you know,
made it a different color.
I then,
and then what?

127
00:07:57.301 --> 00:08:01.940
Then you get Asians and
native Americans start fucking complaining.

128
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.100
It's just a bad idea.
I think that's what we learned this week.
You know,

129
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.390
you can't get mad at somebody for trying.
I mean it was a turtle neck sweater.

130
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:12.840
What the fuck can you do with it?
Can you lower it a little bit?

131
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.430
It's already been done.
Mock turtleneck sweater.
What do we do?
Well,
let's fucking,

132
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:21.480
let's keep it going.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Underneath the mouth?
No,

133
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:25.800
right up and over it.
That looks weird.
I'll put some fucking lips on it.

134
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.410
You know,
if you're sitting there going like bill,

135
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.660
who the fuck talks about half a turtle neck?

136
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:37.810
Fucking black face sweater for fucking eight minutes.
Well,
you know what,

137
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.430
it's not football season anymore.

138
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.970
Football season is over.

139
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.343
<v 3>MMM.</v>

140
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.330
<v 0>Then you're in New England patriots and your New England patriots,</v>

141
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.410
other fucking champion,

142
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.010
your Boston red sox or the world series champion and it's unbelievable.

143
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.010
You know Bruins are playing.
All right.

144
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.420
I don't know what's going on with the Celtics.

145
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.010
Somebody asked me today on set the way,

146
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.930
is Kyrie Irving going to go to the Lakers?
This kind of a room?
I heard of rule.

147
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.820
I have no idea.

148
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.750
All I know is I don't think that they've been playing as well as everybody

149
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:14.940
thought they were going to play,
so I have no idea.

150
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:17.700
But I'm going to try to check in on that.
All I have to do now,

151
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:21.300
now that I'm on the other side of that acting Gig,
all right.

152
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.210
All I gotta do now,
you know,

153
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.990
I keep doing the F is for family stuff and at night I'm just going to be running

154
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.870
my hour because I am taping my hour special.

155
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.110
I kind of kept it under wraps as to where I was taping it,

156
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.850
where I was recording it.
And I feel like now is the time,
you know,

157
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:41.040
cause it's a very weird time in comedy.

158
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.850
You hear that a lot now is not the time for those jokes.

159
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.670
I'm a white woman who's not even funny and I'm telling you that now is not the

160
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:52.050
time for that.

161
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.920
Have you noticed that most people who are saying what you should and shouldn't

162
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:59.880
be saying comedically are about as funny as your average feature act.

163
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.840
They're like Middle Act,
funny telling like fucking really funny people.

164
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.470
What they should be saying.
Um,
Oh yes.
Yes.

165
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.930
You by all means who with your best joke.

166
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:14.520
You just make me raise my eyebrows a little bit like yeah,
that was a funny,

167
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:18.810
wasn't it?
By all means.
Tell the world what is funny.
Um,

168
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:22.680
I am going to be recording my next hour special

169
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.220
and um,
Royal Albert Hall in London.
That's right.
I'm a trader.

170
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.260
I'm going back to the motherland.
Yeah.
Yeah.

171
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:37.170
What the fuck?
I mean I'm on my sixth one.
I've got to try something different.

172
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:41.730
I'm going to go over there,
be funny.
Half of my shit.
People will be like,

173
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:44.130
I don't understand that.
And maybe they'll bomb for part of it.

174
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.360
We'll see if it's funny.
Anyways,

175
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:49.620
I'll be doing it at Royal Albert Hall on a Monday and Tuesday.
March.

176
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.690
Uh,

Third and fourth.
Fourth and fifth.
Fifth and sixth.

177
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:55.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.630

180
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:10.850

Why is this an October

181
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.190
is the last time I actually put anything in my calendar.

182
00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:20.190
October 29th I put Jimmy Kimmel.
How the fuck do I get out of this?

183
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.110
Click on this today.
Click on today.
All right,

185
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.470
so next week on the 15th,

186
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.420
I'll be in Santa Barbara.
I'll be in Pasadena and I'll be,

187
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.410
uh,
in,
uh,
Riverside,
California.

188
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.120
And then I go to New York City on the 19th and a,

189
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:52.230
I do the Patrice O'Neal benefit.
And then,
um,

190
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.890
I'm in New York for a little bit,

191
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.891
doing some spots out there and then I embark on a little run of dates through

192
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.970
the,
a great United Kingdom,
Great Britain,
whatever the fuck you call it.

193
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.370
And then I ended up at,
um,

194
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.013
<v 1>okay.</v>

195
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.600
<v 0>I ended up a Royal Albert Hall and they have it.</v>

196
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.150
And then when I get on the other side of that Shit when I Sang,
thank you.

197
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.730
Good night on March 5th.

198
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.660
Then I'll have to do is worry about wrapping up the writing on season four of f

199
00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:25.000
is for family and I don't have shit until the summertime and I'm just going to

200
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:29.890
be fucking hanging in Cali doing,
you know,
getting ready to do my new hour work.

201
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:33.760
Am I,
that's,
that's the game plan.
All right.
Because,
uh,

202
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.740
I love my daughter and I,
I don't like leaving the way I used to,

203
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.790
you know.
Do you know she,
she tried to get out of her bed.

204
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.420
I saw two months ago she was swinging her leg up and over the,

205
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.250
the the crib.

206
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:49.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.380
<v 0>And my gut said,</v>

208
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.190
you better put some pillows down around the floor in case she goes up and over.

209
00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:55.530
And I just,
you know,
I didn't listen to my gut like a fucking idiot.

210
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.440
So it was coming home from the,

211
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.540
that amazing shoot that I was on that I can't wait to fucking tell you guys

212
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:04.110
about,
but I'm just not allowed to be so awesome.

213
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.230
Um,
but uh,
I came home last night and you know,

214
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.850
after I got off set,
I never bring my phone down to the set or a watch,
you know,

215
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.490
cause I don't want to know what time it is because then it just makes it drag.

216
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.010
So I just focus on whatever the fuck it is I need to do.

217
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.440
And then I come walking out at like one in the morning,
however it works.
Anyway,

218
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.510
some fucking coming back.
You know,
I come outside and I get the,

219
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.240
uh,
oh,
the pizza's here.
Um,

220
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.770
I get this text message
and uh,

221
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:40.150
<v 1>yeah,</v>

222
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.480
<v 0>it says we're at the emergency room,
blah,
blah,
blah,
all this fucking shit.</v>

223
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:47.240
She fell out of the bed
and I'm like,
Oh my God,

224
00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:50.630
I'm wiped out and I have to go to the emergency room and my fucking tires has a

225
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:54.410
slow leak on the left side.
So I'm like,
great.

226
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.390
It never rent.
So I'm on my way there.
And it's so funny,

227
00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:01.820
like how my wife is wiring and how I'm wired.

228
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.020
Like my wife is wired like a normal,
caring human being.

229
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.750
And I'm like a fucking lunatic.

230
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.760
I was raised the way I was raised just in a different time.
So

231
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.220
I call her up,
she goes,
I go,
oh,
is she talking as she fine?
Yeah,
she's fine.

232
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:20.930
She's joking around,
she's laughing.

233
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:25.280
She actually didn't even cry until I came in the room and cried.
Um,

234
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.330
and she sent me a picture,
you know,
and I'm driving and I'm looking at it,

235
00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:32.840
you know,
like I shouldn't be.
And I was just like,
yeah,
she's fine.

236
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.340
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

237
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.640
<v 0>she's fine.
She's got a bump on her head.
She's,
she's gonna be fine and blah,
blah,</v>

238
00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:41.120
blah,
blah,
blah.
And we both had the exact opposite.
She's like,

239
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:44.450
I'm not bringing her home until a doctor looks at her.
I'll never forgive myself.

240
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:47.450
And I'm like,
I'm,
she's fine.
She's fine.

241
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.760
So we walk up to the window to see where we are.

242
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.470
It's like fucking one in the or midnight and thick and there's all these fucking

243
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.860
people there with their kids and they're all screaming and crying and

244
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.160
they say we're 16th in line.

245
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:04.070
It's just like they're going to get to us to like fucking three in the morning,

246
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.970
you know,
she's fine.
I literally,

247
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:11.150
I remember being a kid swinging on these ropes.

248
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.230
My other brother was on another rope and we went right by each other and then

249
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:20.180
slammed into the backs of our heads,
like slammed into each other.
Like I,

250
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:24.020
I saw stars that all went white and I landed face down on the ground.

251
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.780
All right.
I was out.
Like I was conscious when I was on the rope and when we hit,

252
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.940
I was unconscious than I hit the ground.

253
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.990
And you know what my dumb ass did an hour and a half later got right back on

254
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:37.970
that fucking thing.
And my other brother did too.

255
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.430
And I remember the looks on our faces when we passed each other going,

256
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.790
how are we really gonna do this again?
And Bam,
back of our heads again,

257
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.870
saw lights knocked out,
hit the ground,
you know,

258
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.040
and I was fine,
so fuck it.

259
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.960
So I convinced her that she was all right and she was all right.

260
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.190
But like I've kind of realized in that like I need to like a kind of gauge that,

261
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.620
because you know,

262
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.950
I came from a house where like I had a ruptured appendix at one point and my

263
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:08.880
parents like,
you fine,
you fine.

264
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.500
Finally went to the hospital,
they slice me,
open it at all.

265
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:20.501
Like my whole belly was just fucking pos like JJ priced.

266
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.920
Um,
so whatever you can take that,

267
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:28.430
rub some dirt on it too far and then he can go the other way where every time

268
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:32.150
somebody has the fucking sniffles,
you taken beyond the Goddamn hospital.

269
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:35.120
You know what I mean?
But I think my wife was right to take her down there,

270
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:36.020
but she was okay.

271
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.080
And she woke up today and then not on her head was a lot smaller and a,

272
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.590
you know,
every kid has to have their black I picture,
you know what I mean?

273
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.160
Um,
something that you did.
So,
uh,

274
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.160
it was cool and I was so proud of her that she didn't cry and she was,

275
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:56.420
she's a little toughie,
you know,
she's a little Badass.
So anyways,

276
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:57.711
you know,

277
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:01.040
she's talking up a storm and I got my little book and I try to keep up on all

278
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:05.450
the things that she says,
you know.
Um,
you know what's funny now is,
uh,

279
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:11.000
they have a park nearby and like once a year they just,

280
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:15.440
little carnival thing comes by and they have like little pony rides and stuff.

281
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.870
So I took her over there,
you know,

282
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.290
it was going on like all the little kiddie rides with her.
It was awesome.
And,
um,

283
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.750
and then she saw the horses.
She's like horse horse,
you know,

284
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.930
she knows how to make the noise and shit.
And,
um,

285
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.850
they had a little pony rides or you want to ride the horse?
She goes,
yeah,
righto.

286
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.240
Bride,
horse ride horse.
She was all about it.
Right.
And then paid the ticket.

287
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.350
I'm going in.
I was like,
wow man,
she's so brave.
You know,
she's so brave.
Right.

288
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.600
And uh,
and she was all about it and right as I went to put her down on it,

289
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.420
cause they gonna put you down and then they'd like put this little safety

290
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:49.620
harness and then you as the parent walk along it,
right.

291
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.430
I went to center down in the second,
I started centered down,
she's going,
no,
no,

292
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.690
no horse,
no horse.

293
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.740
So I immediately got her out of there cause I didn't want to have her to have

294
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.770
issues with horses.
Speaking of horses,

295
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.590
one of the actors that I worked with that,
um,
you know,

296
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:14.700
all of this shit I'm not allowed to say knows a thing or two about horses.

297
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.500
And I somehow asked them,
what does that,
uh,

298
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.590
road rode hard and put up wet.
What does that expression mean?

299
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.500
Or,
uh,
you know,
there's a couple of different ways to say it,

300
00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:28.750
but that's basically,
it rode hard and put up wet.
He goes,

301
00:18:28.751 --> 00:18:32.140
that's actually talking about horses and it's kind of a human cell.

302
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.670
Somebody like Jesus Christ,
that guy looks rode hard and put up wet.
Um,

303
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.500
and it basically was,

304
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.040
I guess if you ride a horse hard enough that it's,

305
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.100
it's breathing hard and it's sweating and you just where to then just walk it

306
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:53.530
into a barn,
I guess they get like these stomach cramps or something.

307
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.150
They call it colic or something and they literally lay down in the ground and

308
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.510
they flip around or I don't know what happens.

309
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:02.890
Something gets twisted up and they just fucking die.

310
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.240
So what you have to do is after you wrote him hard as you have to walk a horse

311
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.400
around until it slows,

312
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.430
slowly cools back down again so it doesn't get those cramps.

313
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.460
And if you put it into early and it lays down,

314
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.490
you've got to fucking get that thing back up or it's going to die or whatever,

315
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.770
you know,
fucking horses,
man,
they really temperamental.

316
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.740
So I had no idea about that shit.
So,
you know,

317
00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:28.160
these are the things that you learn about.
Well,
you sitting there,
you know,

318
00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:32.900
I learned all of this Shit I learned about,
you know,
there was an old school guy,

319
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.350
they're telling me about different actors and how much of the,

320
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.080
how much land they owed out owned out here.

321
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.730
<v 4>Okay.</v>

322
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.230
<v 0>You know,
like this,</v>

323
00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:45.740
this actor went out and he bought from this street to this street,

324
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:47.621
which would you,

325
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:51.040
I mean if somebody went to buy that same parcel land today out here in La,

326
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:54.430
like I don't even have to be $1 billion or something in the person bought it for

327
00:19:54.431 --> 00:19:58.150
like five grand.
And then for the rest of their acting career,

328
00:19:58.151 --> 00:20:03.151
they just sort of slowly sold it off and made all this money is his fucking like

329
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.910
la is one of the most amazing
like historic cities.

330
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.330
If you can somehow find out what the fuck happened,

331
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.380
cause God knows it's not in any books because they don't give a shit out here.

332
00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.290
They just fucking paved shit over.
Um,

333
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.920
it's one of the shady goddamn place.
Awesome.
I fucking love it.

334
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.590
But it is so fucking shady with,
you know,

335
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:27.590
we used to have street cars and trolleys and all of this fucking shit.

336
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.430
And then one day,
you know,
the,
allegedly this group of people got together,

337
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.560
you know,
that was allegedly the automakers and,
and,

338
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.710
and the Goodyear tire people got together and they bought up the trains and the

339
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:42.800
trolleys and they just ripped up all the fucking tracks and turned it into this

340
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:44.540
fucking mess that it is now.

341
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.380
Now you've got a Elon must dig in the fuck.
You know,
he's,

342
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.600
he's already dug this tunnel underneath la in the people that live in Beverly

343
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.250
hills are so fucking rich.
They stopped Elon Musk

344
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.460
who's powerful enough to just start drilling underneath the fucking city.

345
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.710
And they're powerful enough to be like,

346
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.140
we do not want those commoners

347
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.400
taking public transportation under,

348
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.510
cause they know what's going to happen is eventually there is going to be a

349
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:24.280
subway stop in Beverly Hills.

352
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.730
to kick,
to get away from these fucking people,

353
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.800
to have them then just get on some magic carpet ride underneath the fucking

up@billbirddotrobinhood.com.
That's capital B I L L B U R R A.

425
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:18.230
Dot Robin hood.com.
That doesn't make sense.
Oh yeah,

426
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:23.140
it is bill bird dot Robin hood.com.
Okay,
cool.
Um,
you know,
it's taking the,
uh,

427
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.043
by the way,

428
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.190
I didn't gloat about the Patriots won the Superbowl because I still can't

429
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:31.910
believe they fucking did it,
but it does make me feel good.
You know,

430
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.870
after all this shit,

431
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.900
giant fans gave me that the new England patriots now have more fucking Tom Brady

432
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:44.861
has more fucking rings than the giants and the jets combined and the buffalo

433
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:50.271
bills have three NFL teams in the state of New York and Tom Brady alone has one

434
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:56.910
more super bowls than those three teams in their entire fucking existence.

435
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.770
So I'll take those two losses.
Oh,
Boohoo we only went six and three.

436
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.610
Sorry,
just given,
um,
fellow patriots fans some fucking Ammo.

I,

440
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.070

441
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:27.480
all these fucking women do is bitch.

463
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.720

20.
[inaudible].
Um,
all right,

464
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.020
let's look up steak and a blow job day.
I always heard that that fucking exists.

465
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.460
Is that an actual day steak and a blow job?

466
00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.570
God knows a progressive mail.
We'll take a veggie sandwich at a fucking hand job.

467
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:08.110
Um,
let's see here.
Stake in a blow job.
Alright.
Stake in a blow.
Job Day.

468
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.890
Sticking a blow job day is a satirical holiday creating the United States.

469
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.750
Yeah.
It's a male response to Valentine's Day and celebrate it.

470
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:19.450
A month later on March 14th on the day,

471
00:29:19.451 --> 00:29:24.451
women are proport purported to supposedly to cook a fillet steak.

472
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.770
Wow.
Yeah.

473
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:31.910
Good luck getting any woman under the age of fucking 50 to do that.

474
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.340
The women who want to cook anymore,
I mean,

475
00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:39.341
I think they do it for themselves and perform fellatio on a man in response to

476
00:29:39.351 --> 00:29:43.240
postcards,
chocolate and flowers by men on Valentine's Day.

477
00:29:43.241 --> 00:29:45.730
The observance has no official status of course,

478
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.840
being a popular Internet meme rather than an actual holiday.

479
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.490
But various souvenirs in video clips have been produced about it.

480
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.980
It was conceived in 2002 by

481
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.050
Dj Tom Birdsi on w FNX radio.
That's Boston.

482
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.370
It has been suggested that steak and a blow job day is a backlash against the

483
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.100
feminist movement.
Uh,

484
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.130
it has nothing to do with the feminist movement has to do with the for,

485
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.260
why the fuck are we sell?

486
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.380
Why do I only have to buy shit to celebrate that we're together

487
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.470
anyways.
Oh,
oh.
Who's coming in?
My little toughie.

488
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.420
Hey.
Hey Nia.

489
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.290
Just to let you in.
Do you know when the official stake in and Bj Day is?
Uh,

490
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:39.910
March 14th.
Right.
Beautiful.

491
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.670
Just like that.
See that I didn't have to say anything about feminism.
Did I?
Hi.

492
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.020
Gorgeous.
Now look at you.
You look like it's week two of the playoffs.

493
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.360
Sherry's berries near.

494
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.380
Talk about your plans for Valentine's Day this year.

495
00:30:56.381 --> 00:30:59.890
What would you do if you weren't procrastinating?

496
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.730
I'm not procrastinating.
I already have a reservation that my wife made.

497
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.730
We're going to go out and we're going to have some to eat.

498
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.080
Share a personal Valentine's Day story.
All right.
I always tell this story.

499
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:13.150
One time I was dating this woman and uh,

500
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.210
I didn't know what to get her was like my first girlfriend.

501
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:19.960
And I went to the mall and they had these polo shirts that were on sale.

502
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:24.190
So I bought three of them for like golf shirts.
That's what I bought,
a female.

503
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.080
And she opened him up.

504
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.050
She was all excited and she opened them up and she just went like,
Whoa,

505
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.650
what is this?
Who would buy these?
And she got so mad at me,

506
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:37.060
she started yelling at me and I was so embarrassed that I literally sat down on

507
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:41.320
the bed like a scolded child and let her yell at me for like three minutes

508
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:46.150
before I finally got enough self esteem to tell her to go a,
to go to hell.

509
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:49.450
And then she tried to back pedal that she actually appreciated the fact that I

510
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:51.670
went in and I got her a gift.
Like it's just like,
sweetheart,

511
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.550
you're not buying me anything.
I know this gift stinks,

512
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:58.510
but it's the thought that counts.
Right?
Isn't that what it is?
No,

513
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.410
it's the thought.

514
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.780
The shininess and how much you spent at least three different colors.

515
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:09.010
Yeah.
Three different colored Polo shirts.
They were ugly.
She was right.

516
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.160
She was right.
Uh,
what do you do to look good on Valentine's Day?
Well,

517
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:18.820
I get a spray Tan for one.
I put on some me undies,

518
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.080
the Greg Logan from the Greg Louganis line.
Um,

519
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.140
I get a spray on like stumble on top of my head,

520
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.100
put on a cumber Bun,
and then I'm out the door.
Never,

521
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.140
never go wrong with signature dip Valentine's strawberries dipped in milk,

522
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.350
dark or white chocolate.
Goodness for any discernible palate.
Uh,

523
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.820
that's very progressive.
Nia.
Notice the white chocolate was last.
Okay.

524
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.250
Although milk lightskin,
there's still,
you know,
still a little prejudice there.

525
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.610
<v 3>It's not like it's light did,
did it?
No,
it's not.</v>

526
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.570
What do you mean it's not light skin?
The color of it.

527
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.210
I'm talking would it be considered light skin?
You're going to try to raise,

528
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.273
come here.

529
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.580
<v 0>Let me,
can I ask you a question here?
Were you offended by that Gucci?</v>

530
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:09.080
A half a black face sweater.
I,
yeah.

531
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.350
Yeah.
The whole thing was just very strange to me.

532
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.990
Didn't you think it was a tribute to Halfmoon cookies?

533
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.150
I did not think that at all.
No,
I didn't think that you can.

534
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:24.800
It was black,
half a face,
half,
half black face,
black,
half phase,

535
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.760
but I felt triggered as a white man that they didn't recognize the half a white

536
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:33.680
face that was there.
Did you?
Yes,
yes.
I'm sure they will.
Anyways,

537
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:37.460
dipped in milk,
dark or white shop that goodness for any discerning palate.

538
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.660
She'll fall in love with every bite.
Top with decadent toppings,
chocolate chips,

539
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.860
heart and glitter,
sparkles.
Perfect companion to a candle.
Lit Dinner,

540
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.890
a bouquet of flowers or a night out on the town.

541
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.620
Arrive with 100% Sherry's,

542
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.460
can you say Sherry's berries?
Sherry's berries.
Hey,

543
00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.873
hey,

544

Gives sweet somethings to your long distance.

546
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:08.960
Love Valentine's Day is right around the corner.

547
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.920
I got you a little Valentine's Day card.
You're my buddy.
I got to buy two now.

548
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.900
I've got two little girlfriends here.

554
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.000
<v 3>old zip
recruiter's.
She almost did it.</v>

555
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:44.480
Same recruiter.
Zip.
Okay,

556
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.690
you're grabbing them.

557
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.960
<v 0>She said Zip.
She didn't say zip.
Now say recruiter.
Hey,</v>

558
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.060
zip recruiter sends you sense your job to over 100 of the web's leading job

Um,

Thank you to everybody that I've worked with over the last two weeks on this

585
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:35.420
acting gig.
Thank you.
Everybody gave me the opportunity.

586
00:36:35.421 --> 00:36:38.260
I had an unbelievably awesome time.
Um,

587
00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:40.790

588
00:36:40.791 --> 00:36:44.510
it is.
And when I do,
you're going to be like,
oh my God.
No you didn't.

589
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.360
I'm going to be like,

<v 7>good.
I'll talk to you later.</v>

591
00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.613
[inaudible]

592
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.613
Woo.

593
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.473
[inaudible]

594
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:51.600
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

595
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.010
February 7th,

596
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:00.000
2011 seven days into February.
I'm actually doing this Sunday night,

597
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.070
which is why all you motherfuckers in Europe actually got this fucking podcast

598
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.200
on Monday morning.
And everyone across the states got it Monday morning.

599
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:11.640
All right.

600
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.200
And even if you're on a fucking oil tanker in the middle of

601
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.563
the Goddamn Atlantic Ocean,
all right?

602
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.220
If you didn't have to go off and swab the deck or whatever the fuck it is you

603
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:25.710
people do out there,
you got it on a Monday morning.

604
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.670
So I don't want to hear any God damn bitch in this week where you could you mind

605
00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:33.870
you bought e pod because it's Mike podcast.
Um,

606
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.040
you're probably asking yourself,
um,
why do I work in a cubicle?

607
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:41.230
But beyond that,
you probably ask yourself,

608
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:45.430
why did bill actually do one on a Sunday evening?

609
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.510
So it was actually there for his listeners on a Monday.

610
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.490
Maybe if he did that more often,

611
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.870
he wouldn't beat ranked number 52 on iTunes.

612
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:57.160
According to one of my listeners,

613
00:38:57.161 --> 00:39:01.960
he let me know that he loved my podcast and he thought that I should be ranked

614
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.160
much higher than number 52.
Well,
thanks a lot.

615
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:09.460
Thanks for letting me know how far down the fucking ranks I am

616
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.380
when you're doing rankings,
who counts beyond the top 20?

617
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.280
Honestly coming in at number 73,

618
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.790
Mabel mill infield with her how to make a pot roast podcast every week.

619
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:27.190
She talks about how to make a podcast.
You figured it,

620
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:29.920
that would get boring way to go,

621
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:32.770
whatever made up name I said five seconds ago.

622
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.400
So I'm doing it because I'm fucking busy today on Monday.

623
00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.600
Uh,
believe it or not,
I actually,
I booked some acting work.

624
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.070
You know,
it's a great thing,
you know,
when you,
uh,
you know,

625
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:52.300
being in this business you can watch shows on TV and be fans of them.

626
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.780
And actually Lo and behold,

627
00:39:55.781 --> 00:40:00.550
one day I should be on the fucking show and since its inception,

628
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.400
this very few shows that I watch every episode of,

629
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:07.900
and I just have to tell you from day one,
I have just loved that show glee.

630
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.420
I mean,
it is just phenomenal.
You know,
the singing,
the dancing,

631
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.190
the way they stole the Nelly Olson character from little house in the prairie

632
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:21.880
made her some old content with the fucking rape whistle.
Right?

633
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.710
It's a great God damn show.

634
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.780
And evidently that they've been listening to my podcast and they can stay,

635
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:31.150
you know,
they hear that I can belt out a tune,
you know,

636
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.260
I can carry a tune and um,
you know,

637
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:39.730
I'm going to go on this thing a little bit Tony Bennet and uh,
I can't,
I'm,

638
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:44.080
you know,
I'm legally obligated to not say what the entire episode is about.

639
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:49.390
So,
uh,
yeah.
So I'm actually,
I'm taping an episode of Glee this week

640
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.080
and if you believe that I um,
I got a fucking,
I got a,

641
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:59.950
I got a wind screen to sell Ya.
Um,
yeah,
no,

642
00:40:59.951 --> 00:41:03.220
I am working this week as an actor.
I'm not fucking telling you on which show.

643
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:06.400
Okay.
You figure it out.
All right.
There's only 600 channels.

644
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.130
You know how far into my life too.
I have to let you,

645
00:41:09.131 --> 00:41:10.270
but I am working as an actor.

646
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:15.271
I'm fucking psyched because my pilot for comedy central that I was doing a with

647
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:19.630
another,
one of the funniest fucking Comedians I know did not get picked up.

648
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:24.550
That's how my year began.
Began with a little bit of hope for about two weeks.

649
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.110
And then the industry grabbed one of my ankles and then someone else,

650
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:34.010
he undersea grabbed the other ankle and then they drove a fucking emblem right

651
00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:38.090
into my ball bag.
And it said there you got bell,
have a great fucking 2011.

652
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.230
You know,
and I was down on the dumps for a couple,
two,
three days.

653
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.910
But you know,
just like one of those old,
one of those old fucking crooners songs,

654
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:47.331
jazz,

655
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:52.331
what makes that little hack they key can and something in south day.

656
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.720
And everyone knows that you're fucked,

657
00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.530
but you don't got the balls to kill yourself.

658
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:04.180
So you keep a dashing say,

659
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.780
can you believe I'm not on fucking glee?
Um,

660
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.050
I can't to go fuck yourself.
You figure it out when I'm on.
All right.

661
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.520
Um,
so anyways,
so this is the podcast.

662
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.200
So I was going to do it this afternoon and uh,
I dunno,

663
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:24.050
a day got away from me and then I was like,
wow,
the super bowls today,

664
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:27.890
so I got to make sure I do it after the Superbowl because I always talk about

665
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:32.510
sports and uh,
if you're someone who's a hates when I talk about sports,

666
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:34.820
you really going to hate this podcast.
All right?

667
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.140
Cause I got to talk about it a little bit.

668
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:38.420
There was the fucking super bowl and you know,
you showed up,

669
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:41.480
you sport Hayton cont didn't you?

670
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.800
And you sat there and you ate the fucking food,
didn't you?

671
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.720
And you ran your mouth during the fucking game and then you shut up during the

672
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:54.950
commercials,
right?
And then you gab with all the chicks afterwards.

673
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:56.480
I thought that that was the good one.

674
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.830
Can you believe they pay nine zillion dollars a second,
right?

675
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.500
So shut your face.

676
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:05.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

677
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.930
<v 6>People will say they hate fucking sports.
Still show up to Superbowl parties.</v>

678
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.560
All right,
if you do that,
you're,
you're,
you're a punk.
All right.

679
00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:17.540
When I say I hate sex in the city,
I don't show up for the season finale,

680
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.450
you know,
I know.
Go to the movies.
They are,

681
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:23.510
that's what I should do when they make another one of those horrific movies.

682
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.930
Right?
Do you know,
I heard most of the budgets of those movies is,
uh,

683
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.330
is actually dying the pubes of the women who play those girls.

684
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.490
It's true.
The people out here in Hollywood,
man,

685
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:44.810
I have the fucking trade magazines at my fingertips.

686
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.070
I know people who are on television,
they tie,

687
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.850
you get the inside information here.

688
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.500
I can't believe I'm ranked 52 with some of these gems that I'm giving you this

689
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.270
week.
It really boggles my mind.
I'm going to say I'm gonna,

690
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.650
I'm gonna crack the top 50 this week.
I'm going to get to number 49.

691
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.900
What do you think about that people?
Um,
Hey,
what the hell I'm talking about?

692
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:10.610
This one's just going to be all momentum people.
All fucking momentum.
Uh,
let's,

693
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:14.600
let's talk about the Superbowl.
Shall we shot off right out of the gate?

694
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.790
My condolences to Pittsburgh Steeler fans.
Who is a hell of a fucking game,

695
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.950
a little bit boring and points,
but uh,

696
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:26.951
I think some of that was had to do with the both teams had great defenses and

697
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:32.381
the fact that Ben Roethlisberger was wearing one sneaker and one moon boot or

698
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:36.360
was that an Ugh,
I dunno what happened.
I don't know what happened to that guy,

699
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.160
but a,
I didn't realize that he was so fucked up before the God damn game.
But uh,

700
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.780
my condolences and congratulations to the Green Bay packers,

701
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.700
ladies and gentlemen,
there.

702
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.080
Fourth Super Bowl Championship.

703
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.223
<v 8>Okay.</v>

704
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:59.200
<v 6>Combining that with nine NFL titles.</v>

705
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.830
All right?
In three league titles,

706
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.600
giving them and overall total of 16 titles.

707
00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:08.890
All right?

708
00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:13.890
Nobody can fuck with that in professional football in America.

709
00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.260
All right,
shut up.
You see over there in Europe.
All right,

710
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.810
we call football football over here.

711
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.960
Even though we had the brains to pick the fucking thing up instead of skipping

712
00:45:25.961 --> 00:45:29.230
around
fucking unbelievable.

713
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.740
<v 8>Okay?</v>

714
00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.530
<v 6>You go over there to Europe,
they always give you shit.
[inaudible] Yo,</v>

715
00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:37.100
why you call a football my Jeremia you fucker for shut up.

716
00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:42.400
You do use your foot when you kick a field goal and when you fucking kick off or

717
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.150
when you're punt.
All right.

718
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.670
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's what's called foot and hand balls out.

719
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:53.010
What the fuck was,
how come you don't call it foot and head ball?

720
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.190
How come you don't call it that?
Use Your fucking head over there too,
don't ya?

721
00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.530
All right.
This smarty pants.
Um,
anyways,
sorry.

722
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.240
16 fucking titles.
All right.

723
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.790
That is their 16th title.
Saw You people there,
uh,

724
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.850
around the fucking league who keep looking.
I don't know.
And nobody,

725
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.970
I asked this question why they don't count NFL fucking titles and nobody gave me

726
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.140
a decent explanation.

727
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.420
They raise good people fucking shoved back.
Then I got shit like that.

728
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:32.160
I got shit like urge because you're do merger,

729
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.410
dumb shit like that.
Right?

730
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:37.920
That just made a lot of sports guys perk their fucking ears up.
Yeah,

731
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:42.060
that is right.
That he's worried he's cause the merger.
Is it?
Is that why?
It is.

732
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:46.020
It's a fucking stupid reason because nobody else did that when they had a
merger.

733
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.423
<v 8>You know,</v>

734
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:54.480
<v 6>the NHL had six teams for fucking ever in 1967 they added the expansion.</v>

735
00:46:55.091 --> 00:46:58.480
Six,
they doubled the size of their fucking league.

736
00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.450
No other league has done that one year ever.
Okay.

737
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.900
They didn't tell Montreal and Toronto to go fuck themselves with all their cups.

738
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:09.070
Montreal used to win him back.
You know when they used to play in a pond,

739
00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:13.480
the Stanley Cup was the size of like a fucking shot glass.
They count those.

740
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:20.780
The fucking Chicago cubs had been waiting since 1907 I don't fucking understand

741
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:24.630
it.
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit.
Okay.

742
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.170
And later on in this podcast,
I'm,
you know what?
Fuck it.

743
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:32.230
I'm going to read it right now.
All right.
This is basically how it went down.

744
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:36.850
All right.
And I know why you all you fucking sports nerds out there by the way,

745
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.060
I want you guys to debunk my,
my,
my way of thinking here.
Okay.

746
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.020
Cause you look at the,
the Los Angeles Lakers to,

747
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.890
or their NBA championships are not even,
they weren't even one in the NBA.

748
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.400
They were one in a league called the BBA,

749
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.980
which then merged with some of that.
Then became the NBA.
I mean,

750
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:02.380
you want to talk about patting your fucking stats.

751
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.430
You got every at the Lakers can get away with that shit and act like they're one

752
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:10.510
title away
from the fucking Celtics.

753
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:15.070
If they can get away with that horse shit with that Hanky that they put up with

754
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:17.680
five fucking titles on it.
Right.
It's funny.

755
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:21.490
Every other championship banner they have hanging on their wall,
it just says,

756
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.840
you know,
NBA champion,
1980 NBA champion,

757
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:29.290
1985 right.
They just have,
it's,

758
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.580
it's its own flag.
Then they got this one little fucking Hanky.

759
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:34.870
Okay.

760
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.710
Which should be a big slice of fucking toilet paper that they got five fucking

761
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:39.760
championships on.

762
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.100
I think Schempp played on one of those goddamn teams.
It's fucking ridiculous,

763
00:48:45.101 --> 00:48:47.020
but if they can get away with that,
I'm telling you,

764
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.300
I'm counting from here on out.
I'm counting NFL titles.

765
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.360
All right.
I'm going to start a movement.
Okay.

766
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:57.520
If I can't close down the fucking Federal Reserve,

767
00:48:57.521 --> 00:49:01.110
at least I can make this thing right in this goddamn country.
Okay.
Here,

768
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.340
here's how it goes.
All right?

769
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:07.780
Just if you want to know Green Bay's on top.
All right?

770
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:12.100
This is how it works.
Okay.
1920s when the NFL started,
all right,

771
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:14.200
from 1920 to 1932,

772
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:19.410
they had the league championship and it was determined by team wins and loss

773
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.880
percentages with ties admitted.

774
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.810
And then in 1932 because of a tie in the final standings,

775
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:28.990
a playoff game was played to determine the championship.

776
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:34.230
And from 1933 on that was called the NFL championship game,

777
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.050
all right?
That's how it fucking worked.

778
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.900
Okay.
And all these teams,

779
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:43.510
including the fucking Steelers played and played back then.

780
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:47.410
So they had an opportunity to win titles,
which they did not.
So here we go.

781
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.360
Here's how it goes down in the most successful teams from back then.
All right?

782
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.230
Uh,
the Green Bay packers,

783
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.920
they won nine NFL championships in three league titles for a total of fucking

784
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:04.210
was at 93,
the one 12th.
Um,
fuck it.
I didn't put these in in,

785
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:06.880
in uh,
any sort of chronological order here,
so I just got to read them.

786
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:11.020
The colts won for NFL championships.
All right.

787
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.380
And then another two Superbowls.
So they got six total.

788
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.890
The giants won New York giants,
New York football giants,

789
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.420
one for NFL titles plus three Superbowls.
So they got seven,

790
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.860
they got seven fucking championships.
You know,
they,

791
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.130
they sit there and walking around

792
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.940
like they only got three like to hang in there with my patriots.

793
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:37.150
Then that they got twice as many as us plus one Chicago bears won nine NFL

794
00:50:37.311 --> 00:50:41.600
fucking championships plus one Superbowl for a grand total of a,

795
00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:46.280
of 10.
Uh,
the cardinals,
I've lost,

796
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.160
this is why I'm ranked number 52.
I've lost so many listeners at this point,

797
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:51.680
but don't give a fuck.
Chicago cardinals,

798
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.870
which then became the Saint Louis Cardinals,

799
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.940
which then became the Arizona cardinals.

800
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.330
They won one league in one NFL title.

801
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.090
And if you want to go to an Arizona cardinals game,

802
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:07.390
and if you want to fucking chant a year at those fucking retired George

803
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.830
Mcgovern,
Republican conce a 1947 that's the year you want a chance at them.

804
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:17.090
1947 right?
The lines one for NFL championships,

805
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.060
I forget when the last one I have the wrong year.

806
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:24.140
Written down was 1950 [inaudible] Cleveland Rams,

807
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.630
which then became the La rams in 1946 and then became the Saint Louis Rams in 19

808
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:31.880
fucking 95 I know,
I sound like the rain man.

809
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.710
They have one three NFL championships plus one Superbowl for a grand total of

810
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:39.390
four.
Here's my favorite one.

811
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.040
And the Cleveland browns they want for NFL titles.

812
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.250
All right.
And before that,

813
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:50.660
they weren't for all American football conference titles.

814
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:51.891
All right.

815
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:55.070
And there were three teams that were in the All American football conference

816
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:59.120
that merged with the NFL in 1950 and I'm not counting those championships,

817
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:01.100
by the way,
the all American football conference.

818
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.710
I wouldn't count those because that wasn't in the NFL.

819
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.370
That would be like the Lakers counting those BBA fucking championships.

820
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:08.900
Um,

821
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.900
the all American football concert conference existed from 1946 to 1949 they had

822
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:17.810
four championship games and the fucking Cleveland browns when all four,

823
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.430
they dominated that league,

824
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:23.510
that league merge with the NFL in 1950 and they took three teams with them.

825
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.390
The browns,
the cults,
and the 40 niners.
All right,

826
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:30.830
we're continuing and we've got a couple more here.
The Philadelphia Eagles,
one,

827
00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:34.490
three,
three NFL titles.
Last one's 1960.

828
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:36.560
That's what you want a chance at those angry bastards.

829
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:41.030
And then good luck to you after that.
40 niners one zero and five Superbowls,

830
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:45.510
Steelers one zero NFL titles and have six Superbowls.

831
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:50.360
So there you go for all you sports nerds out there.
That's the deal.

832
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.510
All right?
So I don't want to fucking hear any of this.

833
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.930
Any acting like those things don't count.
They do count.

834
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.060
That was the best of the best back then.

835
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:03.410
And they went through all the same bullshit as every other fucking league with.

836
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:07.070
Oh,
but they didn't let black guys play back then.
So what,
so what?

837
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.860
Every other sport counts,
those fucking things.
So,
um,
I didn't want to help.

838
00:53:11.861 --> 00:53:13.280
My goddamn point was,
but,
uh,

839
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:17.240
you know what I did want to read to continue with,

840
00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.910
I'll get back to the stats in a minute,
but can I,
Hey,

841
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:23.330
can actually bring up something here about the super bowl.
Um,

842
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.220
what was going on with the beginning

843
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.990
<v 9>of the game this year with those fucking whaling whores that they brought out to</v>

844
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:34.230
sing every song that,
that ever about America.

845
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:36.343
<v 8>You know,</v>

846
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.340
<v 9>they brought that chick from fucking glee who tried to make America the</v>

847
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:42.450
beautiful,
sexy.

848
00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.300
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

849
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:48.760
<v 9>Well,
what,
what is it?
Oh,
our singing amazing grace.
Amazing grace.</v>

850
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:53.290
They get a little as they slide into the fucking line.
All right?

851
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.480
She should have been booted right in the box and a Christina Aguilera,
right?

852
00:53:58.481 --> 00:54:01.480
Then she comes out with their booze face.
Say,

853
00:54:01.481 --> 00:54:04.750
that's why I let I've been laying off the booze,
man.
That's it right there.

854
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.170
That's not baby weight.
All right.
That chick likes or bear.

855
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.910
She came out there and,
uh,
I loved her though.

856
00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:17.050
I like how she sort of freestyle the national anthem.
You know what I mean?

857
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.770
Who can honestly remember those words and let's just sing it with somebody else.

858
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.420
That's a really difficult thing to do.
She was just out there and this

859
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.080
<v 10>stars then the free no.</v>

860
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:30.440
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

861
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.150
<v 10>Hey could talk</v>

862
00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.080
[inaudible] let's go.
[inaudible]

863
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:41.740
<v 6>something else.
American.</v>

864
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:47.830
And the flag was still there.

865
00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:54.910
Um,
so what,
I mean,
how long did that,
you know,

866
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:59.680
what kills me was I looked on my cable thing and it said Super Bowl pregame.

867
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.460
All right.
Out here,
the super bowl comes on at three in the afternoon.

868
00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:08.461
So I see from fucking like 12 noon to like three is the pregame.

869
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.120
I don't want to see that shit.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

870
00:55:13.121 --> 00:55:16.450
I don't really see people break down the game.
The keys to the game.

871
00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:21.190
I could give a fuck.
All right.
They're never right.
I don't give a shit.

872
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.680
I just don't care.
So I'm like,
okay,

873
00:55:23.681 --> 00:55:25.960
the game starts at three and then I go to put it on.

874
00:55:25.961 --> 00:55:30.040
And what do they have more of this pomp and fucking circumstance.

875
00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:35.041
And I don't like how they got to sing like 58 songs about fucking,

876
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.380
I understand that it's in America,

877
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.480
it's obnoxious.

878
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.840
Jesus Christ with the fucking songs and then the,

879
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.500
and then they got to make them laugh every time you think they're done,

880
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.600
they got to add a couple to the fucking line and you just sit there and I don't

881
00:55:52.601 --> 00:55:52.841
get it.

882
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:57.841
It's the most important game of the NFL season and they just drag out one douche

883
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.390
bag after another.
It has nothing to do with the game on.

884
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.020
By the time the game starts,
it's like,
I don't even give a shit,
you know?
Um,

885
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:12.070
but at least Deion Sanders dressed up for the game.
Jesus Christ,
man,

886
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:14.290
that guy really was showing his age.

887
00:56:14.291 --> 00:56:18.490
How can you be that flashy and fuck up that bad?
You know what I mean?

888
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:22.540
It was like he picked out that shirt and tie and right before he went out there,

889
00:56:22.541 --> 00:56:24.250
somebody coffee all over it.

890
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:28.360
I think he had like a white suit and then he just went to the nearest like tire

891
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:32.160
salesman,
Eh,
you know,
once you give me a,
excuse me,
this brown suit,

892
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:33.410
I'll just put it over this,
uh,

893
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:39.420
this candy canes striped shirt with the fucking tie.
Um,
anyways,
let me,

894
00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:44.010
let me get,
let me get to some stats on the past fucking week here.
I actually,

895
00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:47.280
I actually took the Steelers in the over just cause I knew everyone was going to

896
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:50.250
pick the packers in the under.
I don't even know what the fuck was.

897
00:56:50.251 --> 00:56:53.070
I lost 25 bucks.
That was my big thing.
You know what?

898
00:56:53.071 --> 00:56:57.780
This is the first time the fucking podcast officially hit a goddamn speed bump

899
00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:02.670
here.
All Right,
Bill,
I'm emailing you.
So we didn't my stats last week,

900
00:57:02.671 --> 00:57:07.080
how many times I said fuck on the podcast.
This was pretty staggering.
So bill,

901
00:57:07.081 --> 00:57:07.710
I email,

902
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:11.370
I'm emailing you to inform you that I served as your personal status Titian

903
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:16.650
statistician during your previous podcast on January 31st,
2011.

904
00:57:16.651 --> 00:57:20.670
I documented each and every time you said the word fuck or some variants of the

905
00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:25.290
word,
I must say,
you are in a goddamn league of your own.
Thank you.
Uh,

906
00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:30.180
you're the podcasting f bomb dropping equivalent of fucking wilt Chamberlain in

907
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.860
1962.
Um,
all right,
let's get to,
um,

908
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.610
anyways,
he said,
uh,

909
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.440
it's kind of ironic that a patio in the back in a way for this feat because the,

910
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.940
through a little research I discovered that you used to pride yourself on a

911
00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:51.900
clean bit during the early stages of your career.
Yeah,
I did.

912
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.610
I had to figure out if I could be funny without Carson.

913
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:59.350
Now once I proved to myself that I could,
I was then free to be myself.

914
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.230
Um,
who's a cozy smug can't.
Um,
despite that fact,
he said,

915
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:09.610
it's obvious that you're off the wagon and fucking shit up on a whole nother

916
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:12.220
level.
Nowadays your numbers are fucking astonishing.

917
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.260
You might as well throw on some red,

918
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.210
red leather pants and a gold chain cause your volt,

919
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:23.170
you're vulgarity is reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's,
uh,

920
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.540
in the 1980s,
you transparent bastard.

921
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.650
I'll list a few of your milestones below and then elaborate on just how

922
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:33.580
revolutionary earth shattering your last podcast was.
All right.
This is actually,

923
00:58:33.581 --> 00:58:37.780
I was kind of amazed by this.
Uh,
first usage of the word fuck occurred.

924
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:42.130
38 seconds into the podcast.
You hit the century mark.

925
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.810
17 minutes in this stat is mind boggling to me.
It took you little [inaudible],

926
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.400
little over the equivalent of one quarter of football to drop a hundred f bombs.

927
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.500
You did this almost leisurely too.
You're a fucking juggernaut.

928
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:59.800
I can only imagine the damage you do while watching a real quarter of football,

929
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:04.260
all sauced up on the juice.
So anyways,
I guess I,
I,
uh,

930
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:09.300
last week Mike podcast was 73 minutes and I said the f word 347 times.

931
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.100
Jesus Christ.

932
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:20.020
You used roughly a year's worth of cuss words in a little over an hour.
Come on,

933
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:23.330
dude.
If you use F word,
there's no way you say it once a day.

934
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:29.510
Um,
all right,
that's 4.753 uses per minute.

935
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.680
You make Andrew dice clay and Bob Saget stuff.
Look PG 13,

936
00:59:33.681 --> 00:59:37.940
I'd argue that first half breakdown in the first 36 and a half minutes.

937
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.480
I used it 210 times in the second half.

938
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.650
137 look at that.
I slowed down after the all star break.

939
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.690
Everybody thought I was going to be the first guy to break 400 and I didn't.
Um,

940
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.480
so this guy actually,
uh,
made a graph of it.

941
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.040
First of all,
if I can figure out how to download this,
I downloaded,

942
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.340
I can't find it in my computer.

943
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:06.670
He has the marker with next to is the sharpie with his headphones and all that.

944
01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:10.310
Like he's counting off days in prison,
345 little slashes,

945
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:11.480
they're in groups of five.

946
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.430
And then he compared me to some of the most vulgar movies of all time.

947
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.680
Um,
uses per minute.

948
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:22.810
I'd beat out Casino Martin Lawrence live good fellas,

949
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.100
menace to society.
Eddie Murphy delirious,

950
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.160
the big Lebowski and pulp fiction and then total counts of movies.

951
01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:34.010
I came in second behind casino,
but in my defense that's like a two hour movie.

952
01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:36.710
So fuck them.
Um,
there you go.

953
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.990
Is that enough stats for you in the first 20 minutes?

954
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:42.590
Jesus Christ can be ranked like 700 at this point.
Um,

955
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.490
so anyways,
what the hell was my,
uh,
my week,

956
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:51.410
like I got over my road aids just to let you guys know I got over it.

957
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.990
I,
uh,
I dunno,

958
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:58.370
it just kept getting worse till like Friday and,
uh,

959
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.400
it's all,
cause I forgot my vitamins.
I told you guys,
I,

960
01:01:02.401 --> 01:01:05.600
I booked some acting work right for tomorrow.
So what do I do?

961
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.140
I'm getting ready for the Superbowl.
Okay.
My Pay Patriots got beaten by the jet,

962
01:01:09.141 --> 01:01:13.220
so I don't give a shit.
Um,
and I know I said I wouldn't trach Rex Ryan,

963
01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:17.690
but for some reason I couldn't resist and I had to watch his post,
uh,

964
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.000
game,
uh,
lost to the Steelers speech and just,
you know,

965
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.630
it just drove me nuts.
He was like,
you know,

966
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
you know,
a lot of people are gonna want to criticize us and they can,

967
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:34.160
but you know,
they don't have,
they don't have any.
Right.

968
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.180
It's just why don't they have a right,
he's like,
just team's been through a lot.

969
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:45.050
Yeah.
You created most of it with your shit-talking.

970
01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.590
You Shit talked the whole way the whole fucking year.

971
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.090
And you'll get said you were going to win the super bowl.

972
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.820
You wrote at the side of the Pos and you didn't.

973
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:56.930
Why do you feel people don't have a right to give you shit at that point?

974
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.450
It's fucking annoying in your here yet.
Oh good.

975
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.110
You have the shame niche going to be the shame.

976
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.510
I'll have the same goal.

977
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.260
You know what I hate about that count is one year he's finally going to win it

978
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:12.560
and be like,
dude,
what?
I say what I say?
You know what you said,
rex?

979
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:15.860
The same thing you say every fucking day.
So stop acting like you called it.

980
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.070
I can't stand that shit that drives me nuts.
You're fucking wrong.

981
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.110
Just be a man about it.
Be like,
yeah,

982
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:24.180
I talked a lot of shit this year and I was fucking wrong.

983
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:25.950
So I'm here to take my medicine,

984
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:30.870
<v 9>you know,
such a fucking fat bitch.
Um,</v>

985
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.093
anyways,

986
01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.090
<v 6>so I'm getting ready for the,
uh,</v>

987
01:02:34.091 --> 01:02:36.260
I'm getting ready for the Superbowl and I don't give a fuck right to the

988
01:02:36.261 --> 01:02:38.840
Steelers.
It's the packers.
I don't give a shit.

989
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.520
<v 9>I can give a flying fuck about this game.
You know,
I don't,
I don't care.</v>

990
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.660
Neither one of those teams has ever done anything really do the Patriots.

991
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.410
I guess the packers beat us in [inaudible] 97,
but who gives a fuck?

992
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:53.580
We weren't supposed to win that game.

993
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:56.730
That was Brett Farve number that young Brett Farve.

994
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:01.100
He had brown hair and then he,
he,
he threw that first touchdown pass.

995
01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.830
Did he took his helmet off and ran and when,
yeah.

996
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:05.200
<v 6>Uhuh</v>

997
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.910
<v 9>over to the sideline.
You remember that?</v>

998
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.660
And they actually had to make a rule that you can't do that anymore because he

999
01:03:10.661 --> 01:03:14.730
was so blatantly trying to get some sort of,
yeah.

1000
01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.660
<v 6>National,
commercial.
Woo.</v>

1001
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.100
<v 9>Um,
yeah,
I'll tell you,
he just loves the game.</v>

1002
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:23.050
That guy just loves playing the game.
Oh,

1003
01:03:23.051 --> 01:03:27.160
how funny was it when the big Lebowski guy with the fucking most insane mustache

1004
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:30.970
ever when he did those voiceovers people of Pittsburgh,

1005
01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:35.950
are you tired of them acting like people still work in steel mills out there?

1006
01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.880
You know,
cause I have to admit as,
as a a fan from Boston,

1007
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.330
anytime they do anything about New England,

1008
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.390
they show a lighthouse and a fucking lobster fishermen.

1009
01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.840
And I lived there for 27 years and I never met anyone who worked in a fucking

1010
01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:56.680
lighthouse,
ran a lighthouse or even worked on a fucking lobster boat.
Nobody,

1011
01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.780
you know.
And I didn't like clam chowder.
I thought it looked like a,

1012
01:04:01.781 --> 01:04:06.340
it just looked like a curdled milk.
Get Out.
Look Gross.

1013
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.440
I didn't like it.
But yeah,

1014
01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:10.570
they're just sitting there talking about Pittsburgh going,

1015
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:15.860
<v 6>yeah,
this,
we're Pittsburgh's a tough town built on steel.</v>

1016
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.770
And when you're Pittsburgh,
if you get hit by a bus,

1017
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:21.600
your mother calls you a faggot.

1018
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:27.210
<v 9>Right?
Sorry,
I got a little bit of the aids left.</v>

1019
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:32.140
Um,
I,
I fucking hate that shit.
And then they go up green bay,
green

1020
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:35.120
<v 6>basis.
Same Shit is itself a can place.</v>

1021
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:40.630
People used to pack shit up in Green Bay and Green Bay when this pack and it'd

1022
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:45.910
be done.
You don't have to look too far to find somebody to Pax Upton.

1023
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.390
<v 9>You know.
I just wish they would be more honest.
You know</v>

1024
01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.580
<v 6>this place used to have a bunch of steel mills.
Now they all closed down,</v>

1025
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.490
they're all rusted,
half of got turned into malls.

1026
01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Now there's a bunch of half fags sitting in cubicles looking at spreadsheets of

1027
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.450
Wisconsin.

1028
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:10.550
You got a bunch your fat fucks that are the God damn fucking pasty and they got

1029
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:13.790
read shit on their face from the goddamn cold.

1030
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.250
Ain't shit been packed up here since 40 before Nafta.

1031
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.470
They are bunch of cheesy in fat flux.
This is,
I'll let God for the love of God,

1032
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:26.770
let the packers win.
Why don't they do shit like that?
Could they do that?

1033
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:29.830
Then I'd watch it then I wouldn't have it on fucking mute.
You know,

1034
01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.680
it'd be a nice break between whaling whores singing songs about America.

1035
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.660
My car cheats.
Here's a thing

1036
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:48.070
that diva shit.
Ah,
cause Christina Aguilera.

1037
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:52.270
How bout some P90x baby?
Good Lord.

1038
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.690
I don't give a fuck.
She had a kid.

1039
01:05:55.810 --> 01:06:00.400
You're still in your 20s go hit the fuck a treadmill.
What happened?
You know,

1040
01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.950
that's the danger.
That's the danger.
You know?

1041
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.090
That's why I'm so glad you know I had a choice at some point in my career to

1042
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:11.710
become a sex symbol and I was just like,
you know what?
I'm not going to do it.

1043
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:16.990
You know,
cause there's only one way to go.
Just go down.
I did people,

1044
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:19.630
I actually had the opportunity

1045
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.280
to become Hollywood's first male redheaded sex symbol.

1046
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.820
All right,
I know what you're thinking.

1047
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.840
What about that fucking pasty freckled last client who was on on an YPD blue

1048
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:36.370
fuck this whole career up.
What about that guy?

1049
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:41.140
I have been in this business since before he fucked up his career.

1050
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.010
Do you understand that people,

1051
01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:47.011
do you realize on March 2nd I am going to be celebrating my 19th year of

1052
01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:50.860
traveling to strip malls,
making people laugh,

1053
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:55.030
giggle that my little wacky view of the world,

1054
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.460
it's pretty fucking depressing.
I can't believe it,
man.
I remember when I,

1055
01:06:59.461 --> 01:07:02.020
when I was,
when I was a fucking kid,
when I got in this business,

1056
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:05.050
when I looked at some of them are doing it 17 years,
I used to look at him like,

1057
01:07:05.051 --> 01:07:07.660
dude,
fucking hang it up because it is over.

1058
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:13.420
It is fucking over.
You are not making it buddy.

1059
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.640
Okay.
Maybe that's why you're sweating right through your fucking sport coat.

1060
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.470
Jesus.
I started in 1992 that's right.

1061
01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:27.060
So if there was a 17 year fucking veteran,
not Jesus,

1062
01:07:27.061 --> 01:07:29.810
I got to do math now.
That would be that.

1063
01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:34.290
That would mean they started in 1975 if I worked with somebody in 1992 when they

1064
01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:39.150
started in 1975 I would bitch be like,
dude,
wow.

1065
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.080
What was that like?
What was it like?
You know?

1066
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1067
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.260
<v 6>Drive into F,
you know,
I don't know what,
what the fuck you guys did back then?</v>

1068
01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.110
Flying on planes with propellers.
What,
what happened?

1069
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.040
And now I don't know what happened.
I'm 19 years into this shit.

1070
01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.470
And I realize now why those guys 17 years in and didn't quit because when you

1071
01:08:00.471 --> 01:08:05.471
have a 17 to 19 year gap in your resume,

1072
01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:08.840
you know from the last time you actually had a day job,

1073
01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.960
excuse me.
Um,
yeah,
you're done.

1074
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.370
<v 9>You don't know what's going to hire.
What are I going to hire me to do?
Sell cars.</v>

1075
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.460
What have you been doing since 1992?
It was kind of,
it was kind of a country.
Uh,

1076
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:28.790
I have three and a half years of podcasts where I say some of the most horrific

1077
01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:32.540
shit ever.
There was any sort of corporate job.
Right.

1078
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.840
Why the hell would I want to work for them anyways?
You know,

1079
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.290
become part of the murder or whatever the fuck it is that you're doing.

1080
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.130
There is always some sort of killing going on when you work for corporation,

1081
01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:47.510
you know,
it is,
if you follow it and then you sit there lying to yourself.
Well,

1082
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:51.100
you know,
I just shine the gun.
I don't pull it

1083
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.780
<v 3>trigger,
you know,
ah,</v>

1084
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:00.800
<v 9>it's the fucking worst.
Um,
yeah.
So I've been doing it 19 years.</v>

1085
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:03.110
There's really no turning back for me.

1086
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:07.250
And if for some reason the bottom falls out,

1087
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.430
I don't know what I would do.
I have no idea.

1088
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.180
No fucking idea what I would do with,

1089
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.350
which is why I don't think about this type of shit.

1090
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.740
So I got 19 fucking years in.

1091
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.740
That's unbelievable to me.
I remember when I hit 10 years in,
I was like,

1092
01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:27.500
Jesus,
I used to look at guys like 12,

1093
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.570
13 years in when I had like eight got man,
they've been doing it a while.

1094
01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:36.650
They have to make it now.
They better make it now.
It's fucking over.

1095
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.330
Um,
so I don't know what I'm saying.
You know,

1096
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:43.970
which probably brings up the question.
You like bill.
Do you think you made it?

1097
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.260
Like what is,
what is it that makes you feel like,
you know what,
I,
I think I did.

1098
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:52.160
I did write the fuck.

1099
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.290
I didn't have high look.
I must fucking see student.
Okay.

1100
01:09:57.291 --> 01:10:01.160
So my goals aren't that high.
I look at it like I made that book glee this week.

1101
01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.130
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1102
01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:10.570
<v 9>Oh Shit.
I gotta get a puppet people.
I got to do it,
man.</v>

1103
01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:13.150
I gotta make it.
I have one year to make it.

1104
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.530
If I don't fucking make it in the next year,
20 fucking years in,

1105
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:18.700
I'll tell you right now.

1106
01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:22.600
You better build an extension to your Goddamn cubicle people cause I'm showing

1107
01:10:22.601 --> 01:10:26.620
up now.
I can't do it.
I left the program.

1108
01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.720
I'm like fucking uh,
uh,

1109
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:31.600
what's his Marlon Brando's character in a Papa Parker Lips.

1110
01:10:31.601 --> 01:10:35.560
Now I'm all the way up the river.
It's over.
All right.
I got a head on the stick.

1111
01:10:35.561 --> 01:10:36.610
There's no fucking way.

1112
01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:39.670
There's no way I could ever go back in and get a real job.

1113
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:44.800
I'd have to have a kid and be like,
I'm doing it for him or her.
Right.

1114
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.210
That's the only way I could,

1115
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.860
there's no fucking way I could go in there and have somebody.

1116
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:55.840
Oh,
Bill,
all my notice.
You came in at nine oh eight this morning.

1117
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.650
Yeah.
Did you,
did you notice anything else?

1118
01:10:59.651 --> 01:11:02.620
Like how fucked up that tires you have?
Like immediately I would just go to that.

1119
01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:07.390
Actually.
I wouldn't look at me,
try to paint myself like I'm a bad ass.

1120
01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:09.450
I wouldn't,
I'd be like,
Oh yes.

1121
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.280
So I immediately go into that traffic and you know,

1122
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:19.310
just become that guy and hate myself and take it out on some sweet lady of work

1123
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:22.620
next to me.
He's been with the company for 25 years,
you know,

1124
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.300
she's never missed a day.
Yeah.
It's cause she's stealing from the company.

1125
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:30.240
You dumb fucks.
Um,
she's too afraid to take a day off.

1126
01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.680
Do you ever think about that?
All right,
let's get,
let's get to some topics there.

1127
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:38.660
So once again,
congratulations to the Green Bay packers.
All right.

1128
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:43.140
Up there in Green Bay,
when you live off water,
the Great Lakes,

1129
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:46.470
you better take your Dick and wrap it around your balls because there,

1130
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.000
there no room for pussies.
Sorry.

1131
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.110
Um,
I better serve my voice.
See,
this is,

1132
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:58.140
this is a type of self sabotage and that's been part of my career for the last

1133
01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:00.440
19 years.
I do shit like this.
I should,
you know,

1134
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:05.470
I should've just be thinking of myself and say fuck you guys in the 52nd rank

1135
01:12:06.181 --> 01:12:09.930
podcast on iTunes.
I should be resting up on my voice.

1136
01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:13.830
That's what I should be fucking doing.
But I'm not,
I'm not,
this is,
this is,

1137
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:18.740
this is what I,
you know,
I don't know why I just had a thought.

1138
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:20.100
Oh,
I,
this is my thought I had.

1139
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.830
So I'm getting ready to go super bowl right and don't give a fuck about in the

1140
01:12:22.831 --> 01:12:25.650
team.
And so I'm going to go make a couple of burgers.

1141
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.770
So I've been using this natural goddamn charcoal,
which is great.

1142
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:30.600
Doesn't have that chemical shit on it.
You know,

1143
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:33.810
you know that shit when you're really hungry,
if he,
if you use that,

1144
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:37.890
that match light stuff is,
you throw the Patty on too early at your tastes,

1145
01:12:37.891 --> 01:12:41.670
the lighter fluid fluid in,
in,
in your burger.
Um,

1146
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.220
so I'm using the natural stuff,

1147
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:48.240
which takes longer to light and it's more of a pain in the ass when you get down

1148
01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:49.620
to the bottom of the bag.

1149
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:53.490
The pieces are too fucking small or he got one giant piece.

1150
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.900
So I take out one giant piece.
It's like I'm not breaking this motherfucker up.

1151
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.440
Long story short,
I couldn't get any sizzle,
a mark resole.
All right.

1152
01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.900
And I'm starving.
So my girls like,
well,
why don't we just make it?

1153
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:11.670
Why don't we just make it on,
on the,
on the,
on the stove top.
It's like,
I'm like,

1154
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:16.110
because I'm a man.
That's why,
because they can't admit the feet.

1155
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:18.000
I can admit the fact that what I'm doing,

1156
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:21.300
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.
All right.

1157
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.700
So I just added more fuel to the damn fire.

1158
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:28.500
So then they throw these fucking patties on
is what I do.

1159
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:33.060
And uh,
I make these two fucking things.

1160
01:13:33.061 --> 01:13:35.700
I melt the cheese and I think everything's going on right now,

1161
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:40.410
but I'm doing it like I had some sizzle on my [inaudible].
You like that?

1162
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:45.030
That's where a little hip hop night for this week.
And evidently I didn't.
So I,
I,

1163
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.953
you know,

1164
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.900
rather than cutting in and making sure everything was done it then they just

1165
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:52.440
take these motherfuckers off.
Okay.
And they're like the size,
you know,

1166
01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:54.570
twice the size of Mcdonald's burgers.
It's just the little ones.

1167
01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:56.790
I don't give a fuck.
Right.
So I take it off the grill,

1168
01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.750
I put what I put on my burgers,
which is just catch up and pickle.

1169
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.350
They keep it fucking simple.
Alright.
Slice the motherfucker and half.

1170
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.850
And I look in the inside of it looks like raw meat and immediately my brain
goes,

1171
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:12.010
don't eat that shit.
Okay,
you're going to get a call.
Like you have to take glee

1172
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.750
<v 6>tomorrow.
How can you sing with a deadly virus society?
You,</v>

1173
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.940
you just got overrode age.
Okay,

1174
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:23.650
let's not had a cold light to this for.
What do I do?

1175
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:26.320
I don't give a fuck.
I just eat the gut damn thing.
You know,

1176
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.370
eight the fucking thing.
I smell like smoke.
I got,

1177
01:14:30.371 --> 01:14:34.480
I'm taking a shower and I'm in that just waiting for this feeling of fucking

1178
01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:38.380
death.
You know?
Fortunately it never hit me,
but you know why?
Why,

1179
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:42.130
why would I do something like that?
Self sabotage.

1180
01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.770
Stupid,
you know,

1181
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.950
that's why I never booked an episode of Caroline in the city.

1182
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.650
I mean I booked one but a a,

1183
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:54.200
you know I fucking night I got Sam and um,
all right.

1184
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.130
You know what people that story wouldn't know where I'm up.
I apologize.

1185
01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:59.470
So you know,
I think it's time to bring a guest onto the show.

1186
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.260
I'm going to hit pause here on the recording cause I've got to set up the

1187
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:04.330
microphone.
We're going to bring my lovely girlfriend and,

1188
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:09.370
and she's going to contribute on this week for [inaudible] of um,

1189
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.490
is it racist,
racist,
racist?

1190
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:19.380
<v 9>Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time.
Once again for,</v>

1191
01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:24.120
is it racist,
racist,
racist?
Yes.
Um,
and this time,

1192
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.490
this time I am joined by my lovely girlfriend,
Nia.

1193
01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:33.360
How are you sweetheart?
I'm great sweetie.
How are you?
I'm fantastic.

1194
01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:36.600
Let's not be too nice to each other.
Okay.
Because of my listeners,
you know,

1195
01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:40.860
I find out this week I'm ranked 52nd on the podcast on iTunes.

1196
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.740
Out of how many?
Like 63.

1197
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.420
[inaudible] no,
I don't.
I don't know how many there are.

1198
01:15:48.421 --> 01:15:52.500
I know everybody has a pot.
You're getting there,
baby.
See that?
All right,

1199
01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:57.180
well here we go.
We're gonna.
We're gonna.
We're gonna bring you in here and uh,

1200
01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:01.560
and I,
you know,
you gotta hand it to me,
Huh?
Um,
for what?
Well,
you know,

1201
01:16:01.561 --> 01:16:06.050
I booked glee this week.
Oh,
that's right.
I know.
I'm so excited about that.

1202
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:11.030
Now I'm nervous about my dancing.
I'm all right with my singing.
The,
the,

1203
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:15.490
no,
we've been working on your pot of arrays,
so I felt pretty confident.

1204
01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:20.400
Fuck that.
There we go.
All right.
Uh,
this guy wrote from our Byu.

1205
01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:25.170
Are you familiar with Byu?
Brigham Young University?
This is the Mormon.

1206
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:29.820
You know those people,
right?
Yeah.
They're wild and out out there.
Right?

1207
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:31.320
While an hour while I'm out,

1208
01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:34.650
they have like 12 wives each skirts down to their ankles,

1209
01:16:34.651 --> 01:16:38.910
skirts down to their ankles,
and they don't lose up to their chin.
Yeah.

1210
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.670
They're all versions before they get married vaginally.
Right.

1211
01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:47.300
Let me just have anal.
That's how they do it.
That's your tie,

1212
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:51.260
everybody that the salt flats.
And you've seen that fucking sit that state.

1213
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:56.310
All right.
Byu Is this racist?
He says,
Bill,
is it racist to root for Byu?

1214
01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:01.410
This is the college because they have the best scorer.
Glen Falls,

1215
01:17:01.411 --> 01:17:04.380
finest white boy.
Uh,

1216
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.970
they start four white kids in total in our eighth.
In the note in the,

1217
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.010
because

1218
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.670
<v 11>I do so evidently this guy's white and he's rooting for,</v>

1219
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:17.480
uh,
this white basketball team.

1220
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:21.420
Basically they start four white guys and one of the highest number one scores in

1221
01:17:21.421 --> 01:17:25.430
a league is white and he's white.
Is it rate?
Is it racist?
Racist.

1222
01:17:25.431 --> 01:17:29.510
Because why don't you just use the effect of your garage band?

1223
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.920
Because it takes too much fucking time.
Um,
plus I think it sounds better.

1224
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.960
Braces.
Braces.
Yes.
Yes,
yes.
See,
I can do it.
Um,

1225
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:45.260
is it racist that a white guy is white for white people on a white team full of

1226
01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:50.120
white people?
Do I invite things playing white beliefs?
Play basketball?
No,

1227
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:52.550
it is not racist.
Is Not Racist.
Okay.
And why?

1228
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.040
Because it has nothing to do with race.

1229
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:57.780
It's not like he's saying that it has everything to do with race.

1230
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.580
It's not like he's saying like,
you know,
fuck black people.

1231
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:06.140
They can't play basketball is white people.
White people own,
that's what it is.

1232
01:18:06.141 --> 01:18:10.100
You know?
It's not like that.
He just likes the white people.
This is what,

1233
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:12.650
this is what I think.
I think if you,

1234
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.680
if your people traditionally shock at something or have been prevented from

1235
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:23.180
doing something,
then it's okay for you to root for your guy.
Okay.

1236
01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:26.750
Now that is nobody prevented.
Why people from playing basketball.

1237
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.260
We just sort of sucked at it for awhile.

1238
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.300
I don't understand why cause we can't jump.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I'm,

1239
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:39.200
I don't understand why he thinks that that would even be in the racist category

1240
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:43.700
because we get in trouble for everything because he's rooting for it.
He's like,

1241
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:45.350
I like this team.
I'm rooting for them,

1242
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:49.550
but I don't want people to think I'm racist.
No,
it's because,
look,

1243
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.340
if you're fucking 30 years or younger,

1244
01:18:52.341 --> 01:18:55.160
you don't even remember white people doing a 40 years or younger,

1245
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:58.670
you don't remember is dominating any fucking sports other than hockey.
Right.

1246
01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.810
All right.
And we're starting to creep in on that a little bit that,
you know,

1247
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.410
black people is like,
it's like,
well Brian,

1248
01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.320
when Lebron talks about the scoring title,
yeah,
I remember that.

1249
01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.231
Well you don't watch sports,

1250
01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:12.530
but like Lebron was just like one time they were asking him about the scoring

1251
01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:15.980
title.
They were like,
you know,
what are they about Kobe?
And he said,
look,

1252
01:19:15.981 --> 01:19:20.120
if I wanted to,
if I wanted to,
I could win that fucking thing.

1253
01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:21.560
But he's trying to like,
like I look at,

1254
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:25.610
I look at hockey the same way like a black people want it to.
If you want it to,

1255
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.400
we could dominate hockey.
You could,
I don't know,
you know?
I mean,

1256
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:30.010
how would we know how many calls?

1257
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.620
How many more sports examples do you need?

1258
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.340
How many more sports do you have to fucking take over before you just sort of

1259
01:19:37.341 --> 01:19:41.720
realize,
you know,
you're killing it.

1260
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.860
Yeah.
Now that,
that,
that is not racist.
Yeah.

1261
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.150
I don't think it's racist either because we've been getting dunked on for

1262
01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.690
fucking,
yeah.
I you wants to rule for white people.
That's not racist.
Yeah.

1263
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.470
Okay.
All right,
so there we go.
That's,
that's the first one.
All right,
next one.

1264
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:59.710
This is,
this is a good one here.
Uh,

1265
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.840
racism or ethnic than I fucking now copy that ethnicity.

1266
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:08.040
That's

1267
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.200
<v 9>not what I did this after the super bowl.</v>

1268
01:20:10.201 --> 01:20:13.440
I got Ecolab and recovering from road aids here.

1269
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:16.730
Bill,

1270
01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:20.250
I've been listening to your recent podcasts about racism and had a few questions

1271
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:25.350
pop in my head.
Why do they call your background,
your ethnicity?

1272
01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:30.480
Example?
Spanish,
African American,
Chinese.
But why?

1273
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:34.680
When we tee someone's ethnicity it's called racism.

1274
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:37.800
Maybe it should be called ethnicity or ethnicity.

1275
01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:40.860
I don't know what he's basically saying.

1276
01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:45.861
There is a why if I guess if you go,

1277
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.690
I don't like those German motherfuckers.

1278
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.750
Why would that be considered racist and shouldn't that be,

1279
01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.880
that'll be more of an ethnic thing cause they,

1280
01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:56.070
are there a certain brand of white people?

1281
01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.070
I honestly don't know.
You don't

1282
01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:03.120
<v 11>on understand status question?
No.
No.
I think I'm a little stumped too.</v>

1283
01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:08.121
Like I don't know that I know the difference necessarily between ethnicity and

1284
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:12.910
race.
All right.
Well why don't I know that.
I Dunno.

1285
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.640
Why will tell me,
okay,

1286
01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:19.410
<v 9>well racist,
like,
like a would be like,
um,</v>

1287
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:24.820
um,
uh,
here we go.
Uh,
black people,
white people like look people fro,

1288
01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.450
okay.

1289
01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:30.100
<v 11>People from England,
France,
Germany,
all of them.
Those are white people.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1290
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:35.170
But the ethnicity,
your ethnicity as German?
Irish.
I'm German,
Irish,

1291
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.970
Scottish,
English and French.

1292
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.080
My ethnicity is like African and like a small,

1293
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:45.220
small drop of native American or something.
You Go.
Okay.

1294
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.220
So what was your race?

1295
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.200
<v 9>Racist.
Black,
like I guess basically or African American,
whatever.</v>

1296
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:54.080
Whatever the fuck you fill out.
Right.
Okay.

1297
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:59.710
I guess you say it a lot of times that,
uh,
I don't know what the fuck he saying.

1298
01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:04.510
I think he's saying like if someone like was given shit about Irish people,

1299
01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:06.280
they say it's racist or something like that.

1300
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:10.730
<v 11>Oh,
you're making fun of the ethnicity,
you know,</v>

1301
01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.100
cause you're not trashing all white people,
right.
You're just,

1302
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:17.740
you're just complaining about a certain ethnicity.
Right.

1303
01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.060
As opposed to entire race of people.

1304
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:23.690
Caucasian versus Irish or something.

1305
01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:28.760
Yeah.
I don't fucking know.
I'm trying to get some fire on this topic.

1306
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.320
[inaudible] get you to fucking artist.
You just agree with all of this shit.

1307
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.600
I'm not agreeing with it.
I just,
I don't know why they,

1308
01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:37.250
I don't know why that it's called that either.

1309
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.030
Well you thought my older Asian game that I play,
you said that that was racist,

1310
01:22:41.031 --> 01:22:43.940
right?
Yes.
How,
how is that racist?

1311
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.000
Not The old part.
That's ageist,
but um,
yeah,

1312
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:53.210
cause you said that all Asian people can't drive.
I don't know.
I didn't.

1313
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:56.690
Yes you did.
When did I say that?
You always say that I didn't.

1314
01:22:56.691 --> 01:23:00.680
I said if somebody fucks up in front of me,
those are the two.

1315
01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.650
I'm guessing you don't see how that or Asian,

1316
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.780
you don't see how that you're taking like one group of people in stereotyping

1317
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:12.670
them.
Yes,
I'm definitely stereotyping them.
Oh,

1318
01:23:12.671 --> 01:23:15.850
I see.
But what you're saying is that you're not like I'm noticing Asians are bad

1319
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:20.640
people that Duh,
Duh,
Duh.
Just saying that they can't drive.
So your stereotype,
no,

1320
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:25.600
no pain.
So in the question makes a fucking,
you turn on a highway.

1321
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.880
If it's not an 85 year old guy,
if you had to take your life savings,

1322
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.430
I'm not even saying it's going to be an Asian guy.
What if you had to bet?
Right?

1323
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.750
And if your life was on the fucking line telling you,
I know,

1324
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:44.950
I know in the grand question of his bill burr racist against Asians,

1325
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:49.990
I would say no,
but he does stereotype them really,

1326
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:54.730
really badly.
And who's fault is that yours?

1327
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:58.000
No one isn't.
Do you think I just pulled that out of fucking,

1328
01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:00.160
if someone said that white people can't jump,

1329
01:24:00.161 --> 01:24:02.560
do you think they just pull that out of their fucking ass?

1330
01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:05.650
Don't how many fucking white guys do you have to walk?

1331
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:09.580
How many six foot 10 inch white guys do you got to watch slam the ball under the

1332
01:24:09.581 --> 01:24:13.630
front of the rim and almost dislocate their shoulder trying to dunk on a fucking

1333
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.990
breakaway before you can say white people can't jump that you go on Youtube.

1334
01:24:17.991 --> 01:24:22.030
I mean go on youtube and you'll see some white dudes doing some shit.
Yeah,

1335
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:25.510
white people could do buys.
Ryan,
you think your thing?

1336
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.130
There are the exception and not the rule.

1337
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:31.390
I'm just saying that if somebody said to me who wasn't white said,

1338
01:24:31.391 --> 01:24:34.990
white guys can't jump and they can't fucking dance,

1339
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:38.650
I'm really not going to get into a heated debate about that.
Right.

1340
01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:44.550
I'm sure Donny Osmond can cut a fucking rug with John Travolta.
Oh,

1341
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.760
whoever the fuck you want to talk to them in federal line.
He was a dancer.
Yeah.

1342
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:53.210
That doesn't count.
Before he became a meeting.
It wasn't though.
He hung out with,

1343
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:56.990
he hung out with black people and he did hip hop dancers.

1344
01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:01.750
He bought one of those VHS tapes.
Video.

1345
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:05.590
He had cornrows.
Yeah.
And he liked to bang that girls.
That doesn't count.

1346
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:10.780
That doesn't count.
It doesn't fucking count.
Justin Timberlake.
I mean,

1347
01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:11.920
ah,

1348
01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.870
stole Michael Jackson's voice and all the shit that Michael Jackson actually

1349
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:19.630
stole from Mimes in hip hop dancers

1350
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.970
and James Brown.
James Brown.
There you go.
I don't fucking,

1351
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:28.690
I'm just talking shit in here.
Um,
all right,
well,
I see the distinction,

1352
01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:31.420
but it's still,
it's still wrong.
What is wrong?

1353
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:35.100
It's wrong of you to stereotype Asian people.
Yeah.

1354
01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:38.650
I'm not fucking hurting anybody.
It get started off.
It started off.

1355
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:41.830
It was a joke in the fucking car.
I know that.

1356
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.510
Realizing that you don't stand up.
Sit down.

1357
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.020
Put that in.
Unless we're going to use that finger.
I suggest you put it away.

1358
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:53.170
Oh Shit.
Shit.
That's for like second grade.

1359
01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:56.950
What do you have on boots right now?
It's really annoying.

1360
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.210
Why are you in your underwear?

1361
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.390
You want to talk shit cause it's fucking 10 o'clock at night and I'm in my own

1362
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:04.790
goddamn bedroom.
If you were going outside that would make sense.

1363
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:07.790
You're wearing tidy whities but they're black.
I'm not.
These are,

1364
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:12.650
these are like the snug ones.
They're like biker shorts.
Yeah,
they cut my balls.

1365
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:15.170
They make them feel good.
What's wrong with that?

1366
01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:17.600
You said you like these and you were wearing your Boston Bruins.

1367
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:18.960
Should I do like them?
Yeah,

1368
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.310
but you got a lot of nerves standing up pontificating and your underwear.

1369
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:27.140
Why cause a hell areas?
It shows you how passionate I am about my opinions.

1370
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:29.240
I want to bribe one of your listeners,

1371
01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.270
so like send me something like an Amazon gift wish,

1372
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:37.300
like a gift wishlist and I'll send them a picture of you right now as you are

1373
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.480
going to do that.
Yeah,
go ahead and do that.
Let's see any of your fucking,

1374
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:43.700
anytime you want to fucking have meals,

1375
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.950
they don't need it at this point with technology.

1376
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:49.850
They just take my hands sticking on somebody anyways.
Oh,
that's true.
Yeah.

1377
01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.970
Which is what they're all going to do now.
Thanks.
Thanks Neil.

1378
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.350
Anything else you'd like to add,
Kim?

1379
01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:58.820
So you guys will somebody please do that,

1380
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.110
may composite of that and email it to bill and you know what this is.

1381
01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:06.800
I have too much control in the relationship right now.

1382
01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.930
So this what you're doing is trying to get my listeners to turn on me.

1383
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.310
Is that what it is?
Divide and conquer or making it funny.

1384
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:17.000
I thought that's what I was for.
All right.
This is why I brought that shit up.

1385
01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.420
This why stood up my underwear and I started pointing at you raising my voice.

1386
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:23.680
The fuck were we talking?

1387
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:26.900
We've talked about that older Asian thing and it was one of the,

1388
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:31.010
we were in the fucking car and you've,
you've admitted in the car,
you're like,

1389
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:34.580
Jesus Christ.
There's something to this game.

1390
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:40.820
And the
time when it was a little odd,

1391
01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:43.060
that's the closest I'm ever going to get you admitted to your posts.

1392
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.600
The best one was one was an old Asian guy and that's what we came up like.

1393
01:27:47.601 --> 01:27:51.200
That was hitting like the green double zero in fucking a roulette.

1394
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.810
You had to call old Asian.
Well,
it's rude.

1395
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:55.790
I have [inaudible] is going to sound terrible,

1396
01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:59.160
but I have Asian friends so I don't want people to think that I sort of,

1397
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.750
why Kevin Shay?
Bobby Lee.
Oh,
I love Bobby Lane.

1398
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:07.940
You don't love Kevin Shay?
I don't know him.
Really?
Bobby Lemon.

1399
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.860
Kevin Shay is like the angry Bobby Lee.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Got It.
Yeah.

1400
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.470
Bobby Lee's anger is just somewhere hidden in there.

1401
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:22.070
Fucking Jesus Christ and yet,
yeah.
You know what this is.
This is right here.

1402
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.680
This is why.
You know what it was,
is when you,
when you,

1403
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.880
when you want to break balls,

1404
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.920
you got to hang out with other guys because of the woman's gonna ruin it.

1405
01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:35.900
What about why you want to bring in a little nother mini bill burr and here just

1406
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:38.330
your own opinion.
Regurgitated over and over again.

1407
01:28:38.331 --> 01:28:39.470
Why don't you get bored with that?

1408
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.230
With like audio of a crowd applauding underneath.

1409
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:48.650
Bill's always right.
Give me another,
is it racist?
All right.
Well,

1410
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:51.000
I have to look up one.
You real.
Oh,

1411
01:28:51.001 --> 01:28:54.620
do you realize I said the f word 347 times.

1412
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.330
That is incredible.
Even for you.
Really?

1413
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:01.830
Jesus Christ.
You just really abandoned me,
aren't you?

1414
01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:06.150
<v 9>I'm not,
but that's excessive.
Yeah.</v>

1415
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:07.270
This podcast is

1416
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.550
<v 11>of the whole thing is fucking ridiculous.
Beard as excessive.</v>

1417
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:14.170
You're the one who told me to fucking grow it.
I love it.

1418
01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:18.010
He told me to grow a God damn beard like,
and guess what?

1419
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.180
You got a part on Gleevec

1420
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.890
<v 9>because of it.
That's right.
I'm playing the part of Kenny Loggins.</v>

1421
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.660
Alright,
now these,
these are the ones,
I'm just grabbing these,
Eh,
uh,

1422
01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.300
I dunno where,
uh,
okay.
And this was,
this was your fucking idea too.

1423
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.750
Cause some of these get crazy.
All right bill.
Oh No,
I'd like to get your fault.

1424
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.800
I'd like to use your,

1425
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:41.880
is it racist segment to get a ruling on a dispute between myself,

1426
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:46.410
a white guy and some friends?
The issue involves,
uh,

1427
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.440
the issue in question revolves around a particular Halloween costume of mine a

1428
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:55.350
few years back.
You chose this one near,
here we go anyway.
Uh,

1429
01:29:55.351 --> 01:30:00.351
anyone who's been to Vegas knows about the porn slappers that clog up all the

1430
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:03.870
sidewalks on the strip.
I guess those are the guys who hand out the flyers,

1431
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:08.070
I guess.
I have no idea.
I'm so calls because as they're handing out the stripper,

1432
01:30:08.071 --> 01:30:09.060
our US business cards,

1433
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:12.300
they give him a quick snap on the hand shoving them in your face.
Okay.

1434
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:16.500
Is if having full color porn pushed on you while trying to walk down the street

1435
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:17.334
wasn't enough,

1436
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.780
I guess they deem it necessary to violate your auditory senses as well.
Well,

1437
01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:25.290
they got to get you to pay attention.
All right.
Um,
during a routine trip,

1438
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.670
Durand's me of something,

1439
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:29.880
I'm sorry that that slapping of the car that reminds me of,

1440
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:33.820
remember when we went to jumbos classroom and that girl,
when we first,

1441
01:30:35.190 --> 01:30:37.630
<v 11>when we first went in there,
the stripper was like super friendly.</v>

1442
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:40.780
So they as you walk in and then occasionally you'd hear like,

1443
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.280
like a clapping noise.

1444
01:30:42.281 --> 01:30:45.890
Really loud sound like somebody got shot and it was her clapping,
her boots,

1445
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:48.960
her stripper boots together trying to get your attention.
I'm like,

1446
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:51.080
cause the room was too quiet and no one was paying attention to her.

1447
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:54.310
It was so pathetic in there and all of a sudden it sounded like a gunshot.

1448
01:30:55.210 --> 01:31:00.130
Clapping her fucking
stripper quit on.
Exactly.

1449
01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:00.993
Anyway,

1450
01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.160
<v 9>Sam never dancing and she just stopped dancing.</v>

1451
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:06.850
<v 11>She,
she crawled over on her hands and knees to her purse,</v>

1452
01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.570
light on her stomach,
pulled her phone out and started texting.

1453
01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.520
<v 9>Music's still going titties out with the Thong on,</v>

1454
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:19.920
but the best part was she,
uh,
she danced to the whole first song.

1455
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.310
Yeah.
And didn't make one dime.
It was slowly coming down.

1456
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.930
The pole grade is lovable and then whatever the hell it was and then landed on

1457
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:31.830
her back.
Not one time.
She was horrific.
She was ugly too.

1458
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:36.990
And um,
the next song started and she was just laying there.
Yeah,

1459
01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:39.660
she didn't answer the bell like a fighter quit on the fucking school.

1460
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:44.120
I had no respect for.
Um,
anyways,
let's just continue here.
Uh,

1461
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.200
during a routine trip to Vegas,

1462
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:49.690
noticing how he paints himself as somebody person,
you know.
Right.

1463
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.790
I thought it would be funny to dress up as a porn slapper for Halloween.

1464
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:59.040
So while there I collected a sizable stack of the previously mentioned cards.

1465
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:04.260
When I returned home I had a fluorescent pink stripper direct to you shirt,

1466
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:08.680
made a,
had it made up in assembled with other key components to create what I

1467
01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.320
considered to be an authentic reproduction.

1468
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.890
Is this going to end with him in blackface?

1469
01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.900
<v 10>It's going to end with him in Mexican face or whatever.</v>

1470
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.840
Cause that's all the guys seem to be like Hispanic handing those out.

1471
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:23.190
I know where this is going.
Here's when the train went off the tracks and a claim

1472
01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:25.280
<v 9>costume became racist.</v>

1473
01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:29.810
My completed costume consisted of a straw cowboy hat,

1474
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:34.190
short black wig,
brown facial makeup,

1475
01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.220
a large mustache stripper direct shirt,

1476
01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.400
some navy Dickies and tennis shoes.
Basically,

1477
01:32:40.401 --> 01:32:45.401
if Poncho villa had to get a second job to pick up a little cash on the side,

1478
01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.870
that's what I ended up looking like.
Now,

1479
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:51.980
did any of my so called white friends mentioned that this costume might be

1480
01:32:51.981 --> 01:32:55.250
racist during the construction,
frayed or their so called white?

1481
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:57.540
Are they still called friends so called white print?

1482
01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.630
Of course not.
They didn't say or basics has white friends didn't say shit,

1483
01:33:02.631 --> 01:33:04.400
but the second amount on Halloween night,

1484
01:33:04.401 --> 01:33:09.020
suddenly I'm surrounded by spokespeople for the Anti Defamation League.
Dude,

1485
01:33:09.021 --> 01:33:10.070
where the fuck did you do this?

1486
01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.670
My stance in all this was a yes that the costumers privately,

1487
01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:16.610
racially insensitive,
but it was not done to be malicious.

1488
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.300
I was just shooting for authenticity and therefore it wasn't racist.

1489
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:22.850
My friends claim that it was blatantly racist.

1490
01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:27.380
The friends who didn't say shit,
we're not trying to step away.

1491
01:33:27.381 --> 01:33:30.450
Call white friends,
so called white bread.
Um,

1492
01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:34.460
can I please get your opinion on this?
Uh,
all right,

1493
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:37.520
<v 10>here's my question.
Did he have to,</v>

1494
01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.170
he could've done that entire costume without the,

1495
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.970
let's say brown face without the brown phase and people would have gotten it

1496
01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.130
because he'd be heading out those thank you pages and he'll be like,

1497
01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.130
oh cause everyone's gone to Vegas.
Everyone's seen those.
I went to Vegas,

1498
01:33:52.131 --> 01:33:54.590
I brought you back a stack of those fucking cards cause I thought it was funny.

1499
01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.150
So people would have gotten it.

1500
01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:01.720
So it does seem a little excessive to add the brown face when it's unnecessary.

1501
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.910
So he is,
he's dipping his toe in the racist pawn.

1502
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:11.720
I do not think that this person is a racist human being.
I don't think he's like,

1503
01:34:11.721 --> 01:34:15.770
he,
he thinks Mexican people are bad.
They shouldn't,
I shouldn't even say Mexican.

1504
01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.770
They could be Peruvian,
whatever.
I don't think things are bad.

1505
01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:23.060
But he definitely dipped his toe in because there was really no need to go that

1506
01:34:23.061 --> 01:34:26.060
far.
He could've done the entire thing.
And everyone would have gotten it.

1507
01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.060
All right.
This is what I said.
He didn't need brown fee.

1508
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:32.570
<v 9>What I say,
I say this isn't racist.
I say,</v>

1509
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.680
well he's guilty of is not knowing that he was going to be called a racist

1510
01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:40.580
because if every fucking due to the hand in those things out that weekend was

1511
01:34:40.581 --> 01:34:45.581
Mexican and look like that and he went all out to try to look like that.

1512
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:49.360
All he's guilty of is having a fucking kickass costume.
All right.

1513
01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:52.130
And if the Wayans brothers can make white chicks,

1514
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:56.130
that fucking horrific horror that I fucking saw and I'd say it's up.

1515
01:34:56.131 --> 01:34:58.250
I didn't even see the movie.
I just like was so fucking

1516
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:02.540
<v 11>weird that that just got to Trans Fast Id for me when he took his foot out and</v>

1517
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:03.440
had it on the table.

1518
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:07.130
It just really was fucking understand how we're supposed to believe that

1519
01:35:07.131 --> 01:35:11.020
everyone in the movie doesn't realize that it's black people in white face cause

1520
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:14.070
it's
[inaudible].

1521
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:16.310
People really believe that this isn't an actual white person.

1522
01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:17.750
Like they're talking to other white people.

1523
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:21.710
Like it doesn't look weird and this is my thing.
If you can fucking do that.

1524
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:26.630
Okay.
Which I get,
I get,
the rules are fucking different because all the bullshit,

1525
01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:30.560
the tablets.
So that's one of those things where he's guilty of light,

1526
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:33.590
like a white person who doesn't mean anything bad but says you people are you

1527
01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:36.620
guys right?
And then has to be like,
well,
I don't,
I didn't know.

1528
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:39.500
I didn't fucking know.
So I,
I wouldn't say that that's,
that's,
that's not racist.

1529
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.820
It's just a,

1530
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:45.650
but your friends are fucking sellouts who you think they did it on purpose.

1531
01:35:45.651 --> 01:35:48.710
I think they were like,
oh,
this is going to be good.
Okay.
They're on purpose.

1532
01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:52.070
I think they wanted him to get called out.
If they did it on purpose,

1533
01:35:52.071 --> 01:35:55.910
then that's fucking four,
I think.
Yeah.
I don't think,
uh,

1534
01:35:56.690 --> 01:35:59.330
I think it was a little unnecessary to add that.

1535
01:35:59.331 --> 01:36:02.210
I don't think he needed that for the costume.
This is what I would say.

1536
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:04.640
In a perfect world.
He had a great costume,

1537
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:09.470
but because of all the shit that we've done,
you know,
that's just one of those,

1538
01:36:09.471 --> 01:36:12.230
one of those extra,
you know,
because of all the extra perks,

1539
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.980
perks you get for being fucking white.
You know,
like you should see,

1540
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:18.680
you should have seen the gift bag I got when I was born.
It was,

1541
01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.820
it was fucking ridiculous.
It was like a bag full of cash.
Oh yeah.

1542
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:23.740
USA Today.

1543
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:30.560
College was automatically paid for it.
You had a giant up.
Oh yeah.
White people.

1544
01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:34.820
We just bitch cause no,
that's actually,
it's uh,
you know,

1545
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:38.960
I,
if I,
if I could tell you honestly how difficult it is being white.

1546
01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:42.110
I want to know though,
why that,

1547
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:46.740
I'd be curious to know why he felt like he had to add that to it.
He did.

1548
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:50.510
Maybe he didn't feel like the costume was like clear enough.

1549
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.930
He's like,
I got everything.
You know what this needs.

1550
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.220
He could even just left the mustache.

1551
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.970
And what if you're going as a specific guy like Billy crystal.

1552
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:07.310
When he used to do Sammy Davis Jr on SNL was in,
he was not only in black face,

1553
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:10.770
he was in black body,
black,
everything.
He went,

1554
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.640
oh you're obviously not underneath but like he and he somehow he got away with

1555
01:37:13.641 --> 01:37:17.240
it cause he was doing a specific guy like how does that work?

1556
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.270
But then Ted Danson comes out and does a roast.

1557
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:24.200
I mean I'm really going far back here,
which allegedly everything goes.

1558
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.980
Did you see on 30 rock when they had one of the characters in blackface?

1559
01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:33.460
They had a much,
I don't want shit.
The girl who plays Jane Krakowski.

1560
01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.390
It was really funny.
And then the context,

1561
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.600
it made completely sense and it wasn't like,
all right,
let me,
let me,
let me,

1562
01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:41.820
let me read one more here and then we're going to let you go here.
Another,

1563
01:37:41.821 --> 01:37:44.590
another stunning performance here.
Dear Bill,
after listening,

1564
01:37:44.591 --> 01:37:46.990
how much better am I getting at reading out loud?
You know what I mean?

1565
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.350
As I do now,
I'm getting way better at this for like a little kid.
I am.
What I,

1566
01:37:50.351 --> 01:37:55.100
what I do is when I start,
when I start to lose control,
this sentence,

1567
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.010
I just make up

1568
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:59.370
<v 9>whatever they're talking about after listening to all the racist stories from</v>

1569
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:03.210
the last two podcasts.
I really like your comedy bill.
I have one.

1570
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.790
Did they really say that?
No.

1571
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:10.280
I have one I wanted to share that I have always felt I lost.

1572
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:16.110
Uh,
all right.
Back in the 10th grade,
I had a friend name Robbie.

1573
01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:21.000
He happened to be one of the five black people in my high school.
Oh Geez.

1574
01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.350
Here we go.
Here we go.

1575
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.830
I knew him for a few years and we had a few classes together.

1576
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.520
We both took some sort of technical drawing classes and sat next to each other.

1577
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:34.290
After we became sort of friends,
he thought it was okay to call me cracker Hunky,

1578
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.220
et cetera.
This must've been the 70s.
So if he broke out Hunky,
uh,

1579
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:42.900
I'm pretty sure he stopped calling me by my real name and only by my racial

1580
01:38:42.901 --> 01:38:46.920
slurs after a while,
seeing how I'm white and I'm pretty laid back.

1581
01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:50.580
I didn't give a fuck about what he called me.
Yeah.
I mean,
at that point,

1582
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:53.130
if every president was white at that point,
you don't give a shit.

1583
01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:54.300
It doesn't carry as much water.

1584
01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:58.980
Suddenly was after about two weeks of being bombarded with racial slurs.

1585
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:03.600
See,
I don't even consider those racial slurs.
I just consider those,
you know,

1586
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.400
I don't consider those ratios.
Yeah.
Hey,

1587
01:39:10.401 --> 01:39:14.240
white boy,
that doesn't bug me.
They fucking black guy.

1588
01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:18.530
That does it.
It does.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't give a shit.

1589
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:24.830
Um,
anyways,
uh,
after about two weeks of being bombarded with racial slurs,

1590
01:39:24.831 --> 01:39:28.550
I figured I would,
I would say,
oh no.

1591
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:33.380
Well,
okay.
Yes.

1592
01:39:33.381 --> 01:39:37.070
You know what it means.
I figured that by saying it,

1593
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:42.490
it would be all be in good fun and we would have a good laugh and it would be

1594
01:39:43.101 --> 01:39:47.660
over.
Oh,
I hope.
I hope he buried it in the middle of a sentence.

1595
01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:49.010
That's the only way.
If he had,

1596
01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.260
he needs a lot of words surrounding it and better known as said it with the Ar.

1597
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.721
Here we go.

1598
01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:58.040
So one day a great opportunity came along when I walked in the room and Robbie

1599
01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.520
says,
what's up my cracker in my head,

1600
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:05.630
I was telling myself to let her rip that's so close to get her done.

1601
01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.460
This isn't gonna end good.
So while I'm doing some sort of stupid hand shape,

1602
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:12.440
I replied to Robbie saying,
what's up my n word?

1603
01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:14.810
Instantly without hesitation,

1604
01:40:14.811 --> 01:40:18.170
Robbie's incestual tribal warrior spirit kicked in.

1605
01:40:18.171 --> 01:40:22.220
Next thing I knew I was being manhandled by a black kid that was much bigger

1606
01:40:22.221 --> 01:40:26.060
than me.
Uh,
the scuffled didn't last long and nobody got hurt.

1607
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:30.020
He said,
what's up my crack?
And then you said,
what's up my n word?

1608
01:40:30.021 --> 01:40:34.840
And that was a fan
that kind of seemed like the comedically that would flow.

1609
01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:38.800
Yeah.
And it would be like funny and everyone would be like,

1610
01:40:38.801 --> 01:40:41.050
everyone in school would be kind of like,
wow.

1611
01:40:41.051 --> 01:40:43.870
Like they have that kind of relationship that they can go back and forth like

1612
01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:48.250
that.
Well,
he's actually sounds like a really bad sitcom.
It does.

1613
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.120
All right,
let's finish.
Here we go.
After the fight,

1614
01:40:52.121 --> 01:40:56.980
we got into a twisted debate on how I was somehow wrong for what I said,

1615
01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:01.970
Eh,
that Robbie wasn't,
it was some,
it was some complete bullshit,

1616
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:06.310
like a bunch of pussies afraid of appearing a racist.

1617
01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.800
None of the other white kids in my class have my back to this day.

1618
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:12.310
It still amazed me how sensitive people are when it comes to racist shit.

1619
01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:16.510
Robbie could clearly dish it out,
but he couldn't handle any,
uh,

1620
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:20.470
heat directed toward him.
I didn't give a shit what he called me,
but,

1621
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:23.100
uh,
shit right there.
I should've made up some shit.

1622
01:41:23.101 --> 01:41:25.870
I don't give a shit when he called me because I knew he was just joking around

1623
01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:27.790
when I started joking around,
he flipped out.

1624
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.250
We still remained friends throughout high school.
To this day,

1625
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.890
I feel as if I didn't do anything wrong,

1626
01:41:32.891 --> 01:41:36.100
but I still feel as if I lost the argument.
What do you think?
Uh,

1627
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:38.820
I think that's one of those things where,
uh,

1628
01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:45.250
uh,
maybe because,
because it was too many other white people around,

1629
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:48.100
but it was one of those things where he should have got at least two minutes for

1630
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.090
instigating on that run.

1631
01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:52.770
<v 10>You know,
[inaudible] fighting one gets two minutes for instance,</v>

1632
01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:56.900
cause I can see where if they were in private they might've said that to each

1633
01:41:56.901 --> 01:41:57.920
other and laughed.

1634
01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.960
But if there's other people around then his friend feels like embarrassed and

1635
01:42:02.961 --> 01:42:07.220
humiliated and like,
oh you're letting this guy say whatever you want.
And so,

1636
01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.990
you know,
but this is like,

1637
01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:13.991
this kind of like reminds me of when black people say that we shouldn't be so

1638
01:42:14.991 --> 01:42:19.970
casual about the n word because it makes white people think that you guys can

1639
01:42:19.971 --> 01:42:23.180
just say it to us because we say it to each other all the time.

1640
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.400
You guys say to each other all the time I was with the big dealers,

1641
01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.740
rappers and stuff,
you guys are constantly saying it.

1642
01:42:30.741 --> 01:42:35.450
So it's like now it's a problem.
If I say it very clearly not the same thing.

1643
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:38.720
However,
I do see that side of the argument where it's like,

1644
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:42.890
well in a lot of it's from like older black people too that are like,
you know,

1645
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:44.300
you can't keep saying it like that.

1646
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:47.930
Cause why people will think that we don't respect ourselves and so they should

1647
01:42:47.931 --> 01:42:49.130
neither blah blah blah.

1648
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:53.100
<v 9>Let me go back to the white guy,
go,
well what you guys say to tribal blah,</v>

1649
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.640
that's just a racist for the most part,
that's just a racist white guy.

1650
01:42:57.650 --> 01:43:00.680
<v 10>Triathlon acting is rationalize saying the n word.</v>

1651
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:04.280
I'm trying to rationalize or trying to get away with it.
Yeah,
yeah.
No.
Okay.

1652
01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:05.500
So I would say

1653
01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.460
<v 9>pretty much that's what that is.
I never a,</v>

1654
01:43:08.670 --> 01:43:11.400
<v 10>I don't think his friend should have opened the door to use that kind of</v>

1655
01:43:11.401 --> 01:43:14.940
language.
And I think his friend was kind of enjoying the phone.
I call him,

1656
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:18.270
I rang her and Honky,
I think he liked that,
that he could just say that to him.

1657
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:21.450
And it might've been like some sort of subconscious like,
yeah,

1658
01:43:21.451 --> 01:43:25.590
see I can say whatever I want.
You can't say shit to me.
And then when he did,

1659
01:43:25.591 --> 01:43:28.440
it was like,
no,
you can't,
which isn't exactly fair.

1660
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.580
<v 9>Has It always said it?</v>

1661
01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.430
If you went a little high pitched and try to say it like funny,

1662
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.293
I think he could have

1663
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:37.750
<v 10>like,
what's his face?
Who you impression of the peanut here?</v>

1664
01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.250
How does he,
how does he always greet the black guy on it?

1665
01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.740
Say the white people for us.
Be like,
Hey Sharon.
He goes,
hey,

1666
01:43:45.741 --> 01:43:50.090
how are you doing Villi?
How's it going?
Tommy looking good.
How you doing Nathan?

1667
01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.390
<v 9>Oh,
fucking dad.
That's just embarrassing.
Oh,</v>

1668
01:43:57.391 --> 01:43:58.620
speaking of embarrassing,

1669
01:43:58.621 --> 01:44:03.090
I asked last week who was the last white guy to win an NFL rushing title.

1670
01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.460
And I actually got two interesting answers.
Okay.

1671
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:10.260
The last time a white guy won it for the conference,

1672
01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:15.710
Mark Van Egan wanted for the AFC in 1977 but Walter Payton one,

1673
01:44:15.901 --> 01:44:20.901
the overall rushing title and Jim Otis when in 1975 that doesn't sound like a

1674
01:44:24.181 --> 01:44:28.680
white guy named Jim Otis.
Uh,
yeah.

1675
01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.220
Oldest Anderson for the Saint Louis Cardinals.
He wanted,

1676
01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.780
and I think Oj Simpson one at that year.
Uh,

1677
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:41.820
speaking of white people,
um,

1678
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:46.250
I didn't know what he meant by that.
I was
just picturing his,
his,
uh,

1679
01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:48.140
the woman eat fucking,
oh my God,

1680
01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.400
that's married to back when that verdict was read and we watched,

1681
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:55.080
we were watching it in high school and I went to,
you know,

1682
01:44:55.081 --> 01:44:56.550
pretty much an all white high school.

1683
01:44:56.551 --> 01:44:58.290
There was definitely some black people there,

1684
01:44:58.291 --> 01:45:00.240
but not as many as the white people.

1685
01:45:00.241 --> 01:45:02.980
You guys like high fiving is every other white person famous.

1686
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.140
<v 10>It was weird.
It was a weird thing because it's like,
yeah,</v>

1687
01:45:07.141 --> 01:45:11.910
we were watching it in class,
you know,
when we should have been learning,

1688
01:45:11.911 --> 01:45:15.240
but we're watching it in class.
And then so the verdict and the like,

1689
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:19.800
you can feel them wanting to sell,
like wanting to be like no.

1690
01:45:19.801 --> 01:45:20.670
And then them looking at me,

1691
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:23.630
<v 9>me and you know,
looking at maybe the other one other black boots.</v>

1692
01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.230
And I remember this guy coming up to me,
he goes,
listen,

1693
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:28.480
I'm not racist and I killed,

1694
01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:35.860
killed that way.
But I think,
I think,
I think he should've gone to jail.

1695
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:40.870
And I was like,
ah,
okay.
And I said,
well,
he's not,
and he goes,

1696
01:45:40.871 --> 01:45:41.704
well,

1697
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:45.130
and then he just walked away and he walked away and then probably mumbled some

1698
01:45:45.131 --> 01:45:49.060
other shit.
Um,
but he just felt the need to let me know.
Right.

1699
01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:52.390
Well that's one of those things where black people being happy with the saint,

1700
01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:56.630
that was just like the white guy rooting for Byu because they just,
you know,

1701
01:45:56.650 --> 01:46:00.880
white guys have not succeeded in basketball and you guys haven't done so well in

1702
01:46:00.881 --> 01:46:03.730
the trials,
have so much history.

1703
01:46:03.731 --> 01:46:07.990
So it was less about the fact that he clearly did it.

1704
01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:13.240
The fact that,
you know,
no we didn't because he wrote that book where he said,

1705
01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:15.200
if he was gonna do it,
this is how I would do it.

1706
01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:20.320
[inaudible] it's totally different.
The book never even came out.

1707
01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:25.530
First pack of football cards I ever got Oj Simpson was,
was,
was the,

1708
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.020
uh,
was the first one and I fucking loved the guy.

1709
01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:33.480
He betrayed you guys more than he betrayed us.
Outlook,
which is,
look,

1710
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:37.790
the ultimate irony.
He,
I can't even say what I,

1711
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:40.810
how I feel about that shit.
But I'm going to tell you this,

1712
01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:46.020
there is actually a picture somewhere in the attic of my life of me in second

1713
01:46:47.081 --> 01:46:51.400
grade sitting on Santa Lap with an Oj Simpson Jersey.

1714
01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.690
<v 10>[inaudible] that says it all.</v>

1715
01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:58.220
<v 9>You're on my hand cause I had a good day at school or some shit.</v>

1716
01:46:58.450 --> 01:47:01.650
<v 10>Oh,
I just remembered another example of,
uh,</v>

1717
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:03.760
well let me finish blackface.

1718
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:04.560
<v 9>Well,
let,
let me,</v>

1719
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.560
let me finish the rushing title and the last white guy to overall when a rushing

1720
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:13.320
title like no bullshit was 1962,

1721
01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:18.000
Jim Taylor for the Green Bay packers and he wanted an in between,
uh,
Jim Brown.

1722
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:21.340
I don't know what happened to Jim Brown that year,
but uh,
so he wanted,

1723
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.480
so they go that that's essentially the pot.
Yeah,
a support cast for this week.
Um,

1724
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:29.550
I got arrest up to do my glee this week.
Uh,

1725
01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:34.410
you know what Song I'm singing?
No,
what is it?
I'm too embarrassed to even say

1726
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:39.570
<v 10>you sensei.
Let it be as surprised.
Let it be a surprise when it's tune in.</v>

1727
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:40.853
Oh yeah,

1728
01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:43.490
<v 9>it's,
yeah.
Ugly on the Glean Network.
And what was,</v>

1729
01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.210
what's your last thing before I sign off here?
Cause I got to upload this shit.

1730
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:48.780
<v 10>No,
I'm just going to,
I just wanted to talk about really quickly.</v>

1731
01:47:48.781 --> 01:47:53.520
I had a boyfriend in college.
Oh kamia.
Thanks for coming on the podcast.

1732
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.050
We had a great time.

1733
01:47:56.110 --> 01:47:58.700
<v 9>No,
I do have a couple more tops.
I don't even know your fucking boyfriend.</v>

1734
01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:01.340
<v 10>No,
it has nothing to do with our relationship.</v>

1735
01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.520
It's when he was a little kid got up and he was dressed as a hobo for Halloween.

1736
01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.910
He was white by the way.
Um,
and he put dirt on it.

1737
01:48:10.911 --> 01:48:14.090
Like he wanted to put like brown makeup on his face to look like dirt.

1738
01:48:14.091 --> 01:48:18.560
So He'd look like a dirty Hobo.
And it looked like
black

1739
01:48:20.630 --> 01:48:23.990
people were like,
do you think all black people are hopeless?
And he was like,

1740
01:48:23.991 --> 01:48:26.400
I just want to be dirty.
So it was,

1741
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.660
<v 9>which made it worse,
but it was hilarious.
Yeah.
Geez,
that's a funny story.</v>

1742
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:35.190
It really isn't
because the fact that he told you that story,

1743
01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:37.230
I can see how far into the relationship you are,

1744
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:39.960
which means other things were going on,
which I really didn't need to know.

1745
01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:44.340
All right,
here's one best teacher ever.
Listen to this guy.
This,

1746
01:48:44.341 --> 01:48:47.430
I got this from a teacher.
Where the fuck was this guy when I was in high school?

1747
01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:50.340
Hey Bill,
first of all,
love you podcasts in your stand up.
Thank you.

1748
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.520
The reason why I'm writing to you is I'm a math teacher and I have a student

1749
01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:54.780
who's a class clown.

1750
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:58.680
I really think he has the potential to be a great standup comedian and I want to

1751
01:48:58.681 --> 01:49:03.360
suggest that to him,
um,
as a potential future for him.
Um,

1752
01:49:03.361 --> 01:49:06.210
I don't think that academics is really his thing.

1753
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.250
What would be some good things slash advice to show slash tell him,
right?

1754
01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:13.650
Rather than being the asshole teacher,
be like,

1755
01:49:13.651 --> 01:49:15.600
you sit down and shut your fucking mouth.

1756
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.770
Make them clap the racist or whatever the fuck these kids do nowadays.
Um,

1757
01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:24.360
this guy's actually,
I'm actually brought the guy back.
I said,
what?
I always say,

1758
01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:27.360
write five minutes of Shit you think's funny.
Sign up for an open mic.

1759
01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:30.210
When they call your name,
go up on stage and there you go.

1760
01:49:30.211 --> 01:49:33.930
Don't judge yourself the first 10 to 15 times you do it 10 times.

1761
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:37.530
I would say it's all about being like,
wow,
I'm holding a microphone.

1762
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:38.400
I'm really doing that.

1763
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:41.810
They really do have brick walls behind me as you're trying to remember your shit

1764
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:45.630
,
but after 10 times then you start getting a feel for it and then then,

1765
01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.130
then everything else falls into fucking,

1766
01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:51.580
they have a talent contest at a talent show at the school.
He should do it too.

1767
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.730
Oh he shouldn't.
That's what I need to tell you.

1768
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:59.650
Under no fucking circumstances,
should you ever go on stage.

1769
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:03.940
The first time you ever did stand up comedy in front of your own fucking class.

1770
01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:06.610
Oh my God.
Oh that's true.
Because if it doesn't go well,

1771
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.570
it's going to be humiliating,

1772
01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:12.430
so he should do it somewhere else away from so he can work it out so he doesn't

1773
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:16.600
bother friends.
Everybody's going to heckle you.
Reach your balls.

1774
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.113
That that is like,

1775
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.480
that's why like bombing on a cruise ships sucks because when you,
after you bomb,

1776
01:50:22.481 --> 01:50:23.320
you can't leave

1777
01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:29.290
with the crowd and everybody just sits there looking at you and that that's,

1778
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:31.210
but at least the cruise is over in a week.

1779
01:50:31.211 --> 01:50:34.210
This kid's got to finish off the fucking school year.
We put the love of God.

1780
01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:39.190
You have to teachers listening to not tell him to sign up for a talent.

1781
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:42.760
Fucking contests don't do that because that's the type of thing they could leave

1782
01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:46.540
and emotional scar with a kid might not do it again for five years or never

1783
01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:49.060
fucking do it again.
Okay.
You need,

1784
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:53.920
you need an escape plan when you're going to go up and do that shit.
Believe me.

1785
01:50:54.110 --> 01:50:58.570
What I,
the first time I've ever fucking bombed,
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1786
01:50:59.850 --> 01:51:04.850
Where is the first time you bond in some fucking bar in uh,

1787
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.960
uh,
north reading Massachusetts.

1788
01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:11.140
I want to say some place Kelly's or something doesn't even exist anymore.

1789
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.540
And I walked in and there was this function,

1790
01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:17.230
this little half of the bar where you could sit down and eat fucking fish and

1791
01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:20.800
chips stowed and there was like nobody there other than other comedians.

1792
01:51:20.801 --> 01:51:24.460
And then like three fucking people who came to see another comedian and then up

1793
01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:29.380
at the bar with just guys drinking like five people spread out amongst 15
chairs.

1794
01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:32.770
Uri your balls.
And I didn't know how to handle it.

1795
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.900
And I went up there and I just bombed and said,
oh,

1796
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:37.120
I was supposed to do five minutes.

1797
01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:40.420
I bailed like two minutes in and said on the Mike,

1798
01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:44.110
I told you that said to the host Jack,
I go,

1799
01:51:44.111 --> 01:51:46.870
Jack on Balan in all the comments went ahh.

1800
01:51:46.871 --> 01:51:50.520
And then I felt like a fucking pussy and I want to do is just walk off stage,

1801
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:52.990
get my car and drive home.
But I was so humiliated.

1802
01:51:52.991 --> 01:51:56.650
I sat in the first fucking chair that was open,

1803
01:51:56.651 --> 01:52:00.340
which was like two Rosen and just sat there with my head down wanting to leave

1804
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:03.580
the whole time and sat there throughout the rest of the fucking open mic.

1805
01:52:03.581 --> 01:52:07.210
Like a scolded child.
And then I drove home,

1806
01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:11.950
cried classic German,
Irish.
Rather than dealing with the emotion,

1807
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:16.330
I kept trying to put it outside of my body and it was just hanging in my car the

1808
01:52:16.331 --> 01:52:19.060
whole fuck.
It was horrific.
I can't imagine doing that.

1809
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:22.510
And then doing it in front of your tire fucking class.
It was horrific.

1810
01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:27.160
So that was bad.
My bad.
Yeah.
Bad Advice.
All right,
you too.
Youtube,

1811
01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:31.660
youtube,
fucking videos of the week.
Uh,
this one,
uh,

1812
01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:34.750
Brad Garrett was on the job,
uh,
bay harsh show.

1813
01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:39.160
And if you just want to see a fucking stand up comedian in complete,

1814
01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:43.540
not giving a shit mode,
just going off.
You got to watch this.

1815
01:52:43.541 --> 01:52:48.290
He's absolutely fucking hilarious.
This guy is a true standup comedian.

1816
01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:51.710
Like I already loved them from the Ray Romano,
Chabot and I watched this clip.

1817
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:55.580
This guy is the shit and I would definitely go see him do stand up.

1818
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.430
This is what it takes to be a great comedian.

1819
01:52:58.431 --> 01:53:00.080
This guy completely doesn't give a fuck.

1820
01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:02.180
And there's a bunch of people evidently watching it cause he,

1821
01:53:02.290 --> 01:53:06.280
he jokes that all is Ray Romano money has gone saying he invested in,

1822
01:53:06.281 --> 01:53:09.800
into this comedy club.
Like he was on a hit series for fucking 10 years,

1823
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.170
like 10 years of syndicated money.

1824
01:53:12.171 --> 01:53:15.590
That's how much it takes to open a fucking room in Vegas.
When you're in name,

1825
01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:16.700
he's clearly joking

1826
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:21.750
<v 6>people,
right?
Is he broke his,
he doing heroin?
Heroin?</v>

1827
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:24.870
No.
What's great is he just,

1828
01:53:25.410 --> 01:53:29.070
at one point he's throwing chips at people who were in Vegas and you go,

1829
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:33.250
you're white trash.
You know,
he doesn't call it.
It's fucking hilarious.

1830
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.950
You got to see itself.
All of these

1831
01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:38.170
<v 9>we the MLM,
podcast.com.
Um,</v>

1832
01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:43.690
we put this one up last week,
but I forgot the hype it insane robot movie.

1833
01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.690
You got to see this thing.
It's just a clip from a fucking great movie.

1834
01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:50.260
And also the greatest wrestling clip I've ever seen in my life.

1835
01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:53.500
Nia said she wants her five minutes of her life back.

1836
01:53:53.501 --> 01:53:55.450
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1837
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:59.650
The name of the video is the most illegal thing I've seen in wrestling history.

1838
01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:04.030
You have to watch it.
It's fucking awesome and quick.
Overrated.
Underrated.

1839
01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:09.310
Um,
okay.
Overrated.
The black eyed peas,
uh,

1840
01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:14.220
build the black ips are terrible.
I'm pissed.
I watched that halftime,
uh,

1841
01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.290
bullshit at the Super Bowl,

1842
01:54:16.291 --> 01:54:20.100
even on mute with the promise that it was going to be something I didn't want to

1843
01:54:20.101 --> 01:54:20.850
miss.

1844
01:54:20.850 --> 01:54:25.260
They suck and that noise they call music is the worst crap ever.

1845
01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:30.240
Um,
I walk out,
I never watched the halftime shows.
They're fucking horrific.

1846
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:35.050
<v 6>They were very different before Fergie showed up.
And I'll just leave it at that.</v>

1847
01:54:35.530 --> 01:54:40.510
Okay.
And if you know them,
you know that what I'm saying is true.
Yeah.

1848
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.310
You're blaming the white girl.
Okay.
Is it racist race?
Car Sex?

1849
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:48.580
Underrated is often unappreciated.
Lol.

1850
01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:53.670
There's nothing like pulling over on the side of a busy interstate and getting

1851
01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.080
it on what he says

1852
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.890
<v 9>or stumbling out of a bar with some random chick you bought a few drinks for and</v>

1853
01:54:59.891 --> 01:55:03.130
convinced to leave with you going into a car and not even in,

1854
01:55:03.131 --> 01:55:07.270
not even making out of the parking lot.
It's just oh,

1855
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:11.310
in bag and basically it's just plain awesome.
Uh,
I purchased,
let,

1856
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.060
let it go and loved it.
Thank you.
Um,

1857
01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:17.380
I would say that sex in the car was way better back in the day when they had

1858
01:55:17.381 --> 01:55:21.440
bench seats and actually made huge cars.
But,
uh,

1859
01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:26.090
I think it's,
I don't know.
You know,

1860
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:30.590
I don't like the look and I don't like the fucking look in your Goddamn I

1861
01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:32.600
um,

1862
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.910
<v 6>okay.
And I'm not getting into that pocket,
personal life,
but we don't,</v>

1863
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:36.740
we don't have enough memories.

1864
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:44.370
[inaudible] wow.

1865
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:47.460
<v 11>Yeah.
The older cars are better because they have more room.</v>

1866
01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:55.790
<v 9>Fucking gotta be kidding me.
You know what?
Why don't you get your trip?</v>

1867
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:59.750
He Ass Outta here.
Please meet you think I didn't realize that when I met yet.

1868
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:03.560
Huh?
You gotta realize,
you know,

1869
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:06.870
<v 11>you could find a sex life before you got them right.</v>

1870
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:12.070
What is the problem is when it took male whore meeting a female or you're a man

1871
01:56:12.831 --> 01:56:16.110
whore.
I was not.
No,
you are a man.
I was always,

1872
01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:21.500
I wasn't looking at me in the eye look like fucking howdy duty with a fucking,

1873
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:26.330
but you've got that whole little like sexy,
angry thing going on women like this.

1874
01:56:26.530 --> 01:56:27.320
And you know what I'm like,

1875
01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:29.830
I don't like being pandering to cater to whoever the fuck.

1876
01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:31.570
<v 9>Let's see.
Oh,
here's one last quick thing.</v>

1877
01:56:31.571 --> 01:56:35.810
I always say I'm going to fucking end it.
I never do.
All right.
Corporations,
uh,

1878
01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.450
selling your information.
Hey Bill,

1879
01:56:37.451 --> 01:56:40.580
I did listen to your podcast for a while now and think,
ah,

1880
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.150
they're very entertaining and funny.
I do have to admit,
however,

1881
01:56:43.151 --> 01:56:45.370
that every time I,
maybe I read this last week,
I can't remember,

1882
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.850
but I'm just happy because I ended up being right here.
Uh,
I do have to admit,

1883
01:56:48.851 --> 01:56:49.211
however,

1884
01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:52.810
that every time you talk about the conspiracy theories and people tracking your

1885
01:56:52.811 --> 01:56:54.670
electronic purchases and whatnot,

1886
01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.930
I roll my eyes and wonder why you're so crazy.
However,

1887
01:56:59.710 --> 01:57:01.180
this is why I actually started reading better.

1888
01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:06.070
As I pause now and I look at the next three words and it fucking works out the

1889
01:57:06.071 --> 01:57:09.400
king's speech and what is that?
What that movie's about?

1890
01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.870
<v 11>I know.
Yeah.
I'm not watching this.
It's good.
It's really,
really good.</v>

1891
01:57:13.871 --> 01:57:15.850
It looks like it took place in another time.

1892
01:57:15.851 --> 01:57:19.870
So that automatic voice in another time.
It's a period piece about reading.

1893
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:25.450
It's fucking horrific.
But that's what I was just talking about.

1894
01:57:27.250 --> 01:57:31.810
Whatever.
What did you think about your time in that Fucking Ltd?
Um,
however,

1895
01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.810
recently.
Ah,

1896
01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:40.450
<v 9>that's one of my favorite cars.
You just ruined it.
You know what?</v>

1897
01:57:40.451 --> 01:57:43.210
I'm going to have to tell a fucking story that's going to ruin something for
you.

1898
01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:47.770
Let me think.
What are you into?
Going to the mall.

1899
01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.620
<v 11>Yes.
One time I got the fucking or whatever orange Julius stand.</v>

1900
01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.390
No.
However,
recently

1901
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:59.740
<v 9>browsing the Internet and started noticing ads on every page that directly</v>

1902
01:57:59.741 --> 01:58:03.220
related to something I had just purchased online.

1903
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:05.110
How fucked up is that?

1904
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:09.730
Now I knew things like this happened and that site's kept certain information

1905
01:58:09.731 --> 01:58:13.960
about you,
but I guess since I never saw any visual evidence of this,

1906
01:58:13.961 --> 01:58:17.260
I simply put it in the back of my mind.
It never worried about it.
However,

1907
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:21.310
now I had direct in your phrase,
evidence of being tracked.

1908
01:58:21.610 --> 01:58:25.480
I have to say I felt a bit violated.
Yeah,

1909
01:58:25.481 --> 01:58:28.750
it's weird like somebody just sitting there watching what the fuck you're doing.

1910
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:30.491
Um,
anyways,
he says,

1911
01:58:30.491 --> 01:58:34.780
I think that the ads were specifically being put up for me on every website I

1912
01:58:34.781 --> 01:58:38.980
went to struck me as a huge invasion of privacy and it was a bit on nerving.

1913
01:58:40.330 --> 01:58:41.080
Um,
this was a week,

1914
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.650
two ago and ever since then I've become a bit paranoid about the amount of

1915
01:58:44.651 --> 01:58:46.420
information that is out there about me.

1916
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.240
I thought about all the Times I've entered my credit card information

1917
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:53.680
information or home address online in order to make some purchases and went

1918
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:56.680
through every website he could think of to erase that information.
Dude,

1919
01:58:56.681 --> 01:59:00.640
it's overt.
It's already up there.
Um,
I know once it's out there,

1920
01:59:00.641 --> 01:59:03.970
it's impossible to take back,
but I have to do what I can do.

1921
01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.540
I've changed my email address,
my old email email address,

1922
01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.820
had my full name in it,
um,

1923
01:59:09.821 --> 01:59:14.440
started shredding everything with my address on it and started using cash only

1924
01:59:14.441 --> 01:59:18.340
to make purchases so that someone can't track it,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1925
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:20.440
Uh,
yeah.
I actually,

1926
01:59:20.441 --> 01:59:24.070
somebody sent me an email the other day of some four year old kid,

1927
01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:26.110
got a,
um,

1928
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:28.880
<v 11>got a,
a,
what do,
what do you call it?</v>

1929
01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:32.930
A credit card application application yet from American Express.

1930
01:59:32.931 --> 01:59:36.320
And why are we talking about how if you use Gmail,

1931
01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.400
if you're having an email conversation with somebody and you mentioned something

1932
01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:44.150
like,
Oh yeah,
I'll meet you after I go to the spa.
Next thing you know,

1933
01:59:44.151 --> 01:59:46.910
there's all these ads for spa stuff.
Like someone's watching it,

1934
01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:50.210
Google reads your email,
it picks up on key phrases,

1935
01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:55.720
and then just automatically pops up ads around it that you could correlate to

1936
01:59:56.391 --> 01:59:59.570
that email that you just,
for some reason you're looking at an email like,

1937
01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:03.830
like it's illegal for you to read my mail mail.
Right?
So the old school shit,

1938
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:08.300
right?
But somehow online they can just look at that because it's just,
no,

1939
02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:11.600
it's now this is what morons are going to say.
Look Dude,
I mean,
oh,

1940
02:00:11.601 --> 02:00:16.310
it's just two computer program is,
she's picking up shirt and words like this.

1941
02:00:16.311 --> 02:00:20.870
This is how you gradually work your way to having a microchip in your forehead

1942
02:00:20.871 --> 02:00:25.871
is they just incrementally take away what they used to not be able to do.

1943
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:31.950
<v 9>And then what happens is people die off and then the new standard is where this</v>

1944
02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:33.130
new generation was born.

1945
02:00:33.131 --> 02:00:38.131
It's like being taken off the gold standard where cash used to represent gold.

1946
02:00:39.370 --> 02:00:41.590
You brought your golden,
silver was heavy,

1947
02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:45.400
it was dangerous and it was a pain in the ass to carry around.
So banks are like,

1948
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:46.780
we'll bring the shit into us.

1949
02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:50.860
We'll give you these pieces of paper cash that represent the gold.

1950
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.340
You give us $20 in gold,
we'll give you a $20 bill.

1951
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:58.360
And anytime you want you can come back down and fucking,
you know,

1952
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:02.470
get you $20 in gold.
And after awhile we just kept using the piece of paper.

1953
02:01:02.471 --> 02:01:06.280
People forgot about the gold.
The fuckers who brought the golden died.

1954
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:11.140
They took us off the gold standard.
Now you can't claim it.
What happened?

1955
02:01:11.141 --> 02:01:15.580
All that gold and silver,
those fucking can stick.
They kept it.
They kept a shit.

1956
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:19.570
So that's what I'm saying about all this other stuff is like all this stuff that

1957
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:21.790
you used to not be able to do like this.

1958
02:01:21.791 --> 02:01:25.210
People being born now will not remember a time when people couldn't just,

1959
02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:25.481
you know,

1960
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:29.440
when the government couldn't listen to and record every phone conversation you

1961
02:01:29.441 --> 02:01:32.360
ever fucking had.
And I know people get like,
I dunno,

1962
02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.300
this is the type of shit you,
if you talk about what people think,

1963
02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.440
you're fucking paranoid.

1964
02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:39.460
<v 11>Well,
it's also like,
you know,
the stuff that you put on,
like Facebook stuff,</v>

1965
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.050
they'll come here.
I don't care.

1966
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:47.230
I'm just picturing you in a Goddamn car with your fucking hot ass feet up

1967
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:49.290
against the fucking window.
All right.

1968
02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:52.670
Just his podcast is too God damn long at this point.
Oh,

1969
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.860
I already did like another 25 minutes.

1970
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:58.070
Other than this was like an hour and 15 minutes and cut off that part of you.

1971
02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.130
Which part?
The part where we were talking about the stuff with the cars.

1972
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.920
Probably be the fucking best part of the podcast at this point.

1973
02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:09.150
All right then I look,
I got you got,
you know it's what I'm here for.

1974
02:02:09.151 --> 02:02:12.470
I know it's give and take.
Yeah.
Comedy.
Somebody's got to get hurt this week.

1975
02:02:12.471 --> 02:02:16.270
It was me
next time.
Is it going to be me now?

1976
02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.920
I wouldn't do that cause I got a fucking live with you.
Yeah,

1977
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:20.450
I got to live with you.
Well that's it.
Listen,

1978
02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:25.660
I have to rest up my voice because I'm singing a macho man in my fucking

1979
02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:28.910
underwear tomorrow on glee and that's it.

1980
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:30.400
