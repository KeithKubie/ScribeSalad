00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.342
<i> And, you know, I
 went to Mongolia</i>

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.878
<i> and we brought together this
 team, we started packing up.</i>

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.881
<i> There's Fred Hiebert,
 my partner in this.</i>

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.250
<i> We got to this point
 where we pass this gate.</i>

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.285
<i> There was a gate
 that was guarded</i>

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.588
<i> by these
 Mongolian soldiers, right.</i>

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:26.459
<i> That essentially have been
 stationed there for 800 years.</i>

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:31.331
I'm serious. The descendants of
the Darkhads, you know...

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.267
this tribe that had been put in
place by Genghis Khan himself

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.904
to defend this region,
the Ikh Khorig.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.439
This zone that you know

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.843
he closed off to anybody outside
of the Imperial family.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:47.380
Marco Polo wrote about
this place, right.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.950
The history of the
Mongols was written by

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.453
historians like Rashid Al-Din,
from the 17th century.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.021
He wrote about this place.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.423
They wanted to go here
but they couldn't.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:00.360
And for the first time,
I am entering into this zone.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.630
<i> I am on that journey.</i>

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.865
<i> We take that data, we
 had the GPS points now</i>

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:08.968
<i> where the crowd had converged.</i>

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.403
<i> We could
 mathematically calculate</i>

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.538
<i> where everybody had
 converged and clustered.</i>

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:13.740
<i> And we started
 looking and you can</i>

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.375
<i> see where people
 had converged.</i>

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.510
<i> These little clusters
 of tags would result in</i>

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.212
<i> you know, us finding things</i>

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:25.518
<i>like this huge Khirigsur, which
 had been here for 3,000 years!</i>

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.053
We started scanning this region.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.955
<i> This is a magnetometer
 and you walk</i>

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.824
<i> back and forth in these lines.</i>

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.659
<i> And you add up all this data.</i>

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.328
<i> And of course the
 sheep come after you</i>

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.595
<i> every once in a while.</i>

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.497
And the result is you
create these maps of

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.765
what's under the
sub-surface, right.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:44.137
<i> There is some metal underneath
 this rectangular mound.</i>

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.171
<i> We don't really know what
 it was but it wasn't--</i>

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.373
<i> we don't believe
 it was, you know</i>

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.409
<i> what we were really
 looking for.</i>

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.844
<i> So we push north,
 we push deeper</i>

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.912
<i> into this region of
 this Ikh Khorig</i>

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:55.215
<i> towards this mountain, right.</i>

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.517
<i> This place that legend has
 it Genghis Khan went to</i>

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.419
<i> every time he went
 to war, right.</i>

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:03.623
He'd go there and
pray to Tengri and say

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.293
well, you know,
"Am I okay here".

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.762
Then he would go
out and wage war.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.831
<i> We would head out
 every single day</i>

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:15.001
<i> up into the upper reaches
 of this mountain range</i>

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.402
<i> to hit all of the
 different peaks</i>

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.605
<i> to try to see what
 people were tagging.</i>

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.475
<i> We'd fly these drones
 across this whole region</i>

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.042
<i> with cameras on them
 to look and see</i>

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.311
<i> if we could see things that...</i>

00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.680
<i> you know, were little
 higher resolution</i>

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.282
<i> than what we were
 seeing from space.</i>

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.817
<i> We're moving down off the
 side of this mountain and</i>

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.820
<i>literally this storm just starts
 descending all around us.</i>

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.790
You can see this big
rain cloud coming at us.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.827
Among it was lightning,
and thunder, and wind

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.529
and it started blowing all
around us at this rate

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.131
which was, I mean,
really terrifying.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.766
Cause there's no trees
around you to duck into.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.569
We had to move almost a
mile down off this ridge

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.038
down to those trees, just to try
to get down below the tree line

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:55.874
get down into the undercut
but we're so exposed, and

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:58.711
we had these big magnetometers
hanging off of our back.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.013
<i> We ran, we ran and the
 wind started blowing.</i>

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:04.249
<i> You know, I mean, it started
 gushing around us and</i>

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.617
I mean, we couldn't
even hear each other.

00:03:05.617 --> 00:03:07.252
And as we were running down
off the side of this mountain

00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:10.089
down the south-east
flank of that mountain

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.690
what would be the sunny
side of that mountain

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.527
what the secret history the
Mongols had described as being

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.696
where Genghis Khan
should be buried

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.766
all these trees started
falling down around us.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.000
( crashing sounds )

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.903
<i>And, you know, it was really...</i>

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.171
<i> it was almost like...</i>

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.008
the mountain was showing us

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.313
its underbelly, it was
showing us a window

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.348
into the sub-surface,
you know.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.017
And it would be in the roots
of one of those trees

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.185
that my life would
really change.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:44.323
<i> My geologist turns to me
 and shows me this thing</i>

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.859
<i> and I'm looking at it, just
 in the roots of this tree.</i>

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.229
<i> And it's this lion face.</i>

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.231
<i> We made a plan, as we
 were walking around</i>

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.366
<i> we're like literally
 walking around across</i>

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.770
across this grass and the earth
is crunching underneath me.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.473
I could feel, I could feel like
I was stepping on something.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.309
I could hear it
crunching underneath me

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.277
like
( crunching sounds )

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:09.148
And we agreed that it was okay
to just look under the grass

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.215
like it was a rug, you know

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.017
we'd just stare barely
underneath this.

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:13.919
You know, this thing, we'd
look underneath the grass.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.389
And, we were standing on a roof.

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.460
<i>And as you look at these pieces
 that are in this sub-surface</i>

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.429
<i> it's this part of this temple.</i>

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.068
<i> We started finding horse
 bones, tons of horse bones.</i>

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.137
<i> We sent this data out to
 get Radiocarbon dated</i>

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:33.139
and it comes back...

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.276
at exactly our
sweet spot, right.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.281
Somewhere between 500
and 800 years old.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.318
Genghis Khan died in 1227,
about 800 years ago.

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:49.588
<i> So, Fred and I, we
 started making a plan.</i>

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:51.390
<i> And we started mapping
 out this region</i>

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.391
<i> with whatever tools
 we could find.</i>

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:55.094
<i> We used cameras on our drones
 and we created this</i>

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.864
<i> 3-D photogrammetry mapper
 of the surface.</i>

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:00.499
<i> And we started using things
 like ground penetrating radar.</i>

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:01.701
<i> This is an 18--</i>

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:04.937
<i> actually an eight-antenna
 array radar system.</i>

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.039
<i> We're doing a virtual dig.</i>

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.410
<i> We're trying to recreate the
 unknown, in virtual reality</i>

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.278
<i> because we can't
 actually go there</i>

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.181
<i> and pull up the earth, right.</i>

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.451
But, I feel like...

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:22.588
I didn't really even have
to look for this artifact.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.723
I just had to look at what
was happening around me

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:27.927
and realize that the
people around me were

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.829
they were telling me that
the history was still alive

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.930
the artifact was
in the experience.

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.601
<i> Did we find the tomb or
 did each individual in us</i>

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:39.305
<i> each individual in this group
 find something in themselves?</i>
