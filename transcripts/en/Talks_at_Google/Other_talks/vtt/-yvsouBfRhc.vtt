00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.009
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So welcome on behalf
of Authors at Google. I'm really excited today

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.481
to bring you Chris Dixon to discuss his new
book Ghost Wave: The Discovery of Cortes Bank

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:17.430
and the Biggest Wave on Earth. Chris is the
founding editor of SurferMag.com. He once

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.740
spent a year documenting the wild life of
another author we've posted here, Jimmy Buffet.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.929
And his work has appeared in many publications,
including the New York Times, Outside, Men's

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.530
Journal, Popular Mechanics, Surfer, and Surfer's
Journal. He lives in Charleston, South Carolina.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.500
And I'm wondering how the surfing is there.
&gt;&gt;Chris: Actually it can be pretty good.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.580
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Okay. Friends have tagged along
with Chris today, and I'm going to let him

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.840
introduce them and tell you more about them.
One point is -- remember we have a remote

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.950
audience. So, when you want to ask a question,
we'll need to get a mic to you so they can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.690
hear it or the speaker can repeat the question.
So I can -- join me in welcoming Chris Dixon.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.219
[Applause]

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:10.560
&gt;&gt; Chris: Thank you guys a lot for coming.
This is a real honor. I used Google a lot

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.750
in researching this book in ways that I didn't
even expect to. And so, to be able to actually,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.890
you know, come here and talk to you guys and
maybe even tell you a little bit about how

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.049
[chuckles] I used some Google in some ways
-- it was pretty cool. This book is -- obviously,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.680
it's called Ghost Wave: The Discovery of Cortes
Bank and the Biggest Wave on Earth. And I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.490
became really fascinated in the Bank early
on in 2001 after a group of guys that -- one

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.200
of whom is here, up here in the front with
me -- went out. And the photographer -- actually,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.049
two guys are here, Photographer Rob Brown
and Ken "Skin-Dog" Collins who is a well-known

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.810
Mavericks surfer, went out and road these
waves that nobody even knew existed back in

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.249
2001. And I'm going to stop real quick and
just tell you that the other guys I have with

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:11.480
me are Greg Long, big wave surfer from San
Clemente, Jason Murray, "Skinny", Jeff Clark

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.500
of Mavericks' renown and Rob Brown. And they'll
be available to answer some questions afterwards,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.640
too, because the book wouldn't have been possible
without the help and just amazing work that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.380
these guys [chuckles] have done through the
years conquering big waves around the world.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.470
So I'll start with showing you a pulled back
picture of this wave on Cortes, January 2008.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.010
This is actually stretched a bit. So this
wave is actually bigger than this. If you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.520
were looking at it in a real regular perspective
-- perhaps -- I don't know -- 65, 70 feet

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.730
high. This is Grant Banker, who is one of
Greg's best friends, he's a South African.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:05.209
And he's also very well-known in the Mavericks
community. The Cortes Bank is a really unusual

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:14.990
underwater feature. And it was first explored
by sort of the group of surfers who now go

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.590
out there on a regular basis -- or started
going out there on a regular basis -- around

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.380
the turn of the century by a group of guys
that included Larry Moore who everyone knew

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.569
as Flame who was the photo editor of Surfing
Magazine. And Larry developed a real mania

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.370
to chart the spots off the California coast
that he thought might have waves. And this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:48.469
included the outer Channel Islands on San
Nicholas and San Clemente. And then, he became

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.481
sort of fixated along with two other guys
that he worked with at Surfing Magazine. Bill

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:59.939
Sharp, who is right here. And Bill, as these
guys know, is the sometimes contentious, always

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:06.500
entertaining, director of the Billabong XXL
Big Wave Awards. Bill and Sam George, who

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.799
was director of the film Riding Giants some
of you guys may have seen. Bill and Sam and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.590
Flame eyeballed this spot off the California
coast -- way off the California coast. You

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.190
can see this is southern California right
here. San Clemente. Catalina, San Nicholas.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.950
Then I'm going to zoom and show you the Cortes
and Tanner Banks. These are really strange

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.990
underwater features. They're essentially sunken
Channel Islands. They're not little sea mounts.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.210
They're really big. If you were to measure
Cortes from here to here the shoal stretch

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.620
it's about 15 miles long and the waters off
of Cortes drop off to 1,000 fathoms or 6,000

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.160
feet. What that translates into for a surfer
is a spot that's capable of taking wave

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.340
energy and focusing it almost like a lens
-- like sunlight through a magnifying glass

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:09.250
on a very shallow pinnacle here called Bishop
Rock. Which is various depending on the tides

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.770
on the shallowest point of Bishop Rock comes
to 12 to 15 feet from the surface. Even further

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.710
complicating things, they saw on the map a
fathom, a half fathom of water over one spot.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.860
And that was -- that looked like a wreck.
A shipwreck. So there's a shipwreck that's

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.870
covered by three feet of water out there.
They didn't know what that meant. All they

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.240
knew was that could generate a wave. The first
person that they asked about, the first person

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.069
that Flame actually asked about the potential
for there to be waves was a gentleman named

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.080
Phillip "Flippy" Hoffman. Some of you may
have heard of Christian and Nathan Fletcher.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.060
This is Christian and Nathan Fletcher's great
uncle; he passed away this past year. And

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.910
he was a renowned big wave surfer. One of
the first people to surf a frightening wave

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.130
off a westernmost point of Oahu called Kaena
Point. Flippy used to fish of the Cortes Bank

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.350
in the 50s for abalone. He would join a number
of other big wave surfers. They could get

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.800
6 dollars or so per abalone so they were pulling
in pretty good money because you could pull

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.710
in 50 or 60 dozen abalone in a day. Flippy
described the bank "It was a very rough place

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.970
to try to sleep at night. Cups and plates
would fly across the galley. I knew sometimes

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:31.860
it would get really big out there." But he
never surfed it. So they weren't able to confirm

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.790
with anybody, had anybody ever actually surfed
out there. This is what Flippy described to

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:44.819
them though. He described this beautiful place
of cerulean water. Massive schools of sardine

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:52.349
and Menhaden, kelp forest. And bat rays. Huge
bat rays swimming along on the bottom. And

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.740
then urchins and abalone just littering the
sea floor. A real underwater Eden. But also

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.760
a place, obviously, of real considerable danger.
These photos were taken by a a guy named Terry

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.289
Moss who's spearfishes out there a great deal.
He's actually set a few world records at top

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.800
the bank spear fishing. This is what they're
fishing for abalone, these huge shellfish

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:24.509
that are very tasty. The other person that
Flippy had talked to almost sort of independently

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:31.539
of Flame, at least early on, was a guy named
Sean Collins and Sean is generally considered

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:37.410
surfing's one true media mogul these days.
He runs a big surf-forecasting site called

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:43.949
SurfLine.com. And Sean also talked to Flippy
and Flippy basically described the same thing.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.889
And Sean had also talked to some other fishermen
out there. Another fisherman, in particular,

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:57.919
who said he actually seen a good surfable-looking
wave out there. Well, Sean developed a real

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:04.169
insatiable need to find out where waves came
from, how they worked why they came in sets.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:09.879
Why the sets had different spacings and what
the different angles were. And he turned that

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:14.860
eventually into very successful surf forecasting
business. Because if you talk to Sean he's

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.820
still today completely obsessed with understanding
the propagation of waves across the ocean.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.030
This is a chart he drew early on where he
was trying to -- it was just a hand drawn

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.319
chart that looked at the chart guide where
he was actually looking at the bathymetry

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:34.380
-- the underwater topography figuring out,
"Okay. What happens when a wave comes across

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.719
the Cortes Bank ?" Ideal direction? Should
it be a swell that comes from a storm way

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:43.940
up to the north? Should it be a storm to the
south? Should it be a storm right off the

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:51.800
California coast? And he kind of keeps the
best of these angles a secret. Eventually,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:09:00.410
Flame, Bill Sharp, Sam George and a pro from
Laguna named George Hulse road out on an incredibly

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:06.291
secret mission. They didn't tell anybody.
And this is George Hulse' first paddle in

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:10.709
wave atop the Cortes Bay. There was no such
thing as what's known as tow surfing today

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:18.060
back in 1990 when they road these waves. But
you can imagine they're 100 miles out in the

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.761
ocean. There's no land anywhere. All there
is is this shallow sea mount. And they're

00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.920
in the middle of the open ocean. It's very
difficult to even catch a wave out there much

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.260
less try to predict where the next one is
going to come from. As you can imagine they

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:39.740
also got steam-rolled by several sets. This
is generally considered as small as Cortes

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.420
is able to break. This is maybe 8 feet. What
surfers would consider 8 feet from top to

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.019
bottom. If it's any smaller than this the
waves just sort of generally pass over the

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:56.480
bank and don't even break. They just continue
on to California. Sam George described it

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.670
as "one of the most fantastic feelings. We
had found Flame's Moby Dick." In researching

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:12.470
the history of the bank, I think it was a
geologist or an archaeologist, I can't remember

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.810
which who actually pointed out to me that
Cortes was actually an island not very long

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:23.970
ago. As recently as 10,000 years ago, it was
a big island. It was about 14 miles long.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:30.510
And it's very likely that it would have been
walked upon hunted upon by the native Americans

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.620
who lived on San Clemente island 40 miles
away. They regularly paddled these huge distances

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.740
between all the Channel Islands. And so, it
wouldn't have been a stretch at all for them

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.920
to paddle along Tanner Island and Cortes Island.
And here we see a map that shows us the contours

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:54.150
of the coast, 10 and 12,000 years ago. 12,000
years ago, all of the northern Channel Islands

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.889
-- Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, the ones off of
Santa Barbara were a single island inhabited

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:08.740
by a tribe of woolly mammoths that swam over
there at some point in history. And then,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.290
this shows -- the black is 10,000 years ago.
The gray is 12,000 years ago. There was even

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:18.769
a tiny island that they called North Cortes
12,000 years ago. But 10,000 or so years ago

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:26.260
was when native Americans would have first
gone out there. They would have -- you know,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.421
they lived on San Clemente. And this is the
western shoreline of San Clemente. And it

00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:37.300
shows these million-year-old plus wave-scoured
of San Clemente. This kind of gives

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:44.130
you what the wave topography off of Cortes
looks like. The varying sea levels through

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.480
the millennia have created these stair steps.
And each of these flat stair step spots is

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.540
a spot where the sea level remained fairly
constant for awhile and it scoured out these

00:11:53.540 --> 00:12:01.930
ridges. They would have gotten there on what
are called tomol or tiat plank canoes. And

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:08.550
these folks were as solid a seafarers as you
could hope to find. Surely as much so as Hawaiians

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.480
and there's even -- I've even read some thought
there's cross-pollination between Polynesian

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.820
and Californian culture. When they went out
to Tanner Banks, which is the near of the

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.860
islands, this is essentially what they would
have seen. This is provided to me by Rick

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.779
Gavitak California State University Monterey
Bay. They would have seen a hilltop about

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:38.910
100 foot high bluff in red. Then 75 to 100-foot
high ring around a beautiful lagoon that would

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.820
have just been a paradisaical place to fish.
There would have just been incredible sea

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:51.000
life in that lagoon. And then this would have
been looking from North Cortes to South Cortes.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.990
And you can see how quickly the sea floor
drops off. Interestingly, this is the western

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:02.310
plank of Cortes where the big swells approach
from -- here you see some blank spots in the

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:09.720
map. That's because when Mr. Gavitak was mapping
the sea floor, he actually had a whale flip

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:17.500
off his sonar sounder, so he wasn't able to
get there the whole way. I, obviously, was

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.980
interested in the history of who discovered
the Cortes Bank. When was -- why is it named

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:29.290
what it is, etc. The general truth that's
accepted is that a ship called a Cortes, a

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:37.139
side-wheel steamer that passed along the coast
in the 1850s carrying 49ers to San Francisco,

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:42.050
was the first ship to ever seen waves atop
the bank. This is an ad actually from the

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:50.610
New York Times in 1853. The captain of the
ship on this actual passage that's advertised

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.450
on this very ship right here reported seeing
-- as he passed this bank -- he said the waters

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.130
were in violent convulsion, throwing up suddenly
into columns at regular intervals of four

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.860
to five minutes. Because of that, that would
have represented a big shipping hazard. You

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.759
were seeing thousands of people ferried every
week to San Francisco to head into the mountains

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:16.300
to look for gold. So officers of the United
States Coast Survey would have been dispatched

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.290
out there to the middle of the ocean with
basically a sink-line with lead on the end

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:25.660
of it to go and try find this thing. They
would have given him a rough idea of it probably

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.529
would have. But it would have been difficult
to actually find this place out in the middle

00:14:29.529 --> 00:14:35.820
of the ocean. But it was found by the officers
of the Coast Survey in 1853. And this is the

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.130
first map. Interestingly enough though, they
missed the spot that is surfed today -- the

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.440
spot called the Bishop Rock. And that was
reportedly found by a clipper ship called

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.120
the SS Bishop. And this is an advertisement
that appeared in the Daily Alta advertising

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.410
passage on the Bishop around Cape Horn to
New York City. This ship still holds the record

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:02.120
for the fastest sailing trip from the East
to West Coast and you could have booked it

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:09.560
in California Street in San Francisco. This
is the Bishop. Now, the legend has it that

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:16.029
the Bishop struck a rock out in the middle
of the ocean. Back it up one. The Bishop struck

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:22.360
a rock out in the middle of the ocean. That
this was the Bishop Rock. And it somehow went

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.560
back to San Francisco battered and torn. But
I've been able to find no verification of

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.220
that. And I actually had a guy named Steve
Lawson, who's a pretty well known treasure

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.259
hunter in Orange County who's looked at a
lot of ships basically say, "I don't see any

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:43.300
record of a ship actually hitting it." And
so, what we have hypothesized was that a ship

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.680
actually probably saw waves out there and
the story became conflated over time that

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.610
it actually hit the rock. So then the question
came to me, "Okay. So was there any earlier

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.480
record?" And interestingly enough a guy named
James Alden, who was a commander with the

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.709
Coast Survey, a real world traveler. He had
visited -- he traveled all over the world

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:08.450
aboard the U.S.S. Constitution. When the Mexican
American War started in the 1840s, Alden was

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:19.000
aboard the USS Constitution and it sailed
from Hawaii to Monterey and on -- I believe

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.130
it was January fifth of 1846 --as they left
Monterey Bay and sailed south, they discovered

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.180
breakers bearing northeast about ten miles
distant. And this would have been a time that

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.190
you would have seen big waves on the Cortes
Bank. So I kind of postulate that the bank

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.110
should actually be called the Constitution
Bank, because it was discovered by Old Ironsides,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:44.399
which is still afloat in Philadelphia today.
The other real interesting story, at least

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:51.199
to me, was, "Okay. If the Bishop didn't actually
hit the rock, then maybe it should be named

00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:56.080
after the guy who actually discovered the
rock in 1855." This was the father. I wasn't

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.660
able to find the picture of the guy who actually
discovered the rock, but this was his father

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.149
who was a general in the Confederacy from
Wilmington, North Carolina. And the guy's

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:10.430
name was Archibald MacRae. And on November
3 of 1855, a story appeared in the New York

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:16.160
Times "Dangerous rock off the coast of California."
MacRae spent a couple of miserable weeks off

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:24.300
the coast of California and he finally found
this 12 foot deep rock. And then, two weeks

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:31.850
later, he blew his brains out in San Francisco
Bay. And the story is pretty tragic. And I

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:39.610
was pretty shocked when I found that out.
All of his letters home are at Duke University.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:45.930
And they're pretty wrenching -- his letters
home during his whole military career including

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.410
his suicide note. "My soul I give to God,
and I hope he will make better use of it than

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:55.330
I have." Whether or not he is buried in Wilmington
actually remains a mystery. He had been buried

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:03.670
in Yerba Buena which no longer a cemetery.
So moving forward in time. Okay. Who else

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.580
went to the Cortes Bank? What are some other
stories? There were several stories in the

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:13.270
Los Angeles Times during the 20s and 30s about
coast surveyors and fishermen who really started

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:19.390
discovering the waters off the bank. But then
in 1957, Mel Fisher, who some of you guys

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:25.900
may know is the discoverer of the richest
treasure on the sea floor off of Florida.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.771
He launched his first major treasure hunting
expedition off to Cortes. And I was actually

00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:37.460
able to locate the reporter who went out with
him on that journey and we talked about it.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:43.760
And it turned into just a complete fiasco.
Their boat almost sank on several occasions.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:52.040
And they basically didn't find any treasure.
But this was the start of Mel Fisher's career.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.200
And his first mission was Cortes Bank. I thought
this was a funny picture. This was provided

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:04.340
to me by Jimmy Buffet, graciously. This is
Mel Fisher on July 20, 1985, sitting atop

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:11.140
gold and silver bars at the Atocha. While
Jimmy sings "A Pirate looks at 40". [laughter]

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:17.650
And that was actually on the day that he found
the treasure. So, I wanted to know, "Who was

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.880
the first person to surf out there?" Who was
actually the first person to catch a wave

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.760
off the Cortes bank? I'm not going to say
definitively that the gentleman in the center

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.350
of this photo is the guy who discovered, who
first surfed out there, but I think it's very

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:36.580
possible. His name is Harrison Ealey, and
he is an absolute hoot. He lives in Oceanside;

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:43.670
he is a real adventurer who spent his early
years sailing between Mexico, Hawaii, and

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.550
California, and hardly anybody's ever heard
of him. I was put on to him by a guy named

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:53.270
Mickey Munoz, who was a well-known surfer
in his 70s. And he still charges every day

00:19:53.270 --> 00:20:00.290
in San Clemente. In this photograph are another
big wave surfer named Wayne Schafer. And this

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.830
is Phil Edwards, who is the first guy to have
ever been documented surfing pipeline. And

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:15.030
there riding on Phillip "Flippy" Hoffman's
catamaran be built taking it down to trestles.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.790
So, Mickey put me on to Harrison. Harrison
showed me this picture of him surfing Waimea

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:30.230
in perfect form dropping inside a Waimea legend
named Buzzy Trent in 1963. Well, Harrison,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:37.940
in 1961, actually carried Phil Edwards to
Hawaii for the north shore winner. And a week

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.830
or two later, Phil -- that's when Phil Edwards
was documented surfing the pipeline. So Harrison

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:49.510
actually carried Phil Edwards to his date
with fame at the Bonsai Pipeline. On the way

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:56.120
back from Hawaii, on this very same trip,
Harrison sailed past the Cortes Bank. It was

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.700
during the summer. There was a big south swell
in the water. And the weather was very calm.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.630
And he saw this wave breaking out in the middle
of the ocean. And he said, "Whoa, I want to

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.820
go check that out." And so, they pulled the
boat up close, anchored it in shallow water.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.210
And this is Harrison basically said, "I've
been surfing Makaha and Waimea, so it didn't

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.610
look scary. But then it wasn't 50 feet either.
I watched it and watched it before I tried

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.920
to catch one." And eventually he did. He caught
a few waves. Then, when the tide started to

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:28.180
stir the current, things got a a little breezy,
he just pulled up anchor and sailed back to

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:35.530
California. There were a number of other stories
about the bank that I found. None of them

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:41.660
were sort of more scary than that of this
gentleman named Ilima Kalama. Ilima is the

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:50.160
father of Dave Kalama. And Ilima is a well-known
big wave pioneer in his own right. Ilima used

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.880
to abalone fish in the late 60s and early
70s. And around 1971, I'm pretty sure is what

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.540
he said, he and a buddy named Larry Doyle
were off the coast of Cortes and they had

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.081
a huge take of abalone. And they knew that
the weather was going downhill and all of

00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:15.420
the other fishing boats pulled off of the
bank and headed back to shore. But Ilima basically

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:21.570
said, "I got greedy." And he went out and
they decided to stay. Well, in the middle

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.670
of the night, the weather got rough, the waves
got huge and the boat kind of sank out from

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.480
beneath them. And left he and Larry basically
swimming in the middle of the ocean in pitch

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:36.140
black dark. And there was -- the water was
about 49 degrees. As you can imagine they

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.960
would have frozen to death very quickly had,
a few minutes later, not their wet suits popped

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.230
to the surface like the coffin in Moby Dick.
They climbed into their wet suits and I'll

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.190
let you guys read the rest of the story. If
you believe in miracles, the fact that he

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:57.310
survived is an absolute one. So, in moving
forward in time, in 1985, there was -- and

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.310
I have a feeling I can't confirm this, but
I think part of the reason Flame became fixed

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.630
on the waves of the Cortes bank was because
there had been a report of a ship striking

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.180
a reef 100 miles off the coast of California
in the LA Times. And the story didn't get

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:16.990
a whole lot of play. There were only a few
mentions of it. But essentially I was lucky

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:22.810
enough to find the commander Robert Leuschner
and he told me about what happened. Basically

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.220
the USS Enterprise slammed into the spot very
near where the guys surf today and it was

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:33.310
nearly sunk. And it would be a very different
place today, you know, a radioactive waste

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:42.080
dump for one thing, had that actually happened.
But Mr. Leuschner attributed his Savior to

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:50.170
divine intervention as well. The strangest
story that I came upon in all of this and

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:55.470
one that still has resonance with the surfers
today is a chapter I call "The Kings of Abalonia."

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:03.350
In 1966, a story appeared in the Pasadena
Independent that was quoted a gentleman named

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.700
Bruce. I think, well, his last name is Taggard,
I don't remember his first name. He says,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.250
"It sounds fantastic but we've consulted experts
in international law. They say there's nothing

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.570
to prevent us from starting our own country
if we want to. The Cortes Bank is in international

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.970
waters on the shelf and beyond the U.S. or
Mexican jurisdiction." So essentially the

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.860
idea was
they were going to take a bunch of rocks out

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.890
and sink them until Cortes Bank was again
an island for the first time in thousands

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:35.670
of years, plant a flag on it and declare territorial
waters all the way around the Cortes Bank,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:41.610
which would give them potentially huge lucrative
fishing rights because it's one of the most

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:48.470
prolific fisheries in the Pacific. So the
guy who actually hatched this plan was an

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:55.770
actor named Joe Kirkwood. He was sort of a
B movie actor who played a boxer Joe Palooka

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.150
back in the 50s and 60s. And he was very well
known at this time because he also played

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:06.050
in five masters golf tournaments. I tried
really, really hard to find anybody who'd

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.430
been attached to this project and was just
banging my head against the desk. I couldn't

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:16.870
find anybody. And then one day this package
comes in the mail anonymously to me that contained

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:24.910
a 60-page account that Kirkwood had written
of his role in this fiasco. And it even included

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:29.970
some really interesting film that I'm going
to show you guys in a second. But we see that

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.430
Kirkwood wrote, "The newspapers called it
Abalonia, although I wanted to call it Lumeria

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:39.250
for Lumeria is to the Pacific what Atlantis
is to the Atlantic." I thought it was fitting.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:45.160
The country I was going to build would be
deserving of a better name than Abalonia."

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.280
That was Joe Kirkwood writing in '67. He submitted
this story interestingly to Sports Illustrated.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.340
As I said, he was a well-known golfer at the
time. And why they didn't at least publish

00:25:54.340 --> 00:26:00.600
it I have no idea. In '50 -- I actually found
a photo of Kirkwood that was taken in 1952

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.730
in Wilmington, North Carolina, coincidentally,
which is where Archibald MacRae who discovered

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:11.690
Kirkwood's nation-building site was from.
And this photo is of him and his wife actress

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:18.100
Cathy Downs, who is the azalea queen that
year. This photo is actually taken by Archibald

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:26.150
MacRae's great, great nephew. And had it not
been for Google, that knowledge would never

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:33.620
ever have come to life. [laughter] The person
that Kirkwood hit up to help him plan this

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:39.840
mission was one of the best-known divers in
California in the 1960s. And the reason was

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.930
that he had been diving Devil's Hole which
is this gash. This little tiny gash that leads

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:50.570
almost to an underground sea beneath Death
Valley. And this gentleman -- this is him

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:57.760
diving in Devil's Hole. He had set a world
record by diving 300 feet deep in Devil's

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.030
Hole on nothing but compressed air. No mixture
or anything. And he was the right man for

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.001
the job. He was a Navy demolitions expert.
He was an expert fisherman. He had been to

00:27:07.001 --> 00:27:12.590
the Cortes Bank a lot fishing. And so, Kirkwood
went to him and basically said, "I want to

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.140
build a nation out there. What do you think?"
And Houtz said the idea really got the wheels

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.310
spinning. It was like, "Okay. I got a project
here. What will it take to do it?" Houtz came

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:28.490
up with a very interesting, radical idea.
There was this ship in the moth ball fleet

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:34.860
in San Francisco -- in Oakland actually -- that
had been badged the Jalisco and it had come

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:42.700
from Mexico. It was built of concrete in the
1940s in Tampa as a World War II freighter.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:48.880
It had been badged the Richard Lewis Humphrey
in America. And then disappeared to Mexico

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.910
and then turned back up into moth ball fleet.
They bought this ship for 80,000 dollars.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:28:00.340
Salvaged most of the parts off of it. And
this is actually footage of it being towed

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:06.720
to the Cortes Bank beneath the Bay Bridge.
So there's some interesting San Francisco

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.710
connections to this story that has absolutely
nothing to do with surfing at all. This was

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:20.610
actually it being carried down. And you can
see the concrete hull. And this is the tug

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:26.530
that carried it all the way down there over
300 miles. When they got there, everything

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:32.120
was going according to plan, but then there
were several communication snafus and miscues

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:39.200
and they got the ship sort of positioned atop
the Bishop rock. And then things started to

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.670
go haywire. And the reason it did was because
this was, of course, November and Houtz had

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:51.180
noticed a big storm brewing off the coast
of Japan but it looked like it was days and

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:57.150
days out. What he failed to calculate was
the face that swells from these storms propagate

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:02.700
way ahead of these storms and they run way
way way faster. And so, as they got the ships

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:09.870
into position. Seas were calm as a lake. Within
about an hour and a half, they were battling

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:16.070
waves 50-feet high atop the bank. They came
in out of nowhere. This is Joe Kirkwood perched

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:26.150
on the bow of his great ship of state as it
is about to be submerged. He said, "There

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.210
was enormous wall of blue-green water rising
45 feet or more and the fish were plainly

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:36.170
visible." This superstructure is four stories
tall. So what you're looking at is the back

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:41.610
of a breaking wave. Kirkwood is looking up
at a wave 30 to 40 feet high and it's getting

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:49.640
ready to take him out. Now, the boys who surf
out there didn't realize that this ship was

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.040
there. They knew there was a ship there, but
they didn't realize exactly where it was.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.030
This is Kirkwood after he's been liberated
from the ship. He was in the water. Jim Houtz,

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.970
the gentleman in the other photo, is standing
behind the superstructure here. He had been

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:06.900
trying to get Joe to let go of the mast and
come back there with him. And the fact that

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:14.530
these guys survived again is like, it's unbelievable.
I'm just -- I'm astonished that nobody that

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.840
I found has actually died atop the bank. This
wave is even bigger. As you can see, it's

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:24.360
bearing the entire superstructure of the ship
and several of these guys -- actually all

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.370
of these guys are intimately familiar with
this exact spot. This is later, and you can

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.520
see the superstructure has blown off the spot
by the waves. And this is a breaking wave

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.810
on the shallow spot at Bishop rock. Today
-- this was a couple years afterwards -- these

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:47.140
guys went diving in the hull of the Jalisco,
which is as I said, known for now is lots

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:56.030
of big, big lobsters. So, I'm sure you guys
are now, --because I've been dragging this

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:01.380
story out-- interested. "Okay. So where do
these waves come from?" The waves that sweep

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.420
over Mavericks, Cortes Bank, Todos Santos,
Pescadero Point and Carmel also known as Ghost

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:15.580
Street are -- they come from massive storms
that generally sweep off of Siberia and get

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.460
pulled up into the warm waters of the Japan
current and sort of go nuclear as they -- the

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:28.220
mixture between the cold and the warm ocean
currents causes huge storms to spin up. In

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:33.470
1933, this gentleman -- it says James White
Marsh. It's actually R.P. White Marsh. That's

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:39.500
a typo on my part. Went into the middle of
one of these storms about a ship called the

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.240
Ramapo that you saw in the previous picture
and went over a wave that is still the biggest

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.570
ever recorded in the open ocean. A wave of
112 feet high. And I actually found his daughter

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:54.550
living in Honolulu. She's 88. And she really
helped me kind of spin the story of incredible

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:59.410
guy. He was t the guy who actually sunk the
Japanese mini sub in the hours before the

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:04.880
attack. And had been an officer on a ship
in World War II that had been sunk from beneath

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.700
him. He led just an incredible life. So what
White Marsh basically experienced and some

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.081
other engineers in here. So hopefully you
can get your heads around this graphic. When

00:32:15.081 --> 00:32:24.110
you have a long long fetch of wind across
the water, you can see it when winds at San

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:28.000
Francisco Bay. You can see these tiny little
ripples start to form. The longer that wind

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.890
blows, the bigger those ripples get until
by the time you're 25 miles offshore, you

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.090
can have a 10-foot wave that takes -- if you
were standing -- if you were on a boat in

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:44.690
a single spot, that wave would take seven
seconds to pass you by. As those waves get

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:51.710
bigger and bigger, they get faster and faster.
Their periods, or wavelengths, increase dramatically

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:56.100
until by the time you're about five miles
offshore with a 40 knot continual wind, you'd

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.570
be looking at a wave that would take 15 seconds
to pass you that would have -- that would

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.830
be 15 feet high and would go down below the
surface of the ocean. Its energy column 575

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:12.640
feet. As you get longer and longer stretches,
the waves just get bigger and bigger until

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.030
at the end of 2000 miles, that wave would
be 37 feet high with a 20 second period and

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:22.200
it would go down to 1,000 feet below the surface
of the ocean. That doesn't mean it would be

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:28.110
as powerful here as it is here. But you would
have an energy column that far down. Now,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:33.340
you know, how could 112-foot wave happen?
Basically as I understand it. I'm not the

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:39.821
oceanographer, but as it was explained to
me -- these waves, they don't sort of follow

00:33:39.821 --> 00:33:48.090
tidy laws of physics. One wave might be -- you
might have a 37-foot wave actually run over

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:54.240
the top of a 15-foot wave. And when that happens,
you could get what you would consider a rogue

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.230
wave. A wave that's temporary but that builds
up far, far bigger than its brothers and sisters.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.990
And if you're at the wrong place at the wrong
time, as Sean Collins the forecaster, explained

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.970
to me, you could end up with a perfect storm
scenario. It's just that not a lot of boats

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.220
are there to actually see that happen. And
when they do, the results can be catastrophic.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:18.990
But it happens all the time. You think that
this must be a rare occurrence. At any one

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:25.880
time there was -- I believe it was a European
space agency study that found there were seven

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:33.060
or eight waves like this coursing through
the oceans on an average day at any one time.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.880
So that gives you somewhat of an idea. And
then, this is a famous photo that's just on

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:45.090
the Internet thanks to Google of a ship facing
a wave that's maybe 80 feet behind him. So

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:50.870
you can imagine what 112-footer must have
looked like. But it swept beneath him and

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:58.020
the ship surfed down it for awhile and then
it kept going. And then so what happens when

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.380
a wave like that hits the Cortes Bank? This
was a graphic provided to me courtesy of Sean

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.460
Collins in surf line. Here we see the Bishop
Rock. And the way that it sort of sticks up

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:14.390
out here. But then you see this abyssal drop
off of the Cortes bank. It goes -- it drops

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:20.170
down as I said to 6,000 feet. So a wave that
comes up has nowhere to go up but up because

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:25.130
it's been coursing through the ocean at 1,000
feet depth. And it climbs these stair steps

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:31.490
off Bishop Rock and can become essentially
what is generally recognized now as the biggest,

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:39.060
rideable, surfable, perfect wave on the face
of the earth. In 1990, Flame -- the photographer

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:44.380
-- flew over the Cortes Bank with his buddy,
Mike Castillo and in the days right before

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.480
the -- right before they made their first
surf mission. And they took these photos from

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.120
an airplane. They were actually looking at
the sea waves looking way way up at these

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.460
waves. And Sean Collins went and backtracked
these swells and said these waves 80 or 90

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.070
feet high. Because they didn't have any point
of reference, because they didn't have any

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.760
point of reference, they didn't know how big
they actually were but Sean reckons these

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:11.910
were 80 or 90-foot waves. And as you can see
Mike Castillo told Flame, "if anyone tries

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:17.050
to surf out there, they better bring the "blanking"
Pope along to pray for them." And, of course,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:25.160
eventually guys did. Here's a shot from the
air of one of Flame's 17 or 18 flyovers at

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.090
various times at Cortes Bank on swells. He
became just obsessed, just fixated trying

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:35.210
to figure out when the Cortes Bank broke the
best. What were the best conditions? As the

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:40.531
surfers in this crowd would agree, these are
not ideal conditions for Cortes bank. This

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:46.270
is actually not a huge swell by Cortes standards.
And it's pretty windy and choppy out there,

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:51.910
but you can see the right-handed wave just
peeling off in the distance. And that's what

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:57.870
these guys are after out there. You see two
waves following each other in succession.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:06.850
That's what they became obsessed with. In
the late 1990s, tow surfing really started

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:13.990
taking off. For those of you who have seen
it, it's pretty darn spectacular. It was among

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:21.620
the first people to do it at all were generally
regarded to be the Hawaiians Laird Hamilton,

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:29.100
Dave Kalama, Derek Doerner. Some of their
friends. And the waves that they road at spot

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.720
off the coast of Maui and also a spot off
called Log Cabins off Oahu were generally

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:39.160
just considered a quantum leap. And it wasn't
long before guys like these boys in front,

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:45.260
Jeff Clark, and "Skinny" in particular, took
up that mantle to see if you could do that

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:50.581
at Mavericks. And of course they realized
in short order it was quite possible. One

00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:55.020
of Rob Brown -- a photographer here -- one
of his good friends growing up was this little

00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.210
skinny ripper named Mike Parsons. Rob described
him as this skinny, red-headed, stepchild

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.970
with freckles, with his perfect wetsuit and
his sponsor's logo air brushed on it and he

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.600
pulled these perfect "off the lips". We tried
to buy him but he outsurfed us so bad that

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:14.370
it just didn't matter. Well, in 2001, after
several aborted missions, the conditions finally

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:21.300
came together for Mike and the boys to maybe
go out to Cortes Bank. And Mike had just been

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.850
obsessed big wave surfer. This is him at Todos
Santos this is one of the first bona fide

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.290
big waves that it realized existed off the
California coast. Of course Mavericks would

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:40.481
soon follow. Mike was enemies with this guy,
Brad Gerlach. [laughter] Mike was sort of

00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:45.522
your Richie Cunningham of surfing and Brad
was this flashy punk. I kind of compare him

00:38:45.522 --> 00:38:48.520
to Corey Haim in "The Lost Boys". I don't
know if you guys ever seen that movie. He

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.540
was just this brash, outrageous, hilarious
and Brad said to me, "I'd see him and just

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:59.960
be like Parsons -- like, this guy's going
to beat me." Well, eventually after they quit

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:06.930
competitive surfing, they became best friends.
And they took up tow surfing. And here was

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.670
a -- this was a story that Jeff Clark was
gracious enough to grant me an interview for

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:16.900
way back in the day I wrote for the New York
times in 2002, when the sport first really

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.530
started to come on. And as a lot of you guys
realize there's been this controversy over

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:26.650
jet skis in the water around Mavericks and
off the California coast ever since. This

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:31.780
is Skindog who is here in the audience and
Peter Mel, a well-known Mavericks surfer and

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:42.570
Josh Loya, also. Well, in 2001 -- back that
up -- in 2001, Flame contacted Skindog, Peter

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:47.790
Mel, Parsons and Gerlach and said, "hey, I
see something on the charts here. You guys

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:53.180
need to get down. We're going to go to this
spot in the ocean." And you can imagine Skinny's

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.420
wife was a little apprehensive and he had
a pretty funny discussion that appears in

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:03.430
the book. But this is what they found. This
was an aerial shot by Flame. We can see Rob

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:07.830
Brown 's boat. One of the jet skis. And then,
the other boat that was being -- that had

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:12.661
been rented by film maker Dana Brown for the
film "Step into Liquid". This

00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:18.530
was a photo I took of Rob up on the deck of
his boat. This is Parsons, also known as Parsnips

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:25.520
or Snips. And Gerlach. And -- now, these two
guys right here. This is Evan Slater and John

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.190
Walla, they actually tried to paddle in on
this day. Evan was an editor at Surfing magazine.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:38.070
He wasn't sure what he thought about tow surfing.
And as these guys will attest, Evan's a lunatic.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:42.940
He will try to paddle into anything. And this
is John Walla on the right who actually took

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:49.670
Greg along on his first trip to Cortes Todos
Santos. And Johnny is one of these guys like

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:54.370
Harrison Ealey. If you're a big wave surfer,
you knew who he was. If you weren't, you didn't

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.870
have a clue who he was. Johnny actually scared
the bejesus out of Skinny and Pete, because

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:05.440
he was what? Only 19 years old and he was
captain of the boat. And then, he tried to

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.790
paddle in out here. And so, here's a picture
of John trying to punch through a wave out

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:15.900
there. And Evan Slater is about a hundred
yards to the side of him about to wear this

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:23.380
wave on the head. Eventually Mike and Brad
traded places and this is Mike's first ever

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:29.140
ride at Cortes. [laughter] Let me back up
to what Rob Brown told me about this, because

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.450
it's pretty funny. "I was just sitting there
click click click watching the counter go

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:38.260
down frame by frame telling myself, "Relax,
Mike is going to die right here right now

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.550
but you're going to do your job." [laughter].
Rob's job was to capture Mike's first ever

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.721
world record ride at Cortes Bank. This was
the aerial photo of that same wave. You can

00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:53.850
see this tiny little speck . And that's Mike
Parsons. I believe Skinny you had a ring side

00:41:53.850 --> 00:42:03.600
seat to this wave, yeah? This is Mike's proud
mama. [laughter] This is some footage That

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.880
was provided to me courtesy of Dana Brown
who was director of the film "Step into Liquid",

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.830
[soft music begins] who was able to at the
last minute charter the ship and he went out.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:19.510
I highly encourage any of you guys to rent
this film. It's a really interesting look

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:25.040
at surfing during the time that tow surfing
was first starting to blow up. And this was

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:34.140
obviously a coup for Dana to get out and capture
this. And you could see how they're whipping

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:42.610
each other into the waves with the help of
the skis. And then we see John Walla trying

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:47.810
to punch the wave right there. [audience chuckles]
That's not even something that's even mentioned

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:57.760
on the film but that's the scariest moment
of both of their lives. That's Brad Gerlach

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:12.760
. And this is Mike's wave. I remember -- yeah,
he was telling me I was just thinking, "This

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.840
thing's going to drop forever." He was just
thinking it's going to keep going never let

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:42.000
him off. [music ends] Rob, is that your boat
in the foreground? Yeah, it's your old one.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.490
So, as you guys can imagine, after this footage
came out and Jaws was being ripped and torn

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:53.870
by Laird Hamilton and his buddies and Jeff
Clark and Skinny and the other boys tow surfing

00:43:53.870 --> 00:44:03.410
really took off. In 2003 Mike Parsons and
brad tapped Greg Long and his brother Rusty

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:08.020
to go out to Cortes on a sort of similar size
swell but on a day that was even glassier

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:13.661
and cleaner literally a surreal day when the
ocean was just calm as a mirror and Rob Brown

00:44:13.661 --> 00:44:23.240
was fortunate to get the call to haul him
out there. This is Rob's photo that also became

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:29.690
Greg's first cover shot on Surfer magazine
ever. And he's had a few since. This is actually

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:37.260
video footage that was shot by Rob's good
friend of that wave. And it's been seen very

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:57.580
few times until now. [vocal rock music] And
you see Greg's kind of happy. [laughter] I

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:03.010
told Greg I think my head would explode if
I rode a wave like that. Now, during the time

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:07.600
that tow surfing was, of course, really coming
on, Mike Parsons and Brad Gerlach decided

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:17.090
they were going to surf Jaws. They got on
a way too small jet ski and headed down in

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:25.090
the dark. And, when they got there, this is
what they found. And Mike and Brad gave me

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:30.151
a hilarious accounting of this in the book.
Mike said, "when I saw it bend at me ahead,

00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:35.750
I just figured, 'Well, you're really done.
You've just got to go as far as you can go.'".

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:40.610
Filming this was -- this was being filmed
for this contest -- the Tow In the World Cup

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:45.040
as Bill Sharp told me when he actually saw
the footage, he realized it was the best piece

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.660
of footage of big wave surfing ever. And he
put it in his film Billabong Odyssey. I tried

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.690
to count up all the iterations that this video
has been watched on YouTube from the film

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:02.910
Billabong Odyssey. And one version of it called
"Struck in Tsunami" has s been viewed 37 million

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:07.740
times and it's probably in 60 or so other
iterations across YouTube. Therefore I would

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.410
easily say this is the most downloaded surf
film on the Internet. And you're -- oops,

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:27.040
let me back it up so you can see why. Who's
not seen this -- raise your hands. OK, you're

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:51.610
in for a treat. This is not photo-shopped.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:47:08.170
This is Mike's second ever wave at Jaws. First
one happened moments earlier. See? He almost

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:35.210
wipes out right there. Manages to pull it
together. [sounds of surf crashing] Eventually

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:40.190
they did get rag dolled by then the wave had
expended so much of his energy he was able

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:48.080
to live to surf again. Moving forward in time,
in -- you guys may remember in January of

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:55.260
2008 and even before there was in 2007 -- late
2007 -- there was a massive storm that provided

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:00.410
some of the biggest waves ever seen off the
California coast at Mavericks and Pescadero

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:05.910
Point also known as Ghost Street and then
later at Todos Santos but a month later even

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:12.930
bigger storm roared in. This storm actually
left more people without power in San Francisco

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:20.990
than any storm ever. And it was strongest
storm reported off the Pacific coast. Somehow

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.820
Greg Long and Mike Parsons were able to convince
Rob Brown to take his boat out into the teeth

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:33.710
of that storm in gale force winds in the hope
that they would be able to get a brief window

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:39.630
of calm weather out atop the Cortes Bank.
The data buoys offshore had recorded the biggest

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:48.490
swell ever hitting them. Greg and the boys
-- Greg and Mike and Brad and Greg's best

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:54.900
friend Twiggy Baker had to see it and Rob
Brown was scared to death.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:01.340
But he went for it. This is what they found.
This is sitting off the side of Bishop Rock

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:08.390
looking at the wave perhaps 80 feet high.
And I like this quote from Archibald MacRae.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:14.440
This is him looking into the Caldera at Kilauea.
"When foolhardiness would urge me to go and

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.560
peep into some yawning chasm, my conscience
would appear to say to me, "Stop! You are

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.660
trifling with the Almighty!"". That's when
I think it's arguable that these guys did.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:29.470
This is Gerlach. You can see the seasickness
patch on his neck. He was really battling

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:36.420
it. And he had a rough ride out there. And
even rougher ride was had by the videographer,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.470
Matt Wybenga, who, his footage was essentially
almost unusable. I've been fortunate enough

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:46.681
to see it and it's terrifying but it would
make you seasick just looking at it. Matt

00:49:46.681 --> 00:49:52.940
threw up 30 or 40 times in this mission as
I understand it. This is Greg and Mike trying

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.211
to figure out what exactly they're gonna do.
Mike said, "The only time I've ever really

00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:01.140
been nearly as scared to ride a wave was at
Jaws. But this -- the consequences were just

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:07.570
so heavy. It was ominous and overwhelming."
This is Brad after getting towed into his

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:14.880
first wave. [laughter] "I was going yes, no,
yes, no, yes, noooooo!" So he still regrets

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.750
not going for this wave, but Greg has pointed
out to him had he wiped out he probably would

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:27.369
have died and the chances of a wipe out were
pretty high. This is Brad on a later wave.

00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:38.150
This is -- Greg help me out here. This is
Mike Parsons. This is Greg on a huge wave.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:43.380
This is Mike again. And you can see the conditions
just became blue burg at least for a short

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:48.490
amount of time and then eventually the storm
roared back in but not before. This iconic

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:55.970
moment was captured by Rob Brown of Mike Parsons
on what is regarded as the biggest wave ever

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:02.671
ridden ever documented. Usually you don't
see this wave pulled all the way back. White

00:51:02.671 --> 00:51:09.000
water eruption is absolutely gigantic. And
here's the shot of Twiggy that's on the cover.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.390
And Greg and Twig were basically describing
a sensation a condition where they were so

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:20.310
amped on adrenaline that their bodies were
essentially overdosing every single time they'd

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:28.340
ride a wave. Greg rode a wave that everyone
agrees was actually bigger than the one that

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:34.410
Mike is photographed on after he rode it he
threw up because he was just so jacked up.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:40.510
Twiggy threw up on every single wave he rode
. [laughter] And he described it "As far as

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.820
the eye could see, it was just a huge square
of white water. If you lost your guy in there,

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.180
he was just gone. He would have been lost
in that expanse and you'd never find him.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:54.050
It was just so scary". So the book ends with
that mission chapter wise. As some of you

00:51:54.050 --> 00:52:01.920
guys know. Some of you guys look like surfers
out here. Tow surfing is spawned another revolution

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.480
in surfing and it's almost a regressive revolution
in surfing, if you will, because what it's

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.480
taught the guys is, they can survive beat
downs harder than they ever could with the

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:18.540
help of skis in particular, they could perhaps
paddle into waves that were thought to be

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:24.080
unpaddlable. At sizes where the waves move
so fast, they thought they couldn't get into

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:30.400
them. So Greg is one of the guys who has really
been leading that charge along with Skindog

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:36.910
out at Mavericks and recently at Cortes Bank.
And I was fortunate to go with Greg and a

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:41.580
crew that included Mark Healey, Peter Mel
of Mavericks, Greg's brother, Rusty, and Grant

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:49.770
Twiggy Baker, on this ridiculous yacht the
day after Christmas in 2009. And it was going

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:54.990
to be a paddle surfing mission. The conditions
were set to be just gorgeous and glassy and

00:52:54.990 --> 00:53:00.900
calm. Photographer Jason Murray was out there
and these are some of the images he captured.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:08.500
I just can't stress to you enough how difficult.
I got to go out on a ski and watch this happening.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.300
The waters were so shifty and there was so
much current. And the waves come -- at a spot

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.640
like Mavericks -- these guys can explain it
better, but a spot like Mavericks the waves

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.940
tend to break at a very set spot. At Cortes,
they can break 100 yards farther down the

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:27.360
reef and absolutely just leave these guys
scratching for the horizon and bailing their

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.060
boards as you can see here. I think we have
Greg either here or here getting ready to

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:36.490
get obliterated and Peter Mel paddling for
the shoulder. And I want to thank Jason who

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:44.210
is here for these shots. This is Rusty Long
on a bomb and I thought this was a gorgeous

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:51.240
one. This is some footage that was provided
to me courtesy of Bill Sharp who runs the

00:53:51.240 --> 00:54:03.630
double XLs. [music begins] This is video footage
of that day. Greg, of course, rode the first

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:13.380
wave out there -- paddled in. 
This is Kelly Slater that ten almost eleven

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:24.630
time world champion. This is Greg's brother
Russ on a bomb. And he paid. [laughter] And

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:30.520
I would point out, you know, these guys are
surfing over the hull of the Jalisco. So that

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:39.340
ship provides a hazard kind of unlike most
other surf spots I've ever seen anywhere.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:51.170
[music] Peter Mel from Mavericks on 
a beauty. This is Chilean, Ramon Navarro.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:57.240
He had just surfed Eddie Aikau contest that
Greg had actually won a few weeks earlier.

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.520
And Ramon was a real crowd favorite. This
is Nathan Fletcher. Flippy Hoffman's great,

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:11.000
great nephew. And Nathan is generally regarded
as the best in the business today. And then,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.060
we had November 2, 2010. Initially this swell
was looking like a carbon copy of the 2008

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:22.340
swell, but it lost some of its push between
Hawaii and California, but it was still going

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.290
to be really big. This is Rob Brown's boat
pulling up to a boat called the Condor. I

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:35.490
got to go out on the Condor at a very slow
pace and I was just having awful nightmares.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:38.940
I mean, as I was asleep, I was having these
awful nightmares of being in a tsunami and

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:44.360
a earthquake at the same time. And Greg and
the boys had surfed the Mavericks the day

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:50.300
before so they wanted to see if it was possible
to surf Mavericks and then make it down to

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:56.861
Cortes. And they proved that indeed it was.
These are some shots that Jason took. This

00:55:56.861 --> 00:56:03.330
is of course, you know, all bow, this is Jeff
Clark, Maverick's founding father who was

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:08.530
out there not only surfing but running rescue
for the boys. I might point out Rob Brown

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:14.460
and Jason Murray are both kind of lunatics
in their own right. This is Jason with his

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:20.170
camera perched in his lap. He goes out there
to take the shot and you're sitting there

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:25.430
on the Rob's boat at Cortes too, thinking,
"oh my gosh, I hope he knows what he's doing."

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:30.900
This is Shane Dorian who has recently been
captured along with Greg and some of the boys

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:36.870
paddling in the waves at Jaws which is of
course largely considered to be unpaddlable.

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:45.550
This is him at Cortes. This is video I shot.
This just gives you an idea rolling towards

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:53.600
the waves on Rob's boat. [voices in the background]
This was a tow surfing wave. They tow surfed

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:06.560
the first part of the day. So I think that
was Parsons. And everything is moving around

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.190
out there as you guys can see. It's not like
anywhere else I've been. And it's just so

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:19.830
surreal seeing the wave breaking out in the
middle of the ocean like that. And then a

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:24.740
few more photos and then I'll finally let
you guys alone. This is Mark Healey, Greg's

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.200
good friend from Hawaii tucking into a barrel.
And this is Jason shooting in the foreground.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:37.140
And this is Shane Dorian. He's thinking twice
on this one and it's probably a good thing

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:44.050
he did. [chuckles] We could see Jason perched
down there. And this is-- Shane broke his

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:49.300
favorite board out there. And this is Jeff
Clark who was running rescue. Jeff and Mike

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.310
decided to run rescue for the boys who were
paddling. And basically Greg, you know, sort

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:59.630
of said if we hadn't had Jeff and Mike out
there running life guard for us I don't think

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:02.470
it
would have been very wise thing to do. Now,

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:07.690
again the engineers in the crowd would find
this very interesting. Two years ago Jeff

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:13.200
when -- was it two years ago that Shane had
his hull down at Mavericks. Two years ago

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:19.970
Shane nearly drowned at Mavericks. And he's
a dad with at least one kid -- two kids. Down

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:25.640
at the bottom of the ocean, he kind of said
to himself, "something's got to change." And

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:31.460
so, Shane actually thought to the idea when
you go on an airplane and you see the life

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:36.810
jackets you pull the thing and it hits the
CO 2 cartridge. He had the guys at Billabong

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:41.420
rig him up a suit with the rip cord on it.
So Shane went down on a huge wave and got

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.191
rag-dolled and while he was 30 or 40 feet
under he pulled the cord and rocketed up to

00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:51.619
the surface. I think it's arguable you will
see this more and more as the guys are trying

00:58:51.619 --> 00:58:57.000
to paddle into waves that are bigger and bigger.
As Skindog has pointed out unless you're knocked

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.050
out cold, this could really be a great life
saving invention. This is Mark Healey from

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:08.290
Maui -- not Mark Healey-- Ian Walsh from Maui.
He's an absolute charger. And you can see

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:14.720
how blue the waves. They almost seem inviting,
but not to me. [laughter] This is the same

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.840
wave. And you can see sometimes the wave just
hit. I don't know what it's hitting but they

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:25.830
hit these perturbations, these features under
the water. And they just erupt into the air.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:29.830
And off into the distance, you can see another
wave that nobody surfs because there's just

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:36.470
kind of no escape from it. And this is Greg
on a wave that looks kind of like a claw behind

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:41.950
him. We have one more photo. And this is Greg
sitting by himself in the middle of the ocean

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:46.191
100 miles from shore. And he said to me, "when
you're paddling all alone out there, when

00:59:46.191 --> 00:59:52.130
you really look at the place and feel its
immensity, - it should be you can't just help

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:58.340
but feel that there's something much greater
so much more significant at work than you"

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.160
. And this is me and Mike Parsons and the
King of Abalonia, Jim Houtz and Greg Long.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:08.500
Jim actually went with us on that mission.
He really had a great time. It was his first

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:15.171
time going back to Cortes since he nearly
died aboard his great ship. So I hope you

01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:18.710
guys will enjoy the book. I hope you enjoyed
this.

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.450
[Applause]

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:29.920
&gt;&gt; Chris: And do we have time for these guys
to come up and take some questions? I'd be

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.250
honored if you guys would take the bench and
maybe if you guys have any questions for me,

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:39.310
these are the guys my primary sources of information.

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:44.600
&gt;&gt; Female: Introduce them so we know who they
are.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:52.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you. For policing me, I appreciate
it. Greg Long. Ken Skindog Collins. Photographer

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:59.060
Jason Murray. Jeff Clark. Photographer Rob
Brown. And thank you guys for everything.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:07.570
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So, I'm not a surfer really but
I went to Mavericks out on the ocean a couple

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.190
years ago and I was struck by how close the
break is. You know, like if you're 100 yards

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.190
away or 200 yards away, the swells are way
way smaller than the waves you're surfing.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:19.420
It looks like this is different. The breaks
are different, waves are bigger wider. Is

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:26.230
that right?

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:33.619
&gt;&gt; Greg: That's what really separates I mean
every big wave is kind of unique unto itself

01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:40.550
the bathymetry the bottom contours which in
turn direct the swell. As in Mavericks it's

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:46.700
a very consistent kind of reef bottom not
over an expansive area so the waves are consistently

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:54.450
in the same place relatively speaking whereas
Cortes bank it's an underwater sea mountain

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:59.690
island that's been sunk in and waves can break
in in an expanse of 12 to 15 miles. And actually

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:08.650
the shallowest part of the reef extends about
a mile long. At Mavericks, actually reef breaking

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:11.330
over the course of maybe 25 yards as far as.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:17.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Yeah, Mavericks comes up much more
abruptly where it's gradually comes up at

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:25.731
Cortes bank. Mavericks because it comes up
so abruptly, when he talks about the swell

01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:33.160
slamming into the reef, it is so abrupt, which
is why Mavericks is so hard to ride in a different

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.530
way than Cortes. It hits the reef and then
jumps out of the ocean to where it whips the

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:48.640
top of the wave over. And Cortes bank it comes
up smoother. So the breaking area -- if a

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:56.369
wave -- it comes up smoother to that final
break point. But that lends itself to being

01:02:56.369 --> 01:03:04.230
a much bigger playing field in and out by
100 yards. And you can kind of be in no man's

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:13.330
land. So when we were caddying for Greg and
Healey and Shane and Parsons, it was over

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:22.891
a football field or more of area. It was fun
trying to use our instinct to go, "maybe he's

01:03:22.891 --> 01:03:27.640
in too far. Maybe I should get him pull out."
It was exciting though.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:34.640
&gt;&gt;Skindog: Yeah, I was going to say that on
the coast of California, the swells hit the

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.030
continental shelf. It really slows them down
whereas Cortes bank, there's no continental

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:43.700
shelf. It hits them directly. So one thing
you'll notice right off the bat is the wave's

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:51.200
faster, way faster. And the fact these guys
went out and tried to paddle it is border

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.420
line crazy. So it comes in it feels like you're
flying twice as fast. It's like no other thing.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:04.520
You know trying to track it down is that much
more difficult all through California swells

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.040
hit the continental shelf. In some places
it's not as far but it totally slows it down

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.630
to a way more manageable speed.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:17.690
&gt;&gt; Chris: I might point out some of you guys
might wonder how fast those waves are going.

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:24.620
I can't say this definitively but when a big
wave sweeping over Cortes has been slowed

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:29.630
a bit, but it's -- the wave itself is probably
moving between 45, 50 miles an hour if not

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:35.960
faster and that's a big one like the 2008
swell. And then you take the surfers are moving

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.050
25 to 30 miles an hour over that. So they're
moving at the speed of a super G skier basically

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:46.120
going down these waves. And so, that introduces
a whole new set of hydrodynamic issues.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:53.550
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Just curious the big waves. [inaudible]
Do they affect. Seems like.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.840
&gt;&gt; Chris: You saw Greg.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.270
&gt;&gt; Greg: Yeah again, every wave is unique
unto itself. There's no two waves that are

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:04.360
ever the same. No two swells -- it has to
do with the laws of the wind, the current.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:11.420
Like Mavericks water to a real abrupt shallow
shelf and you'll get a consistent barreling

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.599
wave where other, you know, waves it just
fends on the bottom contours whereas we mentioned

01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:21.910
Cortes, it's just a gentle sloping shelf.
It will topple over at the top and then sort

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.030
of roll over itself. So it just depends on
the bottom contours. But there are some waves

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:31.881
another one I'm sure you have heard of called
Jaws, called Pe'ahi over in Maui where that

01:05:31.881 --> 01:05:38.220
is a perfect reef and it's a 60, 70 foot barrel
down the entire length of the reef. So it

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.720
just depends on the bottom contours. That
shape the form of the wave.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.460
&gt;&gt; Chris: And Cortes does barrel. Sometimes
it's generally more on the inside. As you

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:50.580
saw on the wave that Greg rode . The wave
will come into the inside slam certain parts

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.980
of the shelf and just throw out.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:02.800
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I just moved here from Hawaii
months ago. I remember watching the [inaudible]

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.690
Barreled offshore. What's Waimea like compared
to these places?

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:15.950
&gt;&gt; Jeff: What is Waimea compared to Cortes
or Mavericks? [Male #2 responds inaudibly]

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:24.020
Well, yeah. When Waimea is big it seems like
if the swell's just right you can get waves

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:31.630
close to as big as Mavericks or Cortes, but
Cortes and Mavericks -- there's no limit to

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:38.770
how big. You know, Waimea is in a small bay
and you know these open ocean waves have much

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:42.840
greater opportunity for a much bigger swell
to be good.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:48.599
&gt;&gt; Greg: Actually having scientific calculations
as far as how deep the channel is to the side

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:54.840
of the reef which in turn will dictate how
big a wave will hold its shape and be surfable

01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:01.280
before it closes out becomes just one successive
whitewater. You know where Waimea anything

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.540
over about 50 feet on the face it starts to
close out the bay and basically become an

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.610
unsurfable wave. Whereas Cortes Bank right
off the side starts to drop off thousands

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:16.220
of feet of water. Mavericks I think it's close
to 100 feet right off the side which in turn

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:22.359
there's been a couple you have surf documentaries
that explain all this. Mavericks can hold

01:07:22.359 --> 01:07:28.240
close to 100 foot wave. Cortes Bank hypothetically
would never close out. It could hold wave

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.900
up to 300, 400 feet high. The reality to get
waves to significant wave heights to make

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:42.080
it that big is not realistic. But Cortes,
Jaws, and Mavericks are the three kind of

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.700
prominent big waves that have the potential
to hold 100 feet wave.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:51.619
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah, since we're talking 300, 400
foot waves, I think Cortes might be too shallow.

01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:52.619
[laughter]

01:07:52.619 --> 01:07:53.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff: The wave would just buckle.

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:57.790
&gt;&gt; Male #3: What was that wave called off
the coast of France? , [inaudible]

01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:01.760
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Belharra
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah that's Belharra.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.710
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Huge, it was kind of like this.
Is that still a place to be –

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:13.950
&gt;&gt; Chris: The question was about this wave
Belharra which is off the coast of France.

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:18.199
Maybe I'll let Jeff or Skinny take that question,
because it is a huge wave.

01:08:18.199 --> 01:08:22.390
&gt;&gt; Skindog: In reality, there are going to
be more waves discovered because this is a

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:30.810
fairly new support. Now we're looking for
the biggest waves. Right now actually Garrett

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:36.420
McNamara is in Portugal. And he's on a project.
They're pretty confident they're going to

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.430
find one of the biggest waves in the world
there. When the reef is at a certain level

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:47.220
of depth it won't stand up as straight like
a building. Mavericks is pretty much straight

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.630
as a building. You can be at the bottom and
look up straight on it. Cortes a little more

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:55.489
sloped but still super strong. France it's
not that, like seriously? It's dangerous.

01:08:55.489 --> 01:09:01.400
But it just doesn't have the impact of a building
that Mavericks has.

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:07.580
&gt;&gt; Jason: It's gaining respect among big wave
aficionados. Yeah, because it's so slopey.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:14.250
&gt;&gt; Jeff: And all that takes is a bigger wave,
because a bigger wave would drag more of that

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.830
energy and stop it and you'd have more going
over the top to actually make it break like

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:22.670
a real wave, but we haven't seen that 200
foot swell.

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:25.989
&gt;&gt; Skindog: We're looking for those giants
storms from the 40s or 60s whatnot.

01:09:25.989 --> 01:09:31.940
&gt;&gt; Jeff: It's probably just too deep. Reef
is probably 20 to 35 foot deep so the wave

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.599
actually never grounds enough to stop the
base and topple over.

01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:38.099
&gt;&gt; Chris: He had a question.

01:09:38.099 --> 01:09:45.580
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Yeah, I was going to ask how you
go about measuring these waves. [inaudible]

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.359
&gt;&gt; Chris: The question was how do you go about
measuring these waves and that is a contentious

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.359
issue. Jason?

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:55.400
&gt;&gt; Jason: It is a contentious issue and it's
a pretty inexact science too. You'd be surprised.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.900
It's a bunch of guys in a room with some calipers.
&gt;&gt;Chris: And beer and pizza.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:03.560
&gt;&gt;Jason: And beer and pizza, going okay. Let's
try and identify the base of the wave judging

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.739
from the photographic evidence. They say here's
the base and then we'll look at the crest

01:10:07.739 --> 01:10:13.940
of the wave and we'll measure by using the
human scale in the photo and kind of calculate

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.870
from that. But it's not the most scientific.
And you'll have different angles produce different

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:23.950
size. Photos of different sized looking waves.
If you were to take this particular photo

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:28.950
here on the cover and you shot it more from
head on, the wave could look 30 percent larger

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:33.350
versus shooting something from the air it
might flatten out the photo. So there's quite

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:38.610
a bit subjectivity. And then it also depends
on the angles where it was shot from and such.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:43.539
&gt;&gt; Chris: How many beers they guys have and
ow small the guy looks.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.040
&gt;&gt; Jason: If he's crouching down. If he's
in a squat.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.020
&gt;&gt; Skindog: He's about 6 foot tall. You start
at the bottom going 1, 2, 3, 4 so it's not

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.610
100 percent accurate.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:54.652
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's literally how it's judged
for the XXLs.

01:10:54.652 --> 01:10:55.652
&gt;&gt; Male #6: So you guys are big wave surfers,
what's your favorite wave though? Are there

01:10:55.652 --> 01:11:13.048
waves I have as much fun doing that or is
it just big wave is so much different it's

01:11:13.048 --> 01:11:14.048
better you'd rather have that? So good shape
versus huge wave.

01:11:14.048 --> 01:11:18.340
&gt;&gt; Greg: I personally like surfing every single
day doesn't matter how small how big. I can

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.670
find a challenge even on a windy 2 foot day
if you go out there with the right mind set

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:29.340
and just being in the ocean is what brings
me my satisfaction, my passion in life. Granted

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:34.500
I love surfing big waves more obviously. The
excitement, the exhilaration, the gratification

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:41.860
that comes from that surpasses that of small
waves. We only get, you know, a handful of

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:47.090
days big waves a year. So if you only dedicated
or said I'm only going to surf big waves you'd

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:51.710
be missing out on a lot of fun opportunities
to be in the water otherwise.

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:58.960
&gt;&gt; Skindog: That was so vague [laughter].
Here's the deal, big wave surfing is -- it's

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.690
spiritual too. You get a lot of like serious
satisfaction out of riding a big wave. Tow

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:10.270
surfing, not so much. You can tow into anything.
And everybody knows it's just luck. You get

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:16.420
towed in. I found out halfway through it's
kind of like not satisfying. All right. I

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.420
did another one. I did another one.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.800
&gt;&gt; Jeff: But it's really fun. [laughter]

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.770
&gt;&gt; Skindog: Nothing wrong with it and you
can get barreled. But grabbing your surfboard

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:27.810
and paddling out to a spot and catching it
with your bare hands is way more satisfying

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.441
than anything I've ever experienced in my
life. . I kind of gave up to tow surfing and

01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:36.080
just went back to paddling with my hands.
You know, you catch a 50 foot wave on a jet

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.770
ski, all right, that's cool. You catch a 15
foot wave on a board, your heart is in your

01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:41.780
throat. It's scary.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:47.590
&gt;&gt; Jeff: And you remember every little thing
about catching that wave with your hands.

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:52.429
It's like branded into your brain. You'll
never forget any part of it.

01:12:52.429 --> 01:12:56.050
&gt;&gt; Chris: Jeff do you want to tell him why
we have these two boards what the differences

01:12:56.050 --> 01:13:02.090
are. We have two of these huge boards. One
is Greg's paddle surfing board. The other

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:05.760
is tow toe surfing board. They might be interested
to know why these boards look so different.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:12.739
&gt;&gt; Jeff: One's the wake board. No, it's a
toe surfing board. It's shaped to go really

01:13:12.739 --> 01:13:18.550
fast, ride big waves. The paddle in surfboard.
This is Greg's board. Is this like the one

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:28.840
you won the maverick's contest on? Yeah. This
board is built to be large enough to get your

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.010
paddling speed up
to catch that wave and make the drop before

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:40.571
you get thrown to the beach. You need to find
that perfect mix for you that is the right

01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:45.950
size and once you catch the wave, have the
maneuverability. The little boards are much

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:51.320
more maneuverable but you can't catch a wave
with them. And with the Mavericks being probably

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:57.630
the premier paddle in surf spot in the world,
we were really refining what we're building

01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:01.810
for the guys to ride the waves.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:10.880
&gt;&gt; Skindog: Perfect example -- that's Greg
Long's board. That's my board. Greg long has

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.370
a supermodel, super sexy, super thin. I got
a big fat chick over here. I find out they

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:21.381
feel way better and I catch way more waves
on a big board. And I'm seeing a whole new

01:14:21.381 --> 01:14:27.700
trend of boards being -- I know, that's bad
huh? [laughter] But his board is probably

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.010
under three inches. That one is almost five
inches thick. I just got to the point where

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:37.440
I don't care what it looks like. I want to
catch these waves. No matter how good a shape

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.130
you're in or how fast you are, you're running
into. Even on that board I'm paddling for

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:47.860
waves maybe not catching it. Boards will get
smaller but you'll see boards get bigger,

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:53.420
thicker. And find that ceiling. They found
the ceiling how thin you can go. You can't

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:58.900
go thinner than 2 and a half. They haven't
found the ceiling on other boards. And I've

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:03.320
seen guys on stand up paddle boards actually
catch waves at Mavericks. Oh my God, if he

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:09.590
can ride a wave on that long board that has
no design and technology whatsoever what can

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:13.950
I do on a board that actually has some technology
and that girth. So that's what we're seeing.

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:19.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff: And that's why I got this board I
built for myself because I'm doing a lot of

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:24.690
stand up paddling riding big waves on stand
up paddle boards. And I'm thinking, you know,

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:30.340
what my big stand up paddle board turns really
well on a big wave. So I'm going to use what

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:38.440
I learned in shaping guns, transfer it to
the volume of a stand up paddle board and

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.630
you know with what Kenny wants to do and what
all the big wave guys want to do is paddle

01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:52.300
into the biggest bomb they can find. So volume,
speed, and then incorporate the maneuverability

01:15:52.300 --> 01:16:00.080
you need to survive -- make that take off,
set your line, do what you -- be maneuverable

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.010
enough to escape. [chuckles]

01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:06.880
&gt;&gt; Skindog: Hang on -- with that said, I would
love to challenge you guys who are engineers

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.170
take a look at these boards and possibly give
us some more feedback. [laughter] Because

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:16.780
I don't think the smartest people in the world
are making these boards, no offense. [laughter]

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.270
Really good craftsmanship but I would really
love to see what your brains could come up

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.270
with.

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.969
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Tell me that after this winter. [laughter]

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:35.134
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So what do you need to start
surfing the big waves? Like. [inaudible]

01:16:35.134 --> 01:16:36.134
[laughter]

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.134
&gt;&gt; Female #1: How do you go about [inaudible]

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:40.130
&gt;&gt; Chris: The question was how did these guys
get into surfing these big waves like this.

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:47.020
&gt;&gt; Jeff: For me it was -- as I started little,
it just became a natural progression to go

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.719
to the next size to the next size to the next
size and pretty soon I was surf surfing by

01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:51.719
myself.

01:16:51.719 --> 01:16:57.980
&gt;&gt;Chris: Rob should have a big input because
rob is not a big wave surfer.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:02.010
&gt;&gt; Rob: They're mental cases. It's natural
though. I used to surf and the only reason

01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:06.090
I started photographing the big waves was
because I knew I couldn't survive it. And

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:11.230
I had so much respect for it. These guys definitely
they start and next thing you know it's not

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:16.230
enough for them. There's kind of no limit.
And they have to keep growing and get to that

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:21.410
point. But definitely -- it's not so much
a screw loose. It's just different. They just

01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:25.340
are comfortable amongst it and they just grow
and get bigger and bigger and next thing you

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:30.590
know they're at the level they're at now.
But you have to really, really want it bad.

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:36.200
&gt;&gt; Chris: I think some people would argue
-- Greg might agree if Jason -- Jason has

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:43.580
surfed Mavericks I might point out; Rob is
more sane like me. I've seen Rob on his boat

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:49.730
do things that leave Greg kind of slack jawed.
And so, it's the same sort of thing. Rob is

01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:54.230
really comfortable with his boat and Jason
is really comfortable with doing photos and

01:17:54.230 --> 01:18:02.680
running rescue on the ski. There is a level
of comfort that you get. It is different as

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.680
Rob said.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.760
&gt;&gt; Greg: I guess what I think it really comes
down to is anything that you really love or

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.581
are passionate about in life, there's that
constant pursuit to challenge yourself. There's

01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:18.280
a time as you're saying shoulder high waist
high wave. I was peeing myself too. Obviously

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.670
I grew up in the water from a young age and
it was when I was about 9, ten years old.

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:25.990
You do anything for long enough But you do
anything for long enough you learn kind of

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:33.180
how to figure out to become comfortable. Always
want to continue to improve. And you know

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:39.530
I'm sure Skinny, Jeff can attest as you continue
to sort of push yourself it becomes this sort

01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:44.090
of obsession to actually see physically and
mentally what it is you're actually capable

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:50.491
of. That's led us to this constant pursuit.
Now as we're spending more time surfing big

01:18:50.491 --> 01:18:56.360
waves and had this whole tow surfing revolution
refining our equipment we're realizing we

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.130
really haven't tapped into our fullest potential.
We only get so many days of big waves a year.

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:06.610
It's kind of a slow progression. We're still
learning a significant amount every single

01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:07.610
year.

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:13.420
&gt;&gt; Skindog: Well, you know I have a kid now.
I have a couple. And I personally think it's

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:17.810
genes. [laughter] You ever go to the park.
You ever see the kids at the park. You see

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:22.420
the one kid climbing on top of the monkey
gym jumping off? That's a candidate for Mavericks

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.830
surfer or any big wave surfer.
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's your kid right?

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:28.370
&gt;&gt;Skindog: Same thing with snow boarding,
you ever see a little kid, "oh my God that

01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:32.640
kid is not scared to go down the black diamond?"
That same gene pool.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:39.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Also, the more your relationship
grows with the ocean, you know, the better

01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:45.320
you get, it becomes kind of a -- you have
goals that you silently set for yourself,

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:53.370
"wow, I pulled that off. I want to do it again."
And then surfing bigger waves. And then, just

01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:59.800
the, you know, whether it's 2 foot or 20 foot
just being in the ocean -- I mean, that's

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:07.000
my favorite place to watch a sunset is in
the water. And I'm -- it becomes just, you

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.940
know, part of your world. And you'll take
it any way you can get it.

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:18.070
&gt;&gt;Male #6:
&gt;&gt; Chris: The question was has anybody ever

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:20.400
tried Shane Dorian's inflatable wet suit.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.090
&gt;&gt; Skindog: On order.

01:20:22.090 --> 01:20:25.330
&gt;&gt; Chris: Skinny said they're on order
&gt;&gt;Greg: We're still waiting to get all of

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:30.950
ours. I was kind of doing the research and
development with him with the wet suit. It

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:38.000
was an idea we'd all been talking about for
years. It really isn't, you know, rocket science

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.130
technology. But it just actually took somebody
being pushed to that limit and finally saying,

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:49.940
"it's time that we do this because it will
in fact save lives in the future. In recent

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:55.520
years we've all lost couple of our closest
friends something of that sort could have

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.090
easily saved their lives. It's something that
will be implemented on a regular basis on

01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:02.499
the big days in the future.
[inaudible comments]

01:21:02.499 --> 01:21:06.619
&gt;&gt; Someone had one at [inaudible] Rob was
asking.

01:21:06.619 --> 01:21:11.070
&gt;&gt; Skindog: Another thing that's going on
too we're implementing -- there's a canister

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:16.420
it's called Xtreme Air. It's from kayakers
and it's a can of air with 15 breaths of compressed

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:21.110
air and you can put it on your chest. It's
pretty amazing. And I fell with the pool.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:26.420
With air you can actually go to some place
like Cortes and survive something you normally

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.760
wouldn't survive with that equipment.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.940
&gt;&gt;Jeff: One of the things we really need to
get changed as well is the PWC ban because

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:43.880
they're the cleanest craft in the ocean and
this NOAA law that banned them is just wrong.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:51.830
And they have -- they made their mind up before
they ever had the hearings to hear us and

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:59.390
when they heard us they said thank you and
passed the law anyway. And now we have one

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:04.949
guy that made it and then last year we lost
a guy because we were afraid of ticketing

01:22:04.949 --> 01:22:08.680
and didn't have our rescue skis in the line
up where they should have been.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.740
&gt;&gt; Chris: And I might point out that if Jacob
is that the guy that was rescued? Jacob who

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.250
was rescued was rescued with the help of ski.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:22.090
&gt;&gt; Skindog: My ski. I'm going out there with
the ski regardless. I'll take the ticket.

01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:24.150
I just told myself I'll have the ticket. I
just told myself I want to have a rescue team

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:29.380
supporting me. To answer the question how
that happened. Some guys didn't like the fact

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.989
that guy was tow surfing Mavericks. There
was a bit of an argument between two groups

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:37.750
of surfers -- paddle groups and tow surfing.
At this point, it's gone. We don't want to

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:43.430
tow surf Mavericks anymore, we just want the
jet skis there to survive for rescue. A couple

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:47.610
guys that knew the Surfrider Foundation chimed
in, made it happen. This thing got railroaded

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:52.390
through no problem. Without any kind of scientific
proof that they're bad for the environment,

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:57.400
bad for the animals. Annoying towards people.
That's basically what it was. It was just

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.400
annoying people.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:05.780
&gt;&gt; Jeff: I saw an article just recently and
they were using data from 15 years ago. All

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:11.020
that's changed and it's no more two strokes.
I mean.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.910
&gt;&gt; Skindog: They're also using data too from
Lake Havasu. There's 50,000 accidents in the

01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:19.280
lakes. Well, they're not banned in the lakes.
They're banning the oceans where there's maybe

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.010
probably 20 or 30 jet skis on the whole coast
of California that want to go out and support

01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:29.831
guys surfing. In all life guard situations,
Hawaii, everyone has a jet ski. It's the ultimate

01:23:29.831 --> 01:23:33.590
water safety rescue operation. If a boat goes
down in the ocean, they send in a jet ski

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:37.550
with a rescue sled on a back with a 2 man
team to save the people that are in danger.

01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:41.230
There's not a better water safety craft in
the world right now.

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:42.780
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: With that, thank-you.

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.020
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thanks, Pat. Yeah.

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.020
[Applause]

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:45.022
&gt;&gt; Thanks Pat.
