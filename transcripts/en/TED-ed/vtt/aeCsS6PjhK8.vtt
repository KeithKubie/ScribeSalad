00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.885
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe,

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.066
but we can still measure its speed

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.895
if we slow down the animation,

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.805
we can analyze light's motion using

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.739
a space-time diagram,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.839
which takes a flipbook of animation panels,

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.973
and turns them on their side.

00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:25.080
In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.977
that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves,

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.329
they get the same answer:

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.281
299,792,458 meters every second,

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:35.710
which means that when we draw light

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.882
on our space-time diagram,

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:39.991
it's world line always has to appear at the same angle.

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.354
But we saw previously that speed,

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:44.843
or equivalently world line angles,

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:47.502
change when we look at things from

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:49.249
other people's perspective.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.804
To explore this contradiction,

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:53.900
let's see what happens if I start moving

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.988
while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom.

00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:00.455
First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:01.875
Yes, that means taking all of

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.284
the different panels showing the different moments in time

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:06.289
and stacking them up.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.338
From the side, we see the world line

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:11.548
of the laser light at its correct fixed angle,

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:12.660
just as before.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.213
So far, so good.

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:17.634
But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective.

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:19.454
What does it look like to me?

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.246
In the last lesson, we showed

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:24.516
how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:28.351
along a bit until his world line is completely vertical.

00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:31.825
But look carefully at the light world line.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.222
The rearrangement of the panels

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:35.714
means it's now tilted over too far.

00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:38.883
I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would.

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:40.855
But every experiment we've ever done,

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:42.405
and we've tried very hard,

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:46.708
says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.052
So let's start again.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:51.642
In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:54.487
worked out how to see things properly,

00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.147
from Tom's point of view,

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:59.442
while still getting the speed of light right.

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:02.867
First, we need to glue together the separate panels

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.248
into one solid block.

00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:07.069
This gives us our space-time,

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.946
turning space and time into

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:12.277
one smooth, continuous material.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.723
And now, here is the trick.

00:02:14.723 --> 00:02:18.076
What you do is stretch your block of space-time

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.423
along the light world line,

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:22.950
then squash it by the same amount,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.926
but at right angles to the light world line,

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.220
and abracadabra!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.286
Tom's world line has gone vertical,

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:32.775
so this does represent the world from his point of view,

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:34.453
but most importantly,

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:37.822
the light world line has never changed its angle,

00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:40.331
and so light will be measured by Tom

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.957
going at the correct speed.

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:44.780
This superb trick is known as

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.005
a Lorentz transformation.

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:49.490
Yeah, more than a trick.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.024
Slice up the space-time into

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:52.353
new panels and you have

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:55.043
the physically correct animation.

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:56.373
I'm stationary in the car,

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.304
everything else is coming past me

00:02:58.304 --> 00:02:59.934
and the speed of light

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:02.392
works out to be that same fixed value

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:04.177
that we know everyone measures.

00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:05.403
On the other hand,

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:06.929
something strange has happened.

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.873
The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore,

00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:12.384
and my mom will be worried

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:14.520
that I look a bit thin.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.791
But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin?

00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:19.834
I thought physics was supposed to be the same

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:20.937
for everyone.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:23.052
Yes, no, it is, and you do.

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:24.862
All that stretching and squashing

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:26.841
of space-time has just muddled together

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.977
what we used to think of separately

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:30.791
as space and time.

00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.702
This particular squashing effect

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:35.251
is known as Lorentz contraction.

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:36.728
Okay, but I still don't look thin.

00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.160
No, yes, you do.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.348
Now that we know better about space-time,

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:41.484
we should redraw

00:03:41.484 --> 00:03:43.650
what the scene looked like to me.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.992
To you, I appear Lorentz contracted.

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:49.760
Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.845
Yes.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:53.344
Uh, well, at least it's fair.

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:54.755
And speaking of fairness,

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.899
just as space gets muddled with time,

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.442
time also gets muddled with space,

00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:02.029
in an effect known as time dilation.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.417
No, at everyday speeds,

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:05.260
such as Tom's car reaches,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.402
actually all the effects are much, much smaller

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:09.854
than we've illustrated them.

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:13.252
Oh, yet, careful experiments,

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.641
for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:17.613
whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider

00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:19.972
confirmed that the effects are real.

00:04:19.972 --> 00:04:21.008
And now that space-time is

00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:23.640
an experimentally confirmed part of reality,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.743
we can get a bit more ambitious.

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:27.475
What if we were to start playing

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.494
with the material of space-time itself?

00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:34.756
We'll find out all about that in the next animation.
