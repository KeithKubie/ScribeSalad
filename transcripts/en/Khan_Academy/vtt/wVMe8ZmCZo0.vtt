00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.896
So what we have here is a
solution of a copper sulfate.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.780
And copper sulfate
is an ionic compound.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.450
The copper loses two
electrons to the sulfate.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.570
So the copper has a
positive 2 charge,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.640
and the sulfate has
a negative 2 charge.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.005
This is a cation.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.220
This is an anion.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.330
So you could imagine it's
very easy to dissolve it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.310
in a polar solvent like water.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.910
So this is an aqueous solution.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.300
We are dissolving it in
water, and it actually

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.540
does have this blue color.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.370
So one way to think
about it is this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.200
is a bunch of copper
cations dissolved

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.180
in water and a bunch of
sulfate anions also dissolved

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.720
in this water right over here.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.360
Now, we're going to do a
little bit of an experiment.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.830
We're going to take
some solid zinc,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.790
and solid zinc would have this
kind of metallic gray color.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.570
We're going to take a
powder of solid zinc metal,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.300
and throw it into this
solution, and think

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.150
about what is going to happen.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.830
So that's solid zinc
right over there.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
So zinc in the solid
state plus inside

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.290
of this solution of copper
sulfate, what do we think

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.330
is going to happen?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.510
And I actually encourage
you to pause the video,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.890
look at this table of
electronegativities,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.430
and look at what's
going on here.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950
Think about who
has the electrons

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.490
and who might want
the electrons,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.520
and then think about what
you think is going to happen.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.710
Well, let's look at the
electronegativities right

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.580
over here.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.550
Copper is more
electronegative than zinc is.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.922
And so, if there was a way
for copper to take electrons

00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:47.130
from the zinc, it would,
especially this copper right

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.629
over here.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.540
These are positively
charged coppers.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.180
They would love nothing more
than to take some electrons

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.270
and become neutral.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.210
And look-- there's someone
to take those electrons from.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.740
And so what you get
is a redox reaction.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.490
And we'll look at the half
reactions in a second.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.960
You get a redox reaction where
the copper takes electrons

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.690
from the zinc.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.200
So it becomes
neutral solid copper.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.070
And the zinc loses those
electrons to the copper.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.280
And so those become
zinc cations.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.260
Or you could think of it
as zinc sulfate dissolved

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.150
in the aqueous solution.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.380
So let me write that down.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.280
Zinc sulfate, and that has
a negative charge still,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.620
and it is in an
aqueous solution.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.650
So what will this
actually look like?

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.510
Let me put another glass here.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.470
So this is before
the reaction starts.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.340
After the reaction, it's going
to look something like this.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.480
Zinc sulfate is actually
a clearish looking liquid.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.010
So let me draw that.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.900
The liquid will
actually become clear.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.230
So zinc sulfate is
a clearish liquid.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.470
And instead of having
solid zinc here, now

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.160
you're going to have
solid copper that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.020
will have precipitated
out of the solution.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660
So that's pretty neat.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.570
And just to make sure
that we understand it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.900
in terms of oxidation
and reduction,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.070
let's think about the
half reactions here.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.120
So let's think about the
half reaction for zinc.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.710
So solid zinc
right over here, it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.860
has a neutral oxidation state.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.800
It has no charge.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.170
And then we end
up right over here

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.860
with zinc that has a positive
charge, a positive 2 charge.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.680
So what happened right here?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.820
It lost electrons.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.220
It got oxidized.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.720
So it lost two electrons.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.140
The zinc got oxidized.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.120
And then what happened
to the copper?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.540
Well, the copper
started as a cation.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.779
So it started in the
aqueous solution.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.340
And then it gained
two electrons.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.550
Each ion of copper
gained two electrons.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.060
And then we end up with neutral
copper in the solid state.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.230
So it's oxidation
number was reduced.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.050
It became more negative.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.820
So we could say that
the copper was reduced

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.670
by the zinc, the zinc
oxidized by the copper.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.740
And we see that the sulfate,
its charge didn't change.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.990
And when you're dealing with
an actual ionic compound,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.800
the oxidation state
is its actual charge.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.127
It's not hypothetical anymore.
