some season one and I realize that the

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439
some season one and I realize that the
 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.620
some season one and I realize that the
character is pretty much the same as

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
character is pretty much the same as
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.090
character is pretty much the same as
when I started him I think that he has

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100
when I started him I think that he has
 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.550
when I started him I think that he has

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
evolved as a person over the last seven
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.019
evolved as a person over the last seven
years and that's been an interesting

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
years and that's been an interesting
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150
years and that's been an interesting

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
thing I think he's not so much Michael's
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.000
thing I think he's not so much Michael's
sycophant anymore he's pretty separate

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
sycophant anymore he's pretty separate
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.770
sycophant anymore he's pretty separate
and independent from Michael they've had

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780
and independent from Michael they've had
 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.570
and independent from Michael they've had
some falling outs he's no longer

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
some falling outs he's no longer
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279
some falling outs he's no longer
interlocked with the character of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
interlocked with the character of
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.479
interlocked with the character of
Michael Scott

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489
 
 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.759
 
so he's matured he's more confident he's

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769
so he's matured he's more confident he's
 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.139
so he's matured he's more confident he's
more socially confident he's more

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
more socially confident he's more
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700
more socially confident he's more
confident from women he's become a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
confident from women he's become a
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.379
confident from women he's become a
little bit more of the alpha male kind

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:42.389
little bit more of the alpha male kind
 

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.189

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199
of testing his his limits in the office
 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.009
of testing his his limits in the office
in the workplace and I think that's been

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019
in the workplace and I think that's been
 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.689
in the workplace and I think that's been
interesting but the character in terms

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699
interesting but the character in terms
 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.209
interesting but the character in terms
of the acting is really the same I think

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
of the acting is really the same I think
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.120
of the acting is really the same I think
from season one

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130
 
 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.660

I would hire Dwight yes I would in a
heartbeat he would do anything I could

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960
heartbeat he would do anything I could
 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.439
heartbeat he would do anything I could
hire him for any job imaginable and he

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449
hire him for any job imaginable and he
 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.520
hire him for any job imaginable and he
would he would morph himself to the task
