00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.100
One of the most lucrative endorsements ever
signed by any sportsman was not for some shoe,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.390
line of clothing, or athletic gear- but for
a cooking item- The George Foreman Lean Mean

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.070
Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.789
In fact, the deal is generally thought to
have made the former boxing great drastically

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.180
more money than he ever made fighting in the
ring.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.180
(And, if you’re curious, see: Why Boxing
Rings are Called Rings When They are Square)

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.469
According to the grill’s inventor, Michael
Boehm, the inspiration for the grill’s unique

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.600
design came when he was walking around a department
store in the late 1980s and he noticed that

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.230
not a single grill for sale cooked meat on
both sides.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.750
Boehm, a lifelong inventor and tinkerer, rushed
home and sketched an idea for a grill that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
did exactly that, as well as drained fat away
while the item cooked.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.340
To test the concept, Boehm bought some cast
iron skillets, placed them at an angle and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.350
then tried cooking burgers on the contraption,
measuring how much of the fat was drained

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.350
away.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.159
The crude device worked and Boehm refined
the idea, adding such features as a floating

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.060
hinge (so that it could evenly cook things
of varying size) and a separate reservoir

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.630
that the fat would drain into, making cleaning
the grill that much easier.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.290
Boehm later claimed that he knew from day
one that the grill was going to be a huge

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.470
success, noting that “It was different;
it had some magic and it fulfilled a need.”

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.210
At the time, Boehm was the general manager
of a Chinese manufacturer of electronics called

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.110
Tsann Kuen USA.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.900
While Tsann Kuen USA did eventually end up
selling a version of the grill dubbed the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.520
“Short Order Grill”, it sold poorly, prompting
Boehm to begin pitching the grill to other

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.009
manufacturers, all of whom showed him the
door.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.479
As Boehm later elaborated:

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.500
They initially seemed indifferent, even skeptical.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.380
That was true of just about everyone I showed
it to, [they told me] you can’t cook on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.380
an angle!

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.510
It’s like anything new, something people
haven’t seen before.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.909
If it’s so great, people say, it would have
already been invented.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.900
Well… that’s not necessarily the case.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.920
Ignoring the naysayers, Boehm continued to
pitch his idea, eventually catching the eye

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.509
of Salton Inc. (now known as Spectrum Brands)
in 1994, who agreed to manufacture the device.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.459
Now all Boehm needed was a spokesman, which
is where Hulk Hogan allegedly came swaggering

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.459
in.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.840
The Hulkster has changed his story on this
one over time, initially claiming during an

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.379
episode of Hogan Knows Best that his agent
called him to tell him of the offer to have

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.560
Hogan endorse the grill, but Hogan missed
the call.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.680
This purportedly resulted in the agent switching
gears and working out a deal for the grill

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.799
for one of his other clients- George Foreman.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.129
This, of course, makes no sense at all as
no agent who wanted to keep his job would

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.799
do such a thing simply over a missed phone
call.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.579
In an interview in 2011, Hogan changed the
story to something a bit more plausible- he

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:52.269
was approached by his agent in the 1990s about
the idea of endorsing a line of kitchen products.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.519
Mr. America was then pitched three different
devices his agent had managed to wrangle him

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.260
offers for: a meatball maker, a blender and
a grill.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.870
While Hogan liked the idea of putting his
name on a meatball maker and a blender, with

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.809
the latter being released under the awesome
moniker of The Hulk Hogan Thunder Mixer, he

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:13.329
passed on the grill, allegedly telling his
agent “Ah, give that to your other client.”

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.329
That client?

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.329
George Foreman.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.879
As interesting an anecdote as this is, and
as much as it’s often claimed to be “fact”

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.629
by various otherwise reputable outlets, Boehm
has never confirmed either of The Hulkster’s

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.019
versions of events, maintaining that he always
intended to have George Foreman be his spokesman

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.260
after seeing him passionately endorse some
mufflers in a TV ad.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.049
As a result, it’s not really clear whether
or not Hogan was ever actually a potential

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.839
candidate to endorse the grill as he has claimed.

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.170
It may even be the case that Hogan was simply
offered an endorsement of a grill that was

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.709
not the product that became the George Foreman
Grill, but later confused it as such.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.599
(Hogan did later endorse a product known as
the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.)

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.120
Whatever the case, according to Boehm, Salton
Inc sent a prototype grill and some information

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.860
about it to Foreman after getting in contact
with his lawyer.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.840
Unfortunately for them, they were promptly
stonewalled by the former champ for several

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
months.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.979
Foreman’s lawyer, Sam Perlmutter, would
later recall that Foreman’s immediate reaction

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:17.169
to the grill was less than enthusiastic, with
the boxer taking one look at it and flatly

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.269
stating, “I’m not interested in toys”.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.760
This was a bit odd as Foreman was known to
be a huge lover of hamburgers and had once

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.610
noted he made a practice of carefully draining
the fat from every piece of meat he cooked-

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.870
the very thing the grill was literally invented
to do.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.960
Despite this being the perfect product for
Foreman, the prototype grill sat in his kitchen

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.150
for a reported six months until his wife decided
to use it to make his children a grilled cheese

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.150
sandwich.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.150
The result?

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.989
Mary would later state in an interview, “I
told him I tried that grill.

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:51.669
I really love that grill and it was easy for
me because having a bunch of kids, you just

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.479
put the stuff on there — and especially
children love grilled cheese sandwiches.”

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.240
Nevertheless, Foreman remained unconvinced
about the grill until his wife made him a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.389
hamburger with it.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.860
He stated of this momentous burger, “The
grease, everything went away and the meat

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.979
was delicious.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.370
So I called my partners back and said, ‘I’m
going to do that deal’.”

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.629
Perhaps thanks to being a long-time holdout
on this one, Foreman was given pretty ridiculously

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.819
favourable terms in the deal; in exchange
for promoting the grill and slapping his name

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.870
on it, Foreman was promised a whopping 40%
of the profits of each grill sold.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.340
This was 25% more than Boehm, the guy who
invented the thing, received.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.819
The remaining 45% of the profits went to Salton
Inc.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:35.199
Launched in 1994 as “The George Foreman
Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine”

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.760
the grill would eventually become a huge success,
to date having sold well over 100 million

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760
units.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.250
Sales of the grill netted Foreman so much
money in royalties that they actually influenced

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.500
his decision to finally hang up his boxing
gloves at the age of 48.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.789
According to Foreman, after his 1997 loss
against Shannon Briggs (Foreman’s last ever

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.090
professional bout), he sat in his locker room
feeling sorry for himself when his lawyer

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.819
walked in and handed him a comically large
cheque large not only in dimensions, but amount,

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.960
despite being royalties for only a single
month of sales.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
To quote Foreman:

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.729
That was one of the happiest days of my business
life.

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.400
I lost my last professional boxing match,
[but] I’d received a check for $1 million

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
for the grill.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.830
While Foreman has never officially stated
how much money he’s received from sales

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.380
of the grill in total, conservative estimates
taking into account his royalties, which at

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.130
the peak of the grill’s success were totaling
about $4.5 million per month, and the $137

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.800
million he was paid in 1998 by Salton Inc
to buy him out of future royalties, it’s

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.129
generally estimate that Foreman made well
over $200 million (adjusted for inflation,

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:47.720
about $300 million today) from the grill;
this is approximately 2.5 times what he earned

00:06:47.720 --> 00:07:28.389
during his prestigious career 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:42.689
in 
the ring.
