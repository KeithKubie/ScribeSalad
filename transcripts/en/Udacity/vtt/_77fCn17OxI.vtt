00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:01.930
Well now we're getting somewhere.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.469
All we have to do is run
those table creation queries

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.763
by calling exact SQL
at the end of our onCreate function.

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:14.150
But wait, there's another function
in our SQliteOpenHelper, onUpgrade.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.761
You might think,
why should I care about those?

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.934
I'm not upgrading anything yet.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.751
To make our development lives easier,
we're going to implement

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.030
the most standard kind
of onUpgrade there is.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.060
You see onUpgrade only fires

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.093
if you change the version
of your database.

00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:31.085
Now remember, we passed that version

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:35.356
into the SQliteOpenHelper
base constructor, ages ago.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:39.279
Since we are going to be using
our database as a cache for web data

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.793
and not for user generated content,
we'll drop the tables.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.377
This is helpful if we want to change
the database in the future.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.279
If we were using user data,

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:51.709
we'd do something like use alter table
to add new columns.

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:54.018
So, now we have a database.
