ANJALI KUMAR: Please join me
in welcoming to Google New

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.751
York, Jacques Pepin.

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:08.242
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.715
Thank you very much.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.720
ANJALI KUMAR: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.570
It's a thrill to have you.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.700
JACQUES PEPIN: Google
not exist when I

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.750
moved to New York.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.180
ANJALI KUMAR: Google didn't
exist when I moved to New

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.720
York, I think, either.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.196
JACQUES PEPIN: None of
you existed when I

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:24.310
moved to New York.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.800
It was 1959.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.770
So I wasn't kidding, you see.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.680
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, so now,
this tome that we talked

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.840
about, which, truly, I think,
does weigh more than my child.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.920
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.580
ANJALI KUMAR: It was originally
two books.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.055
JACQUES PEPIN: That's
not "Cuisine

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:41.988
Master." It's very heavy.

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:42.450
ANJALI KUMAR: Yes, it is.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970
JACQUES PEPIN: It's
not light cuisine.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.410
ANJALI KUMAR: Pardon?

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.310
JACQUES PEPIN: It's
not light cuisine.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.950
It's very heavy.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.030
ANJALI KUMAR: No, it's
heavy cuisine.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.585
So it was originally two books,
"La Technique" and "La

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:53.280
Methode" that you originally
wrote in the late '70s.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.640
JACQUES PEPIN: Right.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.800
ANJALI KUMAR: So can you tell
us a little bit about the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.690
inspiration for the original
two books and then why you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.980
decided to combine them?

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.420
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.440
Actually, I had a friend of
mine who kind of became a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.820
surrogate mother.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.200
Her name was Helen McCully.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.930
She was the food editor of
McCall's "House Beautiful." I

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.630
lived on 50th and 1st
Avenue at the time.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.910
ANJALI KUMAR: We're all going
to show up tomorrow.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.910
JACQUES PEPIN: And she--

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.940
ANJALI KUMAR: There's
going to be a line.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.330
JACQUES PEPIN: And I
started writing.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.300
She always pushed me--

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.690
do this, do that.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.780
Don't put those stupid socks
we have in front.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.240
Don't do this don't do that.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.790
An then I started doing little
things for "House Beautiful,"

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.110
and I say you know what
would be good?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.760
Is to show people
how to do it.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.460
So we decided to do pictures.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.470
Those were pictures in black and
white about the size of a

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.090
stamp, so you couldn't
see anything.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.200
And so that was the beginning
of that book.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.860
And I met a friend of mine,
Craig LaBan, the food editor

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.007
of the "New York Times." I
went to his house in East

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.920
Hampton, and there I
met Herb Nagourney.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.410
He was the president of the "New
York Times" book company

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.480
called Quadrangle.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.850
And he said, do you want
to do a book with us?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.070
I said, yeah, I'd love to.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.630
So I started, and I said, well,
you know, maybe I need

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.880
like 400 pictures.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.030
And I called him, and I
said, maybe like 800.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730
He said, OK, go ahead.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.289
I said, like 1,200?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.340
He said, OK, fine.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.935
Like 1,500?

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.170
He said OK.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.800
1,500, that's enough.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.080
So I did a book, about 1,500
pictures, and I did a second

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.790
one, which we didn't want to
call "La Technique Number

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.000
Two," so we find a synonym and
called it "La Methode," and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.060
that was a continuation
of this.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.320
And those books were in print
for many, many years.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.600
And about 12 years ago, I
reorganized the material, too,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.780
and we did a large
book out of it.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.080
And then this year, we, again,
reorganized the material and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.970
took a lot of pictures in color
that I have in a book

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.780
called "The Art of Cooking,
Volume 1 and 2" that I did in

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.090
the end of the '80s, which
is probably the best

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.340
book that I've done.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.600
We're reorganizing and reusing
those pictures in there.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.290
interestingly enough, I have
some book, after like 8, 10

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.330
years, people look at it, and
they say, well, we can't

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.970
really use it.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.540
The pictures are obsolete.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.320
Technology goes so fast.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.820
And it's true that there
is a certain style.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.800
Like a few years ago, where you
would kind of focus on the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.430
main dish to shoot a picture
and make it very clear, and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.620
all the outside kind of
cloudy and in a moody

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.630
and a romantic way.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.380
That was a style of shooting
which can date the picture,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.950
pretty much.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.200
But that doesn't happen with
this, because those are just a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.690
close-up of my hand boning
a chicken, turning a

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.450
thing, and so forth.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.330
So that's why they didn't
get obsolete.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.910
And the point is that the
technique, the way you beat an

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.190
egg white, or peel an asparagus,
bone out an

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.530
chicken, make an omelette, or
do a caramel cage, it's the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.810
same now that it was
50 years ago.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.120
I am Dean of Study at the French
Culinary Institute

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.400
here, and we have what they call
the Competency, like 250,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.870
which are like techniques
that we have to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.830
cover, like doing eggs.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.080
You have to know how to do
scrambled eggs, poached eggs,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.160
this, this, and that.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.730
With the poached eggs, we do it
now the same way we did 50

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.030
years ago, except 50 years ago
without all this sauce and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.510
some truffle on top, of a piece
of ham underneath, a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.180
bouche, so that was
the Eggs Benedict.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.079
And now you may do your eggs
with a little tiny asparagus

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.450
hedge, or saute in a much more
modern way, but basically the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.690
techniques themselves
don't change.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.610
ANJALI KUMAR: Right.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.140
So why did you feel the
need to combine

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.190
these into one volume?

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.260
JACQUES PEPIN: To sell
more and make money.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.210
ANJALI KUMAR: That's
very smart of you.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.560
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, I have
a series on television now

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.060
called "Essential Pepin," which
I taped last year, or

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.340
started last year.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.200
And I have a book, and what
makes it in the book is I have

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.030
a three and half hours DVD of
technique, a great deal of the

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.020
technique that I
have in there.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.730
And, in fact, when they
say, well, we want

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.230
to redo that book.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.980
We want to do something
different too.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.430
And at that point, I said it'd
be great if you do that.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.530
A DVD going with it?

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.710
I said, that's great.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.200
I just did one for
the other book.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.720
So they said, well, can
you do one there?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.200
I said no, it would
be redundant.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.090
So this is basically what
I have in there, here.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.360
And, frankly, I teach at Boston
University for about 30

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.060
years and at the
French Culinary

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.150
Institute here in New York.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.400
Those schools, you go, and it's
like $40,000, $45,000 for

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.670
the program.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.970
And basically all of that is
on that three-hours tape.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.690
I mean, not all of it, but a
great deal of the technique.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.580
ANJALI KUMAR: Shh.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.870
Don't tell anyone.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.820
JACQUES PEPIN: So it's
just amazing.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.080
ANJALI KUMAR: Boston University
is not going to be

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.410
happy with you right now when
they hear this tape.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.908
JACQUES PEPIN: No, no.

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:47.900
Oh, well.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.780
No, we do some good
classes, there.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.490
I was there last week with a
group of like 10 people.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.320
I do your participation class
and participation class and

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.820
demonstration, which I do
demonstration usually.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.490
But there, I do like the perfect
meal for me-- a roast

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.400
chicken, a boiled
potato, a salad.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.890
But just with an exactly
one certain way to--

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.660
so I can do it, the student
did it, and then they go

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.820
behind the stove, each one with
a chicken, and then they

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.990
redo it for the class and
they'll make like five hours.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.660
And that's what I tell
them, very often.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.910
Don't try to blow my mind
and make something

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.290
different with it.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.360
Cook with your guts.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.270
In some way, you cannot escape
yourself anyway.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.270
And for the better or
for the worse, you

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.080
have 15 people here.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.630
I am going to have 15
different chickens--

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.750
two undercooked, two overcooked,
two burned, one

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.560
cold, two hot, and so forth.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.850
But they will be different,
because you really cannot cook

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.390
like the person next to you.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.910
You are not that person.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.470
And so that's important.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.730
ANJALI KUMAR: You wear so many
different hats in your life,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.380
and have, throughout your
career, everything from being

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.800
the dean of various schools,
various cooking institutions,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.180
to writing all these books
and the television shows.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.420
Which has been your favorite
thing to do?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.310
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, all
of it, in a sense.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.170
I get bored if I have to
do the same thing.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.955
I had a column in the "New York
Times" for like 10 years

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:16.650
in the '80s.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.880
If you only have to do that,
you're always pressured by one

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.900
thing or another or a
book and so forth.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.840
But I go teaching, or
I confuse that at

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.110
the Russian Tea Room.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.560
I opened the World Trade Center
here in the Hilton.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.220
So it's a type of work, then
you go back to doing an

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.190
article for this,
then I teach.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.550
That's the beauty of doing all
things related to food, but

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.720
different things.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.830
But to a certain extent,
probably teaching, I like.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.930
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, so, you were
on a much loved show with

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.080
Julia Child, "Julia
and Jacques."

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.634
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.900
ANJALI KUMAR: There seems like
there's stories there.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.680
And you guys were really the
pioneers of the sort of

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.340
television chef and the sort of
celebritization of chefs.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.360
Can you tell us a bit
about your favorite

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.150
memories with Julia?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.860
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, there's
so many memories.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.310
I met Julia in 1960.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.410
And we became friends.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.150
And then we cooked together
very occasionally.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.340
And when I started teaching at
BU, I would always see her

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.210
from breakfast, to lunch, to
late-night drink, or whatever,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.690
with Julia.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.710
And at some point,
I said, maybe we

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.450
should do a PBS special.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.710
And we did at BU what we called
"Cooking in Concert,"

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.370
for that two-hour show that we
taped in the Tsai Auditorium

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.200
at BU, and which was shown--

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.289
that was just prior to the Food
Channel Network, which

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.309
was widely shown on PBS.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:45.340
And then that led us to do
another two-hour special, and

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.420
eventually, we did the
series together.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.400
Conventionally, when
you do a series--

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.020
I have done some with my
daughter, Claudine.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.470
I have done 12 series of 26
shows, mostly with KQED, the

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.510
PBS station in San Francisco.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.760
But I remember doing a series
years ago which was on time,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.870
so a 30-minute show
with like 28 and a

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.350
half minutes, whatever.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.790
So I have like three dishes
or four dishes to do.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.470
And there's a guy going back
with a sign-- nine minutes,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.960
six minutes, five, three,
one, 30 seconds,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.250
wrap up, and so forth.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.920
It can be a bit stressful.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.430
You want to look kind of
suave and go and the

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.060
thing has to be finished.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.850
So when I started doing some
with Claudine, my daughter, I

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.460
say, you know, I'm supposed to
teach the kid how to cook, and

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.730
if I show her how to make a
pie, and she's rolling the

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.390
dough and struggling, and the
guy goes back there, three

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.800
minutes, I push the kid off
and grab the dough.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.220
So I said, OK, well, don't
go to too long.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.430
Editing is expensive.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.420
So we end up showing
35, 38 minutes.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.630
They have to do editing
a little bit.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.310
Then we did the show
with Julia.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.270
And Julia said, you know,
we're going to cook.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.770
When it's finished,
we'll tell you.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.560
We did some show--

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.750
I think the longest one 120
minutes for a 30-minute show.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.220
And, of course, it was great.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.220
We kept drinking wine.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.710
We cooked.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.840
OK, it's over.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.000
Finished.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.560
And I am amazed sometimes at
seeing some of the show, where

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.680
it's very smooth and all that.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.610
It wasn't that smooth at all,
and it was much too long.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.120
But that's the beauty of
anything, I suppose.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.630
But PBS, Julia loves
to work for PBS.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.640
All I do, we don't have
to cow to a sponsor

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.340
and stuff like that.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.530
In fact, we don't even have
the right to work for a

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.026
sponsor and all that.

00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:39.750
Not that I'm such
a great pure--

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.630
if you pay me enough, I'll
work for anyone.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.550
But--

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.430
I'm kidding.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.610
But the point is Julia
was happy.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.270
So one time, I remember we had
Kendall Jackson came, and Jess

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:57.440
Jackson and his Barbara Banke
owned Cambria Winery, and he

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.010
owned Artisans &amp; Estates, which
is like 30 wineries--

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.740
Pepe, La Crema, Stonestreet
all of those.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.070
So we had a lot of wine.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.480
They were very nice people.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.280
He told me, you can have
any wine you want.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.660
Well, I didn't want to take the
Mondavi wine next to him,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.470
but I had French wine,
and Italian,

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.100
Spanish, Portuguese, whatever.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.320
South African.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.070
And we started having a glass
of white wine, and we start

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.030
cooking, too.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.410
So they call and say we'd like
to come see a couple of shows

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.710
taped, and maybe we will take
you out for dinner with Julia.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.170
I said, terrific.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.490
Because they became
friends with me.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.080
And so they came.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.130
They were in the room, the
control room, whatever, where

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.570
you can see the show.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.690
And Jeff Drummond, the producer,
said well, Kendall

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.395
Jackson is there--

00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:45.250
I mean, Jess Jackson.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.660
What are you going to do?

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:46.980
And I said, Jackson?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.940
It's not like we don't
drink wine.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.560
Fine.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.360
We'll drink wine.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.470
I don't know which we'll
drink, but we'll drink.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.440
So we finished the show, and I
even forget what we did, but I

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.650
tell Julia, OK that's great.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.750
Do you want a little bit of
Cabernet Sauvignon with that

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.000
or you want a Merlot?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.505
She said [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:03.391
I want beer.

00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:05.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.980
JACQUES PEPIN: I said what do
you mean you want beer?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.650
I said, we don't have beer.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.760
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.526
We have beer.

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:10.776
She got beer underneath.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.340
Well, I told Julia, I mean,
maybe we don't have to cow to

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.685
the sponsor, but we
don't really have

00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:18.650
to antagonize them.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.600
JACQUES PEPIN: And then she did
the same thing with the

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.800
president of Land
O'Lakes came.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.250
I mean, it's not like we
didn't use butter.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.074
She said [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:12:29.074 --> 00:12:29.898
more butter, boom.

00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:32.860
She put another stick of butter,
two sticks of butter.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.580
So we did, and so the producer
said, what are

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.140
you going to do?

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.500
I said, Jeff, I'm doing a dough,
and I'm going to do a

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.980
tart with it, a big gullet.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.070
And then, with the rest of them,
I'll show them how to

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.520
cover a dish to do a chicken
pot pie or whatever.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.030
And we had no recipes on any
of the shows with Julia.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.380
So at the last moment, we'd
change, or whatever.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.490
And so Julia said
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.020
I want to do my dough.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.630
I said fine.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.560
You want to do your dough.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.420
OK, fine.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.420
So I started.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.650
I made the dough, rolled
it, put that.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.925
And I said, now, Julia is going
to show you how to do

00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:08.770
another dough.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.750
She said [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.560
well, Jacques is going to
do it, which she did.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.610
So I said, OK, fine.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.410
She said I want you to do
it in a food processor.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.355
I say, OK.

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:20.440
I take the food processor,
I said all right.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.030
A couple of cups of flour, a
dash of sugar, a dash of salt.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.060
I said how much butter
she wanted.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.445
She said [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:27.346
I want Crisco.

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:29.060
You want Crisco?

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.950
The president of to Land
O'Lakes is there.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.930
We have no Crisco.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.800
We never use--

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.580
she had a can of Crisco
underneath.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.560
She grabs it, and we did half
butter, half Crisco oil.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.260
That was Julia.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.670
ANJALI KUMAR: I was going to ask
you to do an impression of

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.050
Julia Child, but I feel like--

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.460
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, OK.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.580
ANJALI KUMAR: --we've already
been treated to one.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.780
You do a very good
Julia Child.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.010
JACQUES PEPIN: Not really.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.050
Not as good as my daughter.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.920
When my daughter was born, I
already knew Julia Child,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.550
which is a long time, because
Claudine is going to be 45.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.500
Whew!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.290
In any case, I talked often on
the telephone with Julia, and

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.650
Claudine, my daughter, ended
up doing a very good

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.800
imitation of Julia.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.010
I mean, terrific.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.720
And she used to do that
all the time.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.320
And she went to college at BU.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.430
That's why I'm teaching there.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.600
So she went to BU, so
she used to call.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.290
One time I'm eating dinner
with my wife, and the

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:23.410
telephone rang.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.470
Gloria picked up
the telephone.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.070
She'd say, OK, Claudine,
well, what do you want?

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.950
Stop fooling around.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.450
What do you want?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.160
And now she'd say, oh, no, no.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.220
I'm sorry, Julia.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.710
I'm sorry.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.360
I'll call him right away.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.790
She thought it was Claudine
doing her imitation of Julia.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.040
So she was good.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.740
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, I'm going
to do a couple of "finish

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.270
these sentences" with you,
because there's a lot of

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.400
people here that I know have
questions that are going to be

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400
better than anything
I can come up with.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.950
We've already chatted on the way
in, so I want to make sure

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.100
we leave some time
for everybody.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.660
JACQUES PEPIN: All right.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.520
ANJALI KUMAR: So those of you
who do have questions, please

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.750
get ready to go to one of the
mics, because we are recording

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.520
this for YouTube.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.600
So I'll just ask you to finish
the sentence that I'm going to

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.413
read to you.

00:15:03.413 --> 00:15:04.360
JACQUES PEPIN: All right.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.000
ANJALI KUMAR: The most essential
technique to learn

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920
the kitchen is?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.900
JACQUES PEPIN: Is how to
drink wine properly.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.550
JACQUES PEPIN: You have to--

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.480
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, so
now, you were at a

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.690
wine event this morning.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.820
Can you tell us about that?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.850
JACQUES PEPIN: This morning
I was introduced at the

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.450
Companion de Beaujolais.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.620
I am from Beaujolais, actually,
in France, and the

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.830
Beaujolais Nouveau, the new
Beaujolais, start on the 15th

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.330
of November every year.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.590
So they came this morning.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:35.110
We went down Park Avenue with
the guy on the trumpet playing

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.650
"When the Saint Go Marching
In" and we had a bottle of

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.790
Beaujolais.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.662
So I had some this
morning, too.

00:15:41.662 --> 00:15:43.060
I feel all right.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.340
But Anjali gave me a sandwich
and a banana, a couple of fig.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.450
ANJALI KUMAR: I know.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.310
We treat our guests well here.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.010
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.020
ANJALI KUMAR: You didn't
bring me any wine,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.750
but we'll talk about--

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.520
JACQUES PEPIN: Google
sandwich is amazing.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.930
ANJALI KUMAR: It was
good, right?

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.296
JACQUES PEPIN: Whoo!

00:15:55.296 --> 00:15:55.420
Incredible.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.150
ANJALI KUMAR: A ham sandwich.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.330
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.690
ANJALI KUMAR: It goes nicely
with the Beaujolais.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.680
JACQUES PEPIN: Pam sandwich?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.810
That what it was?

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.120
ANJALI KUMAR: Ham.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.840
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, I thought
you said Pam.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.190
OK.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:03.361
ANJALI KUMAR: No.

00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:04.300
Pam sandwich.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.150
What would a Pam sandwich
entail?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.600
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.970
ANJALI KUMAR: Pam
like the spray?

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.390
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.160
JACQUES PEPIN: When you're
broke, you know--

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.740
ANJALI KUMAR: It's a tight
budget here, that's true.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.010
But not that type.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.165
OK.

00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:17.010
Now finish the sentence.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.280
A food trends I hate is?

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.410
JACQUES PEPIN: Molecular
cooking.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:22.670
Oh, no.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.040
I don't--

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.550
ANJALI KUMAR: You can say it.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.240
JACQUES PEPIN: I like
molecular cooking

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.850
for some time now.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.790
A trend that I hate--

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.340
I can't think of any because
I'm a real glutton.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.500
So I eat anything you
put in front of me.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.850
ANJALI KUMAR: Including
a pam. sandwich.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.730
JACQUES PEPIN: Including
pam sandwich, yeah.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.540
ANJALI KUMAR: I'll remember
that for next time.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.910
My favorite kitchen tool is.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.320
JACQUES PEPIN: My finger.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.710
I mean, there's nothing to
replace your finger.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:53.860
It squeezes, it crushes, it
strains, it twists, it kills.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.350
ANJALI KUMAR: All purpose.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.230
The thing I miss most
about France is?

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.940
JACQUES PEPIN: Well,
my mother.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.950
She's still there.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.160
ANJALI KUMAR: Somebody's
laughing in the audience.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.950
I'm not sure why.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.560
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.540
ANJALI KUMAR: I thought
that was sweet.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.825
JACQUES PEPIN: She's
98, though, so

00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:11.099
she's getting there.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.950
But I saw her this spring.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.980
I am Executive Culinary
Director of

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.020
Oceana cruise line.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.040
So we do a couple of cruises a
year, and I tend to go to Lyon

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.550
and see her and my cousin
and so forth.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.539
And that's always fun.

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:28.950
ANJALI KUMAR: That's nice.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.330
If I wanted to impress
Julia Child, I

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.950
would have made blank.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.750
JACQUES PEPIN: I would have
given her the best one that I

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.572
have in my cellar,
to start with and

00:17:38.572 --> 00:17:40.900
probably a ham sandwich.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.990
She loves ham.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.290
I do love ham, too.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.190
We have that book called "The
Last Meal of My Life,"

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.840
something like that.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.260
There are 50 chefs on it, and
they ask you what is the best

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:54.880
thing you can eat.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.520
And if you have the greatest,
greatest bread that I can

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.370
think of and the greatest butter
that I can think of,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.060
it's very difficult to beat
bread and butter.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.220
It's true.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.040
That being said, I probably
will have squid with fresh

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.460
peas and maybe a can of caviar,
probably a hot dog.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.820
Ham and egg I love.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.220
All that stuff are things
that I like.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.830
But be sure that it would
be a very, very, very,

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.500
very, very long meal.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.750
if it were to be the last one.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.510
ANJALI KUMAR: Well,
thank you so much.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.140
I think we're going to open
it up to questions

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.780
if anyone has any.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.106
JACQUES PEPIN: Preferably
about food and wine.

00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:38.560
ANJALI KUMAR: But anything.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.030
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.080
Do they need the mic, no?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.400
ANJALI KUMAR: They need
to mic, yes, please.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.650
We're recording.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.520
JACQUES PEPIN: You're
recording this?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.330
ANJALI KUMAR: We are.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.050
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh my god.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.510
ANJALI KUMAR: I have to have
you sign a release.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.010
I have to remember to do that.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.920
So next week-- oh,
is this working?

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.720
Next week, obviously, we have
Thanksgiving coming up, which

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.390
is probably the biggest
food holiday.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.290
So I was wondering if there are
any particular culinary

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.380
traditions that you liked
on Thanksgiving.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.700
JACQUES PEPIN: Did you see the
"New York Times" yesterday?

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.580
I had my turkey in the "New
York Times" yesterday.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:18.800
And as I said in the article, I
haven't actually read it, be

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.620
the truth, so I don't
know what they cut

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.840
out of what I wrote.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:28.120
But certainly, I had my friend
Susie Heller, the producer of

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.970
the show for Julia
and so forth.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.310
Like 30 years ago, she lived
in Cleveland at the time.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.120
And she said, oh, I'm going
to the Thanksgiving.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.970
I want you to come.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.190
And I said great.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.510
She said, I'm going to do
a big saddle of veal.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.200
Be different.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.340
I said, what?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.710
I said, if you don't do
turkey, I'm not going.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.790
I mean, Thanksgiving
is turkey.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.880
So she got some turkey, and she
even went to a butcher.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.690
She had a butcher.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.230
She had a fresh turkey.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.870
And she said, you have
something special?

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.700
Could you get some turkey
fried for me?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.410
And the butcher--

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:01.740
ANJALI KUMAR: Wait.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.920
Can you tell them what
turkey fried is?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.700
JACQUES PEPIN: Turkey fried?

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.250
ANJALI KUMAR: I learned
this earlier.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.630
JACQUES PEPIN: Turkey
testicles.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.890
They call it turkey fried.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.730
So the butcher said, well,
let me call the farm.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.160
So she called the farm and said,
yeah, we can get it, but

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.290
I have to have an inspector
guy, too.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.545
She said, oh, wait a minute.

00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:19.150
How much is that
going to cost?

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.960
He said, well, $0.80 a pound.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.670
All right, fine.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.540
Give me three pounds.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.720
So I came back and she said,
I got some of you for you.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.910
I said, woo hoo, turkey
ball, that's good.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.900
So we fried them and
we gave them.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.760
All the guests didn't
know what it was.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.900
They said, oh, these sausage
are really good.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.455
And when we told some of them
what it was, some had to go

00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:44.236
out to throw up but--

00:20:44.236 --> 00:20:46.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.270
JACQUES PEPIN: And then Susie,
many years later--

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.580
she lives in Napa Valley now--

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.000
came, and we did the mother of
all Thanksgiving, which again,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.660
I mentioned in that article.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.330
There was Thomas Keller,
cooking, Cat Cora, Don

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.110
[INAUDIBLE], I mean, a lot of
great chefs, like eight.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.460
And I think we did eight
different type of turkey.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.010
There was a split up
and pomegranate

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.630
glazed grilled turkey.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.770
There was a suveed turkey.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.900
There was a deep fried turkey.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.640
There was a brine turkey.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.570
There was a regular
roasted turkey.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.520
There was a turkey I did with
Julia, which was bone out,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.610
where I bone out the leg and
roast the breast separately.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.370
And then the one that I had
in the "New York Times"

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.380
yesterday, which is steamed
first and then roasted after.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.200
What's was your question?

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.300
About the--

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.575
AUDIENCE: Well, it was
what is your favorite

00:21:37.575 --> 00:21:38.485
Thanksgiving tradition.

00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:39.400
But I guess I followed--

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.850
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah,
the turkey.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.480
AUDIENCE: that with the turkey
balls in New York.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.710
JACQUES PEPIN: Right.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.460
I say it's amazing that it was
such a Puritan beginning.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.300
It became the most probably
dynastic celebration that we

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.040
have here, and the best, because
there is no political

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.870
application or religious
application.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.770
You don't have any gift
to give to anyone.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.640
There's nothing with
a kid, you know?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.980
So it's purely the pleasure of
sitting down, overeating and

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.080
overdrinking.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.410
That's great.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.160
ANJALI KUMAR: Yes.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.730
I wonder if you can provide any
inspiration for working

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.580
parents who are short on time
but still want to provide a

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.750
special meal for
their families.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.590
JACQUES PEPIN: Well,
very easy.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.840
You've got to buy my book.

00:22:25.984 --> 00:22:26.970
Not that one.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.170
Or that one, also,
if you want.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.570
But I have two books.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.430
Yes, I did.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.810
No, it's a good question.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.480
I did two series
on television--

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.880
not the last one that I have
now-- two series before called

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.980
"Fast Food My Way." We did about
26 shows, which is about

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.030
130 recipes.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.510
So I have "Fast Food My Way" and
"More Fast Food My Way."

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.770
We did two series.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.180
And the premises was
that probably the

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.190
antiquity of this one.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.110
The premise was that when you
work in the restaurant, you

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.460
have the prep cook who comes in
the morning, and he bones

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.280
out the chicken, bones out the
fish, slices the mushrooms,

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.660
washes the spinach,
chops the shallot.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.630
You have everything ready.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.340
Nothing is cooked, but
it's ready, fresh.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.510
So I get behind the stove.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.390
The first order is a filet
of sole or whatever.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.795
I grab it.

00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:10.350
It's done.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.620
I put a bit of shallots on top,
some sliced mushroom, a

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.900
dash of white wine, bring
it to a boil.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.150
Finish it with a piece of
butter, and I do that dish in

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.360
five, six minutes because I have
the prep ready for me.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.860
So I did do those books
with the same idea.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.850
I used the supermarket
as the prep cook, and

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.660
we can do that now.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.850
So I had two boneless, skinless
breasts of chicken.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.890
I had prewashed spinach.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.950
I have a no-stick pan.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.780
I mean, when I did those shows
of 30 minute, which are like

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.350
28 and a half, I did
four dishes, and

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.195
I had nothing prepared.

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:44.850
I usually did them on time
there, you know?

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.340
You go to the supermarket.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.780
Now I go to the deli.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.260
And I take a container.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.170
It's all the same
price, anyway.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.650
So I take some black olives,
some Kalamata olives, some

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:56.960
green ones, some [INAUDIBLE],
a little bowl of mozzarella,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.120
some dried tomato, too, and
I'm making a salad.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.860
I get home to put a bit more
olive oil on top of that, some

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.100
fresh basil.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.510
I buy a package of ham.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.015
I take a Martini glass, a nice,
honey-cured ham, put a

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:12.356
big slice of ham hanging
on the side, fill

00:24:12.356 --> 00:24:12.860
it up with my salad.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.770
First course--

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.150
fine.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.560
Using this supermarket
in those ways--

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.400
it's true--

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.970
with a minimal amount
of effort and still

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.800
have fresh good food.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.890
Because it's very important to
have the kid partake of what

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:31.550
you do, to involve the kid, and
all that, and not to give

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.410
the kid the idea that your house
is a restaurant and the

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.580
kid is going to eat
a la carte.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.150
I don't like this, I
don't like that.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.080
That didn't exist with
my daughter.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.430
That's what we served tonight.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.090
That was it.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.440
That was dinner.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.420
And when Claudine was five years
old, asked her mother,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.000
my wife, Mom, what's
for dinner?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.740
My wife would say food.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.760
And it's still food now.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.070
That's what we have
for dinner.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.580
We never specify the
type of food.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.390
No, but try that
type of thing.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.460
It's good, yeah.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.791
Thank you.

00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:04.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.865
Thank you for coming here.

00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:07.550
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.590
Your voice is very familiar
because I grew up while my mom

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.360
was watching you 24/7.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.130
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, thank you.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.430
AUDIENCE: So a lot of memories
coming back.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.780
So I know this is about cooking,
and your book is

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.440
about cooking, and you're all
about cooking, but for us lazy

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.810
New Yorkers, what's your
favorite restaurant in New

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.610
York, and what would
you order there?

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.620
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, it's
a leading question.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.850
Two days ago, I was in Chinatown
in Flushing.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:39.610
And at lunch for $8 or $10,
whatever we spent per person

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.170
in a Shanghai restaurant.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.180
So there's many, many places
like this that you can eat.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.210
I have to say, in New York, in
Manhattan, the French Culinary

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.950
Institute, where I am a dean
of the school there

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.930
occasionally, it's one of the
best dinners in New York.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.980
The food has to be super fresh,
morning, and again

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.460
night, because the students at
night start by peeling their

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.020
carrots and stuff, can't even
use the stock, whatever, from

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.190
the morning.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.390
And we do a lunch--

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.340
I think $30.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.380
And the five-course dinner
is $41, I think.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.770
So it's really cheap for New
York, and the food is quite

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.300
fresh and good.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.500
AUDIENCE: Where would
you go tonight?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.710
JACQUES PEPIN: Tonight.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.160
I don't know.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.116
Anjali didn't tell me where
she's taking me, so--

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.630
ANJALI KUMAR: Ham sandwiches
at Google.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.440
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.010
I don't know.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.050
I have to do a book signing
tonight, and I may go back to

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.710
the school, actually,
to have dinner.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.850
We have very good wine, too.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.040
Good price.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.760
I mean, there's many, many--

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.340
you can look even in the Zagat
and other on the internet.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.500
I mean, there is 24,000
restaurants in New York.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.510
It's just amazing.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.330
Some very expensive ones,
some good ones.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.290
I mean, you can spend $1,000
easy, if you want to

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.340
go to Per Se, too.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.190
It depends on the wine you buy,
or if you get into caviar

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.940
or stuff like this.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.070
But you know what?

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.380
I think it's even more expensive
in Europe now, those

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.120
types of restaurants.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.710
Anyway, I didn't answer
your question, right?

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.020
No.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.300
OK.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.640
ANJALI KUMAR: He has
a very diplomatic

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.180
way of skirting around.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.340
You could be a lawyer
at Google.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.270
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, thank you.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.230
ANJALI KUMAR: That was
very impressive.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.940
JACQUES PEPIN: That's
a compliment or--

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.330
ANJALI KUMAR: Yes, seriously.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.830
Watch as I dance around.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:18.930
It was very much a compliment.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.580
JACQUES PEPIN: Either way
it's a compliment, yeah.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.700
ANJALI KUMAR: It's the highest
compliment, some might say.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.640
Very few people, but
somebody might say.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.733
Those people laughing, those
people would say it.

00:27:25.733 --> 00:27:26.720
Yeah.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.340
AUDIENCE: So in the US, there's
been a long campaign

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.070
of eliminating fat from food.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.180
Everything is low
fat and no fat.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.330
And as a result, a lot of the
food has gotten sweeter to

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.010
compensate for the
lack of flavor.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.130
I read that maybe 80% of the
food in the supermarket now is

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.480
artificially sweetened.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.390
What do you think
of that trend?

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.150
JACQUES PEPIN: You
can go to 90%.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:50.390
There were 2,300 cookbooks
published last year.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:56.880
In the last 20 years, 25 years,
most of them mine.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.870
In the last 25 years, 30 years,
we've done over 20,000

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.730
books related to losing
weight and diet.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:11.260
And we are now 40% fatter than
30 years ago, so it doesn't

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.940
seem to work.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.880
I don't know.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.950
I think you can eat whatever
you want, but you can't

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:17.960
swallow it.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.560
That's the problem.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.680
JACQUES PEPIN: But It is true.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.760
And your percentage
is even low.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.620
It's like 90%.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.360
Now, the amount of sugar that
you have in something like

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.550
catsup and all that savory stuff
is just amazing, more

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.100
than in soda.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.350
It's really frightening.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.610
For me, you start with
kid and all that.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.840
First, you never eat something
you can't recognize.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.230
It's already a good step.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.850
And many often, of course, for
most kids, a chicken is

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.440
rectangular with
plastic on top.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.980
It doesn't have any feet and
head, but you still know that

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.940
it's chicken.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.480
But now I was, I don't know,
somewhere not too long ago,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.800
and there was a little kid.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.070
And so you move from this to
something less recognizable to

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.215
even Cheerios or stuff like
that, cereal, where you look

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:10.120
on the box, you don't really
know exactly what's in there.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.670
But now, that kid there where I
was, would ask your mother,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.290
she wanted to eat the red
box or the green box.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.810
So now, it goes one
step further.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.060
The food is recognized just
by the color of the box.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.410
That's why they have
absolutely no

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.960
idea what's in there.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.460
We have to avoid processed
food at all cost because

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.510
that's really deadly, the junk
that there is in it.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.060
But, of course, on the other
hand, markets are opening.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.790
The markets have never been as
beautiful as they are today.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.190
When I came to America, there
was only one salad.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.300
It was iceberg, period.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.430
No leek, so shallot, no Oriental
vegetable in the

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.260
supermarket.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.350
Now the supermarkets are
absolutely beautiful.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.230
And people tell me they don't
want to cook anymore.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.170
So what do they do with the
stuff at the end of the week?

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.350
Someone must buy it.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.190
Otherwise, they wouldn't
replenish it on Monday.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.270
So the last few years,
people are cooking.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.130
And then we are becoming
"localvore." You have to go

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.680
local food now, organic.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.160
And so all that is good.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.410
It used to be like that
not that long ago.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.970
I already said, my mother
and my father

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.020
were organic farmers.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.450
Of course, they had no idea what
the word "organic" meant.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:27.190
But the point is that chemical
fertilizer did not exist, and

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.170
fungicides, insecticides,
pesticides

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.720
did not exist either.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.470
So basically we used some cow
manure, whatever we had.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.960
We did the garden,
and that was it.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.680
So we're going back to
this, and it's fine.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.400
It's terrific, actuality.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.230
And eating from next-door
farm.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.310
But then we always exaggerate.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.010
Here we go.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.960
And I've been to restaurants
where they

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.040
introduced me to carrot.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.760
This is a carrot.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.980
Her name is Sarah.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.100
She went born on the
7th of March.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.420
Give me the goddamn carrot.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.180
So we go too far sometimes.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.790
ANJALI KUMAR: That seems
a bit extreme.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.700
JACQUES PEPIN: But it happens.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.140
ANJALI KUMAR: So don't go to
that restaurant, whoever was

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.520
asking for the restaurant.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.570
AUDIENCE: So it feels like
there's a lot more TV

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.430
celebrity chefs now, and
the rise of the Food

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.960
Network and all that.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.150
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.880
AUDIENCE: So I'm just curious
what your opinion of the

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.190
current generation
of TV chefs are?

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.075
Are there any that you're
a particular fan of or

00:31:18.075 --> 00:31:19.390
anything like that?

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.670
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, I was--

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.185
I forget where I was.

00:31:22.185 --> 00:31:24.950
I was at a convention
a few weeks ago.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.520
There was a food historian
saying that there is 407

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.860
cookery shows on television.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.950
That kind of my mind.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.070
I mean, I don't know whether
it's accurate, frankly.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:39.060
But even if there's only 200
or so, it's just amazing.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.390
But people look at it for
different reasons.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.570
I'm sure many people look at
my show and say, well, that

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.330
guy's boring.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.360
All he does is cook, too,
and do and whatever.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.170
And it's fine.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.650
Some of the people do Italian
for entertainment, for other

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.690
type of thing, and I think the
more it brings people into

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.970
food, the better it is.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.080
Every year, I go to the Food
and Wine Festival in Aspen.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.350
Last year was the 30th
anniversary, and I think I did

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.270
it 28 times, many times with
Julia and then even my mother

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.260
when she came.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.720
So it's 5,000 people there.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.280
Last year, we drank 45,000
bottles of wine from Thursday

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.930
until Monday, 5,000 people
there, and about 300 wineries.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.960
And if you know Aspen, everyone
is kind of very

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.810
cliquish because it's
all closed in there.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.020
No one has a car.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.230
And it's a great thing.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.770
Now, everyone is into food.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.440
Everyone knows you there.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.240
So people will come to me and
say, I know you had all the

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.040
shows on television.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.770
You are the best.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.110
And the reason those people
say that is that only the

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.000
people who like me
come to see me.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.250
The other ones don't.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:42.920
They go to--

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.380
I don't know--

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.402
Bobby Flay next door and say,
you know, we look at all of

00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:46.270
the shows on television.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.860
You are the best,
and so forth.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.340
That way, I think it's fine.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.080
We all have our own way
of doing things.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.160
Some people like it.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.700
Some don't really care
one way or the other.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:02.000
And so for me, I don't
really look--

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.450
to tell you the truth-- much
at cookery shows on

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:05.950
television.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.860
Most of the time I don't.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.580
So I don't really know that
many, but certainly, a show

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.600
like "Hell's Kitchen" or
whatever is certainly not the

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.620
way to train someone in the
kitchen because there is a

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.780
great of love, at the risk
of sounding a bit mushy.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:31.150
But cooking, you have to
cook with your gut.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.960
It's something which
is automatic.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.770
There is a great deal of
affection of love that you

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.130
bring into what you do.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.210
And yelling at people your head
off is not going to train

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.470
someone properly.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.880
But I know that this
is television.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.820
That's the way it is.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.820
If you go into the kitchen at
Per Se with Thomas Keller, or

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.010
Jean-Georges, or [INAUDIBLE],
there's no noise.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:51.965
The chef is there.

00:33:51.965 --> 00:33:52.650
You order.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.940
We order this, this, this.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.350
Say, yes, chef, I will do.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.760
I say pick up this, that, too.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.360
The guy pick up.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.530
No noise.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.280
You hear the cling
of the thing.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.470
That's all you hear.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.460
It's very organized.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.840
It's very structured and
disciplined in a sense, so no

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.120
televisions come there.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.780
There's nothing to film.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.739
You're noticing that
It's really boring.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:16.989
So they create those shows,
where everything is hey, man.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:21.440
But it's not really the way
it is in a real kitchen.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.860
And as far as all the shows,
there are some very good chefs

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.929
on television.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.375
I mean, certainly people like
Lidia Bastianich and Bobby

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:33.034
Flay or Mario Batali,
I mean, those guys

00:34:33.034 --> 00:34:34.820
are really good chefs.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.239
I've seen some others who
wouldn't recognize a carrot

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:40.070
from a potato, but.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.929
they don't do it for that.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.300
And often I asked people,
how many people

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.750
cook out of a show?

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.020
Not that many, really.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.894
They look at it for
other things.

00:34:50.894 --> 00:34:53.179
That was your question, right?

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.670
No, his question.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.360
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you remember the first

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.210
thing you taught your daughter
to cook and what you would

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.930
recommend for someone as like a
first way to introduce their

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.830
children to the kitchen?

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.960
JACQUES PEPIN: To cook with your
daughter, you mean, or

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.340
children in general?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:09.590
Yeah.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.456
They say you have to
get them involved.

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:16.990
When Claudine was a year
old, I hold her in

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.180
my arm, and we cook.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.540
She's stirred the pot.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.440
So she stirred it.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.610
Quote, she made it.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.630
And she was going to taste
it, of course.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.670
And as I said, again,
we don't explain

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.010
the menu to the children.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.960
We cook whatever we cook.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.280
And you find out that the kid
absolutely adores string beans

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.970
for like a month, and then they
hate string beans for

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.890
another month.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.060
And then they like
this and that.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.020
Claudine liked-- it ended up
when she was a kid like

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.620
artichokes and Brussels sprouts
were like her favorite

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.340
vegetables.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.230
And also the fact that certainly
she had frog legs

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.980
and escargot, as we are
French, at my house.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.750
And the kids don't
really mind that.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.400
Usually, very small kids, up to
like age seven, eight, and

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.690
they go to school, and they
talk to their friends, and

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.210
say, you eat what?

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.010
Yuck.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.710
This is still so.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.750
So you have that type of thing,
that they want to be

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.630
the same than their friend,
and you have

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.580
to go through that.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.650
I remember taking Claudine
when she was like

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.630
10, 12 years old.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.290
We always spent a weekend
together in New York, go to

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.430
the theater, or a movie,
and go to a restaurant.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:27.840
And I said, OK, you want to
go to see Tonton Andre.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.030
Uncle Andre was Andre Soltner,
the owner of Lutece, here,

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.760
because she knew him.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.750
One of the greatest restaurants
in New York.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.840
And I said, it's
your birthday.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.420
She said can we go to Burger
King or whatever.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.380
So I said, fine, OK.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.950
So nothing is wrong,
occasionally, here and there.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.930
But the kid should be partaking
of the food, being

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.460
part of it, and there is nothing
better for a child

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.130
coming back home and listening
in the kitchen.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.320
The kitchen is the most
comforting place of the house.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.090
And hearing the cling of the
pots and pans, the smell in

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:09.170
the kitchen, the voice of your
mother, those smells, those

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.250
sounds, and all of that will
remain with you the

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.060
rest of your life.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.320
It's a very important
comfort zone.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.910
You see that with those kids in

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.890
Afghanistan or whatever now.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.470
What you dream at night,
that type of food, not

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.480
really for the food.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.870
You want it for the comfort
and what it brings.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.890
I think it was a Chinese
philosopher Lin Yutang, I

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.990
think, who said the entire
paraphrasing, patriotism is

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.860
the taste of the dishes
you had as a child.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.180
And there is a great deal of
truth in this, because that

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.092
brings so many other things.

00:37:44.092 --> 00:37:44.470
So.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.710
I don't want to get
too deep here.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.172
ANJALI KUMAR: Now what
was your question?

00:37:50.172 --> 00:37:51.950
Go ahead.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.870
AUDIENCE: So what is it that
excites you the most about

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.700
what's happening
in food today?

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.660
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, the
involvement of the farm, the--

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.070
yes, the entrees that
people are.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.270
And that's kind of unique
to America, too,

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.350
to a certain extent.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:13.250
Because for many Europeans,
they look at Americans and

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.750
say, those people
eat five dishes.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.800
This is it-- hot dog, hamburger,
fried chicken,

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.690
pizza, and can of macaroni,
or whatever.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.840
Which is, of course, not true.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.790
And which is, of course, true.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:30.850
If you go into the [INAUDIBLE]
crowd, if you want, that's

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.050
usually where you have a lot of
obese people, and they will

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.530
eat four, five dishes
over and over again.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.010
That's how people eat.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:41.460
But then, conversely, if you
move in any urban center, even

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.140
a small town now, the amount of
restaurants is staggering.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.300
And the diversity,
because we are a

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.840
country of ethnic people.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.110
For one night, you're going
to eat Turkish.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.170
Then the day after
is Shanghai.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.450
Then it may be Italian,
French, Portuguese,

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.250
Greek, and all that.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.210
And that's the way people eat,
which is absolutely amazing.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.150
Even for me, I go back to France
now, and after a while,

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.520
I'm bored with the food because
I'm used to more

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.920
diversity and other
things here.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.020
Because if you go to France, the
food is good, and you're

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.320
born with that type of food.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.370
That's what you eat, so 99%
of people eat French.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.690
There are Chinese restaurants
and all that, but basically,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.230
I'm talking especially
in the country,

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.980
people will eat French.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.570
I did the same thing in Italy.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.230
99.9% of Italians eat
Italian food.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:34.100
Same thing with Portuguese, with
Greek, and with Spanish

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.240
and so forth, because the
food is good and that's

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.590
what you're used to.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.760
But in America, that's
not the case.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.590
And you explore in all those
different directions, and it's

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.440
very exciting.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.450
And good food, too.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.920
ANJALI KUMAR: Great.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.130
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, sir.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.890
AUDIENCE: So thanks
again for coming.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.690
When you were talking a little
bit about "Hell's Kitchen," I

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:58.880
was reminded of your memoir,
"The Apprentice." Or was it

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.730
"The Apprenticeship"?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.510
I apologize.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.300
It's been a few years.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:01.925
ANJALI KUMAR: The show on NBC.

00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:03.586
AUDIENCE: But it's
a wonderful book.

00:40:03.586 --> 00:40:03.980
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.840
AUDIENCE: And I was trying
to think back to your

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.300
descriptions of what it was like
to cook in the old world

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.690
in France and of kind of the
great French chefs, and what

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.200
that apprenticeship was like,
and how it in some ways it

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.620
could be pretty brutal.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.440
And I thought those were kind
of very interesting

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.850
descriptions, because we went
through kind of a dead zone of

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.300
cooking, at least in America,
and as you've

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.660
said today, it's back.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.100
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah, it's--

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.040
AUDIENCE: So what was all that
like when you were young in

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.030
France, coming up, and then
maybe a little bit of what it

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.345
was like when you were kind of
cooking for the government and

00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:40.720
the royalty?

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.940
I mean, that whole trajectory
of your career is sort of

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.940
unknown to Americans, I guess.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.840
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.430
Well, from '56 to '59, I was
chef to the President in

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.360
France under the Fourth
Republic.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.730
The government was changing at
a rapid pace, and I finished

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.820
with de Gaulle in '59.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.430
And someone introduced me, as
you did, a few weeks ago and

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.630
said that man cooked for three
French presidents.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.290
Three of them are dead.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.200
OK, I think one is
still alive.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.180
I'm not sure.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:16.780
The apprenticeship that I did,
it was another world.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.590
Interestingly enough, if
I look at my father--

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.180
well, I never knew
my grandfather.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.780
They all died in the
first World War.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:30.120
But my father and other older
people at that time, my

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.580
generation it was different
than they were,

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.570
but not that different.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.580
Remember, there was no planes
here at the time.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.070
We had no television.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.800
There was no internet.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.950
It was really--

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:47.640
barely electricity, so it was
different for my parents.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.310
It was different for me,
but not that different.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:54.030
Now, I look at my granddaughter,
wow, In those

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.340
one or two generations.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.050
I mean, if they look
at my book, it's

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.500
like the Middle Age.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.280
It's really, really
another world.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.000
Just the management of the
stove, to start with.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.650
We had a stove that you start in
the morning, put some paper

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.570
and some wood, then coal,
and you have to

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.550
keep that thing hot.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:17.940
Now, those were very large
rectangular stoves, almost as

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.060
big as that stage.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.790
And there is different-- six
people are working on it,

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:25.390
three on each side, like the
sous department, the

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.410
fish, and so forth.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.930
And then in between there
was the oven.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.680
You open the door on one side.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.730
On the other side, it
was like a funnel.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.200
So there was no thermostat, of
course, or stuff like that.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.540
When that thing really had red
on top, the temperature was

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.570
probably 500 degrees
in the oven.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.550
And on one side, someone
is cooking a fish.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.160
I'm cooking a souffle
on the other side.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.080
So you have to work within the
food itself to move it close

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.260
to the door, open the door a
little bit, put a thing in

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.530
front of it to regulate the
temperature and so forth.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.070
It's not like we put it on the
timer, 20 minutes, 375, go

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.410
take a nap.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.390
It was totally different
things.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.170
And that stove was hot.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.490
Like at the Plaza Athenee in
Paris, still we had no stove.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.590
The people are coming.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.500
The lunch crowd come
at 12 o'clock.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.540
Now, the people in charge of
the stove, which were the

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.330
first [INAUDIBLE], if you did
not regulate it properly, then

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.110
that thing is not lukewarm, but
not really hot enough for

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.895
the first 30 people who come in,
and that pushed back the

00:43:22.895 --> 00:43:24.140
whole dining room.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.465
When that people came in the
dining room, that stove had to

00:43:26.465 --> 00:43:29.520
be red to where the chef would
be out of his mind.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.370
So just the management of that
was a great deal of work,

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:35.290
which, of course, doesn't exist
at all anymore because

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.000
it's another world.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.950
Now, there was no
school, really.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.650
You worked behind the line
as an apprentice.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.490
And you were not particularly
well treated.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.270
If you did something wrong, you
got a kick in the behind.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:52.950
And that was not a big deal, but
that's the way things were

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.270
with some people,
not with all.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.070
But also the fact that they
didn't tell you anything.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:43:59.940
They do a sauce.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.330
You say, what is that?

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:01.960
It's a sauce

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.130
[SPEAKING FRENCH], which means nothing.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.650
Or if the chef tells you to
do this, and you say why--

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.950
first, I would not even
have said why.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.940
But if I had said why, he said
because I just told you.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.750
That's about the end
of the explanation.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:20.380
So you learn by osmosis,
by stealing the things.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.020
And there was no recipe.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.130
It was purely memory of
the senses in the

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.300
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.850
sense of the taste, and look,
and smell, and so forth.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.890
And then for a year, I cleaned
up pots, pans,

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.060
did vegetables, too.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.730
And one day, the chef
told me, you?

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.740
Tomorrow, you start
at the stove.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.150
Wow!

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.440
I was flabbergasted.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.140
I said, I don't know.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.860
I went to the stove, and
I knew how to do it.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.130
Why did I know how to
do it and remember?

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.690
Through that type of osmosis.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:55.130
That was a type of
apprenticeship, which is very

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.790
different now.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.640
But remember, I was 13, 14,
15 years old during my

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.150
apprenticeship.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.070
And it's a way of learning,
which is still applied to a

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.480
certain extent.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.290
I used to teach skiing in
upstate New York, here.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.620
That's how I met my wife.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.550
I've been married 47 years.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.855
So I would teaching skiing.

00:45:14.855 --> 00:45:17.420
I remember for several years,
I taught the kids, middle

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.620
school, or whatever it was,
seven, eight years old, 10

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.310
years old, from a
Catskill school.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.110
And they would come up to
teach kids how to ski.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.010
You go up the mountain,
say, stay close to

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.780
me, and you go down.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.020
If you put them on the line
and talk to them about the

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:38.170
full line and the position of
your wedge, and all that, it

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.640
comes here, and it
comes out there.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.790
They want to ski.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:45.380
The same weekend, I'm giving
a class to a lawyer, maybe.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:49.410
And that person, 30 years old,
to want to know why I'm

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.060
turning, why this, why
the position, too.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.080
It's a totally different
explanation.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.190
This is probably
what we do now.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.680
At the French Culinary Institute
here, we cater to

00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.120
the people.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.480
It costs a fortune.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.220
We explain.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:01.930
We show them.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.760
We cater to them-- totally
different than when I was an

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.080
apprentice.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.680
When I'm there, sometimes there
is graduation, and often

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.870
I'm a judge.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:14.730
I'm amazed, absolutely amazed,
what they can do in the six

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:15.880
months they have been there.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.270
I would never have been able to
do that after three years

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.410
of apprenticeship.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:19.750
Never.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.980
However, I was certainly much
faster with my knife, cleaning

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.240
all kinds of manual things that
you learn through that

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.760
type of endless repetition.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.580
So a very different way
of learning now

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.375
than it used to be.

00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:33.800
ANJALI KUMAR: All right.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.460
Well, this has been wonderful.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.110
Thank you so much for coming.

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:37.530
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.060
ANJALI KUMAR: You can come back
for a ham sandwich or

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.700
anything else--

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:39.980
JACQUES PEPIN: OK.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.820
ANJALI KUMAR: --any
time you'd like.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.360
Thank you.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.510
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.
