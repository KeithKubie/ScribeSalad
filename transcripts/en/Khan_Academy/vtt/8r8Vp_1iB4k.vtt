00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.060
So let's review
the idea of slope,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.930
which you might remember
from your algebra classes.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.470
The slope is just the
rate of change of a line.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.580
Or the rate of change
of y, with respect

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.800
to x, as we go along a line.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.260
And you could also
view it as a measure

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.820
of the inclination of a line.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.460
So the more incline the line
is, the more positive of a slope

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.250
it would have.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.960
So this right over here,
this has a positive slope.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.210
It's increasing as x increases.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.460
And if this had an even
higher inclination like this,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.316
if it increased even
more as x increased,

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.940
then it would even
have a higher slope.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.100
So this right over
here is some line.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.040
So that's some line.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.070
And just as a reminder,
we can figure out

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.810
the slope between two points.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.490
Two points define a line.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.110
And between those
two points, we can

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.750
find the rate of change
of y, with respect to x.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.250
So let's put two points on here.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.500
So let's say that this point
right over here, this x value,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.450
is x sub-- well, this
is pronounced x naught,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.890
or x sub 0 is just x naught--
and when x is x0 for this line,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.600
y is y0.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.590
So this is a point x0, comma y0.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.850
And let's say we have another
point all the way over here.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.330
And let's say that this x value,
this x value right over here

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.890
is x sub 1.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.430
And the y value over
here is y sub 1.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.700
So this is the point
x sub 1, y sub 1.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.190
So just as a review,
the slope of this line,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.280
and a line by definition,
has a constant slope

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.500
between any two
points that you pick.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
The slope of this line, which is
often denoted by the letter m,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.300
is your rate of change
of y with respect to x.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.800
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.980
for a given change in x,
how much are you changing y?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.550
Or a change in y divided
by a change in x.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.110
Just as a reminder,
this triangle,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.090
that's the Greek letter delta.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.140
It's shorthand for
change in whatever.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.400
So change in y over change in x.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.530
So let's think about what this
is going to be for this example

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990
right over here.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.889
Well, let's think about
change in x, first.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.200
So we are moving from x0 to x1.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.090
So our change in x.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.340
So this is our change
in x, right over here.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.690
We're starting at
x0 and going to x1.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.490
That is our change in x.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.550
I'll put that in
that pink color.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.350
That is our change in x.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.400
And what is it equal to?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.010
Well if we're ending
here and we started here,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.330
let's just do ending point
minus starting point.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.850
So it is x1 minus x0.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.687
And that way, doing
it this way, I

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:41.770
would have made sure that
I have a positive value.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.250
I'm just assuming that
x1 is larger than x0.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.720
And what is my change in y?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.560
Well, once again,
ending point, ending

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.030
y value minus starting y value.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.099
y1 minus y0.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.640
Now, you might be
saying hey, could I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.620
have done y0 minus y1
over x0 zero minus x1?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.500
Absolutely.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.810
You could have done that.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.580
Then you would have just
gotten the negative of each

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.400
of these values in the
numerator and denominator,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.520
but they would
have canceled out.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.436
The important thing is
that you're consistent.

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:13.480
If you're subtracting you're
starting value from your ending

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.320
value in the numerator, you have
to subtract your starting value

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.940
from your ending value in
the denominator as well.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.450
So this right here you probably
remember from algebra class.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.310
The definition of
slope is the rate

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.800
of change of y
with respect to x.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
Or it's the rate of change
of our vertical axis,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.480
I should say, with respect
to our horizontal axis.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.100
Or change in y, or change
in our vertical axis

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.350
over change in a
horizontal axis.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.150
Now I'm going to introduce
a little bit of a conundrum.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.812
So let me draw another
axis right over here.

00:03:43.812 --> 00:03:45.270
Scroll over a little
bit just so we

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.150
have some space to work with.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.370
So that was for a line.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.090
And a line, by definition,
has a constant slope.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.960
If you calculate this between
any two points on the line,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.490
it's going to be
constant for that line.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.270
But what happens when we
start dealing with curves?

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.580
' When we start dealing with
non-line or non-linear curves.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.140
So let's imagine a curve that
looks something like this.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.839
So what is the
rate of change of y

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.959
with respect to x of this curve?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.750
Well, let's look at it
at different points.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.030
And we could at least
try to approximate what

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.650
it might be in any moment.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.370
So let's say that this
is one point on a curve.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.956
Let's call that x1,
and then this is y1.

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:36.080
And let's say that this is
another point on a curve

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.790
right over here, x2.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.840
And let's call this y2.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.520
So this is a point x1, y1,
this is a point x2, y2.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.859
So we don't have the tools yet.

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:49.650
And this is what's
exciting about calculus,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.490
we will soon have the
tools to figure out,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.060
what is the rate of
change of y with respect

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.697
to x at exactly this point?

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.030
But we don't have that tool yet.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.240
But using just the
tools from algebra,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.150
we could at least
start to think about,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.230
what is the average
rate of change

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.380
over the interval from x1 to x2?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.140
Well, what's the
average rate of change?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.470
Well, that's just how
much did my y change--

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.290
so that's my change in
y-- for this change in x.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.970
And so we would calculate
it the same way.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.050
y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.770
So our change in y
over this interval

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.410
is equal to y2 minus
y1, and our change

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.910
in x is going to be
equal to x2 minus x1.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.040
So just like that we
were able to figure out

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.082
the rate of change
between these two points.

00:05:48.082 --> 00:05:49.540
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.180
is, this is the average rate of
change for the curve between x

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.600
equals x1, and x is equal to x2.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.130
This is the average
rate of change

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.180
of y with respect to
x over this interval.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.310
But what if we have we
also figured out here?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.144
Well, we figured out
the slope of the line

00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:07.435
that connects these two points.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.950
And what we call a
line that intersects

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.570
a curve in exactly two places?

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.020
Well, we figured out, we
call that a secant line.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.110
So this right over
here is a secant line.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.480
So the big idea here is we're
extending the idea of slope.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.080
We said, OK, we already knew
how to find the slope of a line.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.860
A curve, we don't
have the tools yet,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.700
but calculus is about
to give it to us.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.519
But let's just use
our algebraic tools.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.310
We can at least figure
out the average rate

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.600
of change of a curve, or a
function, over an interval.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.230
That is the same exact thing
as the slope of a secant line.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.980
Now just as a little
bit of foreshadowing,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.980
where is this all going?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.860
How will we eventually
get the tools, so

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.540
that we can figure out the
instantaneous rate of change,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.060
not just the average?

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.570
Well just imagine what happens
if this point right over here

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.670
got closer and
closer to this point.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.200
Then the secant line is
going to better and better

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.430
and better approximate
the instantaneous rate

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.580
of change right over here.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.336
Or you could even think of it as
the slope of the tangent line.
