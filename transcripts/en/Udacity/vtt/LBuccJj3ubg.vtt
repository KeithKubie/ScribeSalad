Welcome to our last Office Hours.

00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:07.379
This is basically just kind of a wrap up and any last questions that we saw

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.419
that we felt needed to be answered before we ended the course. Right? &gt;&gt;Yep, yep.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.003
Okay. Let's just jump right in.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.154
First question was if you were building
Reddit or Hipmunk today,

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:26.233
would you build it on Google App Engine or
would you go ahead and--

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:32.020
That's a really good question, and
the short answer is: I'm not sure.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.608
I think we could build Reddit or Hipmunk on
Google App Engine.

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:42.697
Probably definitely Hipmunk, a site that I know is--because it's a travel site--

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.755
it's never going to be at the scale that Reddit is,

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.027
because even the biggest travel sites aren't anywhere near the scale that Reddit is.

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:51.787
Yeah, so I would have no problem doing that.

00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:55.959
Now, Reddit--it's funny, because when I started Reddit we didn't expect it to be a big site.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:01.027
I was actually--my level of knowledge was less than where yours is now.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.241
App Engine would have saved us a lot of heartache.

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:10.001
Now, for the scale that Reddit is now, I don't know if App Engine would work.

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:15.141
Because it's at such a large scale we need to have control over a lot of little pieces,

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.321
but I think for the first couple of years of Reddit's life absolutely it would've worked just fine.

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:23.631
Over Reddit's existence, we've rewritten it
probably 5 or 6 times

00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:28.469
and moved a couple data centers and we moved from our own machines

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.532
to our first data center to now we're on
Amazon Web Services.

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:34.228
Each of those was a pretty major
architecture change.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.903
I imagine we'd consider starting the App Engine

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.829
and then probably migrate to our own more custom setup down the road.
