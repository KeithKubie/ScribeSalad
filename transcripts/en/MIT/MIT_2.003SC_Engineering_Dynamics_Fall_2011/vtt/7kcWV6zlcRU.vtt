00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:25.140
PROFESSOR: The purpose of
these recitations, small group

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.790
recitations, is so
that we can get out

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.140
the key concepts over
the week and what

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.217
I call the essential
understandings-- what

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:35.050
are the really important
points for the week

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.380
so that when the
first quiz comes,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.050
you will know how
to deal with it.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.420
So let's start with that.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
But you're going to help
me think through this.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
So take a minute
or two, write down

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.310
on a piece of paper
two or three things

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.010
that you think are the most
important things that you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.140
heard, saw, read this
week about this course.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.400
Let's report out.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.390
I want one from a number of you.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.702
Who wants to volunteer here?

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:08.506
AUDIENCE: Using different
reference frames?

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:09.790
PROFESSOR: Say it again?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.560
AUDIENCE: Using different
reference frames.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.393
PROFESSOR: Using different
reference frames.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.040
I'm going to write that,
once I get the chalkboard.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.540
Using-- I'm going to write it
as multiple reference frames.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.582
Close enough?

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:35.290
What's your name?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.123
AUDIENCE: Christina.

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:37.640
PROFESSOR: Christina?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.655
What do you have?

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:40.655
AUDIENCE: All points on
a rigid, rotating object

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:42.643
have the same rate of rotation.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.110
PROFESSOR: She said, all
points on rigid object that's

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.910
rotating, all points have
the same rotation rate.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:14.110
So this is rotation and
translation of rigid bodies.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.250
I'm going to generalize
what you said

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.300
a little bit, because
somebody else tell me,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.960
what can you say
about translation?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.140
So rotation, key point is, all
points share the same rotation

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.640
rate.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.920
How about translation?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.380
Two different points
on an object--

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.252
what can you say about it?

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:36.710
AUDIENCE: They follow
the same paths.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.850
PROFESSOR: Parallel paths.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.650
They go through the exactly
same parallel paths.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.850
So those are two key things
we remember about that.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.150
How about another point?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.256
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:55.630
This is actually
quite important.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.220
I'm going to write it
slightly differently.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.860
We need to talk about this.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:12.750
And that is that rotations--
to be absolutely correct,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:23.690
finite rotations
are not vectors.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.190
I want to come back
to that in a minute.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.450
Lots of possible
confusion around that.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.823
One more-- or
actually, there's more.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.280
AUDIENCE: The MLM strategy?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.330
PROFESSOR: MLM.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.960
So I mentioned that last time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.300
That's problem
solving my way, which

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.085
is first M is figure out the
motion, describe the motion.

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:51.835
That's kinematics.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.940
The second term is
L. What is that?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.610
Laws.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.510
By the physical laws.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.980
And the second M?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.310
Do the math.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.195
So motion, laws, and math.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.460
There's something else here.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.315
Well, you may have
just decided it's

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:14.440
going to encompass in that.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.100
But I want to go a
little further than that.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.959
What did we talk a lot about
yesterday in the lecture?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.855
AUDIENCE: Different
types of acceleration.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:28.560
PROFESSOR: Accelerations and
velocities and translating

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.990
and rotating frames.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.290
Translating and rotating
frames-- running out of room

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.340
here but you get the point.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.510
All right, that's
a pretty good list.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.377
If I'd been coming up
with a list on my own,

00:04:56.377 --> 00:04:57.960
what would have
thought was important,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.860
that would've captured
most of those things.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.370
Certainly this is really
important this week.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.470
And we definitely need to
learn how to use translating

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.860
and rotating frames.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.190
And you're absolutely in
trouble if you don't know this.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.160
This is just sort of
fundamental to the whole thing.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.880
And then this is a subtle point.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.630
Let's start right
there for a second.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.354
Who has a textbook?

00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:29.770
It doesn't actually
really matter.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.065
Let me borrow your notes.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.790
Rigid body, got the
print on the front.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.160
I'm going to rotate it twice.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.950
The x-axis and call
this the z-axis.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.160
It comes out top
actually pointing at you.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.840
So I did that right.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.300
So now I'm going
to do the rotation.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.790
Now this one first.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.770
And then what was
the other rotation?

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.100
AUDIENCE: Backwards.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.420
PROFESSOR: Different
answer, right?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.450
Totally different answer.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.070
You can't add angles as actors.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.330
Doesn't work.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.130
And it's just-- the
way I think of it,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.990
mathematics is
largely done to help

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.710
describe the physical world.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.440
Newton and all those people were
figuring out-- needed calculus

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.920
to describe the
motion of the planets.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.620
Vectors were invented
to do analytic geometry.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.190
And it doesn't work for angles.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.230
You just can't use
them for angles.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.850
It's just the vector math
that they figured out

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.670
just wasn't quite clever
enough to include angles.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.880
However, vectors can be applied
to positions, velocities,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.240
accelerations, and
angular velocities

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.140
and angular accelerations,
but not angles themselves.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.550
That's the basic thing you
need to learn from that.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.292
Let's use some multiple frames.

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.500
We're going to do that today.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.660
We're going to now apply
this and this and this today

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.925
to do some problems.

00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:23.425
And let me see where I
want to go first with this.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.036
So I have a problem
that I wanted to do.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.840
And it's a circus ride.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.850
There's an arm.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.910
And that arm is rotating.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.035
Attached to the arm
is a cross piece.

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:15.230
And a passenger can sit in
each one of these things.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.930
And this is
basically horizontal.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.350
You're looking down on it.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.600
So you'd be riding around
in these cups at the circus

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.120
and it's going
around and around.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.770
And I want to know the velocity.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:34.341
What's the velocity of
point B in the O frame?

00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.590
And so this has to do-- one
of the things on this list

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.750
might be to get
the notation down.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.289
So this is the velocity.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.190
This is the point.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.270
And this is the frame.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.040
So what can you write down?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.560
Just take 30 seconds.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.500
See if you remember.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.490
Write down the general
velocity formula

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.580
that was put up
yesterday-- vector velocity

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.430
formula for a point in
a moving frame that's

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.530
moving in a fixed frame.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.054
Came up with a general formula,
had two or three terms in it.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.470
And we'll walk our
way through it.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.200
I realize I did something
maybe slightly out of order.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.700
So hold that thought.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.150
You've written down
what you've got.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.340
We have to do something before
you can actually write that.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.990
We haven't actually picked
our reference frames, have we?

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.380
So think about
that for a second.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.590
How would you set
up this problem?

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.930
What would you make
translating reference frames,

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.580
your rotating,
translating frame--

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.730
where would you assign it?

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.980
Think about it for 30 seconds.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.500
Who's got to take a
shot at it for me?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.711
Where would you pick reference
frames for this problem?

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:55.766
What your name?

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:57.104
AUDIENCE: I'm Ben.

00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:59.244
PROFESSOR: Ben.

00:10:59.244 --> 00:11:03.240
AUDIENCE: O and along the cross?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.700
PROFESSOR: Here, for sure.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.890
This is your inertial
frame-- not moving, right?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.320
And?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.715
AUDIENCE: Two axes on the cross?

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.360
PROFESSOR: So you
would put one up here?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.860
OK.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.345
I'm going to line
up with the cross,

00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:25.660
and I'm going to stick
out here and call it x2.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.390
And then there'd be a y2 here.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.120
And it rotates with the cross?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.380
All right.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:33.990
That's good.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.830
Now go back to that equation.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.690
Now give me the velocity,
the general expression.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.340
I don't want you working out the
details, just what set of terms

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:48.110
would you plug things into now
to get the velocity of B and O?

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.560
Then we'll evaluate the terms
and talk about it, using now

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.800
what we've decided here.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.780
OK, somebody help me out.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.050
What's on the right hand
side of this equation?

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.240
First term, Mary.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.540
AUDIENCE: Velocity of--

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.490
PROFESSOR: What's your name?

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.910
Steven?

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.660
AUDIENCE: Velocity of
A with respect to O.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.780
PROFESSOR: Velocity of A
with respect to O. All right.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.460
That's the velocity at this
point in this frame, right?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.670
What else do we need?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.420
What's your name?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.410
Andre?

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:39.820
PROFESSOR: I hear a velocity
of V with respect to A.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.550
And what is that-- is that
influenced by rotation?

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.780
Can you describe what
you mean by the velocity

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.426
of v and A physically?

00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:50.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.738 --> 00:13:00.230
PROFESSOR: So it's as if you
were sitting on that frame,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.730
right?

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.511
Does the rotation have anything
to do with what you see?

00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:04.010
No.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.130
So I sometimes remind
myself right here

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.850
this is omega equals 0.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.330
And you can set the omega
equal to 0, what you

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.420
would see is what this term is.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.060
Do we need anything more?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.692
Name?

00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:19.525
AUDIENCE: Christina.

00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:21.525
PROFESSOR: Sorry, you
gave it to me once before.

00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:22.911
It's going to take me awhile.

00:13:22.911 --> 00:13:25.366
AUDIENCE: It's the
rotational motion

00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:29.785
of B spinning around in there.

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:33.222
So it has to do with the
omega as seen in the reference

00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:45.740
frame, the origin, cross product
with r from the in regards

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.543
to the x2 xy.

00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:53.700
PROFESSOR: And we have the name
of that frame to help us out.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.120
This is then frame
A, x2, y2, z2.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.340
If you really wanted
to write [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.770
We just call it frame A. so
this is would be rB as in NA

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:10.370
And these are all vectors and I
often forget to underline them.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.480
Do we have it right?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.380
Anybody want to add
to that, fix it?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.050
Correct it?

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.734
Steven, right?

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:20.608
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:25.510
PROFESSOR: I left
it vague on purpose.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.810
We need to figure that out.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.160
He asks, is it
omega 2 or omega 1?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.930
Really important point we want
to make today about what omega

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.220
this is.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.970
We'll get to that.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.540
Yeah?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.890
AUDIENCE: Well, if they're
rotating in the same direction,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.807
wouldn't it be added in
both omega 1 or omega 2?

00:14:41.807 --> 00:14:42.640
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.890
Let's talk about it right now.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:49.680
Are we agreed that this
is the right formula?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.550
Then let's set about
figuring it out.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.770
And we can talk about
this term first.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:01.840
So we want to know, this
is the rotation rate

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.560
of this arm out here
in the base frame.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.440
That's what the notation says.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.890
And we know that the rotation
rate of this first arm

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.860
in the base frame is this.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.580
And we know that
the rotation rate

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:28.842
of this thing with
to-- now this has

00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:30.550
gotten a little
complicated, because this

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.190
isn't quite exact enough.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.500
This is omega 2 with
respect to this arm.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.930
That's what's given
in this problem.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:49.490
So this is omega 2 with
respect to the arm OA.

00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:53.080
Yeah?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.032
AUDIENCE: So does
that mean it's omega

00:15:55.032 --> 00:15:58.936
2xz from coordiante system B?

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:03.040
PROFESSOR: No, coordinate
system A x2y2 rotates.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.790
And if you're sitting in
there, you wouldn't see it.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.440
So this is correct.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.537
It's the rotation
rate as seen in O.

00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:16.120
So we need to figure
out what that is.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.494
And I'm telling
you in this case,

00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:20.110
you were given--
you might have been

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.150
given the rotation rate in O.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.710
You weren't.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.860
You were given the rotation
rate relative to here.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.140
So I'll write it as W2 with
respect to this arm OA.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:39.015
So how do you get-- we
need omega in O is what?

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:40.440
Help me out here.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.092
AUDIENCE: Is it O-- should
there be a small b at the bottom

00:16:43.092 --> 00:16:43.592
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.280
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.090
But what is it?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.520
Let's deduce it.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.820
If my arm here, this
is the first arm.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.950
And this is the at AB link.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.400
Now if omega with respect
to this arm, this thing

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.660
weren't moving, no rotation
rate relative to this,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.869
the whole thing would
be straight, right?

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.210
And it's going around like this.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.160
What's the rotation rate
of the link out here?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.960
Omega 1.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.420
And now this arm's not
moving, but this is rotating

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.570
relative to it at omega 2.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.310
What's the rotation rate
of the link out here?

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.270
Just omega 2.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.300
If I put the two together,
what is the rotation rate

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.454
of this arm, this second link?

00:17:43.454 --> 00:17:44.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.210
PROFESSOR: Omega 1 in,
certainly in O plus omega 2.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.050
It's not with respect
to A. I'm just

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.060
going to call it with
respect to the R maybe.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.301
Even this notation is
failing a little bit.

00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:03.300
But you get what I mean.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.140
It's omega 1 plus omega 2.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.040
And let's just write it
as omega 1 plus omega 2.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.550
And what direction is it in?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.940
It's a vector.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.940
So one of the things we
have to pay attention to

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.611
are unit vectors.

00:18:16.611 --> 00:18:17.110
Yeah?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.984
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:21.535
PROFESSOR: So this
is capital I hat here

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:27.420
and capital J hat there and
coming out of the board, K hat.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.310
Now, this is certainly
K hat, capital K hat.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:36.090
This one, though, is relative
to-- it's the rotation

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.350
rate of this thing.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.220
Here is a reference frame.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.590
What's sticking out this way?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.670
A little k2, right?

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.720
But is it parallel to capital K?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.720
Always parallel to capital K?

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.580
So they're the same thing.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.431
If unit vectors in
this are parallel,

00:18:57.431 --> 00:18:58.680
they amount to the same thing.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.920
So we can put capital
K, lowercase k, anything

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.220
we want here and it's correct.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.750
Now we've got an
answer for that.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:14.800
So when you're given-- when the
one thing's attached to another

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.090
and you're given
the-- if out here

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:23.270
you are given the rotation rate
in the base frame, you're done.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.930
But if you're given
the rotation rate

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.950
relative to some
other moving part,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.730
then you have to add them up
to get the true rotation rate.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.040
That's the bottom line message.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.550
All right.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.800
So we started-- we're
trying to figure out

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.780
this expression here.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.020
And we started with one
of the harder terms.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.450
And we need to figure
out-- to finish it,

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.480
though, let's do this over here.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:16.150
We have velocity of A in-- and
we have the velocity of B in A

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.860
with no rotation.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:25.040
And we have omega B in
O. And let's finish that.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.781
We know what omega is now.

00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:28.280
Whoops.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.360
It's not omega.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.502
The third term is omega
B and O cross RBA.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.380
So we've gotten the
first bit of this.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.770
Let's finish the problem.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:50.360
This is omega 1 plus omega 2
times k hat cross with what?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460
We need a length.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.810
I'll call this L. It's L long.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.290
So what is RB respect to A?

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:07.790
Yes?

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.120
AUDIENCE: L X 2 hat?

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.535
PROFESSOR: L X 2 hat.

00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:13.600
And I'll call that Lj2.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.940
The coordinate is x2.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.830
The unit vector would
be I2, not a j, an i.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.100
The unit vector is i2.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.180
OK, great.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.350
Now what is k cross i2?

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.440
j2.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:52.700
So we get omega L omega
1 plus omega 2 j2 hat.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.150
That's that term.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:03.970
And we need to figure
out our other two terms.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.580
What's this term?

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.470
Remind yourself of the meaning.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.410
This is the velocity of point
B with respect to the A frame,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.750
which is attached to it.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.290
It's on a rigid body.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.776
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:27.730
PROFESSOR: He said omega
2 times L. She says 0.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.740
Any other?

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.580
I hear another 0.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.662
Why 0?

00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:36.090
AUDIENCE: Because it's rigidly
attached into the ride,

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.090
if you're moving around.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.070
It's not moving on the
ride versus strapped in.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.778
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:42.900
So this term is always from
the point of view of a person

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.350
riding on the frame.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.670
Riding on that frame-- so
you won't ever see rotation

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.850
from inside the frame.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.730
You're just moving with it.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.860
So that's called, in
the Williams book,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.480
he calls this term the rel.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480
It's the relative
velocity between these two

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.222
points and no rotation.

00:23:04.222 --> 00:23:05.430
So what is that in this case?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.570
I hear 0.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.270
Everybody agree it's 0?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.660
It's a rigid link.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.070
Two points don't move.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.310
So now we're just
left with this one.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.500
And now, one of
the points I really

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:27.060
wanted to drive home today is
in fact this problem is one

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.820
that, depending on
how you set it up,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.840
you can think of as actually
having multiple rotating

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.440
frames.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.880
And if you do that,
what's the correct way

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.430
to add up the parts so you
get to the right answer?

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.020
Because we've left
this one for the last.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.890
And I want to make
sure you go away

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:56.030
knowing a formula you can always
use, and it's going to work.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.580
And the formula
we can always use

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.820
is the one that's of this form.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.560
Every one of these problems,
including multiple links

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.160
and things, you can
build up by doing

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.230
a sequence of this problem
again and again and again,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.450
until you get the whole answer.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.580
So we've actually
done what I would

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.400
call the outer problem first.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.330
We've worked out this thing.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.050
We have to do the
inner problem now.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.841
We could have done it
in a different order,

00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:24.390
but I need to know the
velocity of this point.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:31.105
And just to get you in the habit
of using the vector equation,

00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:35.280
that we have, I want to
know the velocity of A in O.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.370
And I'm going to
attach a rotating

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:49.270
frame to this arm, x1, y1.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.610
It rotates with this
arm at that rate.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.900
And I want you to use
that frame to solve

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.600
for the velocity of this point.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:09.580
And that would be--
velocity of point A in O

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:26.090
would be the-- this frame now
is an O little x1, y1, z1.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.970
It's a rotating frame, right?

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.450
Because the O's are
going to get confusing.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.680
Better not call it O.
We'll call this rotating

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.000
one-- in Williams, he
uses a lowercase o,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.380
but it's hard to
do on the board.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.670
Let's call this c.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.030
So this is a frame, C, x1, y1.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.080
So this frame will
be my c frame.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.940
So I want to know the
velocity of point A.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.830
It's the velocity of what?

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.500
If you get stuck, use
that top formula up there,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.975
put in the right points.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.686
So what's the first term mean?

00:26:08.686 --> 00:26:15.470
It's the velocity of the--
this time the rotating frame,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.000
does the rotating
frame translate?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.270
We have a rotating frame.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.370
Does it have any
translational velocity?

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.265
No, but you still have
the right to turn it

00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:25.110
down and set it equal to 0.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.410
So what's the right term?

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.712
How do you write it?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.910
Right?

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.760
It's the velocity of
my reference frame.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.759
It's the transitional
velocity of that reference

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:40.970
frame in the O frame.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.940
And that's what it is.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:56.930
And in this case,
it's 0 plus velocity

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.742
of A with respect to c.

00:27:01.742 --> 00:27:03.202
And I'll remind you again.

00:27:03.202 --> 00:27:04.910
It's as if you were
now rotating with it,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.120
and you're sitting at c,
looking at A. What's its speed?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.580
0.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:20.300
Plus omega-- what omega?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.629
Seen where?

00:27:22.629 --> 00:27:26.010
Measured from where?

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.900
Measured with respect
to what frame?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:39.170
I hear on O, cross
with-- we need length?

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.700
We'll make this length
capital R, scalar.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.335
So what's the
cross product here?

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.796
What's the unit vector?

00:27:54.718 --> 00:27:57.370
Correct unit vector?

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.006
Not x.

00:27:59.006 --> 00:28:00.600
x is the coordinate.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.400
The unit vector is--

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:06.971 --> 00:28:08.852
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:28:08.852 --> 00:28:09.816
That turns 0.

00:28:09.816 --> 00:28:10.780
That turns 0.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.710
This turns 0.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.870
Omega 1, And what's the
unit vector associated

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.930
with this omega 1?

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:26.440
k cross i 1 j hat.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:34.560
And so we have R omega 1 j1 hat.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.800
And now, we should
be able to write out

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.340
the full answer of
the velocity of B

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:59.230
in O is the velocity of A,
which is R omega 1 j1 hat

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.510
plus velocity of B
with respect to A,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:15.950
which was 0 plus this term,
which we figured out as L omega

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:21.976
1 plus omega 2 times j2 hat.

00:29:30.866 --> 00:29:32.490
So we have two or
three sub-- this kind

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.260
of a hard problem, actually,
for the first time out.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:41.240
Because it has a number of
subtle concepts built into it.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.940
You actually have
two rotating bodies.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.023
How do you deal with them?

00:29:44.023 --> 00:29:49.150
Well, you do sequential
applications of that vector

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.176
velocity formula.

00:29:50.176 --> 00:29:50.676
Yeah?

00:29:50.676 --> 00:29:52.818
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering why we

00:29:52.818 --> 00:29:56.388
made another coordinate system
that's rotating with the arm

00:29:56.388 --> 00:30:01.660
to solve for the velocity
of A [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.395
PROFESSOR: She asked,
why did we bother

00:30:03.395 --> 00:30:04.520
to make this another frame.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.620
The problems are going to
get nastier and nastier.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.880
I could have asked you, when
I walked into class, what

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.340
is the velocity of point A.
And you would have said, well,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.554
obviously R omega.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.540
Why are we going to
all this trouble, when

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.960
everybody knows from high school
physics that it's just R omega?

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.930
And the answer is
is because we're

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.060
going to get to doing
really nasty problems.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.890
And I want to make sure you
understand all the subtleties

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.120
about how we get these.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.380
So we started simple, but I
did it the long, hard way.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.410
Because later on, if I'd
walked in at the beginning

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.460
and just asked you right
off the bat, what's

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.669
the velocity of this
point-- go for it--

00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:56.210
you guys would have
failed miserably.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.400
It's not much
harder, but it takes

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.920
two sequential applications
of what you think

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.050
is obvious when you
walked into class.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.095
So that's why.

00:31:07.095 --> 00:31:08.970
We're just doing it the
hard way, so that you

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.610
get all the little nuances.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.397
Yeah?

00:31:12.397 --> 00:31:14.882
AUDIENCE: So why [INAUDIBLE]
there for omega 2,

00:31:14.882 --> 00:31:18.609
we have it with respect to arm
AB [INAUDIBLE] with respect

00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:20.846
to arm OA?

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:23.228
PROFESSOR: Why is it that way?

00:31:23.228 --> 00:31:24.644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
with respect

00:31:24.644 --> 00:31:28.045
to arm AB and when you wrote
[INAUDIBLE] with respect

00:31:28.045 --> 00:31:29.511
to arm OA?

00:31:29.511 --> 00:31:32.100
PROFESSOR: When I wrote
the equation for--

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.710
AUDIENCE: For the omega 2.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.800
There you're saying
it's with respect to OA,

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.356
and there you say
its respect to AB.

00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:42.550
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.190
Because this is wrong.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:57.307
AUDIENCE: My question deals with
j1 and j2-- are they the same?

00:31:57.307 --> 00:31:58.640
PROFESSOR: So he has a question.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.170
And that's the final, subtle
point I want to get to today.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.840
Good question.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.173
He's saying, are these the same?

00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:08.390
Are they different?

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.850
How do we deal with it?

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.960
So a question for you.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.280
In general, if
you're asked or given

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.520
a problem like we just did,
and you arrive at a solution,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.380
is it OK to give an
answer where you had unit

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.740
vectors in multiple frames?

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.520
And neither of these unit
vectors are in the base frame.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.790
And yet, the answer
we're claiming

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:34.270
is that this is the
velocity of B in O.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.130
And here we've got unit vectors
that are not in the base frame.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.825
Is it a legit equation or not?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.584
What do you think?

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.501
See a lot of no's out there.

00:32:53.547 --> 00:32:54.880
I think we better figure it out.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.530
So we have unit on the arm.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.430
This is my c and O here.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.040
On the arm, I have
frame that rotates

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.070
with it that has unit vectors in
the direction of the arm of i1

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.830
and j1.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.410
So here's i1.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.050
It's unit long.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.730
Here is the angle theta.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:06.000
Here's j1 and the angles.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.360
And I want to know-- this
is i1 and this is j1--

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.780
can I express i1 and
j1 in terms of capital

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.400
I, capital J, the unit
vectors in the base frame?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.780
I want to express them
in terms of unit vectors

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.500
that are in this rigid,
non-moving, non-rotating,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.230
inertial frame.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:39.449
So down here, this is
the i hat direction

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:45.280
and this is the j hat
direction, right-- not moving.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.139
So this is just a
unit thing, unit long.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.760
Can I project it onto its
i component and capital J

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.449
component?

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.170
All right.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:59.630
So i1, it looks to me
like cosine theta I

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:05.715
hat plus sine theta J hat.

00:35:05.715 --> 00:35:06.370
Do you agree?

00:35:10.524 --> 00:35:13.650
Just standard trick, right?

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.665
And this one, takes me a
minute to figure this out.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.200
Which is the theta here?

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.280
This is theta.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.910
That's 90 minus theta.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.195
So this must be theta, right?

00:35:30.116 --> 00:35:32.110
There's a theta here.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.430
And if this is unit
long, what's that?

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:43.350
That projection there is--
so j1 has two components,

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:54.540
minus sine theta I
plus cosine theta J.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.611
And I highly recommend
you write that one down.

00:35:57.611 --> 00:35:59.110
Make sure you can
drive it yourself.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.610
You're going to need it again
and again and again and again.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.890
Now, could we do the
same thing for-- could we

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:17.230
convert J2 to the base frame?

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.520
And it rotates, so this x2 can
be at any arbitrary position.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.360
But in order to do the problem,
you have to pick a position.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.930
And then you'd have
to do draw an angle.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.570
And then you'd have
to apply this formula.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.790
And so you're going
to end up with an i2

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:53.630
and some cosine phi capital
I plus sine phi capital

00:36:53.630 --> 00:37:04.450
J. And the same thing, j2 is
minus sine phi i plus cosine

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.280
theta J.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.870
So we'll do a trivial
example, solve a trivial case.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.540
What is the
instantaneous velocity

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.950
at the moment that the
coordinate system is lined up

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.580
as we see, and B is
sitting right here?

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:39.070
So we've got to go
look at our answer.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.300
Where was our final answer?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.075
Velocity of this
guy here, right?

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.335
What would be the
contribution of this term?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.800
We have to take each
term and convert it

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.910
to the base system and
capital IJ terms, right?

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.640
You do it one term at a time
and add up the components.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.570
So how do you break this one
down and put it into capital I,

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.484
capital J components?

00:38:14.484 --> 00:38:15.858
AUDIENCE: Substitute?

00:38:15.858 --> 00:38:17.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
what's the answer?

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.310
So j, if it's
lined up like this,

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.744
j2 is importing
in what direction?

00:38:27.744 --> 00:38:28.550
Up.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.240
And what is that in this system?

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.470
Just capital J.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.030
At this instant in
time, that's just

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:42.080
capital J. Trivial
calculation, because this angle

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.950
is 90 degrees.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.130
Plug in 90 degrees, this term
goes to 0, this term goes to 1.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.310
J2 is capital J.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:57.620
And what about the
other term, J1?

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.982
You just got to--
it's J1, right?

00:39:00.982 --> 00:39:02.440
So you just gotta
go with the flow.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.220
It is is.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.530
You'd substitute this
in for J1 right here,

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.680
and you'd have R1
omega 1 cosine theta

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.100
sine theta and j and k terms,
plus this thing, capital J.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.790
And you have just
converted the answer,

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.230
which was in terms of
unit vectors in rotating

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.530
to different rotating frames.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.730
You've converted it all
down to the base frame.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:32.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.350
PROFESSOR: Oops, I'm sorry.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.530
I just made a mistake.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.352
You guys got to get
better catching me.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.780
That now make sense?

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.710
So phi is the angle that
the j2 unit vector makes

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.190
with the inertial frame, right?

00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:00.182
And theta is the angle
that the j1 or i1

00:40:00.182 --> 00:40:01.390
make with the inertial frame.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.890
Yes?

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.150
AUDIENCE: Phi is
0, though, right?

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:12.410
PROFESSOR: In this
case, phi is 0.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.950
Does that still
work out over there?

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.812
Sine of phi is 0 and cosine
of 0 is one and you get j.

00:40:18.812 --> 00:40:23.250
AUDIENCE: Then why did we
didn't plug in anything for j?

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.340
PROFESSOR: We did.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.040
There isn't a simple
answer for it.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.070
And so you have to use
the full expression.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.810
I just got lazy and didn't
want to write it out.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.880
The answer is this.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.770
Stick in 30 degrees if you want,
and then you'll get numbers.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.150
So real important point
that we discovered

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:56.040
is that the answers are correct,
expressed in rotating unit

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.860
vectors, expressed in
different unit vectors,

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.210
different rotating ones.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.240
This is correct, because
you can take this

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.090
and you can reduce it
down to the base frame.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:12.060
So you will be-- usually in
problems that you're given,

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.290
you'll be asked to express
the answer in terms of unit

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.434
vectors in the base frame.

00:41:16.434 --> 00:41:17.850
Or you'll be told
you can leave it

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:22.300
in whatever is your comfortable
set of unit vectors.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.610
Most of the time, the
first ones you'll arrive at

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.885
are the ones in terms of the
rotating coordinates that

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:29.530
are easier to use.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.990
The more natural answer
falls out in terms of these.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.330
Good.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.560
All right, and we've got
three, four minutes left.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.730
What have I confused
you with here?

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:51.920
So key concepts--
what have we-- what

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.820
hasn't been clear or
maybe we didn't cover it

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.502
yet-- another point.

00:41:58.502 --> 00:42:00.090
AUDIENCE: So the
reason we chose those

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.462
as the starting reference frames
instead of I hats and theta

00:42:04.462 --> 00:42:05.127
hats?

00:42:05.127 --> 00:42:07.210
PROFESSOR: Only because
at the beginning of class,

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.410
we talked about it-- which
frames do we want to use,

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:11.290
and then we chose those.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:15.630
Could we have used a
polar coordinate system

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.390
to do this problem?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.790
Sure.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:23.705
Twice You do it once in each--

00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:25.425
AUDIENCE: Is there
a way to know up

00:42:25.425 --> 00:42:32.855
front which one would simplify
down to the inertial i hats

00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:34.316
and j hats more simply?

00:42:34.316 --> 00:42:35.795
PROFESSOR: The easiest way?

00:42:35.795 --> 00:42:37.261
Is there a way to know upfront?

00:42:37.261 --> 00:42:37.760
No.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.850
That's just experience.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:43.790
Work lots of problems, and
you get good at picking frame.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.945
We can probably, with
time as we meet and talk

00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:47.320
about these things,
we'll come up

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.330
with some sort of general
insights about how to do that.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.325
Yes?

00:42:52.325 --> 00:42:54.750
AUDIENCE: Is this
picture up in parentheses

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.145
supposed to be those
coordinate systems?

00:42:58.145 --> 00:43:01.990
PROFESSOR: This picture
is the coordinate system

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.110
of that first arm.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.860
AUDIENCE: OK, so is that
supposed to be phi up there?

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.623
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.640
Wait a minute.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.490
No.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.050
This is the first arm.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.750
That is theta and
these are ones, right?

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.705
The 2 system would be phis

00:43:22.705 --> 00:43:23.463
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:23.463 --> 00:43:26.004
I was just wondering if that
was the ride or if that was not.

00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:26.920
PROFESSOR: No.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.711
This is point A, if you will.

00:43:31.711 --> 00:43:32.460
Well, it could be.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.050
It's lined up with
point A. This is A.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.050
AUDIENCE: Because I thought
we decided that the phi was--

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.800
PROFESSOR: This
is point A, right?

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.590
That is point A.
And this is arm CA.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:48.852
AUDIENCE: So is this one
here the origin of this one?

00:43:48.852 --> 00:43:51.540
PROFESSOR: Well, look at
whatever the unit vector is.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:56.200
The unit vector in this system
is lined up with that arm.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.300
So this is just a breakdown
of these unit vectors

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.110
so I could draw the
angles and figure out

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.570
the sines and cosines.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:07.730
You could draw a similar
picture for i2 j2's.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.600
And then it would be phi's.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.110
Good question.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.610
Yes?

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.150
AUDIENCE: So, since
you can choose

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.010
between Cartesian and
polar coordinates,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.400
could you set one in
Cartesian, one in polar,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.350
you can mix and match it
or-- is that beneficial

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:26.835
in some problems?

00:44:26.835 --> 00:44:34.450
PROFESSOR: Polar is-- I don't
have time to show you today.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:39.680
But for planar motion
problems, which

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.170
are things confined to a plane,
they rotate, axis of rotation's

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.770
always in the k direction, which
is all the problems that you

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.115
ever did in 801 Physics.

00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:50.990
You didn't do general
things actually.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.340
But for planar motion problems,
cylindrical coordinates,

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.250
actually, you still need the
k to describe the rotation,

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.300
right?

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.150
Polar coordinates,
cylindrical coordinates

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.480
are oftentimes
really convenient.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.290
And they're easy to use
because you've learned them

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.450
a long, long time ago.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.890
And you know the relations.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:17.439
But you can make it a rotating
x1, y1, z1 rotating system

00:45:17.439 --> 00:45:18.480
and it will all work out.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.440
We came up with this
little formula here, right?

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.565
This could just as
easily have been r hat.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:35.600
And this could have just as
easily been no difference

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.860
whatsoever in a planar
motion problem, when

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.190
you attach an xy system
that rotates with it,

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.970
or I call it r and theta.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.430
These are the same direction.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:46.820
R is in the direction of i1.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.390
Theta is in the direction of j1.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.540
So use it when it's
convenient, and it's convenient

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.620
a lot of times, especially that
nasty acceleration formula.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.570
In polar coordinates,
it reduces down just

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.620
to the set of five terms.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.330
Memorize it and just tick them
off-- Coriolis, centripetal.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.440
You see them right away.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.570
You know what they are.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:13.180
But there are certain problems,
even in planar motion problems

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.610
that polar coordinates don't
work for-- doesn't work for.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.110
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.810
And think about that.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.280
It's actually a simple problem.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.640
Put a dog on a marry-go-round.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.420
The dog's running in
a random direction

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.372
on the merry-go-round.

00:46:27.372 --> 00:46:29.330
And the merry-go-round
is turning at some rate.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.460
And you only want one rotating
coordinate system, r and theta.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.090
You can't do the problem
with polar coordinates.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:35.930
Think about it.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.560
Go away, think about why not.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.410
I'll tell you the
answer in words.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.320
You go figure it out.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.080
You can't describe the
velocity of the dog

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.203
in polar coordinates.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.660
The dog is running around.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.930
If the dog's fixed on the
rotating thing, than polar

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:55.650
coordinates work.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.691
If the dog's running, you
can't do that velocity.

00:46:57.691 --> 00:47:02.155
So you need a more
sophisticated coordinate system.
