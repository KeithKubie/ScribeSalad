00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.890
The only regression coefficient that's significant is for religiosity.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.405
Therefore, that's the only one that we can conclude has a relationship with

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:14.420
days of alcohol use. In this case, we would reject the null, but since the

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.420
regression coefficient for self-esteem is not significant, we would fail to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.280
reject the null. And there is no evidence that there is a relationship between

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.100
self esteem and alcohol use.
