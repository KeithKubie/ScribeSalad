00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.900
 Let's get some rational numbers. 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.460
 I use this word because it is used in this book, 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.480
 but in the more popular terminology we will "collect fractions". 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.090
 Let's go through all these, 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.080
 just to see all the examples. 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.660
 First we will have 3/7 + 2/7. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.700
 Denominators are the same, 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.070
 so we can just collect the numerators. 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
 Our denominator is 7, and 3 plus 2 is 5. 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 This is an example 'a'. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.220
 Let me decide on one. 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 It will take an eternity to solve all. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 Not for eternity, but more than I want. 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.860
 Example 'c' is 5/16 + 5/12. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.900
 Our denominators are not the same. 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.700
 We will have to find a common denominator that should be 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.320
 at least in general - in fact, it may be every common fold 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.040
 to these, but to make it easier to find 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.770
 at least in total. 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.150
 Which is the smallest number that is multiple 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.215
 and at 16, and at 21? 

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.700
 Let's see, 16 in 2 is 32, we have not found it yet. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.640
 Three is 48. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.800
 This seems to work. 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 12 enters 4 times at 48. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.700
 Let us use 48 as a common denominator. 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.000
 We had to multiply by 16 to 3 to get 48, 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 so we'll have to multiply this by 5. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.660
 We just multiply the numerator and the denominator 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.480
 on the same number, do not change the value of the liver. 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.360
 5 by 3 is equal to 15. 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.240
 And then, to get from 12 to 48 here, 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.880
 we have multiplied by 4. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660
 Then, to get from 5 to this numerator here, 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.120
 we need to multiply again by 4. 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690
 5 in 4 is 20. 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.980
 Now we have the same denominator. 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.180
 This will be equal to - our denominator is 48. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.080
 And then we can get 15 plus 20, which is 35. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.660
 And can we shorten this? 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 Let's see, 5 does not divide 48. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.620
 7 does not divide 48. 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.330
 We seem ready. 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.940
 Let's solve the example 'e'. 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.790
 8/25 + 7/10. 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.570
 Again, we do not have a common denominator. 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.850
 But we can solve this. 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.240
 Let's see, 50 is the smallest number, 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.040
 which is a multiple of both. 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.340
 25 by 2, it's 50. 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
 8/20 to get to 50, multiply by 2. 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.990
 We will have to multiply by 8 as well. 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.640
 That would be 16/50. 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.920
 And then 7/10, we want 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 to put it on 50. 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.500
 We multiply 10 by 5, so 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.900
 we have to multiply by 7 by 5. 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.720
 This will be 35/50. 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.560
 Now the denominators are the same, they are 50. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.550
 How many is 16 plus 35? 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.690
 10 plus 35 is 45, plus 6, is 51. 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
 This is 51/50. 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.992
 Example 'g'. 

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:19.700
 Let me do it in another color. 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.410
 Example 'g'. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.470
 Here we have 7/15 - I will write this second 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.440
 in a different color - plus 2/9. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 Again, the denominators are different. 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.490
 We find a common denominator. 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.540
 What is the smallest number, which is a multiple of 15 and of 9? 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 Let's see, 15 by 2 is 30. 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.940
 No, do not divide at 9. 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.670
 15 by 3 is 45, this works. 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.220
 45 is divided into 9. 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.590
 So we'll use 45. 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.810
 15 in 3 is 45 and 7 in 3 is 21. 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.850
 These two fractions are equivalent. 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.680
 Plus - we'll have 45. 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 To get from 9 to 45, we need to multiply by 5. 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.380
 So to get our numerator here, 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.980
 we have to multiply by 5. 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.420
 2 in 5 is 10. 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.422
 2/9 is the same as 10/25. 

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.710
 Now we can collect them. 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.130
 We collect fractions with a denominator 45. 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.130
 21 plus 10 is 31, and we're ready. 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.900
 Let's do another task, a text task. 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.344
 "Nadia, Peter and Ian collect their money, 

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:41.640
 to buy one gallon of ice cream. 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.630
 Nadya is the largest and gets the most pocket. 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.120
 It contributes 1/2 of the amount. " 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.440
 That is Nadia contributes 1/2 of the amount. 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.750
 This is Nadia here. 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.850
 "Ian is next by age and contributes 1/3 of the amount." 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.280
 Ian contributes 1/3. 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.820
 This is Ian. 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.360
 "Peter, the youngest, gets the least pocket and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.880
 contributes 1/4 of the amount. " 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.280
 That is, Peter gives 1/4 of the sum, 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.560
 Peter contributes 1/4 of the amount. 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.920
 "They calculated that this would be enough money. 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.340
 When they reached the cash desk, they realized they had forgotten about VAT 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.440
 and worried that there would not be enough money. 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.370
 For amazement, they had the right amount of money. 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.460
 How much of the price of ice cream has been added as a tax? " 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.732
 Let's see if we collect 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 of the sum, 

00:05:35.732 --> 00:05:37.640
 let's see how much we get. 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 We need to find a common denominator, 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.240
 that is to say, at least a total of a multiple of 2, 3 and 4. 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.970
 Let's see ... it will have to be 12. 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.940
 12 is a multiple of 2, multiple is 3 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.400
 and is a multiple of 4. 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.480
 That is 1/2 is the same as 6/12. 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.750
 2 by 6 is 12. 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.420
 1 in 6 is 6. 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.240
 These are equivalent. 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.720
 6 is 1/2 out of 12. 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.240
 1/3, if we use 12 as a common denominator, 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.560
 to get from 3 to 12, we must multiply by 4. 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.190
 You take this 4 and multiply it by 1. 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.620
 4/12 is the same as 1/3. 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.880
 And then 1/4, if you use denominator 12, 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.100
 to get from 4 to 12, you must multiply by 3, 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.620
 so we multiply the numerator by 3 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.080
 and we get 3. 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.360
 Let's get them together. 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.660
 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 will be equal to - 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.720
 our denominator will be 12, and the numerator is 6 + 4 + 3, 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.560
 which is equal to - 6 plus 4 is 10, plus 3, is 13. 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.980
 This will be equal to 13/12. 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.000
 And this is an irregular liver. 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.950
 Or we can say it's the same thing - it's equal 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:02.880
 on 12/12 + 1/12, or we can say it's the same thing as - 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.420
 12/12 is just 1. 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.770
 12, divided by 12, is 1. 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.050
 This is 1 whole and 1/12. 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.820
 When they collected their money, 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.920
 they received 1 whole and 1/12 of the price of ice cream, 

00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:19.180
 who they wanted to buy. 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.240
 And they ask: 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.360
 "what part of the price of ice cream has been added as a tax?" 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.620
 This is the exact amount they had to pay. 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.740
 So, obviously, 1 is the price of ice cream without tax, 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.760
 that is 1/12 is the amount added as a tax. 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.740
 The answer to the question is 1/12 of the price 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.290
 has been added as a tax.
