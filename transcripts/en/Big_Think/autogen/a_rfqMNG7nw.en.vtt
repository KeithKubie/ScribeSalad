through it I think there's also a risk

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639
through it I think there's also a risk
 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.970
through it I think there's also a risk
of and we're seeing this fiercely a risk

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
of and we're seeing this fiercely a risk
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.180
of and we're seeing this fiercely a risk
of real income disparity and I think we

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190
of real income disparity and I think we
 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.319
of real income disparity and I think we
have reached a dangerous place in the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329
have reached a dangerous place in the
 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.259
have reached a dangerous place in the

I think a rather growing disconnection

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889
I think a rather growing disconnection
 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.479
I think a rather growing disconnection
between the rewards available to the top

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
between the rewards available to the top
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.180
