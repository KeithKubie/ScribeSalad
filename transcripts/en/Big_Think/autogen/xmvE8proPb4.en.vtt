it's a bit more complicated but they're

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570
it's a bit more complicated but they're
 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.840
it's a bit more complicated but they're

the answer is no the brain seems to have

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
the answer is no the brain seems to have
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.050
the answer is no the brain seems to have
fundamentally different ways of telling

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060

time so the first thing to notice is

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830
time so the first thing to notice is
 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.350
time so the first thing to notice is
that while the mechanical clocks that we

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360
that while the mechanical clocks that we
 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.179
that while the mechanical clocks that we
make even your quartz watch can tell

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189
make even your quartz watch can tell
 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.999

minutes and days and months and years so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850
minutes and days and months and years so
 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.800
minutes and days and months and years so
the brain has many different clocks in

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810
the brain has many different clocks in
 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.279

order to tell the
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500
order to tell the
milliseconds and seconds and to tell the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
milliseconds and seconds and to tell the
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910
milliseconds and seconds and to tell the
time of days so one way to think about

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
time of days so one way to think about
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980
neural dynamics and changing patterns of
 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.640
neural dynamics and changing patterns of
neural activity neuron a activates

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650
neural activity neuron a activates
 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.530
neural activity neuron a activates
neuron B or checked-in rates neuron C

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
neuron B or checked-in rates neuron C
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.810
neuron B or checked-in rates neuron C
and you have these complex evolving

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
and you have these complex evolving
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.990
and you have these complex evolving
patterns so this is consistent with what

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
patterns so this is consistent with what
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.259
patterns so this is consistent with what
we call the multiple clock principle

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269
we call the multiple clock principle
 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.880
we call the multiple clock principle
which is the brain doesn't have any

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890
which is the brain doesn't have any
 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.979
which is the brain doesn't have any
master clock it has many different

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989
master clock it has many different
 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.559
master clock it has many different
circuits each specialized or that

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569
circuits each specialized or that
 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.070
circuits each specialized or that
that focuses on processing time on one

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
that focuses on processing time on one
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.910
that focuses on processing time on one
scale or another

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920
scale or another
 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.170
