00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:08.540
- [Moshe] Hey this
is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.209
- [Natasha] And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.911
- [Moshe] We just got
married six months ago.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.780 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Natasha] Which, we think
pretty much makes us qualified

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
to give love advice
to strangers.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe] So,
that's what we did.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.453 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
We packed up the car, hit
the road and spread the love.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.523 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- [Natasha And Moshe] This
is The Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.026 line:0%
(light upbeat music)

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.728 line:0%
- Is there something that
you would like to discuss

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.964 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
with the group that
you would like to maybe

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:35.235 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
address in your
relationship with Josh?

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.203
- Butt stuff.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.572
(audience laughs)

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:43.076
- You want it, or he wants it?

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.646
- Umm.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.248
- I mean, if you want it,
he will be the luckiest man

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:52.418 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the world because
I've never heard of that.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.586
- I wanna give it.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.088
- You wanna give--

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.256
- You wanna give it?

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.992
Oh, okay, that's so weird that--

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.660
- [Natasha] Josh,
you're so lucky!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.464 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's so weird that Josh
didn't want to come up.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.132
How weird, so weird.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.268
He's like, "I know exactly
what you're gonna bring up,

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.736
"you're going to bring up
the fucking thing again.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.105
"I'm not getting pegged,

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.639
"I'm not interested
in getting pegged,

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:14.940
"if you want that you find
another guy, I've told you

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
"many, many times I'm
not interested in that."

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.914 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Aww, that's so cool
that she wants to do that.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:22.915
Wait--

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.651
- I don't think it's cool.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.287
(audience laughs)

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.621
No, are you into it?

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.456
- No.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.459
- Well he's not into it.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Wait, but hold on, what
sparked your interest

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.261
in the inspiration cause
this is clearly something

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start size:84% position:16%
you've brought up with
him more than once?

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.199
- I don't know, why not?

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.301
- Well, I would say your
partner not consenting

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.770
is a good reason.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.339
- You know what today is?

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.007
- Uh, hump day?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.476
(laughter)

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.545
Why do people still say that?

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.780
- It's our eight
month anniversary.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.982
- Hump day!

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:56.849
- No, today--

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:57.817
- No, that's hump day.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.218
- No, it's hump night cause

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.120 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's our eight month
anniversary, we need to hump.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.655
(laughs)

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.890
- Okay, that's cool,
our wedding was fun.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.325
- It was the best.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.561 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was the first non-boring
wedding I've been to.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.897 align:start size:97% position:3%
Except for the wedding of
all of my friends and family.

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.466
- Wish we could do it again.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.568
- We can do it again, we're
going to Las Vegas tomorrow.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.903
We could straight up
do a wedding there.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:19.505
- You wanna renew our vows?

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.507
- I guess we would have
to renew our vows, yeah.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.709
- Would you really do that?

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.144 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Why not, I think
that'd be fun.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:29.315
We renew our vows and we can
go out on the town in Vegas!

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.251
- [Natasha And Moshe] Baby!

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.354 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Natasha And
Moshe] Vegas, baby!

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.057
- And then be like
schwing, you know?

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.091
- What is it about it?

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.225
Is it, what is it?

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:41.527
Is it the psychological dynamic?

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:42.728
Is it, what's the--

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:45.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Something about
getting there, just--

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:48.568
- It feels dominating from a
woman and that, maybe it's an

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:52.538 align:start position:0%
ignorant part of my like little
like pathetic male brain,

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.208 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I don't like the
psychological dynamics of it.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.409
It feels like--

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.843
- I'm getting emasculated.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.078
- I'm getting bent
over and fucked.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.546
- You know what I'm saying?

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.348
I just, there's
a thin, but I'm--

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.515
- That's for women.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.552
(audience laughs)

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.220
Yeah you little bitch!

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.422
Yeah you little bitch!

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.457
You deserve that
you little bitch!

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.126
(audience laughs)

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.594 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh man, I haven't
thought about

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:17.296
our wedding night
in a long time.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.433
(audience laughs)

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.702
- Alright, let's go
renew our vows then.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:23.903
- You sure you want
to renew your vows

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.538
with someday that
goes "schwing"?

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:29.208
- Well, we never even had
vows so there's low risk.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.744
- Oh, so who should we
have do the ceremony?

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh like a Liberace
impersonator?

00:03:35.747 --> 00:03:37.616
- That's funny, I bet
a Liberace impersonator

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:40.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
hasn't gotten a
call in a long time.

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.387
- What about uh--

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.956
- What about Elvis?

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.124
No that seems cliche.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.059
- What about Carrot
Top impersonator?

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.328
- A Carrot Top impersonator?

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:51.330
Why not just Carrot Top?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.931
- I mean, that's a good point.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So what if she just, what
if he just lets her do it once

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.436
and then if he doesn't like it

00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:00.306
they never talk about it again.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.608
Would you be happy
with that Christine?

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:04.510
- Yeah, that's fine.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.113
- That's cool. What if he
was into say, like, um--

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.315
- I don't wanna fuck him
I just wanna finger him.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.517
- Oh, all you want to do
is put a finger in there?

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:12.785
Josh, man up dude.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.622
(audience laughs)

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.691
I mean, come on.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
- First of all you
should clip your nails.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:26.098
I mean, that's like
the number one thing.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.534
I wouldn't want that up my ass.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.968
Those are long!

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
How about she cuts her
nails, he lets her do it once

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start size:94% position:6%
all the way, and then
never talk about it again

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.875
if you don't like it.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.811
- What do you mean all the way?

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.979
All the elbow.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.483
What's a thing that you
want in the relationship

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:46.519
that you wish was different.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.153
- I don't know.

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.622
- Nothing she does bothers you?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.525 align:start position:0%
Except for try to sexually
assault you every single night?

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.328
- No, we've got an agreement.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.997
Keep the Kardashians out of
the house and we're good.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.333
- Oh so she can't watch
reality TV type of stuff?

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.736
So if she's giving you
that, give her one pinky.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.871
Okay, how about one knuckle?

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.673
Yeah, he says I'm right.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.142
Alright, well we just,

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.177
I don't know if I feel
good about this, but we--

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:12.512
- Pinky tonight!

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.014
- Pinky tonight!

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:15.914
- Room 207!

00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:17.016
- [Moshe] Give it up for them!

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.685
- We'll see you there.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:19.685
That was good.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:21.420
- That was really good.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.688
- That was a great show tonight.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.589
- Oh, the show, yeah
that was good too.

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:25.825
- Yeah, no I feel like we really

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.160
help people with
the love advice.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
- For sure, especially
that one couple.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:30.829
- Oh, the butt couple?

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.198
- Yeah I really feel
like we opened them up.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.032
- I agree.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.534
Alright, goodnight.

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:37.002
- Goodnight babe.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.205
- [Natasha and Moshe] Goodnight!

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.941
- [Christina And
Josh] Goodnight!
