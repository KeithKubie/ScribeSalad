00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.500
NARRATOR: The Hindu god Vishnu
is the protector of creation,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
and Angkor Wat
was built for him.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.233
Inside the temple
are over 12,000

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:15.000
square feet of intricately
carved reliefs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.767
One relief was created
to link King Suryavarman

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.266
II to Vishnu himself.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.900
Look, you can
see that by relief,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.166
the king who built this temple.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.100
And if you look
closely over there,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.800
there is an inscription saying,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.433
[non-english speech]

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:41.200
Meaning that he is
the king who went

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.233
to the highest world of Vishnu.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.166
NARRATOR: Archaeologists
aren't sure whether the king

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.400
is buried here.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.100
But local people believe
that his spirit resides

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.800
here in Vishnu's paradise.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.433
That paradise, that
heaven, lies at the top

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:05.333
of the central tower.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.767
DAVID: So they believed
that Suryavarman

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.433
II's spirit would inhabit
these towers in the afterlife.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:13.767
Exactly.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:16.800
If you look at the steps,
like the wide of the step,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.633
why it's too narrow?

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:24.433
It can be implied, the ideas
of that approaching the worlds

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.967
of God is not that easy.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.667
All right.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.867
Well, let's not wait
a moment longer.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:32.667
Let's go up.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:33.367
Please, go.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.200
NARRATOR: The peak of the
temple was believed by the Khmer

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.200
to be the highest reaches of
heaven and the realm of Vishnu

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.900
himself.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.400
David, what do you think?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.367
I think that everyone is
impressed by your ancestors.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:13.900
This is phenomenal.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.800
Perhaps they were
building such immaculate,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.633
beautiful structures to
entice the gods to inhabit

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:24.133
the structures so that
the priests, the king

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:28.367
would have had this opportunity
to have a direct connection

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.600
with the supernatural.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.667
That's true.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.033
Even if you're not
a spiritual person,

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.867
you can feel the aura
of this kind of place.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:39.967
We really are at
heaven on earth.

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.166
Mm-hmm.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.967
