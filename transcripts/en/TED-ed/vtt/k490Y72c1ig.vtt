00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:15.697
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:17.325
Window,

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:21.558
an opening constructed in a wall to emit light or air.

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:24.174
When the Scandinavian settlers invaded England

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:25.686
in the Middle Ages,

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:27.755
they brought with them a whole slew of words

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:30.216
whose modern descendants have become part

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:32.754
of our everyday vernacular.

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:35.780
Their word for window was related to the Old Norse word

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.266
for the same architectural feature,

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.058
vindauga.

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:42.061
Vindauga was a compound,

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.659
composed of two separate words:

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.409
vindr, meaning wind

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.658
and auga, meaning eye.

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.408
The word vindauga was probably quite old,

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.652
having come into being long before

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:57.916
windows were made of glass.

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.238
This type of metaphoric compound,

00:01:00.238 --> 00:01:01.623
called a kenning,

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:05.587
was very popular in both Norse and Old English.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.016
The beautiful literary trope was used

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:10.202
in the Norse word for ship,

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:13.384
literally "wave stead."

00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:15.844
And, in the epic poem, "Beowulf,"

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:19.369
where the sea is described as a whale road

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.067
and blood is described as battle sweat

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:24.111
and slaughter dew.

00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:26.669
From its literal yet lyrical beginning,

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.574
the word window has expanded

00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:30.700
beyond its concrete definition

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.083
as a construction or design element

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:35.113
to be used figuratively

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.227
in phrases like the poetic

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:39.833
"window of opportunity."
