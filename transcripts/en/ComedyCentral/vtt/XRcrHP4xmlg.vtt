YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE TIMES ON
THIS PROGRAM WE'RE ALWAYS

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.341
TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS
IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.110
BUT OUR SOCIETY HAS MUCH TO
CELEBRATE!

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.412
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
DAD BODS.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:17.317
&gt;&gt; GUYS WHO LOOK LIKE THEY GO TO
THE GYM BUT THEY ALSO MAYBE

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.619
ENJOY A LITTLE PIZZA,
A LITTLE BEER.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.121
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH AND I FIND IT
REALLY ATTRACTIVE.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.189
&gt;&gt; LEONARDO DICAPRIO, JASON
SEGEL AND SETH ROGEN HAVE ALL

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.926
BEEN CALLED DAD BODS.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.194
&gt;&gt; UNDEFINED ABS AND MAYBE EVEN
A LITTLE BIT OF FLAB

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.328
ARE ACTUALLY IN.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:32.332
&gt;&gt; WOMEN ADMITTING
NORMAL-LOOKING GUYS ARE THE SEXY

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:32.733
ONES.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.901
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH!

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.202
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY
THIS YEAR FOR DUDES!

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.804
CAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK
THERE'S JOLLY FAT MEN.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:44.311

DRIVING WOMEN'S CRAZY,

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.213
WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR WOMEN'S
ISSUES CORRESPONDENT,

AND WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR MEN!

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.522
IT'S TIME SOCIETY FINALLY
ACCEPTED THAT A MAN'S BODY

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.425
CHANGES WHEN HE HAS KIDS!

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.828
HE SPENDS NINE MONTHS EATING TOO
MUCH BECAUSE HIS PREGNANT WIFE

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:05.599
IS STRESSING HIM OUT AND THEN
THERE'S A SCREAMING BABY AT

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.803
HOME, HE'S GOT TO GET OUT FOR
PIZZA AND BEER AS MUCH AS HE

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.370
CAN.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.872
IT'S JUST BIOLOGY, JON.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.240
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
THOSE GUYS WE JUST HEARD ABOUT

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.342
THEY'RE NOT EVEN DADS.

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.812
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A DAD TO
HAVE A DAD BOD, YOU JUST HAVE TO

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.013
BE REALLY LAZY.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:25.419
AND WOMEN ARE LINING UP AT THE
DAD BOD BUFFET WHICH IS GREAT

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:29.389

BORDER LINE BETWEEN WHERE

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.869
THE CHEST ENDS AND THE FUN
BEGINS?

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.339
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST FORGET

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.274

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.552
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY. THERE WE GO.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.707
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW WHO REALLY

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.942
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO?

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.846
&gt;&gt; GUYS LIKE YOU WHO GET MOST OF
THEIR EXERCISE BY TURNING FROM

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.815
CAMERA ONE TO CAMERA THREE.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:29.783
&gt;&gt; AS A 40-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD
DAD I FIND THIS NOTION

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.219
PROFOUNDLY REASSURING.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.487
&gt;&gt; SHOW US YOUR DAD BODY.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.222
&gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.456
&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA GO AND GET A BEER
AND PIZZA AFTER THE SHOW.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:36.857
&gt;&gt; I THINK WOMEN THINK YOU'RE
SORT OF NUTS IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:39.726
THIS SIX PACK.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.161
&gt;&gt; I'M IN A DAD BOD SANDWICH

GOOD BELLY LAUGH --
WELL, THE GUYS ARE.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.936
IF THAT WOMAN HAD A BELLY AT
ALL, THEY WOULD NOT LET HER ON

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:50.871
THAT SHOW.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.373
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
KRISTEN, I MEAN,

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.742
(APPLAUSE)
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:59.046
MAYBE DAD BOD, DAD BOD IS JUST
THE BEGINNING AND IT OPENS THE

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.348
DOOR TO CELEBRATING THE MOM BOD.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.517
&gt;&gt; OH, SWEET, SWEET JON...

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:07.554
WE'RE ALREADY OBSESSED WITH MOM
BODS, OR AT LEAST HOW FAST MOMS

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.256
CAN GET RID OF THEM.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:12.325
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NEW BREED OF MOM ON
THE PLAYGROUND, DUBBED MOM

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:16.630
SHELLS, A HYBRID OF MOMMIES AND
BOMB SHELLS.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.532
&gt;&gt; THAT'S 11 MONTHS AFTER GIVING
BIRTH.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.299
&gt;&gt; SHE LOOKS AMAZING.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.367
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD A BABY SEVEN MONTHS
AGO.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.669
&gt;&gt; SHE HAS A FIVE-MONTH-OLD.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.939
&gt;&gt; THREE MONTHS AFTER HAVING
BABY.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.841
&gt;&gt; LOOKING IMPRESSIVELY SVELTE.
&gt;&gt; PERFECT.

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.076
&gt;&gt; AMAZING.
&gt;&gt; INCREDIBLE.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.110
&gt;&gt; JUST WEEKS AFTER GIVING
BIRTH --

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.111
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT FIGURE TOO.
SHE'S JUST HAD A BABY!

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.046
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT REAL PEOPLE,
THEY'RE CELEBRITIES.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.850
BEYONCE, SCARLETT JOHANSSON, 
J. LO, MICHELLE DUGGAR.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.852
&gt;&gt; Jon: MICHELLE DUGGAR?

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:43.757
FROM THE REALITY SHOW WITH THE
19 KIDS?

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:44.858
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT'S HOW HOT SHE
IS.

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:47.527
HER HUSBAND IS NEVER NOT
(BLEEP) HER.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:52.032
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE HAS TO HIDE
HER BODY UNDER THAT SISTER

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.366
WIFE DRESS TO STOP TEMPTING
THE REST OF US!

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.868
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY IS THERE SO MUCH
PRESSURE, THOUGH, ON WOMEN TO BE

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.537
SKINNY? YOU KNOW IT HASN'T
ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:02.075
LOOK A AT THE RUBENESQUE WOMEN
IN THOSE OLDER PAINTINGS BY --

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.044
&gt;&gt; OH RIGHT, PICASSO?

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:07.948
TALK ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE BODY
STANDARDS, I SPENT YEARS TRYING

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:11.151
TO GET MY NOSE ON THE SIDE OF MY
FACE.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:12.886
ADMIT IT, JON, WOMEN WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO RELAX ABOUT

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:17.090
THEIR BODIES THE WAY THAT MEN
CAN.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.361
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
BECAUSE IT FEELS GREAT TO

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.896
BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, TO NOT
THINK ABOUT IT, THE OLD, 

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.765
FEEL GOOD IN THE OLD DAD BOD OF
MINE.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.869
&gt;&gt; YOU EARNED IT, DADDYO, ALL
THAT NOT WORKING OUT, FOCUSING

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.003
ON OTHER THINGS BESIDE YOUR
BODY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.439
DON'T YOU STAND UP AND GIVE
THE AUDIENCE A LITTLE TREAT?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:40.547
SHOW THEM WHAT
A MOSTLY ADEQUATE PHYSIQUE LOOKS

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:41.281
LIKE.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:47.454
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; YEAH!

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.256
COME ON! YEAH!

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:53.026
GIVE THEM A TWIRL.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.995
WORK WHAT YOUR MAMA GAVE YOU
THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF FOR

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.196
50 YEARS!

00:04:56.196 --> 00:05:01.268
I DON'T HAVE TO ASK IF FRIES
GO WITH THAT SHAKE BECAUSE THEY

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.536
OBVIOUSLY DID.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:08.074
SHOW OFF HOW YOUR LOOKS ARE NOT
WHAT SOCIETY VALUES MOST IN YOU!

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.775
AH! LOOKING GOOD.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.810

&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE YOU GO!

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:11.945
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M STARTING TO FEEL
IT!

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.980
&gt;&gt; THERE IT IS.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.748
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, YEAH. I'M STARTING
TO FEEL IT.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.449
&gt;&gt; YEAH. KEEP POSING, KEEP
POSING.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.488
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M STARTING TO FEEL
IT NOW, UH-HUH, OH, YEAH!
