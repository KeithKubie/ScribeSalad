00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
 

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.970
Now that we have hopefully a
decent understanding of the

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.280
squeeze theorem, we'll use that
to prove that the limit-- I'll

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.190
do it in yellow-- the limit as
x approaches 0 of sine of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.280
x over x is equal to 1.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.090
And you must be bubbling over
with anticipation now, because

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.535
I've said this so many times.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.410
So let's do it, and actually,
we have to go with-- obviously,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.220
they got our trigonometry-- and
it's actually a visual proof.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.640
So let me draw at least the
first and fourth quadrants

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.440
of the unit circle.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.870
I'll do that in magenta.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.420
Let's see, let me see
if I can-- I should

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.220
draw it pretty big.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.840
Let me see.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.795
I should draw it
like quite big.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.240
So I'll draw it like that.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.570
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.780
That's close enough.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.030
And then let me draw the axis.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.920
So this is the x-axis, would
look something like that.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.660
Sorry, that's the y-axis.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.180
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.100
There you go.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.790
And then the x-axis,
something like that.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.030
That's our unit circle.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.810
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.220
There you go.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.690
Now let me draw a couple
of other things.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.170
Let me draw a-- well, it is
a radius, but I'm going to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.580
go beyond the unit circle.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.850
 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.970
So let's go like right there.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.690
Draw a couple of more things,
just to set up this problem.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.650
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.180
I wanted to do it right
from this point.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.340
Right like that.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.260
And then right from this
point, I want to do this.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.720
 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.560
And then I want to draw another
right from that point.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm going to do that.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.250
And now we are ready to go.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.640
So what did I say?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.860
This is the unit circle, right?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.570
So if that's the unit
circle, what does it mean?

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.780
It's a circle with
a radius of 1.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.540
So the distance from
here to here is 1.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.040
And now if this is an angle x
in radians, what's the length

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.260
of this line right here?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.310
What's the length of that line?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.430
Well, by definition, sine
of x is defined to be the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.830
y-coordinate of any point
on the unit circle.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.070
So this is sine of x.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.270
 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.300
I'm going to run out of space,
so let me draw an arrow.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320
So this is-- that right
there is sine of x.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.300
 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.270
Now let me ask you a
slightly harder one.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.870
What's this length right here?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.370
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.970
Well, let's think about it.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.880
What is tangent?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.370
Let's go back to our SOHCAHTOA
definition of tangent.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.720
TOA.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.380
Tangent is equal to TOA:
opposite over adjacent.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.910
So what is a tangent of x?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.460
 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.630
Well, it would be equal to-- we
could take this-- if we say

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.450
that this is the right
triangle, it would be this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.110
length-- the opposite--
over the adjacent, right?

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.440
So let's call this length
over here, let's call

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.380
this o for opposite.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.620
But what's the adjacent length?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.600
What's this base of
this larger triangle?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.050
Well, it's the unit
circle, right?

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.660
So the distance from here
to here-- that distance is

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.830
also going to be 1, right?

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.070
Because it's just
a radius again.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.400
That's 1.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.980
So opposite over adjacent is
equal to the tangent of x.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.350
But opposite over adjacent--
adjacent is just 1, right?

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.280
So the opposite side, this side
right here, it's going to be

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.655
equal to the tangent of x.

00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:00.312
Or another way of saying it,
tangent of x is equal to this

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:02.930
side over 1, or tangent of
x is equal to this side.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.700
So let me write that down.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.080
That side is equal to
the tangent of x.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.840
 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.770
Now, let's think about the area
of a couple of parts of this

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.730
figure that I've drawn here.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.580
Maybe I should have drawn it
a little bigger, but I think

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.560
we'll be able to do it.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.210
So first let me pick a
relatively small triangle.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.580
So let's do this
triangle right here.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.870
I'll trace it in green.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.250
So this triangle that I'm
tracing in green-- what is

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.730
the area of that triangle?

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.910
Well, that's going to be 1/2
times base times height.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:49.850
So it's 1/2 times the
base, which is 1.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.110
Right?

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.600
It's this whole triangle.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.240
And then what's
the height of it?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.740
Well, we just figured out that
this height right here, that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.690
this height is sine of x.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.780
Times sine of x.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.880
 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.650
So that's this green
triangle here, right?

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.040
Now, what is the area of--
not that green triangle.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.180
Let me do it in another color.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.480
Let me do it in-- oh,
I'll do it in red.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.540
What is the area of this pi?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.470
This pi right here.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.270
That pi.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.620
Hope you see-- well, that's
not a different enough color.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.440
So, this pi right here.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.330
Or I'm going there.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.050
And then I'm going on the arc.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.630
So it's a little bit bigger
than the triangle we

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.640
just figured out, right?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.130
It's always going to be a
little bit bigger, because it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.220
includes this area between that
triangle and the arc, right?

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.890
What is the area of that arc?

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.600
 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:54.500
Well, if this angle is x-- it's
x radians-- what fraction

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.660
of that is out of the
entire unit circle?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.920
Well, there are 2 pi radians in
a total unit circle, right?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.220
So this area right here is
going to be equal to what?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.690
It's going to be equal to the
fraction x is of the total

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.270
radians in the unit
circle, right?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.060
So it's x radians over
2 pi radians in the

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.450
entire unit circle.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.135
So that's kind of the fraction
that this is of-- you know, if

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:23.770
you did it in degrees-- the
fraction that this is over 360

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.350
degrees, times the area of
the whole circle, right?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.490
This tells us what fraction we
are of the circle, and we're

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.280
going to want to multiply that
times the area of

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.350
the whole circle.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.450
Well, what's the area
of the whole circle?

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.660
Well, area is pi r squared,
the radius is 1, right?

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.100
So the area of the entire
circle is just pi.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.250
 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.700
Pi r squared, r is 1, so the
area of the circle-- so the

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.960
area of this wedge right here,
is just going to be equal to--

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.210
these pi's cancel out--
it's equal to x over 2.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.860
So that first small triangle,
that green triangle

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.050
we did, is sine of x.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.630
1/2 sine of x, that's the
area of that green triangle.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.390
Then the slightly larger area
of this wedge is-- we figured

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.640
out just now-- is x over 2.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.630
And now let's take the area
of that larger triangle,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.020
of this big triangle here.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.860
And that may be
the most obvious.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.130
So 1/2 base times height.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.950
So that's 1/2-- the base
is 1 again-- 1 times the

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.720
height, is tangent of x.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.900
Equal to 1/2 tangent of x.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.640
Now, it should be clear just
looking at this diagram, no

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.350
matter where I drew this top
line, that this green triangle

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.690
has a smaller area than this
wedge, which has a smaller area

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.330
than this large triangle.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.960
Right?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.510
So let's write an
inequality that says that.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.830
The green triangle-- the area
of the green triangle-- so 1/2

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.900
the sine of x, that's the area
of the green triangle-- it's

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.030
less than the area
of this wedge.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.360
So that's x over 2.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.540
And they're both less than
the area of this large

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.200
triangle, right?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.860
Which is 1/2 tangent of x.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.920
 

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.010
Now when is this true?

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.160
This is true as long as we're
in the first quadrant, right?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.400
As long as we're in
the first quadrant.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.960
It's also almost true if we go
into the fourth quadrant,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.310
except then the sine of x
becomes negative, the tangent

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.130
of x becomes negative,
and x becomes negative.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.300
But if we take the absolute
value of everything, it still

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.900
holds in the fourth quadrant.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.450
Because if you go negative, as
long as we take the absolute

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.900
value, then the distance will
still hold and we still have

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.120
positive areas and all
that kind of thing.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.060
So since my goal is to take the
limit as x approaches 0, and I

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.540
want to take the limit-- in
order for this limit to be

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.260
defined in general, it has to
be true from both the positive

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.320
and the negative side.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.170
Let's take the absolute value
of both sides of this.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.750
And hopefully this
makes sense to you.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.950
If I were to draw the line down
here-- and this would be the

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.720
sine of x, and that would be
the tangent of x-- as long as

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.350
you took the absolute value of
everything, you're essentially

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.370
just doing the same thing
as in the first quadrant.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.150
So let's take the absolute
value of everything.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.020
And that shouldn't change
anything, especially if you're

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.750
in the first quadrant.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.190
And you might want to think
about it a little bit, why

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.290
it doesn't change anything
in the second quadrant.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.510
So we have this inequality.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.270
Let's see if we can
play around with this.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.940
So first of all, let's just
multiply everything by 2

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.180
and get rid of the 1/2's.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:33.110
So we get absolute value of
sine of x is less than absolute

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.770
value of x, which is less than
the absolute value of

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.500
the tangent of x.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.420
I hope I didn't confuse you by
taking the absolute value.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.940
That original inequality I
wrote was completely valid in

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.310
the first quadrant, but since I
want this inequality to be true

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.510
in the first and fourth
quadrants, because I'm taking

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.260
the limit as x approaches 0
from both sides, I put that

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.120
absolute value there.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.540
So you could draw the line down
there and do everything we did

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.470
up there in the fourth
quadrant, but just take

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.170
the absolute value and it
should work out the same.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.390
Anyway, back to the problem.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.730
So we have this inequality.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.630
And I'm running out of
space, so let me erase some

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.710
of this stuff up here.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.280
 

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.570
Erase.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:12.760
Erase.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.420
 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.940
Nope, that doesn't erase.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.960
OK.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.400
That should erase.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.230
OK.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.980
So we could erase everything
that took us so far.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.122
We can't forget this though.

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:30.310
This gives a lot of space.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.430
OK.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.700
So let's take this, and let's
take that expression, and

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.460
divide all of the sides.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.190
You know, and it has
three sides, a left,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.100
middle, and right.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.730
Let's divide them all by the
absolute value of sine of x.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.960
And since we know that the
absolute value of sine of x is

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.640
a positive number, we know that
these less than signs

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.155
don't change, right?

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:52.260
So let's do that.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.210
So the absolute value of the
sine of x divided by the

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.585
absolute value of the sine
of x, well, that equals 1.

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:00.440
 

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.230
Which is less than the absolute
value of x divided by the

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.870
absolute value of sine of x.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.650
 

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.420
Which is less than-- what's the
absolute value of tan-- so, all

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.850
I'm doing is I'm taking the
absolute value of sine of x,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.910
absolute value of sine of x,
absolute value of sine of x.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.350
So what's the absolute value of
the tangent of x divided by the

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.580
absolute value of
the sine of x?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:32.930
Well, tangent is just
sine over cosine.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.580
So that's equal to-- so, just
do this part right here.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.430
That's equal to sine over
cosine divided by sine.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.895
And you know, you could say
that that's the same thing

00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:42.680
as the absolute value.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.360
And the absolute value divided
by the absolute value.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.900
So what are you left with?

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.620
Well, you're just left with 1
over-- this cancels out with

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.550
this, that becomes a 1-- 1
over the absolute value

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.720
of the cosine of x.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.630
So you might feel
we're getting close.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.700
Because this looks a lot like
this, it's just inverted.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.050
So to get to this,
let's invert it.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.750
And to invert it, what happens?

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.090
Well, first of all, what
happens when you invert 1?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.880
Well, 1/1 is just 1.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.760
But when you invert both sides
of an inequality, you switch

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.960
the inequality, right?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.480
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, think about this.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.870
You know, if I say 1/2 is less
than 2, and I invert both sides

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.020
of that, I get 2 is
greater than 1/2.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.830
So that hopefully gives
you a little intuition.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.380
So if I'm inverting all of the
sides of this inequality, I

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.210
have to switch the
inequality signs.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:48.130
So 1 is greater than absolute
value of sine of x, over the

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.415
absolute value of x, which is
greater than absolute

00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:55.400
value of cosine of x.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.430
Now let me ask you a question.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.330
The absolute value of sine
of x over-- well, first

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.030
of all, sine of x over x.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:10.140
Will there ever be a time when
sine of x over x is-- in the

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.730
first or the fourth quadrant--
is there ever a time that

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.110
sine of x over x is a
negative expression?

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.680
Well, in the first quadrant,
sine of x is positive,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.910
and x is positive.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.960
So a positive divided
by a positive is

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.090
going to be positive.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:29.610
And in the fourth quadrant,
sine of x is negative, y is

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.390
negative, and the angle is
negative, so x is

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.400
also negative.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.240
So in the fourth quadrant, sine
of x over x is going to be a

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.010
negative divided by a negative.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.850
So it's going to be
a positive again.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.070
So sine of x over x is always
going to be a positive.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.120
So the absolute value signs
are kind of redundant.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.990
So we could write 1 is greater
than sine of x over x.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.250
And the same logic, in the
first and fourth quadrants--

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.540
and that's where
we're dealing with.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:05.860
We're dealing with minus pi
over 2 is less than x, which

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.000
is less than pi over 2.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.960
So we're going from
minus pi over 2 all

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.310
the way to pi over 2.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.510
So we're in the fourth
and first quadrant.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.050
Is cosine of x ever negative?

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.830
Well, cosine is the x value,
and the x-- by definition, in

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.653
the first and fourth
quadrants-- the x value

00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:20.880
is always positive.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.480
So if this is always positive,
we can get rid of the

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.940
absolute value signs there,
and just write that.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.430
And now, we are ready to
use the squeeze theorem.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.060
Let me erase all of
this down here now.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.580
 

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.500
So let me ask you a question.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:50.170
What is the limit, as
x approaches 0, of

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.750
the function 1?

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.510
Well, the function 1
is always equal to 1.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.460
So I can set the limit as x
approaches infinity, the limit

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.310
as x approaches pi, anything.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.750
This is always going
to be equal to 1.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.620
So as x approaches 0,
this is equal to 1.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:14.570
And then what is the limit, as
x approaches 0, of cosine of x?

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.620
Well, that's easy, too.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.170
As x approaches 0, cosine of 0
is just 1-- and as you get,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.620
you know, it's a continuous
function-- so the limit is 1.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.630
So we are ready to use
the squeeze theorem.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:31.990
As we approach 0, as
x approaches 0, this

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.770
function approaches 1.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.650
This function approaches 1.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.350
And this function, this
expression, is in

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.870
between the two.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:45.300
And if it's in between the two,
as we approach-- this is

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.290
approaching 1 as we approach 0,
this is approaching 1 as we

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.470
approach 0, and this is in
between them, so it also has to

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.790
approach 1 as we approach 0.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.340
And so we are using the squeeze
theorem based on this and this.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.090
And you could say, you know,
therefore by the squeeze

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.740
theorem, because this is true,
this is true, and this is true,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:11.010
sine of x over x, the limit as
x approaches 0, is equal to 1.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.310
So hopefully that gave
you the intuition.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.910
That another way to view it, as
this line gets smaller and

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:24.410
smaller as it approaches 0, as
x approaches zero, that this

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.300
area and this area converge, so
the area in between kind of has

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.660
to converge to the
both of them.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.700
And if you want to see
it graphically, I've

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.490
graphed it here.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.285
Let me see if I can
graph this thing.

00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:40.610
I'll show you the graph.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.850
Just so you believe me.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.270
So we said that 1 is always
greater than sine of x, which

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.630
is always greater than cosine
of x, between negative pi

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.440
over 2 and pi over 2.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.740
And of course, this isn't
defined at x is equal to 0.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.350
But we can figure
out the limit.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.530
So there we have it.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.130
This blue line right here,
that's the function 1.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.650
That's y is equal to 1.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.440
This light blue line right
here is cosine of x.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.430
And this is the graph
of sine of x over x.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.480
And you can see that I
actually typed it in.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:22.060
So sine of x over x, between
negative pi over 2 and pi over

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.170
2, or the fourth and the first
quadrants, the red line

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.100
is always in between.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.750
It's always in between the dark
blue and the light blue line.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.970
And so this is just an
intuition of what happens

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.180
with the squeeze theorem.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.390
We know that the limit,
as this light blue line

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.860
approaches 0, is 1.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.300
And we know the limit as
this top dark blue line

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.500
approaches 0 is 1.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.780
And this red line is always
in between it, so it

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.240
also approaches 1.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.600
So there you have it.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.370
The proof, using the squeeze
theorem, and a little bit of

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.960
visual trigonometry, of why the
limit, as x approaches 0, of

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.970
sine of x over x is equal to 1.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.900
I hope I haven't confused you.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.400
