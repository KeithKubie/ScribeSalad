00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.160
The specific objectives
of this lesson are for

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.920
us to look at how are we
going to transform the image?

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.570
specifically transformations
like Rigid Transformations.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.290
Specifically Translation and Rotation.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.390
Again, the emphasis is that we
are trying to do now is look inside

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.920
the image but not at the intensities,
but the number of rows and columns.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.070
The number of pixels in the image and
transform those.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.340
An additional part of it, where we will
also look at non-rigid transformations,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.950
where we would actually look at our
final projective transformations.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.290
But more importantly, what we
want to do now is start looking at,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.420
how many numbers, how many parameters,
degrees of freedom we

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.450
want to be able to model in mathematics
of how to do these transformations.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.210
So, let's get started.
