00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.330
NARRATOR: The most feared allied
spy in World War 2

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.710
was a woman.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.830
She was an American
named Virginia Hall who

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.790
worked as an undercover agent.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.710
But her career almost
never happened.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.670
At just 27, Hall lost her
leg in a hunting accident.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.210
Undeterred, Hall
spent a year learning

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120
to walk on a
cumbersome prosthetic

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.080
leg she nicknamed Cuthbert.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.920
Four years later,
World War II broke out.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.750
Determined to help,
she moved to Europe

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.750
where she assisted the French
army as an ambulance driver.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
Fluent in French and an expert
on the French countryside,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.330
Hall was recruited by a
secret British espionage unit.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.710
She worked as an underground
informant and organizer,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.540
building a network of 90
agents in the south of France.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.880
The gestapo was desperate
to find The Limping Lady

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.210
undermining Nazi occupation.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.500
If captured, she would
be tortured and killed.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.710
In 1942, they found her.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.420
But hall fled to Spain on
foot through the snow capped

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.960
Pyrenees mountains,
scaling altitudes of 7,500

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.620
feet on her prosthetic leg.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.920
By now, America had
learned of Hall's talents

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.120
and assigned her to America's
wartime predecessor to the CIA.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.790
They sent her back to
Nazi-occupied France

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.880
to spearhead the
underground resistance.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.580
She disguised herself
as an elderly milkmaid,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.380
dyeing her hair gray and
hiding her distinctive limp

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.040
with bulky skirts and
an old lady's hobble.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.620
She transmitted intelligence
via radio signals,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.960
coordinating her band of
French resistance fighters.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.250
On D-day, her team
destroyed four

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.040
bridges, derailed
freight trains,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.460
and severed phone lines.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.540
By cutting off
Nazi reinforcements

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.380
and preventing them
from retreating,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.000
she was instrumental in
securing an allied victory.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.330
After the war in 1945,
President Harry Truman

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.000
awarded Hall with the
Distinguished Service Cross,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.750
the second highest US
military award for bravery.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.080
"March On!"

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
celebrating women who
changed the world.
