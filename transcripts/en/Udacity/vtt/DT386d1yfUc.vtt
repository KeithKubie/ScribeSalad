00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.820
To understand the goals of IPSec,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.830
let's take a look at a critical
weakness of our IPv4.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.050
In IPv4, there's no authentication
of the source IP address.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.571
That is, if Alice receives a packet
with Bob's social IP address,

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:20.580
Alice cannot be sure that
the packet is really from Bob.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.850
As a result, IP spoofing or
forging the source IP address

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.001
is a commonly used
technique in cyber attacks.

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.360
For example,
bots in the botnet can send a DNS query

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
to DNS servers asking the full
TXT record of a domain.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.210
By spoofing, the source IP
address of a victim website.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.780
As a result,
the response from the DNS servers

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.090
which can amount to a very large volume
of data is sent to the victim website.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.550
And this would result in a
denial-of-service of the victim website.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.795
IPSec provides security
measures at the IP layer.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:04.250
This include authentication
of source IP addresses,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.220
confidentiality and
integrity protection of packet data.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.020
And authenticity of packet data, in
particular preventing replay of packets.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.820
Of course,
a network application or protocol

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.910
can implement its own specific security
mechanisms to achieve these goals.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.950
By having IPSec, that is implementing
security at the IP layer,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.948
we can ensure secure networking
not only for applications to have

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:36.360
a security mechanisms, but also for
many applications that are ignorant

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.890
about security because all application
run on top of the IP layer.
