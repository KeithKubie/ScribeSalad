00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.260
Marcel Proust was an early 20th century French writer responsible for what's officially the longest novel in the world:

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.480
"A la recherche du temps perdu"/In search of Lost Time.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.360
which has 1.2 million words in it, double those in "War and Peace" .

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.100
The book was published in French in 7 volumes over 14 years,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.520
and was immediately recognized to be a masterpiece, ranked by many as the greatest novel of the century,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.740
or, simply, of all time.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.300
What makes it so special is that it isn’t just a novel in the straight narrative sense.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.790
it's a work that intersperses genius
level descriptions of people and places

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.469
with the whole philosophy of life. The
clue is in the title:

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.219
"In search of lost time". The book tells
the story of one man

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.039
a thinly disguised version of Proust himself, in his ongoing search for the meaning and purpose of life

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.110
it recounts his quest to stop wasting
time

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.590
and to start to appreciate existence

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.050
Marcel Proust wanted his book to help us above all

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.770
His father, Adrien Proust, had been one of the great doctors of his age

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.900
responsible for wiping out cholera in
France

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
towards the end of his life, his frail, indolent son Marcel,  who had lived on his inheritance

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.229
and had disappointed his family by never
taking up a regular job

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.340
told his housekeeper Celeste

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.420
if only I could to humanity as much good with my books

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.660
as my father did with his work

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.860
the good news is that he amply succeeded

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.860
Proust’s novel charts the narrator’s systematic exploration of three possible sources of the meaning of life.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.360
the first is social success

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.799
Proust was born into a comparable
bourgeois household,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.970
but from his teens, he began to think
that the meaning of life

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.170
might lie in joining high society, which in his day meant, the world of aristocrats, of dukes, duchesses and princes.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.500
but if you convert this to the present day, that would mean celebrities.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.100
For years, the narrator devotes his energies to working his way up the social hierarchy

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.490
and because he’s charming and erudite, he eventually becomes friends with lynchpins of Parisian high society

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619
the Duke and Duchesse de Guermantes

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.780
But a troubling realisation soon dawns on him

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.740
These people are not the extraordinary paragons he imagined they would be

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.800
The Duc’s conversation is boring and crass

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.640
The Duchesse, though well mannered, is cruel and vain

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.720
Marcel tires of them and their circle

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.180
He realises that virtues and vices are scattered throughout the population without regard to income or renown

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
He grows free to devote himself to a wider range of people

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.520
Though Proust spends many pages lampooning social snobbery

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.760
it’s in a spirit of understanding and underlying sympathy

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.320
it's a highly natural error, especially when one is young.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.110
to suspect that there might be a class
of superior people somewhere out there in the world

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180
and
that our lives might be dull principally

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.870
because we don't have the right contacts.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.060
But Proust’s novel offers us definitive reassurance: life is not going on elsewhere

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.019
there is no party with the perfect
people are

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.040
The second thing that Proust’s narrator investigates in his quest for the meaning of life

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.340
is love

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.200
In the second volume of the novel

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.960
the narrator goes off to the seaside with his grandmother

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.000
to the vogueish resort of Cabourg (the Barbados of the times)

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.980
There he develops an overwhelming crush on a beautiful teenage girl called Albertine

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.360
She has short hair, a boyish smile and a charming, casual way of speaking

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.040
For about 300 pages, all the narrator can think about is Albertine

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.420
The meaning of life surely must lie in loving her

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.239
But with time, here too, there’s disappointment

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.480
The moment comes when the narrator is finally allowed to kiss Albertine

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.880
Man, a creature clearly less rudimentary than the sea-urchin or even the whale

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.720
nevertheless lacks a certain number of essential organs

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.500
and particularly possesses none that will serve for kissing

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.660
For this absent organ, he substitutes his lips

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.660
and perhaps he thereby achieves a result slightly more satisfying

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.880
than caressing his beloved with a horny tusk

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.640
The ultimate promise of love, in Proust’s eyes

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.880
is that we can stop being alone and properly fuse our life with that of another person

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.180
who will understand every part of us

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.100
But the novel comes to darker conclusions

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.280
no one can fully understand anyone

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.160
Loneliness is endemic

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.640
We’re awkward, lonely pilgrims trying to give each tusk-kisses in the dark

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.600
This brings us to the third and only successful candidate for the meaning of life:

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.520
ART

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.340
For Proust, the great artists deserve acclaim

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.800
because they show us the world in a way that is fresh, appreciative, and alive

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.880
The opposite of art for Proust is something
he calls habit

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.520
For Proust, much of life is ruined for us by a blanket or shroud of familiarity

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.540
that descends between us and everything that matters

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.580
habit dulls our senses and stops us appreciating everything

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.400
from the beauty of a sunset to our work and our friends

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.240
Children don’t suffer from habit

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.500
which is why they get excited by some very key but simple things

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.320
like puddles, jumping on the bed, sand and fresh bread

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.360
But we adults get spoilt about everthing

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.120
which is why we seek ever more powerful stimulants (like fame and love)

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.920
The trick, in Proust’s eyes

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.180
is to recover the powers of appreciation of a child in adulthood

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.740
to strip the veil of habit and therefore

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.550
to start to appreciate daily life with a
new sensitivity

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.430
This for Proust is what one group in the population does all the time

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.940
artists

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.240
Artists are people who know how to strip habit away

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.780
and return life to its true deserved glory

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.900
for example, when they show us water lilies or service stations or buildings in a new light

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.760
Proust’s goal isn’t that we should necessarily make art

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.200
or be someone who hangs out in museums all the time

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.630
the idea is to get us to look at the world, our world

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.930
with some of the same generosity as an artist

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.330
which would mean taking pleasure in simple things

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.050
like water, the sky or a shaft of light on a piece of paper

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.620
It’s no coincidence that Proust’s favourite painter was Vermeer

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.340
a painter who knew how to bring out the charm and the value of the everyday

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.169
the spirit of Vermeer hangs over his
novel

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.151
it too is committed to the project of reconciling us to the ordinary circumstances of life

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.900
and some of Proust’s most compelling pieces of writing

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.889
describe the charm with the everyday
like reading in a train

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.259
driving at night, smelling the flowers in
spring time

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.580
and looking at the changing light of the sun on the sea

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.140
Proust is famous for having written about the dainty little cakes the French call ‘madeleines’

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.940
The reason has to do with his thesis about art and habit

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.319
Early on in the novel, the narrator tells us

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.400
that he'd been feeling depressed and sad
for a long while

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.860
when one day he had a cup of herbal tea and a madeleine

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.090
and suddenly the taste carried him
powerfully back

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.360
(in the way that flavours sometimes can)

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.360
to years in his childhood when as a small boy

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.420
he spent his summers in his aunt’s house in french countryside

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.670
A stream of memories comes back to him, and fills him with hope and gratitude

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.920
Thanks to the madeleine

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.020
Proust’s narrator has what has since become known as

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.940
A PROUSTIAN MOMENT

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.820
a moment of sudden involuntary and intense remembering

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.260
when the past promptly emerges unbidden from a smell, a taste or a texture

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.480
Through its rich evocative power

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.979
what the Proustian moment teaches us is that life isn’t necessarily dull and without excitement

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.819
it's just one forgets to look at it in
the right way

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.740
we forget what being alive

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.300
fully alive, actually feels like.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.200
The moment with the tea is pivotal in the novel

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.300
because it demonstrates everything Proust wants to teach us

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.319
about appreciating life with greater
intensity

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.380
it helps as narrator to realize that it isn’t his life which has been mediocre

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.860
so much as the image of it he possessed in normal, that is voluntary memory

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.660
Proust writes

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.520
The reason why life may be judged to be trivial

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.599
although at certain moments it seems to
us so beautiful

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.920
is that we form our judgment ordinarily
not on the evidence of life itself

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.800
but in its quite different
images

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.820
which preserve nothing of life

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.890
and therefore we judge it disparagingly

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.020
that's why artists are so important

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.860
Their work is like one long Proustian moment

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.010
they remind us that life truly is
beautiful, fascinating and complex

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.120
and thereby they dispel our boredom and our ingratitude.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.399
Proust’s philosophy of art is delivered in a book

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.280
which is itself exemplary of what he’s saying

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.120
It's a work of art that brings the beauty and interest of the world back to life

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.180
Reading it, your senses are reawakened

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.920
a thousand things you normally forget to notice are brought to your attention

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.170
he makes you for a time, as clever and as sensitive as he was

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.390
and for this reason alone, we should be sure to read him

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.579
and 1.2 million words he assembled for
us

00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:24.679
thereby learn to appreciate existence
before it's too late.
