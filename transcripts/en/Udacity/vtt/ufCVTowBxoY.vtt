00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.410
This is really interesting. I guess the fact the

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.120
we have these three buckets, the number of critical

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.170
resources, the number of critical bytes and path points,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.070
illustrates that there's really no one golden rule. For

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.310
example, if I eliminate the number of critical resources,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.230
I would also probably also reduce the number of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.660
bytes. And likewise if I started compressing, caching and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.920
minifying, I can also produce a number of bytes.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.590
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I couldn't have said it better myself. I

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.600
think you're really starting to get a hang of this.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.290
Let's try a few more examples. Okay same page but now with CSS and JavaScript.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.163
Once again we get the HTML and

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:37.835
let's cover CSS and JavaScript resources and initiate

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:42.720
those requests. Note that the JavaScript file is a bit smaller than the CSS so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.565
it may arrive sooner. Which other script is

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:48.120
blocked on this CSS on being created, right?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.980
&gt;&gt; Correct, once the CSS arrives the browser builds

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
this CSS object model which unblocks java script and

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.310
allows it to execute. Once the java script is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.800
executed, the DOM parser becomes unblocked which means a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.470
complete DOM construction. And finally we have both the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.190
DOM and the CSS object model which means that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.710
we can render the page. As you can see,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.580
even a simple page such as this one has

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.440
a lot of dependencies that slow down the critical path.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no kidding.
