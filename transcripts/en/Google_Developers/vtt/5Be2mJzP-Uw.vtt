00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.330
Android has changed
a lot over the years,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.645
from the classic Android
design, through Holo,

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:06.540
and now material design.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.330
How do you build an app that
looks great and consistent

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.450
across all these devices
and Android versions?

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.710
That's where AppCompat comes in,
giving you a consistent theme

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.270
and baseline for
your applications

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.040
that stays in sync with the
latest version of Android.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.190
Hi, I'm Ian Lake.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.470
I'm here to tell you about
the features of AppCompat,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.370
how to get started, and why
it's one of the keys to building

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.230
apps faster.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.660
So how exactly do you
transform our default state

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.930
into something great?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.940
In fact, there's only
two changes needed.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.180
The first part is
the AppCompat theme.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.610
It encapsulates all of the
version specific logic for you,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.680
giving you just a
single theme to use.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.530
The second part is the
switch to AppCompat activity,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.180
and this is what gives
us a consistent action

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.080
bar, contextual action modes,
and support for toolbars,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.350
as well as the features of
its parent class, fragment

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.900
activity, including
fragments and loaders.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.810
And just like that, we have
a single, consistent look

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.715
and feel that works on
over a billion devices.

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:01.990
Not bad.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.280
But the default theme is
only a starting point.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.880
AppCompat brings the material
color palette to all devices,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.680
making it easy to
bring your brand's

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.530
color into every
part of your app

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.010
with a single, simple theme.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.230
Let's create a theme and
set the three main colors.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.420
Color primary, which
controls the action bar

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.170
coloring, and should be
your main branding color.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530
Color primary dark,
which is a darker

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.780
variant of your primary
color, and used to color

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.660
the status bar on
platforms that support it.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.980
And color accent, which actually
provides the accent coloring

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.500
for views, such as checkboxes,
edit text, and radio buttons.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.750
So how does our coloring look?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.739
Pretty good.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.280
You'll notice that
all of our widgets

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550
now use our custom coloring.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.530
You'll also get backward
compatible versions

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.950
of alert dialogue, search
view, share action provider,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.340
contextual action
modes, and toolbars,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.090
giving you a consistent set
of the latest and greatest

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.820
components, so you don't have
to compromise your design

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.715
to support all of your users.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:02.260
So how do you get AppCompat into
your project in Android Studio?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.000
It's easy.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.350
The templates for new
projects and new activities

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.570
automatically include
AppCompat, giving you

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.026
the basics by default. If you
have an existing project you

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:13.150
want to switch over, you'll
add a single dependency

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.010
to your build.gradle
file, change your theme,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.440
move over to AppCompat activity,
and replace a few method

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.660
calls with their support
library equivalents,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.390
hopefully removing a bunch
of version specific code

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.860
in the process.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.440
With AppCompat giving
you a consistent base,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.350
you can focus on what
makes your app unique.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.140
We've touched on
just a few things

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.497
that you get through AppCompat.

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:36.330
You can learn more about
the Android support

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.290
library and AppCompat
on the developer site.
