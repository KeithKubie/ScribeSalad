00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:01.858
Voiceover:What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.858 --> 00:00:04.364
is use all of our powers,
all of our knowledge

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:06.298
of trig functions and trig identities.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:07.865
In order to figure out,

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.294
given all the information
that we have here,

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:13.706
in order to figure out the
length of this yellow line,

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:16.207
this point, this line or the segment

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:18.807
that goes from here to here.

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:20.249
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.011
and think about it
before I work through it.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.780
I'm assuming you've had a go at it

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.156
and in doing that you might have realized,

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:31.172
okay this line that's one of the sides

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:34.669
of this right triangle that
I have right over here.

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:38.745
We're given this alpha and beta

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:42.871
but if we consider the combined angle

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.779
alpha plus beta,

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:46.632
then this side right over here,

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:48.511
we can just take out our
traditional trig functions.

00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:53.408
Our soh cah toa definition
of the basic trig functions

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.593
and we know that sine is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.482
If we're considering alpha plus beta,

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:01.011
this angle right over here,

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:02.336
opposite over hypotenuse

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:05.422
that's going to be this
length over the hypotenuse

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:06.427
which is one.

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:08.265
Sine of alpha plus beta

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:10.848
is going to be this
length right over here.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:12.979
That seems interesting,
so let me write that down.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.249
Sine of alpha plus beta

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.972
is essentially what we're looking for.

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:27.636
Sine of alpha plus beta

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:30.174
is this length right over here.

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:31.676
Sine of alpha plus beta

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:33.431
it's equal to the opposite side,

00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:35.107
that over the hypotenuse.

00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:37.129
Well the hypotenuse is just
going to be equal to one

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.722
so it's equal to this side.

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:41.737
Another way of raising
the exact same problem

00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:43.202
that we first tried to tackle is

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:47.152
how do we figure out the
sine of alpha plus beta?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.185
If you're familiar with
your trig identities

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.112
something might be jumping out of you.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.558
Hey, we know a different
way of expressing sine

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:58.267
of alpha plus beta.

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:01.064
We know that this thing is the same thing

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:10.903
as the sine of alpha
times the cosine of beta

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:14.068
plus the other way around,

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:24.089
the cosine of alpha
times the sine of beta.

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.222
Let me a draw a line here
so we don't get confused.

00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:28.381
If we're trying to figure this out,

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.776
and we know that this can
be re-expressed this way

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:33.050
it all boils down to can we figure out

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.911
what sine of alpha is, cosine of beta,

00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:37.825
cosine of alpha, and sine of beta.

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:39.391
Now when you look at this,

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:42.064
you see that you actually
can figure those things out.

00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:43.010
Let's do that.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.374
Sine of alpha, I'll write it over here.

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.811
Sine of alpha is equal to ...

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:49.748
This is alpha,

00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:52.483
sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.716
It's 0.5 over one.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:59.809
This is equal to 0.5, so that is 0.5.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.917
Cosine of beta

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.254
this is beta.

00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:09.945
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.824
This is beta, the adjacent side is 0.6

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:14.488
over the hypotenuse of 1.

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:18.565
It's 0.6.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:25.113
Cosine of alpha.

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:26.721
Adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:29.293
it's square root of
three over two, over one.

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.869
That's just square root of three over two.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:37.546
This is just square
root of three, over two.

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:43.034
Then finally sine of beta.

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:46.799
Opposite over hypotenuse is 0.8.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.532
This is 0.8.

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.385
Actually let me write that as,

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:55.555
I'm going to write that as four-fifths

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:59.405
just so that that's the same thing as 0.8.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.278
Just because I think

00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:01.708
it's going to make it a
little bit easier for me

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.212
to simplify right over here.

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:04.939
What is all of these equal to?

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.868
Well this is going to be equal to

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:10.068
0.5 times 0.6,

00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:13.084
this part right over here is .3,

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:20.718
and square root of three
over two, times four-fifths

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:22.770
well let's just multiply them.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.191
Four divided by two is two.

00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:27.863
It's two square roots of three over five.

00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:30.524
This is equal to or so

00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:35.042
plus two square roots of three over five.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:36.940
This is essentially our answer,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.021
I feel a little uncomfortable having it

00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:40.604
in these two different formats

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:42.398
where I have a fraction here
and I have a decimal here

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:43.560
so let me just write the whole thing

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.242
as a rational expression.

00:04:45.242 --> 00:04:51.162
0.3 is obviously the same
thing as three-tenths.

00:04:51.162 --> 00:04:53.998
That's the same things as three over ten

00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:57.749
plus, now this if I want to write over ten

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.693
this the same things as four
square roots of three over ten

00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:03.842
and of course, if we add these two

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:11.893
we are going to get three plus
four square roots of three,

00:05:11.893 --> 00:05:16.466
all of that over ten

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.626
and we are done.
