Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day.
So if you are a Smarter

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.070
Every Day subscriber I know for an absolute fact that right now you are watching the Venus transit,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.090
or as I like to call it, the Venutian eclipse. Anyway, so here's

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.120
what I want to know. How are you watching it? Are you kind of weird, and you

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.160
maybe, oh I dunno, you have, a chinese food box balanced

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.200
on a chair, and you're letting the sun shine through that aperture

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240
that you created with a kitchen knife in your chinese food lid, and you're

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
looking at it that way, or are you doing something crazy elaborate with a telescope? So let's use this

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.280
opportunity to learn about telescopes. I'm very very, umm..

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
I'm very very interested in what you're doing, especially if you're on the other side of the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.310
world from me, so let's ah, get our video responses ready and then I'm

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.350
gonna post some stuff that I learned from the US Space and Rocket Centre. I just went up there.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.390
And I want to see what you're doing. So when I post that video, please give me a response

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
so I know what you're doing. That way we can figure out how we can use this information to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.460
study more about where we live, on Earth. Anyway I'm Destin. You're getting

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.447
Smarter Every Day. Get those video responses ready. Thanks.
