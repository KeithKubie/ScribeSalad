00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.900
So even something as
simple as scrambling an egg

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.633
is essentially a scientific
manipulation of an ingredient

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:11.600
by exposing it to both heat and
movement and incorporating air.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.000
You're making it behave--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.834
an egg behave--
in a desired way.

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.433
It reminds me-- this
is an obscure analogy.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:23.133
But it reminds me of when
medicine became modern,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.133
it did so because,
in part, it looked

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.300
to see what sort
of folk remedies

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.967
existed around the
world in cultures.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.367
Oh, you chew on this bark and
that gets rid of your headache.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.033
Well, what got rid
of your headache?

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:36.633
So you find out
what's in the bark.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.700
Right.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.000
And there's this
molecule that becomes

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.133
what we today call aspirin.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.133
And so you extract
the active ingredient.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.567
And then you can exploit
that to a great gain.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:52.567
And so, it seems to me, if
you knew exactly the moment

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:57.667
and why a sauteed
onion becomes sweet,

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.734
you can possibly hone
in on that and exploit

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:01.867
that fact with other foods.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:04.667
And that's what
chefs are doing--

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.767
some chefs are doing--

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:06.900
every day.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
I have friends who are
rotting all varieties

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.133
of things in some dark
corner of their cellar,

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:16.200
experimenting, talking
to microbiologists

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
from major universities,
talking to them late at night,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.867
working with them in kitchens,
discussing, you know,

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.867
the wonders of fermentation.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.000
What can you ferment?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.300
What can you-- what's
going on in miso?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
How could I apply that
to something else?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Kimchi

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.867
I love miso.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:36.233
So much of food is
not about freshness.

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.967
It's what's called
that sweet spot--

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:42.967
the precise moment in its
decay where it is best,

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.800
sushi being the best example.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.667
Anyone who goes and
tells you that, you know,

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.033
I went to a sushi bar last
night, it was the best,

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.867
the fish was so fresh, had no
understanding at all of sushi.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:55.333
It's not-- sushi's not
about freshness at all.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.333
First of all, even
the best places

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:02.066
deliberately cure their fish
by freezing it, sometimes

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:06.400
out of necessity to kill
the critters-- others

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.567
because it makes it better.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.900
But it's almost never
about the freshest fish.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.367
Fresh fish is right
out of the water.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:13.467
It's still in rigor.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.333
And it's often
rubbery and unpleasant

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.867
and without much
flavor, which is why

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:22.600
in Iceland, they rot it
sometimes, because you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.000
get more [inaudible].

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.367
You're looking for the perfect
point in the decay of the fish.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:30.900
Same with meat.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900
Almost everything
we eat and like--

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.367
cheese, meat, fish--
they're all aged.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.800
Wine.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.667
So it's really about decay and
rot, cheerful as that sounds.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:45.834
[laughing]

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:47.800
[stammering] I never knew.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.600
Thank you.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
[laughing]
