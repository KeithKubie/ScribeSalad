00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:26.520
PROFESSOR: So today
we begin our study

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.500
of solids and in
particular of conductivity

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.270
in solids and
periodic potentials,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.960
and that diagram will mean
something in a few weeks.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.850
So before I get
started, questions

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.260
on everything previous?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.760
Yeah.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.490
AUDIENCE: So when you're talking
about fermions and bosons

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.550
Statistics.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.091
So we said That you had to write
the statement particular way

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:54.395
for fermions with a
minus sign particular.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:55.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.915
AUDIENCE: Well, we
were assuming that you

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:59.410
had to write the statement a
product statement of the two.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.297
Will it be that you
can't do that sometimes

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:02.630
because they can't be separated.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.030
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.196
That's a wonderful question.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.592
We'll come to that in the second
next to the last lecture where

00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:09.800
we'll talk about something
called entanglement, which

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.300
is really what
you're talking about.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.170
But here's the crucial
thing, for fermions,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050
so what I wrote
last time, I said

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.590
suppose we have two particles
that are identical one is

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.650
in the state we know one
is in the state chi of x

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.660
and the other is in the
state described by phi of x.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.650
I'm going to call the position
of the first vertical x

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.010
and the position of
the second particle y.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.210
And I can write the two states
without property, well, three.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.330
I could fill many, but two in
particular of the following

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.366
from, chi of x phi of y plus
or minus chi of y phi of x.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.500
And the point of this
linear combination

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.700
is that when they exchange
positions, the x and y

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.287
So here this is the amplitude
for the first particle

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:01.040
will be an x, and the
second particle to be a y.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.210
If I switch the sign or the
positions to psi plus minus

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.590
of yx or if the first
particle is at y,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.120
the second particle is at x,
this is equal to just swap

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.510
these two terms, plus or
minus psi plus minus of x,y.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.630
So this wave function
has been contracted

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.260
to ensure that under the
exchange of the position

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.830
of the two particles, the wave
function stays the same up

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.290
to a sign.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.170
This plus sign is associated
with systems we call bosons,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730
and the minus sign is associated
with systems we call fermions.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.861
Now as I've
discussed previously,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.610
this is a persistent
property of a system.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.630
If a system is bosonic,
at some moment in time,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.714
it will always be bosonic.

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:48.421
If it's fermionic in
some moment in time,

00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:49.980
it will always be
fermionic, and that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.630
is a consequence of the fact
that the exchange operator that

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.450
swaps the two particles commutes
with the energy eigenfunction

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.770
if they're identical particles.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.510
And so if it commutes with
the energy operator, then

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.430
its value is preserved
under time evolution

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.460
with that energy operator.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.740
So now the question
that was asked is,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.861
if this is our definition
of bosons and fermions,

00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.110
is it true that you can
always write the wave function

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.890
in this form of differences
of products of two states?

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.010
Well, the answer
is both yes and no.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.380
The answer is yes for
sufficiently-simple systems.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.346
The answer is no when you
have many, many particles,

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.970
and we can't always write it as
a simple product of two states.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.800
We can't always write
as the sum of two terms.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.710
What you will discover if you
studied multi-particle systems

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.400
in 805 and 806 is that there's
a nice way of organizing

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.376
this anti
symmetrization property,

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.125
and it doesn't necessarily
have two terms,

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:50.020
but it may have
many, many terms.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.109
With that said, this is
not the defining property.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.650
This is really the
defining property,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.940
whether your a
boson or a fermion.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.660
OK?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.840
Cool.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.340
Yeah.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.706
AUDIENCE: So I had a question
about fermions. [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:08.357
the explanation being
makes perfect sense

00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:10.554
about why two things can't
be in the same state.

00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:11.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.700
AUDIENCE: But Used in
804-4, during recitation

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700
one of the instructors
said, well actually, this

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.628
takes like really hard
quantum field theory

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:19.622
to actually prove this.

00:04:19.622 --> 00:04:20.620
What does that actually mean?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.079
Good.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.454
So the question
is, look, there's

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:25.720
this legendary
statement that this fact

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.400
that the Pauli exclusion
principle is incredibly hard

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.230
and requires the magical
details of quantum field theory

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.840
to explain, and that
some surprising.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.470
So your recitation
lecturer said this to you.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.785
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:42.480
PROFESSOR: I'm sure I
love this person dearly,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.000
but I disagree with him
in an important way.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400
So there are two
things are confusing.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.610
Two things that require
explanation I should say.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.445
One, we can explain
at the level of 804,

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:54.900
and the other does
require machinery,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.851
but it's not crazy
complicated machinery.

00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:58.850
So let me tell you what
we can explain with 804,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.690
and then let me
sketch for you how

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.770
the more sophisticated
argument goes.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.394
So this fact, the basic
fact that wave functions can

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:08.060
be symmetric or
anti-symmetric, and when

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.480
you have identical
particles, they

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.690
must be either symmetric
or anti-symmetric.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.459
This follows from
the statement that we

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:14.500
have identical particles.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.060
If you have identical
particles, it

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.860
must be true that
under the exchange,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.284
they are either even or odd.

00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:24.700
They're either symmetric or
anti-symmetric under exchange.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.930
So if we have an exchange
of identical particles,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.750
we need to have identical
symmetric or identical

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.450
anti-symmetric.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.160
And now it's just an
empirical question.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.640
What particles in the
world are identical bosons

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.800
and what particles are
identical fermions.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.700
Identical fermions?

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.920
Well, how could you
tell the difference?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.760
You can tell that
identical fermions do not

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.720
want to be the same state,
and identical bosons

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.760
do as we saw last time,
as an extra factor of two

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.390
for two particles that are
actually n for n particles.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.281
So bosons want to be
in the same state.

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.030
Fermions want to not
be in the same state,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.210
so if we just look
at the world and say,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.130
which particles are
well modeled by assuming

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.830
we have bosons, which
particles are well

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.460
modeled by assuming
we have fermions.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.660
And answer turns out to be the
following, any particle that

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.250
has intrinsic angular momentum,
which is a half integer,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.780
any particle which
spin like the electron,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.390
which has a limit
to 1/2 and we'll

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.980
study that in more detail
later, any particle that

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.080
has half-integer intrinsic
angular momentum empirically

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.196
turns out to be a fermion.

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.070
Take two electrons, take
their wave function,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.000
and swap the positions
of the two electrons,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.708
the way function picks
up the minus sign.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.816
Take two neutrons,
also spin 1/2.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:27.440
Swap them and you
pick up a minus sign.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.420
It's a fermion.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.130
Take two particles of
light, two photons,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.120
swap them and you
get a plus sign,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.690
and these guys
have integer spin.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.636
Angular momentum of light
is 1, and similarly,

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.010
if we could, for
the Higgs boson,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.801
if you take two Higgs
bosons and swap them,

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:42.430
you'll discover
that they're bosons

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.120
and as a consequence there's
a plus sign under exchange.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.780
So that is not
surprising, it's just

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.500
an observable
property of the world.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.440
The thing that's shocking
is why that's true, right?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.630
Why is it that things that
have half-integer angular

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.031
momentum, which sounds like
an independent property

00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.530
from whether they're bosonic
or whether identical bosons are

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.071
identified, why is
it that all things

00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:06.640
with half-integer angular
momentum or spin are fermions,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.730
and all things with integer
angular momentum like light

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.620
or the Higgs boson or
me we're for bosonic,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.250
we're identical
with an even sign,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.500
and that requires
quantum field theory.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.100
But it's not insanely difficult.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.765
It requires the bearest minima
of quantum field theory.

00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:27.770
So anyone who wants
to understand,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.710
come to my office hours
and I happily explain that.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.460
It takes about 15
minutes just to give you

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.135
the basics of quantum field
theory, just the bare basics.

00:07:34.135 --> 00:07:36.340
It's pretty straightforward.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.319
But it's a beautiful thing about
relativistic quantum mechanics,

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.860
so I'm going to turn
this all around.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.430
So let's look at the history.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.760
The history of this was people
looked at atomic spectra

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.165
and said, this is bizarre.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.450
It almost fits what we
get from central potential

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.280
except it does buy this
factor of two integer indices.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.780
Ah-ha.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.650
There must be an
extra quantum number

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.834
and on top of that, so the
spin, the two possible states

00:07:57.834 --> 00:07:58.500
of the electron.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.420
And secondly, it must
be that electrons

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.679
can't be in the same state.

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.345
So it sounds like
that's two hypotheses.

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:05.650
Now, if you take
those two hypotheses,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.840
everything else follows.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.890
Fine.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.830
What Dirac discovered
when he studied

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.590
the relativistic version of
the Schrodinger equation, which

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.350
really is quantum
field theory, but when

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.808
he studied the
relativistic version

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.802
of electrons, quantum
mechanical relativistic version,

00:08:19.802 --> 00:08:21.760
he discovered that these
two things are linked.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.350
It is cool.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.851
I grant you.

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:30.100
So you he discovered that
these two things are linked,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.200
and he identified what's
referred to as the spin

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.146
statistics theorem.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.270
If you know the spin, you
determine the statistics.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.799
So exactly how that
works, that does

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.424
require a little bit
of effort-- that's

00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:41.679
the 15 minutes-- but you can
dispense with that entirely

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.000
and not be at all shocked by
anything if you just accept

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.300
two principles instead of
one, first, that electrons are

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.220
anti-fermionic, so they don't
want to be the same state,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.028
and secondly, they
have half-integer spin.

00:08:56.028 --> 00:09:01.330
AUDIENCE: Given that the only
thing that's really measurable

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.574
is [? the square ?] or
non-square of the wave function

00:09:06.574 --> 00:09:10.211
and the way the function itself
is never completely actually,

00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:10.710
measurable.

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:18.770
Is there a
mathematical reason why

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.810
exchange can't transform
a wave function just

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.830
by arbitrary phase?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.874
It has to be plus or minus 1?

00:09:25.874 --> 00:09:27.290
PROFESSOR: Well,
the reason it has

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.060
to be plus or minus
1 for two particles,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.420
so you said a couple of things.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.628
Let me answer the first part.

00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:34.920
So what I will call the first
part of your question is,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.502
why did it have to
be plus or minus 1.

00:09:36.502 --> 00:09:38.390
Why couldn't it have
been an arbitrary phase?

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.973
And the reason is that if you
do this exchange operation twice

00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:43.570
for two particles, you
get back the same thing.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.960
And that's what I mean by saying
I have identical particles.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.060
Because I could
quibble with this.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.810
You could say, well
look, you could

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.560
define some different
notion of exchange,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.170
or under exchange, I
pick up an extra phase.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.470
I swap them and then I swap
them and I swap them again,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.053
I get a phase.

00:09:54.053 --> 00:09:55.430
But here's the
problem with that.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.990
The problem with that is,
and this can be dealt with,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.329
but an interesting
question is if it can only

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:02.870
be dealt with in
two dimensions or it

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.953
can be dealt with in general
number of dimensions.

00:10:04.953 --> 00:10:08.030
This is a story called antions,
which Frank Wilczek here

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.550
has really pounded hard on.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.800
But here's the basic question.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.910
So does the wave function
have a single value?

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.054
I'd like to think it does.

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:20.220
The wave function really
should have a single value.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.490
If it has multiple
values, then it's

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.784
ambiguous what the value of
the wave function is there.

00:10:23.784 --> 00:10:24.450
That's not good.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.530
That mean you have to specify
more than just the wave

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.580
function, you have to
specify which of the values

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.544
the wave function takes
in a particular point

00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:31.960
in the value of
the wave function.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.270
So if under double
exchange we've

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.000
returned to the
original configuration,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.080
you pick up a phase,
something is screwed.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.384
You must be able to tell whether
or not you've exchanged twice,

00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:44.550
and here's why you can tell.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.850
Because while it's true that you
can't tell the overall phase,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.140
imagine if I take my system
and I put in a splitter

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.662
and I have a beam
splitter I could think

00:10:52.662 --> 00:10:55.120
of it as a two-split experiment,
one component of that wave

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.289
function I will double swap and
the other component I will not.

00:10:58.289 --> 00:10:59.580
And then I will interfere them.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.910
I will combine
them back together,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.160
do an interference experiment.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.580
So you measure that
relative phase.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.215
So that relative phase
definitely matters.

00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.040
Do you just see that point?

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.800
So it's true that
they overall phase

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800
they can't measure, but
by doing a superposition

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.610
and only exchanging one of
the superposition pairs,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.690
by physically
separating those, then

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.290
you can see that in
interference experiments again.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.020
So you can still deal
with this, but it

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.770
requires being able
to know whether or not

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.830
you can exchange,
so there has to be

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.330
some way of telling that you
sort of entwined these guys,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.740
and that's something you
could do in two dimensions.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.050
It turns out to
be difficult to do

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.050
in general number of dimensions.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.630
Well, it's an act
of research topic.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.800
If you want to a more
detailed answer, ask me later.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.860
OK.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.370
One more question.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.580
Yeah.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah. it has
precisely one observable

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.194
property, which is this sign,
this it's eigenvalue, value,

00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:53.610
and you can tell because the
wave function either vanishes

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.010
when you take the two points
together or it doesn't.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.770
So that's it.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.722
AUDIENCE: So it's not like
the momentum [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:04.686 --> 00:12:07.650
So it's only basically
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:11.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.580
It's less interesting
than position or momentum.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.420
It has two eigenvalues
rather than many.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.630
But it's no less interesting
than, for example, spin.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.050
It contains information that
you can learn about system.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.550
OK.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.050
One more.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:30.061
AUDIENCE: I was wondering why
you can write this fermion

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:34.265
as two electrons I guess when
it seems to me [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:36.050
PROFESSOR: That's a
fantastic question.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.550
OK.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.770
Good.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.635
I was going to gloss over this.

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:38.390
That's a fantastic question.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.390
So here's the question.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.420
Look, I have in my box here,
I have a hydrogen atom,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.930
and I've quantized
the cooling potential,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.570
and I know what the energy
eigenvalues are for the cooling

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.007
potential, and I
put the electron

00:12:49.007 --> 00:12:49.965
in one of those states.

00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:52.550
And I say the wave function
describing my system as sign is

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.830
equal to phi [? nlm ?] for
some particular [? nlm. ?]

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.290
That's what we've been doing.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.740
But there are a lot of
electrons in the world.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.490
In fact, there are
electrons in the walls.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.870
There are electrons
in your nose.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.190
There are electrons everywhere,
and they are fermion.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.130
So the wave function
describing the entire system

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.530
must be invariant up to a sign
under the exchange of any two

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.030
electrons.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.571
If I take this
electron and I swap it

00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.070
with an electron
in Matt's ear-- Hi,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.450
Matt-- then the wave
function had better

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.840
pick up a minus sign.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.830
So what business do I ever have
writing a single wave function

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.924
for a single electron.

00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:24.840
Is that your question?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.524
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:27.190
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent question.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.590
So let me answer that.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.840
So suppose I have
two electrons, and I

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.749
have the wave function
for two electrons x and y.

00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:40.790
I mean, I write this as
if it's in one dimension.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.331
This is some position,
some position,

00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:45.450
but this generally is just an
arbitrary number of dimensions,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.500
and one is in the
state chi of x,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.344
and the other is in
the state phi of y.

00:13:50.344 --> 00:13:52.260
But I know that I can't
have this be the state

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.051
because it must be
invariant under swapping

00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:55.190
x and y of two minus signs.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.950
So I need minus
chi at y phi at x,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.672
and let's normalize
this, so 1 over 2.

00:14:03.672 --> 00:14:04.630
So that's our electron.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.740
Now, at this point,
you might really worry,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.785
because say chi is the electron
is the wave function bound

00:14:10.785 --> 00:14:13.970
to my atom, and phi is the wave
function for the electron bound

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.980
to an atom in Matt's ear.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.240
So we've just in writing this.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.232
Why can we do that?

00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:21.440
Well, let's think about this.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.920
What does the combination
of terms give us?

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.860
What do they tell us is that
they're interference term.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.010
If I ask them what's
the probability

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.120
to find an electron at
x and an electron at y,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.520
this is equal to, well,
it's this whole quantity

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.162
norm squared sine norm
squared, which is equal to 1/2,

00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:38.370
and then there's a term
where this gets term squared,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.203
this term squared, and
then two cross terms.

00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:42.350
So the first term
gives us the chi

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.210
at x norm squared phi
at y norm squared.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:52.815
The second term gives us plus
chi at y norm squared phi

00:14:52.815 --> 00:14:59.030
at x norm squared plus
twice the real part

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.330
of I'm going to write
this subscript chi

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:11.698
sub x phi y, complex conjugate,
complex conjugate chi y phi x.

00:15:11.698 --> 00:15:12.519
Everybody agree?

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.310
That's just the norm
squared of everything.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.980
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
that be minus?

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.350
PROFESSOR: Oh, shoot.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.640
Sorry.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.140
Thank you.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.840
Minus.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.740
Yes, minus.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.420
Importantly minus.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.930
Now, let's be a little
more explicit about this.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:31.995
Saying that chi is the state
localized at the hydrogen,

00:15:31.995 --> 00:15:33.620
then that's as if
the hydrogen is here.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.790
If the proton is here, then
the wave function for chi

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.470
has a norm squared
that looks like this.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.440
And if I say that phi is the
state corresponding to being

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:54.110
localized, at Matt's ear,
then here is the ear,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.560
and here is the wave function
for it, so that's phi.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.310
So let's then ask, what's
the probability that I find

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:10.410
the first electron here and
the second electron here?

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.834
Well, if this is
x, and this is y,

00:16:14.834 --> 00:16:16.250
what's the probability
that I find

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.380
a particle there and
a particle there?

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.420
Well, what's this term?

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.090
Well, it's chi of x, which
is not so small-- that's just

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.930
some number-- times phi of
y, some value norm squared,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.680
so this is some number.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.720
What about this one?

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.220
What's chi of y?

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.230
Well, chi of y, this is all
sharply-localized wave function

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.930
over here chi, and
it's 0 out here.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.260
The probability that an
electron bound to the hydrogen

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.400
is found far away is
exponentially small

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.790
as we've seen from the
wave functions of hydrogen.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.790
It's bound.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.650
So this is the negligibility
small as is phi of x.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.320
Phi of x is
negligibility do small.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.380
The wave function is
localized around the ear,

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.070
but x is way over
there by the hydrogen.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.190
It's exponentially small.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.032
This term is also
exponentially small.

00:17:00.032 --> 00:17:01.240
Now in here, what about this?

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.570
Chi of x phi of y, that's good.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.442
Those are both fine, but chi
of y phi of x phi of x, these

00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:10.650
are both negligibility small,
so these terms go away.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:18.119
So this is just equal to chi
of x norm squared phi of y norm

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:18.650
squared.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.990
And this is what you
would get approximately,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.930
and that approximately
is fantastically good

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.880
as they get far apart.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.020
This chi of x is
just the probability

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.270
that the particle that x
given that it was in the wave

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.850
function bound to the
hydrogen, and ditto given

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.480
that it was bound to the ear.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.642
Cool?

00:17:38.642 --> 00:17:40.850
So the important thing is
when fermions are separated

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.940
and the wave functions
are localized,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.300
you can treat them
independently.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.820
When the fermions
are not separated

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.964
or when their wave
functions are not localized,

00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:51.380
you can't treat
them independently

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.110
and you have to
include all the terms.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.201
That cool?

00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:55.700
OK.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.200
Yeah.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.142
AUDIENCE: That's
times 1/2, right?

00:17:58.142 --> 00:17:59.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that is times 1/2.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.718
What did I do?

00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:18.540
I'm screwing something up
with the normalization.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.450
Ask me that after lecture.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.360
It's a good question.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360
I'm screwing something up.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.568
I'm not going to get the
factor of 2 straightened out

00:18:23.568 --> 00:18:24.110
right now.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.610
OK.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.140
Does that answer your question?

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.640
OK.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.140
Good.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.640
This is a really deep-- it's
important that this is true.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.350
I'm going to stop
questions because I

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.210
need to pick up with
what we need to do.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.189
So this is a really
important question

00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:39.480
because if it weren't true
that you could independently

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.030
deal with these electron,
then everything we

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.600
did up until now in
quantum mechanics

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.180
would have been totally useless
for any identical particles.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.150
And since as far as we can
tell, all fundamental particles

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:53.366
are identical, this
would have been very bad.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.900
So with that, let's move
on to the study of solids.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.737
So I want to pick up where
your problem set left off.

00:19:05.737 --> 00:19:08.070
The last part of your problem
set, which I hope everyone

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.850
did, the left part
of your problem set

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.610
involved looking
at this simulation

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.340
from the PhET
people of a particle

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.800
in a series of n wells.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.610
And I want to look at the
result, at least the results

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.810
that I got for that simulation.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:35.730
So let's see, here
are the data points

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.930
that I got-- shall
I make that larger?

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.050
Is that impossible to see?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.160
Those are the data
points that I pulled off

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.102
of PhET just the
same way you did.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:48.810
You look, you point,
you move the cursor,

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.185
and you pull off
the data points.

00:19:50.185 --> 00:19:53.210
So those are approximately then.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.780
And this is for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 10 wells, and here's

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.350
the plot of them as a function
of the index which state they

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.020
are.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.373
So as a function, this
is the first state.

00:20:05.373 --> 00:20:07.500
This is the second state,
third, fourth, et cetera.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.610
Here are the
energies vertically.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.360
And hopefully, you all got
to plot some more of this

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.720
and they seem to become
bunched together,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:21.030
and the energy of the ground
state without the potential

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.800
was this.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.060
So I'm not going to add in
a parabola corresponding

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.190
to a free particle with
the associated wavelengths.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.470
Remember I asked you to
say take that state that

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.790
looks most like a momentum.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.580
eigenstate with a
definite wavelength

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.100
and calculate the energy
of a free particle

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.620
with the corresponding
wavelength.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.970
So this parabola-- I
should make this smaller--

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:50.851
is a parabola describing
a free particle which

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:53.350
agrees with those free particle
energies at the three points

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.933
where you're supposed
to compute them.

00:20:54.933 --> 00:20:56.070
So there's the parabola.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.403
And so what I've done here
is I've grouped them together

00:20:58.403 --> 00:20:59.610
into the bands of states.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.860
So vertically we have energy.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.260
On the horizontal
side, we have n

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.640
but remember that n is
also corresponding kind

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.250
to a momentum because each
state wiggles and especially

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.240
the states at the
top of each band

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.865
have a reasonably
well-defined momenta,

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:15.150
and so they look a lot
like momentum eigenstates.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.316
So I'm going to interpret
this horizontal direction,

00:21:17.316 --> 00:21:19.259
it's something like a momentum.

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:21.550
And at the top of the states,
it certainly makes sense,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.719
but then what it actually is
is just the number the level,

00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:26.260
and what we see is
that the energy is

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.240
a function of the level
is close-- near the top

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:37.100
anyway-- to the energy
of a free particle,

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.260
but the actual allowed
energies are bound.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.682
So which energies correspond
to allowed states,

00:21:42.682 --> 00:21:44.390
and which energies
have no allowed states

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.348
associate with them is
encoded in this diagram.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:47.610
Are we cool with that?

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.270
In this shaded region,
there are states

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.430
with an energy in that region,
at least approximately,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.850
and in this unshaded
region, there aren't any.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:01.410
And in each band, there
are n energy eigenstates,

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.040
and each band corresponds
to one of the bound

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.880
states of the potential.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.380
OK.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.530
Everyone cool with that?

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.655
So does this look more or
less like what y'all got?

00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:10.771
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:10.771 --> 00:22:11.520
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.020
OK.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.740
Questions about this
before I move on?

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.715
It's an important one.

00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:18.540
And let me just remind you of a
couple of facts about this PhET

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:24.120
simulation so here's what we
see if we have the single well.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.590
We have three states 1, 0, two
nodes, two zeroes, and they

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.262
satisfy the node theorem.

00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:33.470
If we have many states, then
if we look at the bottom

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.510
state in each well.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.200
So there's the bottom
state and the bottom band.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.990
It has no zeroes.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.550
It satisfies the node theorem,
and the top one by comparison

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.020
looks extremely similar.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.540
It looks extremely similar
to the ground state, which

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.910
is the orange one, the
lowest energy state.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.140
It is a little higher energy.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.560
You can see that because
the curvature is greater.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.529
If you look at the top and
bottom of each wave function,

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:02.070
you see that the
curvature is greater

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.860
for the yellow guy, which is
the guy at the top of the band,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.360
and the yellow guy,
meanwhile, looks

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.120
like a wave with a
definite wavelength.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.020
But a general state
in here doesn't

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.270
have any simple
symmetry properties.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.270
It's not periodic.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.720
It's not approximately periodic.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.720
Well, that one's kind of
approximately periodic.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.340
But the top guy
and the bottom guy

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.230
look approximately periodic.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.270
They have some nice
symmetry properties.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.280
But in general, they're just
not translationally invariant.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.196
They're not symmetric.

00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:30.300
They don't have any
simple, nice structure.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.780
They are just some
horrible, ugly things.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.060
The bottom though
and the top guy

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.680
always have some nice
symmetry property.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.160
Anyway to keep that in mind.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.340
And the last thing I want
you to note from all of this

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.550
is that as we make the
potential barriers stronger,

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.850
two things happen.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.920
First off, bands become very
narrow, the gaps between them

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.880
become very large, and
secondly, the wave functions

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.132
take now an even more sort
of complicated and messy,

00:24:01.132 --> 00:24:03.340
which is more obvious that
the wave functions are not

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.180
periodic.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.980
This thing it looks
almost periodic,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.900
but is periodic with
some funny period,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.250
and it's not a single period by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.120
OK.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.605
So any questions about the
wave functions in here?

00:24:16.605 --> 00:24:17.105
Yeah.

00:24:17.105 --> 00:24:23.886
AUDIENCE: In this one, there is
an overall [INAUDIBLE] period.

00:24:23.886 --> 00:24:24.386
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.435 --> 00:24:32.450
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.910
OK.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.940
So let me give you a little
bit of intuition for that.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.240
So suppose I have a big box.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.410
What's the ground state?

00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:46.792
What does the ground
state look like?

00:24:46.792 --> 00:24:47.140
Yeah.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:47.340
Good.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.130
Everyone's doing this.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:48.400
That's good.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.930
So the ground state
looks like this,

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.930
and the first excited
state is going

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:56.540
to do something like
this, and so on.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.040
Cool.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.250
And what's the third excited
state going to look like?

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.852
I guess I shouldn't do that.

00:25:04.852 --> 00:25:07.310
The third excited state is
going to do something like this.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.200
Cool?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.280
Now, meanwhile, imagine
I take my periodic well

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.370
and I add to it a bunch of
delta function scatterers

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.730
with some strength.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:26.330
When the strength is zero, I
just recover my original well.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.180
When the strength is
non-zero though, we

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.800
know that what a delta
function is going to do is,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.200
it's going to make
a little kink.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.840
It's going to induce
a little condition

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.850
on the first derivative
at the delta function.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.350
So what's going to
this ground state

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.070
when we turn a little tiny
bit of that delta function?

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.570
Yeah.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.945
What we're going
to get is, we're

00:25:41.945 --> 00:25:44.869
going to get
something that kinks

00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:46.160
at each of the delta functions.

00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:55.000
But it still has to have
those boundary conditions.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.530
Everybody cool with that?

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.512
And as we make the delta
function stronger and stronger,

00:25:59.512 --> 00:26:01.220
the effect of this is
going to eventually

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:07.910
be to give us something
that looks like-- yeah?

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.010
Now that should look
a lot like that.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.344
Everyone cool with that?

00:26:14.344 --> 00:26:16.510
Meanwhile, what's going to
happen to the second guy?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.340
Well the second guy, same thing.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:33.372
The effect on the second
state is going to be-- cool?

00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:35.080
I'm not sure of I need
the sound effects.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:41.170
So let's magnify and let's
look at the second state here.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.481
Ooh, it's going to be hard
to deal with that tiny energy

00:26:44.481 --> 00:26:44.980
splitting.

00:26:47.602 --> 00:26:49.824
Come on finger, you can do this.

00:26:49.824 --> 00:26:51.920
There we go.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.100
There is two.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.240
Ah-ha.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.690
That looks a lot like this.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.194
Yes, that second state looks
an awful lot like this.

00:26:59.194 --> 00:27:00.735
And let's go back
to that funny state

00:27:00.735 --> 00:27:02.026
that we were looking at before.

00:27:02.026 --> 00:27:04.040
Let' see if I can get it.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.970
Should be the third guy here.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.890
So there's a second
guy in the third band.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.720
Again, you see an envelope
and then the fluctuation

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.300
from being in the third
state and in the second state

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.270
in this band as well.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.790
So on the other hand, what's
the scale of the energy

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.280
splitting due to a
well of it this width

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.270
compared to the energy
splitting between states

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.350
due to a well of this width?

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.570
A wide well means that its
states are close together.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.980
An ENDOR well means the
states are far apart.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.179
So what state do we have?

00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:41.720
We have the state
that was the ground

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.990
state of the whole
box with a correction

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.060
due to the delta function
versus states which

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.150
are, for example, excited
states in the box.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:02.125
The splitting between
this state and this state

00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:04.000
is going to be much
larger than the splitting

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.145
between this state
and this state,

00:28:06.145 --> 00:28:07.777
just because this is
a tiny little well

00:28:07.777 --> 00:28:09.360
and so the link scale
is much shorter,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.630
the energy is much greater.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.900
That's the intuition you
should have from these guys.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.560
So when you see that there's
some approximate structure,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.310
let's see let's make this
nice and separated again.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:26.140
And Oh, yeah.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.579
these are kind of
difficult to control

00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:29.870
when they're so close together.

00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:42.617
The trouble with touch pads.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.600
There we go.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:46.900
OK.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.400
There we go.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.610
That was the guy we
were looking at before.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.670
And so you see that there
is an overall envelope which

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.020
has three maxima, and then
there's the n inside each well.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.340
It's got two zeroes
inside each well.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.935
And it's that envelope which
is coming from the fact

00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:04.290
that you're in a box
and the two zeroes

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.930
inside each well, which
is coming from this.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.910
All the states here in
this band are of the form

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.170
two zeroes inside the well.

00:29:17.982 --> 00:29:20.190
All the states here are the
form two zeroes is inside

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:25.970
each well in this
band except they're

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:30.120
being modulated by an overall
sine wave due to the fact

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.460
that they're in a box.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.990
And so they're
very closely split

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.480
states with a different
overall modulation

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.420
but with each state inside
each band corresponding

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.589
to either the ground state
for the individual well

00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:42.630
or the first excited state
in the individual well

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.290
or the second excited state.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.360
So each band corresponds
to which excited state

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.565
you are inside the well,
and which state you

00:29:48.565 --> 00:29:50.530
are within the band
is your modulation

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:55.950
of the overall wave
from being inside a box.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.750
That make sense?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.600
AUDIENCE: I guess so, but why
does the overall modulation

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.450
have a smaller effect than the--

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.320
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.110
If I have a well
that's this wide,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.480
what are the ground
state energies?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.450
And let's say the
width is L. What

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.457
are the energies in this square
well, an infinite well with L?

00:30:15.457 --> 00:30:16.915
Yeah, but what are
the eigenvalues?

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.150
PROFESSOR: E sub n.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:23.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.260
Exactly.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.634
So they go like, I'm just
going to write proportional to,

00:30:26.634 --> 00:30:30.230
n squared over L
squared, because it's

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:37.490
a sine wave with
period n pi upon L.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:41.610
So the k is n upon
L with constants,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.040
and that means that the energy
again, constant h squared k

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.145
upon 2n is k squared, which
is n square over L squared.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.020
But the important thing
is that the splitting

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.530
between subsequent energy levels
is controlled by the width.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.870
It goes like 1 over L squared.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.840
So if you have a very
wide well, the splittings

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.215
are very small,
the ground state.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:04.600
On the other hand, if you
have a thin, narrow well,

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.540
then the splittings
also go like L squared,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.873
but L is very small here so
the splittings are gigantic.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.800
When we have a superposition
of a big box inside of which we

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.400
have a bunch of barriers,
then the splitting

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.310
due to being excited
in the individual wells

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.267
goes like 1 over the
little distance squared.

00:31:24.267 --> 00:31:25.350
Let's call this a squared.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.600
So these go like 1 over a
squared, delta a delta E,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.210
goes like 1 over a
squared, and from here it

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:37.170
goes like if this is L, delta
E goes like 1 over L squared.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.670
So the combined effect is that
you get splittings due to both.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.000
These splittings are
tiny, and these splittings

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.416
are really large because this
is a much smaller distance,

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:46.874
and this is a much
larger distance.

00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:48.200
Cool?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.336
So the only question
is how big in amplitude

00:31:51.336 --> 00:31:53.210
are these-- how effective
are these barriers.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.918
If they were strict
delta functions, then

00:31:54.918 --> 00:31:56.669
this is all we would get.

00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:58.210
And if there were
no delta functions,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.310
we would just get
precisely these.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.954
And when we have
some barrier, we

00:32:01.954 --> 00:32:03.620
get a combination of
the two, and that's

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.502
what we're seeing here
with the splitting.

00:32:05.502 --> 00:32:07.710
So what I'm doing when I'm
tuning the separation here

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.730
I'm controlling effectively
how strong is that barrier.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.846
And so as we make the
barriers stronger--

00:32:13.846 --> 00:32:15.220
there we go-- then
the splittings

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.220
are controlled by
the individual wells,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.970
an as we make the
barrier very inefficient,

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:25.630
then the splittings are
controlled by the overall box.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.410
Cool?

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.080
Excellent.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.880
Other questions
about the simulation?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.380
Yeah.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.818
AUDIENCE: How close are
the actual [? wavelength ?]

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:37.071
potentials or the combinations
of the original wavelength?

00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:38.320
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.570
So you can answer that
immediately from this.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.540
So the question is this,
look, if we had arbitrarily

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.560
separated wells,
if we had something

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:56.060
that looked like-- so they're
very, very far separated.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.310
Then the ground state would
be effectively degenerate,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.396
because the wave function
or the ground state

00:33:02.396 --> 00:33:04.270
would be the completely
symmetric combination

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.240
of these guys--
you guys actually

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.510
studied this in our problem
set-- then there's also

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:12.172
a combination where you
have this, this, this.

00:33:12.172 --> 00:33:15.120
You could also take
this constant this.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.580
There are many
things you could do.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.119
I'm sorry, this,
many combinations.

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.660
The point is since
each wave function

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.990
for each well effectively
drops off to zero inside,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.710
we can just linear
combinations of these,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.860
and there's no penalty for using
the true ground seats in here

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.120
because the potential is so
high, that the true solution

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.620
has an exponential tail,
but that exponential tail is

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.710
ridiculously small if
the barrier is big.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.790
So in the limit that the
barriers are gigantic,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.360
the true energy eigenstates
are just arbitrary

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.500
linear combinations
of these guys,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.970
of the individual eigenstates
of each individual well.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.020
Agreed?

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.042
However, when the barriers
a large but finite,

00:33:57.042 --> 00:33:59.500
then the true energetic states
have little tiny exponential

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.700
tails, and the curvature of that
little tiny exponential tail

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.890
will determine exactly
what the energy is.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.285
So a state that curves a
little bit versus a state that

00:34:09.285 --> 00:34:14.230
curves more will have
slightly different energies.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.860
So when the barriers
are very, very large,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.020
the linear combinations of the
individual well eigenstates

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.134
should be very good
approximations, but not exact.

00:34:23.134 --> 00:34:25.989
And as the barriers become
less and less effective,

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.290
they should become
less and less exact,

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.040
and we can see that right here.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.290
So let's take the ground state.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.610
The bottom of the band is
the completely symmetric

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.210
combination of the
ground seat of each well.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.450
Everyone see that?

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.389
It's just well,
well, well, well.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.055
It's a completely
symmetric combination.

00:34:44.055 --> 00:34:47.350
At the top of the band
is the completely anti

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.217
symmetric combination, and
let's put them for comparison.

00:34:50.217 --> 00:34:51.800
The top of the band
is the orange one,

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800
and the bottom of the
band is the yellow one.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.380
So the bottom of the band
is the completely symmetric,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.070
and the top of the band
is alternating combination

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.560
of the ground
state in each well.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.340
And all the other states
inside here-- well,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.110
which are extremely
difficult to-- Let's see.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.670
There we go.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.105
These states are also linear
combinations of the ground

00:35:12.105 --> 00:35:14.640
state in each well with
different coefficients

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.500
in front of them.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.041
There are the
different coefficients,

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:19.260
and they are almost degenerate.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.049
But if we go to
higher energy states

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:23.340
where the barrier is less
effective-- because they have

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.215
high energy and the
ratio between the barrier

00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:27.770
height and their
energy is small--

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.660
then you see that these
states are not particularly

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.720
well approximated by
linear combinations.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.970
And the energies correspondingly
are not degenerating.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.270
AUDIENCE: So you said
linear combinations

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.089
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:43.130
PROFESSOR: That gives you
a better approximation,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.600
but for the same reason.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.925
It's a good approximation,
but it's not exact.

00:35:46.925 --> 00:35:49.300
But it becomes excellent as
the barriers become infinite,

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.950
even when they also go over
to the infinites very well.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:54.742
Very good question.

00:35:54.742 --> 00:35:55.241
Yeah.

00:35:55.241 --> 00:35:56.168
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:06.620
PROFESSOR: Very good question.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.080
We'll come to that
in little bit.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.940
We'll come to that shortly.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.555
So I'm done at the moment
with the PhET simulations.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.470
I'm motivated by all this, and
effectively by that question,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.011
I'm going to ask
the following thing.

00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:26.140
Look, real materials like metal
in my laptop, the real material

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.070
is actually a
periodic potential.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.720
It's built out of a
crystal of metal atoms

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.790
that are bound
together, and each atom

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.680
is some
positively-charged beast,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.700
to which some
positively-charged nucleus,

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.010
to which is bound an electron.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.100
And if I want to understand
properties of solids,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.380
like the fact that metals
conduct electricity,

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.569
a basic fact I'd
like to explain,

00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:50.610
if I want to explain the
fact that metals conduct

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.390
electricity, but
plastic doesn't, which

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.780
we will be able to explain, and
diamond doesn't, which is cool,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.280
if we want to explain
that property,

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.890
we probably ought to study
the physics of electrons

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.937
in periodic systems where
the potential is, atom,

00:37:04.937 --> 00:37:06.270
I don't want to be stuck to you.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.310
Atom, I don't want
to be stuck to you.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.851
Atom I don't want
to be stuck to you.

00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.849
So it's a periodic
well a potential.

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:13.640
So in order to study
the physics of solids,

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.040
I need to understand first
the physics of electrons

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.980
in periodic potentials.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.730
And these PhET simulations
were a first start at that.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.834
We did it n's wells.

00:37:21.834 --> 00:37:24.000
I want to now think about
what happens if I take not

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.580
n, but an infinite
number of wells.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.160
What if I really strictly
periodic lattice on the line?

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.930
What do we expect to happen?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.627
Well, looking at the results
of these PhET simulations,

00:37:33.627 --> 00:37:35.960
as you did this for different
numbers, n, what you found

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.460
was the same sort
of band structure.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.292
You just find for
more and more wells,

00:37:39.292 --> 00:37:41.250
you find more and more
states inside each band.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.142
In fact, you find n
states within each band.

00:37:43.142 --> 00:37:44.600
Both the top and
bottom of the band

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.577
quickly asymptote
to fixed values.

00:37:48.577 --> 00:37:50.660
As we take at large, what
do you expect to happen?

00:37:56.055 --> 00:37:57.930
Well, this was a problem
on your problem set.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:58.804
What did you predict?

00:37:58.804 --> 00:38:00.720
What should happen
when you take n large?

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.905
AUDIENCE: [? It ?]
depends on the experiment.

00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:03.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.940
How many states should
there be in each bend?

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.760
AUDIENCE: N.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.230
PROFESSOR: N. So there
are arbitrarily many.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.620
Exactly.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.953
So there should be arbitrarily
many states in each band,

00:38:09.953 --> 00:38:12.810
but they all have to fit within
this energy band, the width,

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.570
which is asymptoting
to a constant.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.050
So there has to be a
continuum of states,

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.050
and they're not going to
be free particle states

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.050
because the system
has a potential.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.300
What is the shape going to be?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.900
Well, a reasonable
guess is that the shape

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.960
is going to be something
that fills out this curve.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.585
It's going to be a
little bit different

00:38:27.585 --> 00:38:30.420
from the free particle state.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.070
So let's find out.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.500
Let's just solve the
problem of an electron

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.680
in a periodic
potential, and look,

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.010
the periodic
potential is extremely

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.790
similar to things
we've already solved.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.220
So I want to walk you through
just a basic argument.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.280
So periodic potentials.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.260
Instead of n wells,
consider a system

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:01.560
of an infinite number
of wells, each one

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:10.470
identical and just
for symmetry purposes.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:19.819
And let the width here be L, so
the period of the lattice is L.

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:21.235
And what I mean
by that is saying,

00:39:21.235 --> 00:39:23.740
so this is V of x
seeing that it's

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:29.080
periodic is the statement
as that V of x plus L

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.070
is equal to V of x.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.704
Potential doesn't change if I
shift it by a lattice vector,

00:39:37.704 --> 00:39:39.120
Now there's a nice
way to say this

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.560
which is that, if I take
the potential, v of x, and I

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.990
translate it by L, I get the
same potential back V of x.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.770
And more to the point,
if I take the translation

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.030
if I think of these as
operators expressions,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.040
if I take TL and
act on Vx and then

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:11.450
the potential of Vx f of x,
then this is equal to V of x TL

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.140
f of x.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.600
So if I think of these as
operators instead of just

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.210
little functions
operator, operator,

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.986
then if I take the
translator operator

00:40:19.986 --> 00:40:22.840
and I translate V of x f of x,
I'm going to get V of x plus L

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.260
f of x plus L. And if I
do the right-hand side

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.930
I get translator of L that's
f of x plus L but just times V

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:29.970
of x.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:35.110
But if V of x is equal to V of x
plus L-- this is V of x plus L.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.350
So if I translate by L says take
this thing and translate it,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.140
plus L f of x plus L. And
on the right-hand side,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.623
we have V of x, not V of
x plus L translate by L f

00:40:45.623 --> 00:40:52.750
of x, f of x plus L And these
are equal because V of x plus L

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.910
is equal to V of x.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.670
Yeah.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:00.250
So what that tells
you is as operators

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.180
translate by L and
V of x commute.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:08.700
Equals 0.

00:41:12.644 --> 00:41:15.040
Everyone happy with that?

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.610
So you should just be able
to immediately see this,

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:22.304
the potential is periodic with
period L if by translated by L,

00:41:22.304 --> 00:41:23.220
nothing should happen.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:29.530
So the potential respects
T of L it commutes with it.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.510
So this tells you a neat thing.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:40.730
Remember that translate by L
is equal to E to the i PL upon

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:46.440
H bar, so in particular,
TL commutes with P

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.870
because this is just a
polynomial in P dL P,

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:54.616
and in particular with
P squared is equal to 0,

00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:57.550
and that just follows
from the definition.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.290
So what that tells
us is that if we

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.040
take the system with
our periodic potential,

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:13.920
periodic V of x plus L
is equal to V of x, then

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.540
the energy, which is P squared
upon 2 m of V of x commutes

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.040
with TL.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:31.500
So in this system, with
a periodic potential,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.640
is momentum conserved?

00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:39.250
What must be true for
momentum to be conserved?

00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:45.230
So momentum conservation come
from a symmetry principle.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.604
AUDIENCE: Translation
invariance.

00:42:46.604 --> 00:42:48.112
PROFESSOR: Translation
invariance.

00:42:48.112 --> 00:42:49.570
In order for momentum
be conserved,

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.170
the system must be
translationally invariant.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.640
Is the system
translationally invariant?

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.140
No.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.660
If I shift it by a little
bit, it's not invariant.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.350
It is, however, invariant
under a certain subset

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:08.240
of translations, which
is finite shifts by L.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:08.740
Yeah.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.240
So it's invariant
under shifts by L,

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.140
which is a subset
of translations,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.720
and the legacy of that is
the fact that the energy

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.830
commutes with translations by
L. The energy does not commute

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:25.922
with P, Because P acting on V
of x, it takes the derivative

00:43:25.922 --> 00:43:27.130
and gives you the prime of x.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.070
It is not the same thing.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.640
But we have a subset
of translations

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.880
under which the system is
invariant, and that's good.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.729
That's less powerful than
being a free particle,

00:43:38.729 --> 00:43:40.770
but it's more powerful
than not knowing anything.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.230
In particular, it
tells us that we

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.450
can find energy eigenfunctions,
which are simultaneously

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.970
eigenfunctions of the
energy, and, I'll call it

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.790
Q for a moment, they have
an eigenvalue under TL.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.040
So we can find eigenfunctions
which are simultaneously

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.120
eigenfunctions the
energy operator you might

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.590
E of phi E is equal
to E phi Eq and which

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:09.000
are eigenfunctions under
translate by L on phi Eq

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.877
is equal to something
times phi Eq.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.290
So we're going to find
simultaneous eigenfunctions.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.290
Everyone cool with that?

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:19.790
Yeah.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.460
AUDIENCE: Do you know if the
momentum operator is still

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.722
the momentum operator?

00:44:25.722 --> 00:44:26.430
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.030
Say it again.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.990
AUDIENCE: The momentum operator
is still in remission, right?

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.298
The momentum operator is
still the momentum operator.

00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:32.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.760
AUDIENCE: Do you
know if [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.310
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:34.640
Excellent.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.020
Good Yes.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.520
OK.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.520
So if T of L is unitary,
note, T of L is unitary.

00:44:42.542 --> 00:44:44.750
And you actually showed this
on a problem set before,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.620
and let me remind you a
couple of facts about it.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.119
The first is that
T of L is unitary,

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:54.920
and that says that TL dagger is
equal to the identity, right?

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.150
But what is TL dagger?

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.180
TL dagger, well, P is
remission, so we just

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.090
pick up a minus
sign, so TL dagger

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:09.429
is equal to e to the
minus i PL over H bar,

00:45:09.429 --> 00:45:10.970
and we can do think
of this two ways.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.670
First thing you can
notice that it's clearly

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.086
the inverse of that guy, by
definition of the exponential,

00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:18.250
but the other is, TL is the
thing that translates you by L,

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.311
and this operator,
e to the minus i PL,

00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.810
well, I could put my H wit h
the and that's just translation

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.850
by minus L.

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.595
So this is translated by L and
then translated by minus L.

00:45:26.595 --> 00:45:28.095
And of course, if
you translate by L

00:45:28.095 --> 00:45:30.140
and then you
untranslate by L, you

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.759
haven't done anything
with the identity.

00:45:32.759 --> 00:45:33.800
What are the eigenvalues?

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.120
What are the form
of the eigenvalues

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.115
of a unitary operator?

00:45:36.115 --> 00:45:37.031
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:41.800
PROFESSOR: Well, that's true.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.258
The eigenfunctions
are orthonormal,

00:45:43.258 --> 00:45:45.190
but the eigenvalues,
are they real numbers?

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.665
So the eigenvalues of a unitary
operator are of the form,

00:45:52.665 --> 00:45:54.970
well, imagine we're in
a moment eigenstate,

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.920
for a momentum eigenstate,
then P is a real number.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.395
And then the eigenvalue of TL
is e to the i, the P over H bar,

00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:02.270
that's a real number.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.140
So is e to the i a real number?

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.390
That's a pure phase.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.630
It's e to i a real number.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.210
So the eigenvalues
are pure phases,

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.710
and this let's just
do a nice thing.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.270
We can note that here the
translate by L of the phi,

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.350
if these are common
eigenfunctions of E

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:21.380
and of TL, well, TL is
unitary, its eigenvalue

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.620
must be a pure phase, e
to the i a real number.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:30.550
So let's call that real number
alpha, e to the i alpha.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:37.504
So maybe just label this
by alpha for the moment,

00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:39.670
and you'll see why I want
to change this to q later,

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:43.634
but for the moment let's
just call it alpha.

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.302
Everyone cool with that?

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.510
So you actually show the
following thing on a problem

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.590
set, but I'm going to
re-drive it for you now.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.830
We can say something
more about the form

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.280
of an eigenfunction of
the translation operator.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.310
This is quite nice.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:04.190
So suppose we have
a function phi

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:08.596
sub alpha such that TL and i is
equal to e to the i alpha phi

00:47:08.596 --> 00:47:10.580
alpha.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.210
I want to know what is the form.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.240
What can I say about
the function phi f of x?

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.199
What can I say about the
form of this function?

00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:19.406
We can actually say something
really useful for this.

00:47:19.406 --> 00:47:21.532
This is going to turn out
to be necessary for us.

00:47:21.532 --> 00:47:22.990
The first thing
I'm going to do is,

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.640
I'm going to just make
the following observation.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.230
Define the function
u of x, which

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:35.820
is equal to e to the
minus i qx phi sub alpha.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.980
So if phi sub alpha is
an eigenfunction of TL

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.612
with an eigenvalue
e to the alpha,

00:47:40.612 --> 00:47:42.070
and I'm just defining
this function

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.200
u to be e to minus i
qx times phi sub alpha.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.882
Cool?

00:47:45.882 --> 00:47:46.840
It's just a definition.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.820
I'm going to construct
some stupid u.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.300
Note the following thing.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.410
T sub L on u, if we
translate u of x, this

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.010
is u of x plus L.
Translating this,

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.800
I get e to the i qx goes to
e to the minus i qx plus L,

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.070
which is just the e to the
minus i qx times e to the minus

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:13.620
i qL e to the minus i qx
plus L phi alpha of x plus L.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:19.460
But this is equal to from
here e to the minus i qL

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.140
e to the minus i qx.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.360
And from phi of x plus a, I know
that if I translate by a to get

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.280
phi of x plus L, I just pick
up a phase, e to the phi alpha,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:36.270
so e to the phi
alpha phi alpha of x.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:42.190
But this is equal to e
to the i alpha minus qL,

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.590
putting these two
terms together,

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:46.540
and this is nothing but u of x.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.877
Yeah.

00:48:50.877 --> 00:48:52.210
So another following cool thing.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:56.030
So here I define some function
u with some stupid value

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.760
q, which I just pulled
out of thin air,

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.310
and I'm just defining
this function.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:02.040
What I've observed is that if
I translate this function by L,

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.460
it picks up an overall phase
times its original value

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.537
where the phase depends
on alpha and on q.

00:49:07.537 --> 00:49:09.370
So then I'm going to
do the following thing.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.230
This becomes really simple if
I pick a particular value of q,

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:20.140
for a special value of q, q is
equal to alpha divided by L,

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.890
then this is equal to e
to the i alpha minus qL.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.896
That's going to be equal to e
to the i 0, which is just 1,

00:49:28.896 --> 00:49:30.395
so I have the phase,
so this u of x.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.310
So that means if I
translate by L on u

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:41.060
and I pick q is equal to
alpha over L, I get back u,

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.920
so u is periodic.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.360
Everyone see that?

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.640
Question?

00:49:53.640 --> 00:50:01.790
So as a result, I can always
write my wave function phi sub

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.190
e and we'll now call
this q or q is related

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.507
to alpha as q is
equal to alpha over L,

00:50:08.507 --> 00:50:11.090
every energy eigenstate can find
a basis of energy eigenstates

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:13.270
with a definite eigenvalue
under the energy,

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.190
a definite eigenvalue
under T sub L,

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.720
and I can write
them in the form,

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.920
since u is equal to e
to the minus i qx phi,

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.010
then phi is equal
to e to the i qx u e

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:31.990
to the i qx u of
x where q, where

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.180
the eigenvalue, e
to the i phi alpha,

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:40.235
is equal to e to the i qL
and u of x is periodic.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.760
Everyone cool with that?

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.500
It's not totally obvious how
much this is helping us here,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.311
but what we've done
is, we've extracted,

00:50:56.311 --> 00:50:58.060
we've observe that
there is some lingering

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.460
symmetry in the
system, and I've used

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.970
that symmetry to deduce
the form of the energy

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.785
eigenfunctions as
best as possible.

00:51:05.785 --> 00:51:07.660
So I haven't completely
determined the energy

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.270
eigenfunctions,
I've just determined

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.240
that the energy eigenfunctions
are of the form, a phase,

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.220
e to the i qx, so
it varies as we

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.510
change x, times a
periodic function.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.640
So the wave function
is periodic up

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.850
to an overall phase,
not a constant phase,

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.197
a position-dependent phase.

00:51:27.949 --> 00:51:29.240
Does everybody agree with that?

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.115
Questions about that?

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:45.120
So a couple things
to note about this q,

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.560
the first is, the eigenvalue
under TL e to the i alpha, this

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:57.170
is the eigenvalue under L
also equal to e to the i qL,

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:06.640
but if I take q to
q plus 2 pi over L,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:12.600
then nothing changes
to the eigenvalue,

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.580
because the 2 pi over
L times L is just 2 pi,

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:17.830
e to the 2 pi is 1, so we
don't change the eigenvalue.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.270
So different ways
of q only correspond

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.100
to different
eigenvalues of translate

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.740
by L of a translation
by one lattice vector,

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.920
one lattice basing.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.370
They only correspond to the
different eigenvalues of TL

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:35.982
if they don't differ
by 2 pi over L.

00:52:35.982 --> 00:52:37.940
If different values of
q differ by 2 pi over L,

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.450
then they really
mean the same thing

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:44.580
because we're just talking
about translate by one period.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:50.120
So q is equivalent to
q plus 2 pi over L.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.228
So that's just the
first thing to know.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.180
So what have we done so far?

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.450
What we've done so far
is nothing whatsoever

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:05.090
except extract, take advantage
of the translational symmetry

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.710
that's left, the
remaining lingering

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.370
little bit of
translational symmetry

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.460
to constrain the for of
the energetic functions.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.220
What I want to do now is
observe some consequences

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.690
that follows
immediately from this.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.106
So there are some
very nice things

00:53:16.106 --> 00:53:17.560
to follow just from this.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.920
We can learn something
great about the system

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.774
without knowing anything
else, without knowing anything

00:53:23.774 --> 00:53:25.690
about the detailed
structure of the potential.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.150
At this point, I've
made no assumptions

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.130
about the potential other than
the fact that it's periodic.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:30.550
So the thing I'm
about to tell you

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.765
were to be true for
any periodic potential.

00:53:32.765 --> 00:53:35.870
They follow only
from the structure.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.980
So let's see what they are.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:43.770
So the first one is
that the wave function

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.640
sine of x itself with
a definite value of e

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:55.660
and a definite value of
q is not periodic by L.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.640
Because under a shift
by L, u is periodic,

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.435
but this part picks up
a phase e to the i qL.

00:54:01.435 --> 00:54:04.060
That's what it is to say that an
eigenfunction, the translation

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.450
operator.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:10.700
It's not periodic by L
unless q is equal to 0.

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.110
So for q equals 0,
there is precisely

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.010
one wave function
which is periodic by L.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:23.500
Because if q is equal to
0, then this phase is 0.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.130
So only if is equal to 0 is
the wave function periodic.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.810
Cool?

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.850
So this should look familiar
because back in the band

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:39.581
structure, these guys
are not periodic.

00:54:39.581 --> 00:54:42.080
So these states in the middle
of the band, they're horrible.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:42.970
They're not periodic.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:47.720
They're some horrible things,
but that top guy in the band

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.660
is periodic, and it
turns out that if we

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.940
had made the system
infinitely large,

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.490
it would become
exactly periodic.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.677
The fact that it has an
envelope on it like this

00:54:55.677 --> 00:54:58.010
is just the fact that we have
an finite number of wells,

00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.969
we're in a box.

00:54:59.969 --> 00:55:02.260
If we got rid of that box
and we made many, many wells,

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.981
we would find it
perfectly periodic.

00:55:03.981 --> 00:55:04.480
Yeah.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.056
AUDIENCE: Could q not be
something like 2 pi over L?

00:55:07.056 --> 00:55:09.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but 2 pi
over L would be equal to,

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.970
it's equivalent to q
equals 0, because it

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.010
corresponds to the
same eigenvalue.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.615
So q's that differ
by 2 pi over L,

00:55:15.615 --> 00:55:16.990
I'm going to call
the same thing.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.531
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:18.664
Got it.

00:55:18.664 --> 00:55:19.330
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:22.240
Other questions?

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.160
So the wave function is
not periodic except for one

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.550
special case, and we already
have a guess as to which

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.340
special case.

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.548
It looks like it's the state
on the top of the energy

00:55:31.548 --> 00:55:34.300
band, which is
approximately periodic.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.930
Two, while the wave
function is not periodic,

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:40.020
the probability that you
find the particle at x plus L

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.520
is equal to the
probability that you

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.320
find the particle at x, and this
immediately falls in this form,

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.945
because when you take
the norm squared,

00:55:45.945 --> 00:55:47.450
the phis cancels
out at every point

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:50.110
and we're left with
the periodic u of x.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.660
So the probability
is equal to norm

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.070
squared of u of x, which is
equal to norm squared of u

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.780
of x plus L because
u is periodic.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.660
So probability
distribution is periodic.

00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:05.660
On the one hand,
this is reassuring,

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.770
because if you look
at the potential,

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.590
the potential is
perfectly periodic,

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.490
and it would be
really weird if you

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.582
could tell by some
probability, by some measure,

00:56:13.582 --> 00:56:15.540
like how likely you would
find an electron here

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.020
as supposed to over here,
potential is the same,

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.650
the probability should
be the same find

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.240
the electron in each spot.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:25.360
The problem with that logic
though, is that these are wells

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.500
and usually we think
that when we have wells,

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:31.310
we have bound states, and those
bound states are localized.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.590
But the probability has to be
invariant under translations,

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.170
so it cannot be that the
electron wave functions are

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.335
delocalized.

00:56:38.335 --> 00:56:40.560
The electrons wave
functions must

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.580
have equal overall amplitude
to be in any given well.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.620
It must be invariant
under translations

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.902
by a lattice spacing.

00:56:51.902 --> 00:56:52.860
So that's really weird.

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.530
We have a whole bunch
of quantum wells,

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:57.390
and yet there are
no localized states.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:59.580
All the states are extended
just like free particle

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:00.413
states are extended.

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.190
It had to be this
way by periodicity,

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.240
but it should surprise
you a little bit.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.250
Anyway it surprises me.

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:09.510
I shouldn't tell you
what to be surprised by.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.010
Yeah.

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.634
AUDIENCE: To normalize
probability, what do you do?

00:57:12.634 --> 00:57:13.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:13.670
Excellent.

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:14.020
OK.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.450
So this is for the same
reasons that free particle wave

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.070
functions aren't
normalizable, these

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.407
aren't going to be
normalized either.

00:57:20.407 --> 00:57:21.865
So what are we
going to have to do?

00:57:21.865 --> 00:57:23.230
AUDIENCE: Build wave packets.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.580
We've going to have
to build wave packets.

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.590
In order to really meaningfully
talk about that stuff,

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.339
we're going to have
to built wave packets.

00:57:28.339 --> 00:57:33.480
We need wave packets to
make normalizable states.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:37.620
But the localized wave
packets are necessarily

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.330
not going to be
energy eigenstates

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:41.667
just like for a free particle.

00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:43.250
And so there's going
to be dispersion,

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.833
and the whole story
that you saw three

00:57:44.833 --> 00:57:46.610
particles we're
going to see again

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.685
for the particles in
the periodic potential.

00:57:48.685 --> 00:57:49.185
Cool?

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.260
So next thing.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:04.460
Therefore, all phi
sub Eq extended.

00:58:07.824 --> 00:58:09.990
This is going to have some
really cool consequences,

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.619
and understanding
this fact in detail

00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:14.160
is going to explain to us the
difference between connectivity

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.510
in the middle and not
conductivity in plastic.

00:58:19.667 --> 00:58:21.539
Although there's a
surprising hook in there.

00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:23.580
Naively, it would have
gone the other way around.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.070
So the last thing
to say three, is

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:35.770
that phi sub to Eq, so this is
the state with definite energy

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:42.070
and definite eigenvalue under
translation E to the i qL Yeah.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:46.500
And you showed on a problem
set that if you take a wave

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.000
function, you multiply
it by E to the i qx, what

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.580
have you done to the expectation
value of the momentum?

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.980
AUDIENCE: You've
increased it by q.

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.170
PROFESSOR: You've
increased it by q, right?

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:55.180
This is the boost
it by q operation.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.690
So q incidentally has units
of a wave number, so times

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:02.800
h bar has units of a momentum.
q is like a momentum.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.660
Is q a momentum?

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.410
Well, we can answer
that question by asking,

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:12.100
is this an eigenfunction of P?

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.075
Is it an eigenfunction
a momentum operator?

00:59:14.075 --> 00:59:15.527
And the answer is
definitely not.

00:59:15.527 --> 00:59:17.485
That's an eigenfunction
of a momentum operator.

00:59:17.485 --> 00:59:21.370
I take a derivative, I get q
times i and I multiply by h

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:24.050
bar, I get h bar q,
momentum, but when

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.210
I have this extra
periodic function,

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.796
this thing together is no
longer an eigenfunction of q,

00:59:28.796 --> 00:59:31.170
because u is some periodic
function, which is necessarily

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:38.650
not a momentum eigenfunction.

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:40.740
So this guy is not a
momentum eigenfunction.

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.040
You can see that by just
taking the derivative.

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.850
I get one term that
picks up a q from this,

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.516
but I get another term that gets
a derivative with respect to u,

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:52.220
and that's not proportional with
the constant to u e to the i qx

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.110
unless u is in the
form e to the i kx.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.950
But if u is in the
form e to the i kx,

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.741
this is just a free
particle wave function,

00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:01.570
which it can't be if we
have a periodic potential.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:05.380
So finally q is not a
momentum eigenstate.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.705
And correspondingly,
q and more important

01:00:13.705 --> 01:00:27.300
h bar q is not a momentum, I'll
say the momentum in the sense

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.910
that it's not the eigenvalue
of the momentum operator.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:38.370
However, it has-- semi colon--
it has units of momentum.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:40.371
And not only does it
have units of momentum,

01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:42.620
it's the thing that tells
you how the state transforms

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.411
under translations.

01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:46.300
It translates by an e to the
i qL under translations by L.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.980
And there is usually
what momentum is.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.480
it's the constant
that tells you how

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.530
the state transfers
under momentum.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.740
So it's kind of like a
momentum, but it's not

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.407
the eigenvalue of the
momentum operator.

01:00:55.407 --> 01:00:56.323
We have a name for it.

01:00:56.323 --> 01:00:58.080
We call it the crystal
momentum, and we'll

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.700
understand what it does for us.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.970
Part of the goal for
the next two lectures

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:02.620
is going to be to understand
exactly what this crystal

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.415
moment is.

01:01:09.609 --> 01:01:11.150
So for the moment,
I'm just giving it

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.525
a name sort of
like the beginning

01:01:12.525 --> 01:01:14.390
we give super position
a name, and we'll

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.824
exploit its properties
basically now.

01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:20.240
So these are the things that
follow just from periodicity.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.031
I didn't know anything
about the potential.

01:01:22.031 --> 01:01:24.730
I just used periodicity.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.310
So before we move on to talking
about a specific potential,

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:30.170
you all have questions
about the general structure

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.920
of periodic systems like this.

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.530
Yeah.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.107
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between the psi

01:01:37.107 --> 01:01:37.386
and the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:38.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, excellent.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.381
I shouldn't have used psi,
I should have used phi.

01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:42.880
Thanks.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.190
I'll use psi only when we talk
about general super positions

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.214
and wave packets.

01:01:53.214 --> 01:01:53.880
Other questions?

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.120
All right.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:04.550
So with all that, let's talk
about a specific potential.

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.050
So far we've extracted
about as much

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:07.508
as of the physics
out of the system

01:02:07.508 --> 01:02:09.437
that we can just
from periodicity.

01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:11.103
In order to make more
progress, in order

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:14.410
to talk about, for example,
what are the allowed energy

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:17.920
eigenvalues and for that matter,
how does that allowed energy

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.404
eigenvalue depend on q,
the crystal momentum,

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.070
in order to answer
that, we have to talk

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.195
about a specific system.

01:02:23.195 --> 01:02:25.320
So let's go ahead and talk
about a specific system.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.365
I'm going to pick my favorite.

01:02:26.365 --> 01:02:27.893
Now the problem
set, you're going

01:02:27.893 --> 01:02:30.000
to do something really
cool about it, which

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.330
I'll explain in a moment.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.890
So you'll do a general
case in the problem set,

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.890
but for the moment, let's
work with a simple example.

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.264
And the simplest
example is going

01:02:36.264 --> 01:02:38.540
to be a periodic potential
with the simplest

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.580
possible barriers
in the potential.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.330
What's the simplest barrier?

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.030
Delta function.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.530
Yes.

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:48.820
So the potential is going
to be for this example

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:56.930
V of x is equal to sum from n
is equal to minus infinity of h

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:05.560
bar squared over 2mL g
naught delta of x minus nL.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.350
So what is this?

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.944
So this is just some
overall constant out front.

01:03:08.944 --> 01:03:10.610
Normally we call this
V naught, but I've

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:12.390
made g naught dimensionless
by pulling out

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.715
an h bar squared over 2nL.

01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:16.760
L is the spacing
between delta barriers.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.710
So the potential
looks like this.

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:20.436
Here is 0.

01:03:20.436 --> 01:03:21.810
We have a delta
function barrier.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:25.805
We have a delta function barrier
L. We have a delta function

01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:31.019
barrier at 2L, dot, dot,
dot, minus L, dot, dot, dot.

01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:32.060
So there's our potential.

01:03:34.522 --> 01:03:36.730
And I want to know what are
the energy eigenfunctions

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.396
for a single particle
in this potential.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:51.138
And again, g naught is
the dimensionless strength

01:03:51.138 --> 01:03:52.110
of the potential.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.520
So how do we solve this problem?

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.490
Well, we've done
this so many times.

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.300
What we see is that in
between each barrier,

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.730
the particle is just free, so
we know the form of the wave

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.420
function between each
barrier, it's just

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.430
e to the i kx plus 2
minus e to the minus i kx,

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:14.730
where k is defined
from the energy h bar

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.479
squared k squared upon 2n is e.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.770
At the barrier, we have to
satisfy appropriate matching

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:20.660
conditions.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.287
So I could put a and b here
and c and d and e and f.

01:04:23.287 --> 01:04:25.620
And under each one of these
imposed boundary conditions,

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.390
and this is going to be an
infinite number of coefficients

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.560
with an infinite number
of boundary conditions.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.820
And that sounds like it's
going to take some time.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.870
But we can use
something really nice.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.160
We already know that the
wave function is periodic.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:43.020
So suppose between 0 and
L, let's say less than x,

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:48.100
less than L the wave
function phi takes the form,

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.480
and we know that phi of eq
takes the form e to the i qx,

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.220
and now some periodic
function, which

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:59.474
would write as a e to
the i kx-- actually,

01:04:59.474 --> 01:05:00.640
I'm not going to write that.

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.330
So in between 0 and L,
it's a free particle,

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.680
and it's equal to A e to the
i kx plus B e to the minus

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.150
akx, where k is defined
purely from the energy h bar

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.942
squared k squared
upon 2m is the energy.

01:05:17.942 --> 01:05:19.150
So this is what we mean by k.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.910
And in between 2L it will
take the similar form,

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.520
but what we can do
is, we can define,

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:33.090
so this is sine of x,
between L less than x less

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:38.020
than 2L phi eq is
equal to-- well,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.620
I could define it
with new constants,

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.050
but I know what it has to be
because whatever the value is

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:46.120
here it's the same as the
value here up to a shift by L

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.390
the translation to
phase e to the i qL.

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:50.580
So this is equal
between L and 2L,

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.480
it's equal to e to the
i qL and periodicity

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.750
condition, the same
thing, A plus B,

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.672
with the same coefficients.

01:05:59.672 --> 01:06:00.910
Everyone cool with that?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.367
So I can now translate,
so let's think

01:06:06.367 --> 01:06:07.950
about what the
boundary conditions are

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.175
going to have to be.

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:12.200
At each of the delta functions,
the delta function boundary

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.120
condition is going to say that
the slope here minus the slope

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.880
here is something proportional
to the amplitude here.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.992
And the slope here is going to
be minus something proportional

01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:21.700
to the amplitude.

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:28.260
But the slope here is the
same as the slope here up

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.110
to an overall phase
from the translation.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:34.055
And the slope here is the same
as the slope here up to a phase

01:06:34.055 --> 01:06:35.620
coming from the translation.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.800
So we can now turn this
into instead of this,

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.807
the condition between
the slopes here

01:06:38.807 --> 01:06:41.348
and here, I can turn that into
a condition between the slopes

01:06:41.348 --> 01:06:42.300
here and here.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:42.800
Wow.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.617
This is horrible.

01:06:43.617 --> 01:06:44.950
Here are my two delta functions.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:48.310
The slope here and here, the
boundary condition I put at 0,

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.670
I can translate this
into the slope here up

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:54.660
to an overall phase
e to the i qL.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.510
So I can turn the
boundary condition here

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:58.301
into a boundary condition
between these two

01:06:58.301 --> 01:07:00.630
guys inside one domain.

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:02.380
And so I can turn this
into a problem that

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.940
just involved A and
B and that's it.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.190
Everyone see that?

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.529
So let's do it.

01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:09.570
So questions on the basic
strategy at that point?

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:14.320
So let's do it.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.570
So what we need is we got
the general form of the wave

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.470
function, and I'm going to erase
this because we don't need it.

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.220
Got the general form
of the wave function,

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.450
and then we need to
impose the boundary

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:24.074
conditions of the
delta function.

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.990
And in particular, let's
just impose them at 0

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:27.450
because imposing
them at 0 is going

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:29.120
to be equivalent to
imposing them everywhere

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.453
else by periodicity if I use
the periodicity of the wave

01:07:31.453 --> 01:07:32.840
function.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:39.440
So the boundary conditions
at the delta functions.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.010
So the first is
that phi at 0 plus

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.895
is equal to phi at
0 minus, so this

01:07:43.895 --> 01:07:46.550
is a statement that the
wave function is continuous.

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:50.767
But phi at 0 minus is equal
to-- well, that's this point.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.100
But this point is the same
as this point except the wave

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.190
function picks up a
phase e to the i qL.

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:59.440
This is equal to phi
at L minus, right here,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.602
times e to the i qL.

01:08:01.602 --> 01:08:03.686
And we have to be careful
because the statement is

01:08:03.686 --> 01:08:05.851
at the wave function here,
is the wave function here

01:08:05.851 --> 01:08:06.660
time e to the i qL.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.243
So the wave function here times
the wave function here times e

01:08:09.243 --> 01:08:10.400
to the i qL minus.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:28.630
And this leads to phi zero
plus-- the value right here--

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:32.589
is A plus B because it's just
this wave function evaluated

01:08:32.589 --> 01:08:34.779
at x equal 0, and
this guy at L is

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:36.649
going to be this
evaluated at x is

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:39.520
equal to L times e
to the minus i qL.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:49.062
So this is equal to A e to
the i k minus qL plus B e

01:08:49.062 --> 01:08:56.040
to the minus i k plus L, So
there's my first condition.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.700
Second boundary condition
is the derivative condition,

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.120
and the derivative
condition is that phi prime

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:06.930
at 0 plus minus phi
prime at 0 minus

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:11.545
is equal to g naught
upon L phi at 0.

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:23.540
And this gives me that ik A
minus B. So that's this guy,

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.870
and now the derivative
of the second guy

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:30.359
picked up our extra
phase minus ik A

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:36.340
e to the ik minus q L
minus B e to the minus ik

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.734
plus qL-- this is
all in the notes

01:09:39.734 --> 01:09:41.609
so I'm not going to
worry too much about it--

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:45.580
is equal to, on the right-hand
side is g naught upon L A

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:50.520
plus B.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.225
So now note the following
properties of these equations.

01:09:53.225 --> 01:09:55.600
These equations determine an
equation, so from the first,

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.760
I'll call this 1,
and I'll call this 2.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.570
So 1 implies that A is
equal to B times something.

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.920
It's just a linear equation.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.107
So if we pull the side
over, put this over here,

01:10:10.107 --> 01:10:11.440
A is equal to B times something.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.580
Everybody agree with that?

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:20.070
Some horrible expression
of k and q times.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:25.680
And 2 also gives an expression
form A is equal to B times

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.350
a horrible expression in terms
of k and q but a different one.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:34.360
Call this expression 1,
I'll call this expression 2.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.480
So as usual, so this is
two different expressions

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.490
for A given B and
this only makes

01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:42.760
sense it's only a solution if
these two horrible expressions

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.374
are equal to each other.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.415
And so this is what we've
done many times before,

01:10:46.415 --> 01:10:48.210
and if you've set these two
expressions equal to each other

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.780
and do a little bit
of trigonometry,

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.530
you get the following relation.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:11:03.250
Cosine of qL is equal to
cosine of kL plus g naught

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:06.010
upon 2kL sine kL.

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:13.770
Where what k means is nothing
other than the square root

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.780
of 2ne upon h bar.

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.030
k is defined from that
relation, and what q means is q

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.170
is the eigenfunction or
e to the i qL anyway,

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.230
is the eigenfunction
of the wave function

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:29.534
under translation by L.

01:11:29.534 --> 01:11:31.450
So k is really playing
the role of the energy.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.710
Everyone cool with that?

01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:40.720
I just skipped the algebra, but
if you do the horrible algebra

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.070
from setting these
two expressions

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:43.390
equal to each other,
then you get this.

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.889
Yeah.

01:11:43.889 --> 01:11:46.257
AUDIENCE: Is q some like
undetermined thing as of right

01:11:46.257 --> 01:11:47.430
now, or do we know--

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.740
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.670
What values of q are
allowed by this expression?

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.420
Is exactly the right
question to ask here.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.530
What values of q's are
allowed for our wave function?

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.470
Is there any condition on
what the value q is so far?

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.850
No.

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:08.640
It could have been
absolutely any number.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.330
For any number q, we
can find a eigenfunction

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.860
to translate by L, e to the i
qL as the eigenvalue, any value

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.360
of q.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.720
However, q is equivalent
to q plus 2 pi upon L.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.386
If you skipped by
2 pi over L, then

01:12:22.386 --> 01:12:24.010
it's not really a
different eigenvalue.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:25.590
It's the same eigenvalue.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:26.625
So q is defined.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:30.000
It's any continuous number
between let's say minus

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.030
pi over L and pi over
L for simplicity,

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.635
make it nice and small. i
could have said 0 and 2 pi.

01:12:34.635 --> 01:12:37.860
It doesn't make any difference,
minus pi and pi over L.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.800
So q is a free parameter.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.210
So there exists a state.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:50.470
Another way to say this
is that there exist states

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:53.930
and in particular eigenstates
for any value of q,

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:59.740
for any q, and any e, so
for any value of q and e

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:04.075
which satisfy this equation
corresponds to a state.

01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:06.450
There exists states for any
q E satisfying this equation.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:11.810
Cool?

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.614
This is just like
the finite well.

01:13:14.614 --> 01:13:16.030
In the case of the
finite well, we

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:18.790
go through exactly
the same analysis

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:20.960
the only difference is
that we don't have the qL.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.672
What happens in the
finite well case

01:13:23.672 --> 01:13:25.630
we impose a boundary
condition off in infinity.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:27.140
So the thing has normalized,
and we put another boundary

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.870
condition in infinity,
and what we ended up

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:31.536
getting is something of the form
roughly 1 is equal to something

01:13:31.536 --> 01:13:32.960
like this.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.240
It's actually not exactly
that, but here we have kL,

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.823
and if you combine
these two together,

01:13:36.823 --> 01:13:39.690
you get something kL plus
a phase shift over kL

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:40.470
and then a 1.

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:42.830
If you multiply, you get
kL is equal to cosine

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.410
of kL plus a phase
shift, which is exactly

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:48.510
the form for the
delta potential.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.210
Good.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:54.160
So this is similar.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.630
However, here we have
an extra parameter q,

01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:59.790
which is free to vary.

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:04.390
q could be anything between
minus pi over L and pi over L

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:07.020
So what does cosine
of qL turn into?

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.725
Well, it's anything qL can
take q is 2 pi upon L or pi

01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:14.560
upon L to minus pi over L. So qL
can go between pi and minus pi,

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.620
so cosine of qL
varies between cosine

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.180
of pi, which is 1 and cosine
of minus pi, which is minus 1.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.320
So any value of cosine
of qL between 1 minus 1

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.200
is a valid value of
qL On the other hand,

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.780
if this is equal to
7, is there a q such

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.123
that this is equal to 7?

01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:31.379
No.

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:33.920
So what we need to do now is,
we need to solve this equation,

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.270
but it's obviously a god
awful transcendental equation.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.669
So how do we solve horrible
transcendental equations?

01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:39.585
AUDIENCE: Graphically.

01:14:39.585 --> 01:14:40.660
PROFESSOR: Graphically.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.909
So let's solve it graphically.

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:54.400
So to solve it graphically, that
lets plot the left-hand side

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.670
and the right-hand side
as a function of qL

01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:01.510
So in this direction, I'm
going to plot cosine of qL.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:04.170
That's the left side.

01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:07.250
And cosine of qL we know is
going to vary between plus 1

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:08.890
and minus 1.

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:17.760
Because q between q
is equal to pi over L,

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:24.020
and q is equal to
minus pi over L.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.860
And in the horizontal
direction, I'm going to plot kL.

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.990
And when kL is 0, remember that
the definition of kL is that E,

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.695
the energy eigenvalue
is equal to h

01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:41.990
bar squared k squared upon 2m.

01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:44.260
And what we're looking
for are points,

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.510
are any common solution to
this equation where there's

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:48.165
a value of q and a
value of E of k such

01:15:48.165 --> 01:15:50.290
that these two expressions
are equal to each other.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:50.758
Yeah.

01:15:50.758 --> 01:15:51.694
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:55.906 --> 01:15:56.650
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:59.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:59.325 --> 01:16:01.010
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.960
Thank you.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.030
This is qL is equal to
0 and qL is equal to pi.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.210
Thank you.

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:10.710
Yes.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.530
Are there types of
other questions?

01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:22.802
So kL equals 0 is going to
be equal to 0, k equals 0,

01:16:22.802 --> 01:16:24.510
and this is going to
be a function of kL.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:25.570
I'm going to plot it
as a function of kL

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:26.778
because that's what shows up.

01:16:26.778 --> 01:16:30.040
But remember that k is
nothing but code for E.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.410
And so what we're looking
for a common solutions

01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:33.510
of that equation.

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.110
Now let's first just plot.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:39.010
So if this is 0, let's
just plot cosine of kL,

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:43.372
the right-hand side cosine of kL
plus g naught over 2kL sine kL.

01:16:43.372 --> 01:16:47.230
And let's do this first
for the free particle.

01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:50.030
Oh, I wish I had colored chalk.

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:56.051
For the free particle, free is
going to be g naught equals 0.

01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:57.634
There is a potential
and the potential

01:16:57.634 --> 01:16:59.220
is 0 times the delta
function, which

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.400
is not so much delta function.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.660
So for free particle
when g is equal to 0,

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.190
that second term
vanishes, and we

01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:13.420
have cosine of qL is
equal to cosine of kL.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.670
Kale, if you fry
it, it's crispy.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.544
So what is that going to be?

01:17:18.544 --> 01:17:19.960
Well, this has an
obvious solution

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:27.440
which is that q is equal
to k, but the problem

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.860
is, q is only defined up to 2
pi over L, so mod 2 pi over L.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.990
Well, let's see what
this looks like in here.

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:38.230
So for the free particle
what does this tell us?

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:41.320
So for the free particle,
let me just write this

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.270
as therefore, q is equal
to L or q is equal to k,

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:48.010
and therefore E is equal
to h bar squared is

01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:50.430
equal to q squared.

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:54.850
So any q or E are allowed
such that q squared

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:58.192
is equal E times 2
upon h bar squared.

01:17:58.192 --> 01:17:59.650
So that's just the
usual condition.

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:03.030
It's the free particle has
energy h bar squared k squared

01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:06.245
upon 2n, and we just chose
to call it k equals q.

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:08.370
So what we're doing is
instead of organizing things

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.800
as momentum eigenstates
of the free particle

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.310
or organizing the free particle
energy eigenstates in terms

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:13.570
of transient by L eigenstates.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:14.236
Perfectly valid.

01:18:14.236 --> 01:18:16.750
It commutes with
the energy operator.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.250
What does this look like?

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:22.060
Well, cosine of kL is cosine
of qL, when k is equal to 0,

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:25.080
q is equal to 0.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:25.850
So we get this.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:40.630
And the points, when the
points where qL is equal to pi

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:44.820
or minus 1, these
are the points where

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:55.160
we get the qL is equal to n pi
or equivalently plus or minus

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.060
kL is equal to n pi
plus or minus n pi.

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:02.310
So this is n is
1, n is 2, n is 3.

01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:04.210
Everyone cool with that?

01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:14.996
And these guys are 2 pi
times n or 2n plus 1 2n pi.

01:19:14.996 --> 01:19:19.410
And I really want this
to be odd, so n odd.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:24.400
And this is n pi kL
so n pi for n even.

01:19:31.013 --> 01:19:32.940
Everyone cool with that?

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:36.194
So that's what it would look
like for a free particle.

01:19:36.194 --> 01:19:38.110
What happens if we don't
have a free particle?

01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:42.060
What happens if we have
the interacting potential?

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:46.840
So now let's have g
naught equal to 1 or 0.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.560
And again, here is plus 1.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.310
Here is minus 1.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.570
And we're plotting
as a function of kL.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:01.026
And now it changes,
so let g naught

01:20:01.026 --> 01:20:02.990
be a small, positive number.

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:05.980
If g naught is a small, positive
number, then near k goes to 0.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.720
Sine goes like it's argument,
and so that means kL over kL

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:15.730
we get cosine of 0, which
is 1, plus g naught over 2.

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:18.730
So at 0, the value of
the right-hand side

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:21.150
is greater than 1.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.950
Is there an energy eigenvalue
with energy equal to 0?

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.630
No.

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.880
We have to wait until
cosine gets sufficiently

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.670
small and sine is increasing,
so what does this curve do?

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:36.950
It looks like this.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.910
It's again periodic with
the appropriate period,

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.760
but the amplitude
of the deviation

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.109
from the free particle
is falling off

01:20:52.109 --> 01:20:53.650
as we go to higher
and higher values.

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:58.200
So we've taken this
point and pushed it out.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.450
So what does this tell us?

01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:01.830
Well, remember that there
is an energy eigenfunction

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:07.290
with a given q and remember
this is cosine of qL,

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:08.540
there is an energy eigenvalue.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:11.360
There exists an
energy eigenstate

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:24.630
with an e and TL eigenstate
for any E and q such

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:30.386
that there exists a solution.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:31.510
And so what does that mean?

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:35.000
Well, is there an energy
eigenvalue with this value of E

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.630
or this value of k?

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:38.340
No.

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:38.839
Right?

01:21:38.839 --> 01:21:41.880
Because here's the right-hand
side and the left-hand side

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.254
is any value in here.

01:21:43.254 --> 01:21:44.920
There's a q for which
any left-hand side

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.367
is any value between
1 and minus 1.

01:21:47.367 --> 01:21:49.950
So there's no value of q you can
pick so the left-hand side is

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:54.680
equal to the right-hand
side for the value of k.

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.990
And similarly here,
here, here, here, here,

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:59.286
specifically for this
value of k or this value

01:21:59.286 --> 01:22:04.160
of the energy, E minimum,
there's one value of q.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.910
This one. q is equal to 0 where
there is an energy eigenstate.

01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:12.520
So there's a minimum
energy in the system.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.900
What about for this
value of energy?

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:16.400
Yeah.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.940
There's exactly
one solution there,

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.170
and actually if
you're careful, it's

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.595
2 because it's the
cosine of qL. q

01:22:20.595 --> 01:22:22.150
could have been
positive or negative.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:29.480
So we have a solution here
with this value of energy

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.149
and with this
value of cosine qL.

01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:34.690
Any q that gives us this value
of cosine qL is going to work,

01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:36.539
and that's one of two values.

01:22:36.539 --> 01:22:38.080
And similarly for
each of these guys,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:42.570
there's a state for every
value of energy in this region

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:48.840
until we get here, and when we
get here, this is E maximum.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.605
If we go to any higher
energy, any higher k,

01:22:51.605 --> 01:22:54.230
then there's no solution for any
value of q and any value of E.

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:56.900
So what we get are these
bands, continuous bands

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.550
for any energy separated
by gaps and then again

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:07.600
continuous bands for any energy
and bands for any energy.

01:23:11.584 --> 01:23:13.000
So all of these
shaded in regions,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.770
any energy in this
region corresponds

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:18.010
to a state and similarly here.

01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.760
So here's the
upshot of all this.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.230
We're going to study the details
of this in detail next time.

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:32.120
When we have a
periodic potential,

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:35.510
every energy
eigenfunction is extended

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.150
through the entire material.

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:38.970
Every energy
eigenfunction is extended

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.090
across the entire lattice.

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:41.900
None of them are localized.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.410
And that's like a free particle.

01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:46.540
However, not every energy
is an allowed energy.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.150
Only some energies are allowed.

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.250
Some energies do not
correspond to allowed energy

01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.670
eigenfunctions eigenvalues,
and some energies do.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.100
And they come in continuous
bands of allowed energies

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.860
and continuous gaps of
disallowed energies.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.760
And it's going to turn out to be
exactly this structure of bands

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.480
and gaps, or band gaps,
that is going to give us

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.170
the structure of
conductivity in metals

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.670
and explain to us why we don't
have conductivity in plastic.

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.280
We'll pick up on that next time.
