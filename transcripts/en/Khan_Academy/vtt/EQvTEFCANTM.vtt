00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.410
Let's review the Calvin
cycle a little bit.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.410
Maybe I'm going to go into a
little bit more detail than

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.470
the last video.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.110
And by doing that, we'll be
able to appreciate an

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.480
inefficiency, or what we think
is an inefficiency that occurs

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.640
in many photosynthetic plants.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.350
So just to review the Calvin
cycle, you start

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.500
off with some CO2.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.950
In the last video, I had six
molecules of CO2 and six

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.150
molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.590
But in this one, just to show
you that I could have

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
literally just divided that last
cycle by two, I'm going

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.210
to start with three and three.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.640
Three molecules of
carbon dioxide.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.150
Three molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.020
If you don't remember what
ribulose bisphosphate was, it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.410
was just a 5-carbon molecule.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.090
It had two phosphates on it.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.800
I can draw the phosphates.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.510
So you have a phosphate there.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.070
And you have a phosphate
there.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.680
And we saw on the last video--
and here I'm going to do a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.420
little bit more detail.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.740
Of course carbon dioxide,
there's only one carbon.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.319
I can just draw a carbon
like that.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.300
I mean, I don't want to draw
the oxygens right now.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.520
I just want to focus on just
the carbons and maybe the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.450
phosphates.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.210
But in the last video we saw
that these two merged.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.070
Or these two reacted.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.950
They reacted in the presence
of ribulose bisphosphate

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.180
carbocylase, which
is this enzyme.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.230
It was that big protein that I
showed you in the last video.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.420
And it's called RuBisCo
for short.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.390
So I'm going to write RuBisCo
in the middle

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.360
of this whole cycle.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.690
Because all of this is going
on with the RuBisCo enzyme.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.735
These molecules are joining on
to the RuBisCo enzyme and then

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:43.860
the ATP and the NADHs are
reacting on different parts.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.810
And that's essentially what's
driving the whole reaction.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.640
So you have all of this is
happening with that big

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.370
RuBisCo protein, or enzyme, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.380
And this just stands for
ribulose bisphosphate

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.740
carboxylate.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
So it essentially telling you
that it merges a carbon onto

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.200
ribulose bisphosphate.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.450
And the last video, I just did
a very hand-wavey, I didn't

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.460
show you all of the
intermediates.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.880
But I showed you, look, if in
this situation you end up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.570
using six ATPs and six NADHs,
you'll end up with

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.580
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.440
Or G3P.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.030
Or that's also called
phosphoglyceraldehyde so you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.330
can also write it as PGAL.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.790
But a very easy way to visualize
it as just a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.930
3-carbon chain with
a phosphate.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930
With a phosphate group.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.630
And the last video when I
started with six carbon

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.600
dioxides and six ribulose
bisphosphates.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.070
And I ended up with
12 of these.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.770
Now I have three and three.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.320
Now I'm going to end up
with six of these.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.810
So I'm going to end
up with six G3Ps.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.110
And the math works out, right?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.720
I have three carbons plus three
times five carbons.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.100
That's a total of 18 carbons.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250
And here I have six times
three carbons.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.700
Or 18 carbons.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.115
And that's what I showed you in
the last video, but there

00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:08.120
are actually some intermediary
steps.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.720
So the very first thing that's
actually formed is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.970
3-phosphoglycerate.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.190
And the whole reason why I'm
showing you this detail, and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.380
maybe you're taking a biology
class where they actually go

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.400
into this level of details, is
I want to show that this

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.270
compound also gets produced in
that inefficient cycle that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.970
we're going to explore
in this video.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.210
So you get 3-phosphoglycerate,
which is

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.390
also a 3-carbon chain.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.640
But it's a different
one than this.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.530
And this isn't ready to produce
glucose just yet.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.790
But you could also imagine that
as a 3-carbon chain with

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.360
a phosphate group.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.260
And then, and course you're
going to produce six of these.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.900
Just to make sure all the carbon
gets accounted for.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.205
You have 18 carbons here, you
have 18 carbons here.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:56.830
So you're going to
have six of these

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.580
3-phosphoglycerates get produced.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.600
And then each of those gets
a phosphate from ATP.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.990
So you're going to have
six ATPs come in.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.460
Remember these ATPs got
produced in the light

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.470
dependent reactions that occur
in the membrane of our

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.130
thylakoids.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.180
Anyway, we have these ATPs.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.000
You have six ATPs.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820
And then they become six ADPs.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.780
So essentially they have given
away their phosphate groups.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.040
So they're going to give one
phosphate group to each of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.100
these six 3-phosphoglycerates.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.870
And then you're going to end
up with this, right here.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.920
I'm running out of space.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.640
Maybe I didn't do it as neatly
as I should have.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.240
But you're going to end up with
this three chain carbon,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.580
or 3-carbon compound.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.790
It's going to have two
phosphates then.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.920
And this, you could
know the name.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.170
This is 1 3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.890
This was just
3-phosphoglycerate, which

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.220
means that the phosphate
is on the third carbon.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.190
Now we have 1
3-bisphophoglycerate.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.160
We have a phosphate on the
1-carbon and the 3-carbon.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.020
We have two of them.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.270
So it's bisphosphoglycerate.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.050
So that's to get
us right there.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.020
And then to get from the 1
3-biposphoglycerate, and of

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.110
course we have six
of these as well.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.830
Six of these turn into
six of these.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.430
And to turn these six 1
3-phosphoglycerate into our

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.690
three glyceraldehyde
3 phosphates, or

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.430
phosphoglyceraldehyde the
names are very daunting.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.920
This is where we're actually
going to oxidize our NADPH.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.030
Remember oxidizing is losing
electrons or losing hydrogens

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.280
with their electrons,
either way.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.170
So here, on this step right
here, two things are going to

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.560
happen, actually.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:57.760
You're going to have six NADPHs
become six NAD pluses.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.220
So they're losing that hydrogen
and the electrons.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.450
And also one phosphate is going
to be lost from each of

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.930
these molecules.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.290
And then you're going to
also have plus six of

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.140
the phosphate groups.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.440
The phosphate groups don't
get lost here.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.190
They get added onto these
molecules right there.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.360
And then we end up with our
sixth glyceraldehyde

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.310
3-phosphates, which we learned
in the last video, we can then

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.720
use to produce fuel or
glucose or other

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.370
carbohydrates in the cell.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.740
But we also learned that this
is called the Calvin cycle.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.380
So all of it doesn't get used
to produce actual glucose or

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.850
other carbohydrates.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:43.310
Most of it, out of the six, five
of them are going to be

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.190
used to produce our three
ribulose bisphosphates.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.870
So let me do it like this.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.440
So you're going to have five
G3Ps go in that direction.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.030
So for every six G3Ps you
produce, five go back into the

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.670
cycle and then one
exits the cycle.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.580
We saw this in the last video.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.822
In the last video I had 12
here, so 10 went in this

00:07:04.822 --> 00:07:06.420
direction and two in
this direction.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.240
I'm just dividing everything
by two in this video.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.970
And the whole reason why I
multiplied by two in the last

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.360
video is so that we end up
with two going into this

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.170
direction because two
is enough to produce

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.310
at least one glucose.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.270
But we don't have to have two.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.260
We could just say we do this
whole cycle twice to get two.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.760
But anyway, I have one
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.250
coming out of this end.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.550
And then these five
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.410
that stay in the cycle.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.950
Remember those are
just 3-carbons

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.890
with a phosphate group.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.560
I drew it over here already.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.430
They will then use another
three ATP.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.630
So we end up with three ADPs.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.490
And the phosphate groups
actually end up on the

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.130
ribulose bisphosphate and they
get essentially recycled into

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.600
ribulose bisphosphate for the
whole cycle to happen again.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.830
Remember when all this is
happening you can kind of

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.150
imagine in or on the surface
of this big enzyme.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.400
This ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.940
And actually, just so you know
a piece of terminology, this

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.020
type of photosynthesis is called
C3 photosynthesis.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.250
And the whole reason why it's
called C3 photosynthesis is

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.409
because the very first product
that you get when you react

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.840
with carbon dioxide, when the
first time you fix your carbon

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.850
dioxide-- remember carbon
dioxide fixation is when you

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.450
take it in its gaseous
form and you actually

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.600
put it into a molecule.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.470
The very first carbon molecule
you get once the carbon

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.330
dioxide gets fixed is
a 3-carbon molecule.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.020
It's phosphoglycerate.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.170
That's why I showed
it to you there.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.810
Because that's where
the three in the C3

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.920
photosynthesis comes from.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.840
Now, everything I've just done
is a review of what we did in

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.740
the last video.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.250
Maybe with a little
bit more detail.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.470
And I showed you that you
don't have to start

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.250
with six and six.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.960
You could start with three and
three and just have five go

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.630
down here and one go down
here instead of doubling

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.065
everything.

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:17.230
But what I want to show you now
is an inefficiency that

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.560
goes on in plants.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.780
This RuBisCo doesn't
necessarily

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.640
just fix carbon dioxide.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.300
It can also react with oxygen.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.140
And actually, its name is
ribulose bisphosphate

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.570
carboxylase oxygenase, which
means it can react

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.030
with carbon or oxygen.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.825
And this mechanism-- so let's
say you have your ribulose

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.740
bisphosphate hanging around.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:50.380
You know we're in the stroma
of our chloroplast.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.610
So let's say we have our five
ribulose bisphosphates.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.810
And instead of reacting with
carbon it can actually react

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.350
with oxygen.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.820
So instead of having carbon
dioxide here, I can have O2

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.180
coming in here.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.940
We have oxygen coming in here.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.560
And all of this, once again, is
occurring on the surface or

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.510
with the assistance
of the RuBisCo.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.290
The exact same, the
RuBisCo enzyme.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.540
Ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.210
That's why.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.530
Because it can also
fix oxygen.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.800
And when these two things react,
you don't get useful

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.810
things that can be used for
fuel and all of that.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.930
You end up with-- and my drawing
is a little messy--

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.240
you end up with-- well when
these two guys react-- you'll

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.330
end up with five molecules
of this guy right here.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.975
Five molecules of this

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:07.310
3-phosphoglycerate right there.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.800
Remember here we ended
up with six of them.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.380
But now we're only going
to end up with five

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.630
phosphoglycerates.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.070
I know the names are
all very confusing.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.550
But the basic idea is to
remember that what's happening

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.950
here is if carbon dioxide isn't
getting fixed, oxygen

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.630
can get fixed.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.880
And you end up with five
phosphoglycerates.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.380
And you actually also end up
with five-- this is called

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.630
phosphoglycolate.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.400
I know these are very
daunting names.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:44.300
Phosphoglycolate, which is
a 2-carbon molecule.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.380
Which makes sense because we
only have five carbons to

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.350
start with.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.650
This thing right here is
a 3-carbon molecule.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.080
That's a 3-carbon molecule
and this right here

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.760
is a 2-carbon molecule.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.010
So this right here is going to
be a 2-carbon molecule and it

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.880
has a phosphate group.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.760
So as you can imagine, in this
situation we're not going to

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.710
be able to keep going forward
and produce our glyceraldehyde

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.100
3-phosphate, which we can then
use to make up carbohydrates.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.950
We're stuck.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.925
We just have these five
phosphoglycerates.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.420
These can go on and some
percentage of them, but the

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.750
ratios are all getting
messed up.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.690
But everything doesn't
necessarily happen this

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.760
cleanly in the cell.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.600
These things can go on, but we
have one less being produced.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.850
And this thing right here, it's
actually using up some of

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.750
our carbon from our ribulose
bisphosphate.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.785
And if this thing kept going
up, all of our ribulose

00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:39.910
bisphosphate is going
to get eaten up.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.400
We're not going to be able to
continue on into this cycle

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.450
over and over again.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.800
And actually this is kind
of a waste product.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.700
Right here this is
a waste product.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.410
Or we think it's a
waste product.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.770
And this actually has to exit
your chloroplast and actually

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.770
get processed by other
organelles in the plant cells.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.060
And these are called, these
waste processing organelles in

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.350
your cells, these are
peroxisomes I know there's a

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.060
lot of complicated
terminology here.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.690
But the important thing to
remember, when RuBisCo fixes

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.200
oxygen, this is actually called
photorespiration.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.220
That's an important
word to know.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.470
Photorespiration.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.670
All of a sudden, instead of
being able to carry forward

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.040
with your Calvin cycle and
produce a lot of sugar,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.300
instead you are depleting
your RuBisCo.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.060
So this is a very bad process.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.000
This is going to get in the
way of your Calvin cycle.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.220
And remember how important
each of these G3Ps are.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.500
Because for every turn of the
Calvin cycle, or at least the

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.640
way I did it, we only produce
one G3P that actually gets

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.220
used for something useful.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:58.530
The other five G3Ps have to go
back to produce ribulose

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.480
bisphosphate.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.320
RuBisCo of course
is the enzyme.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.610
So in this situation we only
have five phosphoglycerates to

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.230
begin with.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.650
Maybe if we have our ATP or an
NADH, we can convert these

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.770
five-- and it doesn't have to
go in this direction-- but

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.870
maybe we can convert these five
phosphoglycerates into

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.610
five glyceraldehyde
3-phosphates.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.930
G3Ps.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.300
Then all of these are going to
be used back to produce our

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.160
ribulose bisphosphate.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.690
So to go from here to here,
we actually had to

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.160
use up ATP and NADH.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.090
And then to go from here to
here, we have to use more ATP.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.350
But we went through this whole
cycle and we didn't produce

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.820
anything, in terms of useful
things that can be used to--

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.050
essentially sugars or
carbohydrates that can be used

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.940
to fuel or provide structure
for the plant in any way.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.490
So this is a completely--
or we think-- this

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.765
is a wasteful process.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.040
So people wonder, when you
look a lot of biological

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.560
systems you don't see wasteful
processes all the time.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.240
You would say, well wouldn't
natural selection have

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.480
selected against this?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.490
And some people believe that
this is just a remnant from

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.510
our evolutionary past, or our
plants' evolutionary past,

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.860
where there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.040
And if there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere, this

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.030
was not that likely
of an occurrence.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.630
But there's some people who
actually believe that no, this

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.770
might actually have
been selected

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.100
for in natural selection.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.830
Because if there is a lot of
oxygen hanging around in the

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:37.710
cell, more than you need, that
oxygen might actually react

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.190
with your ATP and create other
harmful compounds in the cell.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.030
And this might be a way of
sopping up the harmful oxygen

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.110
that's actually hanging
around the cell.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.050
So who knows?

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.390
But it's interesting idea.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.235
That you have this one enzyme
that can react with ribulose

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:56.210
bisphosphate and
carbon dioxide.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.320
And if that happens, we just get
our regular Calvin cycle.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.250
Or it can react with ribulose
bisphosphate and oxygen and

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.310
actually fix oxygen into
these two molecules.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.610
Especially the phosphoglycolate
which we

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.130
think is a waste compound.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.320
And if you just went on and on
in the Calvin cycle in this

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.460
way, you will not produce
any useful sugars.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.960
So in the next video, what I
want to do is study some

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.310
plants that have been
able to get by this

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.850
photorespiration problem.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.850
And you could imagine,
photorespiration could be a

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.200
really big deal or it could be
very harmful in situations

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.040
where, one, it's very important
for a plant to be

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.730
very productive of sugars.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.890
And it can also, we'll see,
it can be a problem-- it's

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.550
definitely a problem if there's
a huge amount of

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.440
oxygen content.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.890
But in the next video I'm going
to show you plants that

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.600
have gotten around this
problem by, instead of

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.030
performing C-3 photosynthesis,
which is the classic Calvin

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.320
cycle that I just showed
you, they perform C-4

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.130
photosynthesis.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.840
And I'll show you what that
means in the next video.
