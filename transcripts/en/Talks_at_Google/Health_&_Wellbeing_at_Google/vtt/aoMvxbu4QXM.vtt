00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280
NATHAN: Michael is the
founder of the Metta Center,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.620
a center that works
on nonviolence issues,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.740
and also was a professor
at Berkeley, teaching for--

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.050
how many years was it, Michael?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.300
MICHAEL NAGLER: Oh, you sure--

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.950
47 years.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.120
NATHAN: 47 years teaching peace
and nonviolence at Berkeley.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.740
I was lucky to attend
his class in 2005,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.820
and it had an extremely
big impact on my life

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.280
and got me involved in working
in nonviolence, becoming

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.009
a community organizer,
starting to meditate.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.100
And so Michael's been
a huge teacher for me

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.474
and I'm really excited to
for him to come to Google.

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:38.140
But yeah, without any
other further ado,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.973
I'd love to introduce
you to Michael Nagler.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.520
MICHAEL NAGLER: Thank
you very much, Nathan.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.270
I'm really, really pleased
to be here with you today.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.830
And I'd like to start off by
sharing with you the trailer

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.009
of a documentary film that I've
been working on for more years

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.800
than I would like to
think about right now.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.269
But it looks like we're kind of
getting closer to completion.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.590
We started this film
for a couple of reasons.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.660
You may have-- can I
get a show of hands?

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.810
How many of you have seen
Richard Attenborough's film,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.740
"Gandhi"?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.310
OK.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.590
I would highly recommend
it for all of you.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.010
It's mostly accurate.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.230
What it omits-- two things.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.120
It omits any exploration
of Gandhi's spirituality,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.720
and it omits any of
those big conversion

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.610
moments that happened when a
person encounters nonviolence

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.870
and changes.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.730
In our workshop this
afternoon, Stephanie

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.840
is going to share with us some
very dramatic episodes where

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.450
this happened.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.770
But there were many, many
episodes in Gandhi's life

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.200
where somebody was about
to strike him and--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.680
there was even an episode
where somebody was choking him.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.317
He had sworn to kill Gandhi, so
Gandhi went there right away,

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.900
knocked on the door
and said, I'm here

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.350
to help you fulfill your vow.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.030
And the man started
choking him and Gandhi just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570
looked him in the eye
without a trace of fear.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.300
And after about half a
minute, he dropped his hands,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.640
fell at his feet and
said, you are now

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.360
in charge of this whole village.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540
So that was missing.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.200
Then there's been some
recent documentaries

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.130
which touched on one
nonviolent episode or another.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.860
So there's an
excellent film on the--

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.450
come on in-- on the
Otpor revolution that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.270
took place in Serbia in 2000.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.650
How many of you have
heard of that ever?

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.200
OK, very good.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.460
This is Google.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.200
And there's films about
the civil rights movement.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.680
Of course, there's films about
the Indian freedom struggle.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.190
But I don't know of any film
that steps back and says,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.110
what is nonviolence?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.150
Where does it stand
right now, where

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.130
do we go with it from here,
and what can I do about it?

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.950
which is what we're going to
be talking about here today.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.590
So without further
ado-- and by the way,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.170
we're also, in case
you're not aware of it,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.090
we're also exploiting you
as good labor practice

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.931
because we would like to get
your feedback on the film.

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:15.893
OK.

00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:16.855
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:28.990
BERNARD LAFAYETTE: Nonviolence,
to me, is a source of power.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.640
And the power is
actually in each person.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:39.810
DAVID HARTSOUGH: Toward
the end of the second day,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.190
I was meditating on
loving your enemy.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.190
And I heard a guy
come up from behind me

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.746
and he says, if
you don't get out

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.120
of this store in
two seconds, I'm

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.760
going to stab this
through your heart.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.830
And I had two seconds
to decide, well,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.440
do I really believe
in nonviolence

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.032
or is there any other way I
should relate to this guy?

00:04:03.032 --> 00:04:04.740
TIFFANY TOOL: I learned
about nonviolence

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.710
in the backwards
way, as in I really

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.050
focused on the practical
use of nonviolence

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.870
prior to learning the
theory of nonviolence.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.990
And it started when I was
working with Peace Brigades

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.480
International in Indonesia.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.620
GREGORY OTIENO: It
doesn't mean that I'm

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.720
weak if I turn the other cheek.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.470
It means that I'm
not just distracted

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.650
by the violent nature
of the other people.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.210
I look up to more
deeper meaning to life.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.450
MICHAEL NAGLER: Well, like
many people, when I first heard

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.680
about nonviolence and became
aware of what Gandhi was doing,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.980
I said, I can't do that.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.640
There are disciplines
that a person can practice

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.230
that helps you deal with
the strong emotions that

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.485
are going to come up
in a serious conflict.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:57.360
KEN BUTIGAN: So
we are continually

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.820
inviting people to
really work with the two

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.940
hands of nonviolence.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.750
The two hands of nonviolence
being on the one hand,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.992
I will not cooperate with your
injustice, but I'm open to you

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:10.700
as a human being.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.484
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.540
DR. FRANS DE WAAL:
Veneer theory basically

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.700
says that, deep down, we humans,
we are nasty and selfish.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.540
And if we are civil and kind to
each other, it's just a veneer.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.760
It's a thin veneer of morality.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.560
And I've always
protested against that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.062
because I think it's a
simplification of human nature.

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:35.520
DR. ELISABET
SAHTORIS: I discovered

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.270
that there was a cycle
of maturation going on

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.130
in evolution over and over.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.440
The first great
leap in evolution

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.590
was competition to cooperation
in nucleated cells.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.640
The second leap was
competition to cooperation

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.530
into multi-celled creatures.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.680
DR. RACHEL MACNAIR: Killing
tends to make us mentally ill.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.171
It tends to make us sick.

00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:01.420
DR. ERICA CHENOWETH: Yeah,
one of the big myths that's

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.360
busted through our data is
that nonviolent resistance

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.200
takes longer to achieve results
than violent insurgency.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.850
In fact, what we find is
strikingly the opposite.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.147
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:18.610
MICHAEL NAGLER:
Humanity, as a whole,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.900
is becoming aware of
nonviolence and that this

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.817
is a tremendous
potential breakthrough.

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:27.650
RIVERA SUN: You know,
there's a famous story

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.000
about Emmett Till's mother.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.120
Emmett Till was a
14-year-old black boy

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.640
from Chicago area,
I believe, who

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.340
whistled at a white woman in the
South while visiting his cousin

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.580
and ended up being lynched
and thrown in the river.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.680
Years later, when his actual
murderers were put to trial,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.780
someone asked Emmett
Till's mother,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.560
would you like to see them
get the death penalty?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.260
And she said no.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.280
If I could, if I had a choice
in this justice system,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.880
I would take their children
and raise them as my own

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.465
so they would learn to love.

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:14.030
KEN BUTIGAN: Not easy to do
it, but this creative tension

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.510
between saying no and
saying yes, this is the job

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.980
description of the 21st century.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.956
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.160
MICHAEL NAGLER: So I'd like
to, when you recovered,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.230
ask for any comments
you have, any

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.395
questions you have about the
trailer, what it presents.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.270
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.030
AUDIENCE: I think it
does its job because it

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.196
makes me want to learn more.

00:07:47.785 --> 00:07:49.660
MICHAEL NAGLER: I think
that's about the best

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.990
comment I think we could hear.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.910
Yeah, that is the point.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:00.250
The motto, mantra, if you
will, of the Metta Center

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.890
is helping people
practice nonviolence more

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.770
safely and more effectively.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.110
We're fundamentally an
educational institution

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.520
because we feel that
people do not get a chance

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.530
to find out about this power,
as Bernard Lafayette calls it,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.852
which is, as he said--

00:08:19.852 --> 00:08:21.310
he may not have
said it right here,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.340
but I think it's the most
important power, the most

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.510
defining power that we can
draw upon as human beings.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.200
Now, I wonder how
many of you are

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.100
familiar with the
term the New Story?

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.110
You might call it
Western civilization 2.0.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.419
What's happening
is we are actually

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.480
in a very awkward situation.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.500
This is why there is so much
violence and disruption going

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.120
on in our world.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.470
It's not because we have only
a thin veneer of morality.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.955
Stephanie and I,
and Metta Center,

00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:02.530
are up in smoke country
and the north counties

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.670
and the outpouring of
support and volunteers

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.280
has been absolutely
overwhelming.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.420
We got a call a couple
of days ago from somebody

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.240
who wanted to donate clothing
to us because she had tried

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.980
to donate them to
all the centers

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.090
that had evacuees in them and
they weren't taking any more.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.670
They had mountains and
mountains of clothing.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.320
In fact, Lou, who is
doing the film with us,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.970
spent the whole day sorting
through mountains of clothing

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.340
so that evacuees or anybody
else could come and get them.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.450
So it was this huge
outpouring of compassion

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.980
that was immediately
touched when

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.200
our community, our
neighborhood, was in crisis.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.960
But there was a
study, or an article,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.890
recently about the fact
that we are experiencing

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.230
an epidemic of depression.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.230
We've got our share
of epidemics going on.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.220
We've got an opioid epidemic.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.950
There's an epidemic of suicides
among military personnel.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.160
Might get back to
that in a little bit.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.560
And there's an
epidemic of depression.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.660
All of those things are symptoms
of this great awkwardness

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.210
I'm going to say a
word about in a minute.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:17.020
And this author said that
that is a misdiagnosis.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.670
It's not really depression
that we're dealing with.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.746
What we're dealing
with is demoralization.

00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:30.100
There's demoralization because--
this is where the New Story

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.060
comes in--

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.780
we're operating with a model of
reality in our mind which is--

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.020
the three things to be
said about it, aside

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.840
from the fact that it's been
there for a couple hundred

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.290
years now, it is demoralizing,
it is extremely harmful,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.360
and it's dead wrong.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.990
And that model-- which I'm
going to show you some examples

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.240
of how it's shared everywhere--

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.270
is that we're all
material beings

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:06.490
and we're determined by
mindless forces, everything

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:12.430
from genes to cosmic rays
to hormones and so forth.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.700
We have no control over
our destiny, right?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.900
So we have to respond to every
advertisement and signal that

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.920
comes down the line.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.930
And we basically have no
meaning on this planet.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.780
Now, you may not believe
that, and I congratulate you

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.060
for seeing through the fog.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.240
But the fact is that
this is the model which

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.700
is operational for most people.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.210
You do not have to prove it.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.990
If you assume it, you can
simply refer back to it,

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.800
and people are supposed
to follow along with you.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.230
So the next thing I'd
like to show you--

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.410
which may need some help
from Maria, not sure--

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:59.410
is an animation that we've done
to illustrate this shift that's

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.280
going on to the New Story.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.360
And so in order to not
keep you in suspense--

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.390
I can almost sense the
rising tension in the room--

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.570
the New Story, as hinted
at by those scientists

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.850
that you just saw
in the trailer--

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.910
and we have several of
them in the finished film--

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.280
is that in fact, we are
body, mind, and spirit.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.140
And just to paraphrase
the New Testament,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.460
we are body, mind, and spirit.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.660
All three of these, but
spirit is the most important.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:35.260
And we are deeply
interconnected with one another,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.840
such that if I were to do
something to injure Ziggy,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.940
let's say, which is
absolutely unthinkable.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.340
But let's say I were to
do something like that.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.800
The fact is, I'd be
hurting myself more

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.760
than I'd be hurting you.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.030
And that's why all of
our military personnel,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.155
there's this huge drumbeat.

00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:57.450
You're telling them, oh, you're
so wonderful, you're so great,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.890
you're saving our country.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.710
Well, the President
doesn't say that,

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.040
but the culture as a
whole is saying that.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.240
Look, there's lots of seats
here if you'd like to come in.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.740
There's enough
violence in the world

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.781
without you having to eat
your lunch standing up.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.200
They're being told officially
that what they're doing

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.140
is honorific and glorious
and helpful and wonderful.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.260
But inside they know
that it's a damn lie.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.420
And if you ask
them, they will say,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.765
I felt like I lost
my soul in Iraq,

00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:32.300
or I don't like myself anymore.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.010
20 people a day committing
suicide for this reason.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.450
By stark contrast, people who've
been practicing nonviolence

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.950
have a very different
story to tell.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.080
And there was a person
in Iraqi Kurdistan,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.350
actually, who said to
a person who was there

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.560
from this country, from a group
called Christian Peacemaker

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.050
Teams, which is part of this
new institution that's sprung up

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.510
called Unarmed Civilian
Peacekeeping or protection,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.890
Unarmed Civilian Protection.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.690
This Kurdish
gentleman said, well,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.780
we're going to try and do it
from here out with nonviolence.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.480
And the person from
Christian Peacemaker Teams

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.960
said, you know, you can
do that if you want to,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.210
but it's very difficult,
which is true.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.200
It can be dangerous,
which is an exaggeration,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.710
and it takes more time,
which is not true at all,

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.060
we just found out.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.250
And he said, I know
all of those things,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.850
but you don't lose your
soul in the process.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.170
You don't lose your
humanity in the process.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.250
So I like to present this
as a stark contrast which

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.420
illustrates the impact of
operating on the wrong story

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.670
and letting it draw
you into action

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.090
and operating on the New Story,
despite the fact that nobody

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.190
knows what the heck
you're trying to do.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:01.010
So we feel that the
development of the New Story

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.690
and the development
of nonviolence

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.670
go hand-in-hand, like opposite
sides of the same coin.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.680
The New Story will
never be complete.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.780
We feel-- we being
basically me and Stephanie--

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.890
we feel, at Metta, that the New
Story will never be complete

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.640
until it makes this discovery
that this film is driving

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.680
at that the capacity
to be nonviolent

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.710
is the core of our
human identity.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.810
So when you are
nonviolent, you feel

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.570
that you are closer
to fulfilling yourself

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.370
as a human being.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.330
That's why the subtitle of
the working title of the film

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.900
is nonviolence
and human destiny.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.150
And on the other
hand, nonviolence,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.310
as I'm going to be
showing in a bit,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.310
is very difficult
to grasp if you've

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.780
got that old story, that
old paradigm, or model

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.200
in your mind.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.700
OK.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.674
So here is the animation
that we created.

00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:02.340
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.615
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.050
- Are you looking for happiness?

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.172
Who isn't?

00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:13.610
In order to be happy, we
need to feel safe, too.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.690
But how do we find
peace and happiness?

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.870
Every day, we're flooded by
messages telling us who we are

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.300
and what makes us
secure and happy.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.010
It sounds a bit like this.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.250
Happiness equals buying
things and security

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.100
equals punishing crime.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.350
Let's call this the Old Story.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.610
It shows a rather uninspiring
picture of human kind,

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.910
but does it work?

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.555
Does buying stuff
actually make us happy?

00:16:42.555 --> 00:16:46.380
Are punishment and revenge
really making us secure?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.270
The answer is no.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.950
Studies show that once
people have the basics,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.480
wealth doesn't add to
happiness, but even reduces it.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.810
Also, huge incarceration rates
eventually lead to more crime.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.870
And as a military commander
in Iraq once said,

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.030
we're making terrorists
faster than we can kill them.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.819
The good news is that,
for the last 30 years,

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.880
science has been telling us
an entirely different and much

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.260
better story.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.770
For example, our brains
reward us powerfully

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.319
when we do something
selfless for others.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.500
It gives us a strong sense
of meaning and fulfillment,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.569
key elements of true happiness.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.349
In fact, we're
wired for empathy.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.770
Our mirror neurons respond
sensitively to what others do,

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.880
think, and feel.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.760
We're more connected to
each other than we think.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.270
This positive view on
humankind is the New Story.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.970
And if you listen well,
you can hear it everywhere

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.680
under many names.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.680
It's the story where ancient
wisdom and modern research

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.320
come together.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.050
This story says that much
happiness is within us

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.110
after all, so we don't need
to consume our planet trying

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.750
to get it from the outside.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.670
It also says that
real security doesn't

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.740
come from violence
and punishment,

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.510
but from ensuring that
everyone has what they need,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.960
including love and respect.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.330
The New Story isn't
that new at all.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.090
It looks like the wisest
among us were right all along.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.550
As Martin Luther King said
in his famous Nobel Prize

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.511
acceptance speech--

00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:17.177
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:18:17.177 --> 00:18:19.052
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING,
JR.: Man must evolve,

00:18:19.052 --> 00:18:22.750
for all human conflict,
a method which

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.010
rejects revenge,
aggression, and retaliation.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.527
The foundation of
such a method is love.

00:18:29.527 --> 00:18:30.110
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.600
- OK.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.390
That's all very touching, but
what about crime and violence?

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.250
How do we deal with that?

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.350
Well, in lots of ways.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.460
For example, have you heard
of restorative justice?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.530
This method involves
victim, offender,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.970
and the whole community.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.950
It's effective,
cheap, and it builds

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.700
community in the process.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.000
And did you know that
ordinary citizens

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.580
with nonviolence training
are solving conflicts

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.810
all over the world?

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.170
It shows we can do things so
much differently and better

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.260
if we change the narrative.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.650
The New Story has new heroes.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.630
Here, we're not consumers,
but contributors.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.320
What really makes us happy
is finding our unique gifts

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.810
and giving them to the world.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.760
At the Metta Center, we
believe in the New Story.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.780
We all have a role to play
in making it come true.

task, we can help you.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.200
MICHAEL NAGLER: So I hope
that serves as an introduction

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.120
to this new paradigm.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:04.160
And our feeling of late is that
the shift from the Old Story,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.410
which isn't working, to a new
one, which has not yet adopted,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.320
is kind of stuck.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.250
It hasn't been moving very much.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:17.260
I first got exposed to this
when I was beginning my career

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.310
at the university in 1970,
handed around these little

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.240
mimeograph-- you
don't remember those--

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.260
sheets talking about
the prevailing paradigm,

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.170
the dominance paradigm, a.k.a.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.160
the Old Story, and the
emerging paradigm, a.k.a.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:36.910
the New Story.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.730
But it still hasn't
emerged, despite the fact

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.820
that we have this great
wisdom tradition, which is now

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.970
available to all of us,
and despite the fact

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.360
that science is now
confirming this dramatically.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.080
So for example, we
mentioned briefly,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.110
in the animation, the
concept of mirror neurons.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.510
Have you heard of those?

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.230
OK.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.650
So do you want to tell us?

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.150
OK.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.295
AUDIENCE: There's some
controversy about what

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.507
they actually mean, but--

00:21:05.507 --> 00:21:06.340
MICHAEL NAGLER: Yes.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.680
Well, there's controversy
about everything,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.450
but one aspect of it
is that, for example,

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:20.140
if somebody is writing,
the motor neurons that

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.560
would make me write are
fired just by observing that,

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.720
even though I'm
not writing myself.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.240
At the last minute,
there's another set

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.280
of neurons, which intersects
that process and says,

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.780
you're not Ziggy, so you
don't have to go like this.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.280
Now, that's, of
course, critically

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.490
important for nonviolence
because in nonviolence,

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.350
the power comes from being able
to, as we call it nowadays,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.890
flip the switch.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.650
Somebody comes at
you with a threat.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.750
The script is,
you're supposed to be

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.970
going into fear and compliance.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.960
But as Ken Butigan showed
you in the trailer,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.760
you say instead, I refuse to
go along with your coercion,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.200
but I accept--

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.060
I'm open to you
as a human being.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.960
And you flip that script.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.730
So when I completely
change my mental state,

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.550
your mirror neurons
resonate with that.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.500
It doesn't, 100% of the
time, mean that you're

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.830
going to change your behavior.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:27.010
But it does mean that
more often and more safely

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.680
than if you try to
get a person to change

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.010
through threat of violence.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:39.460
So any-- this is my whole career
I'm condensing into one hour,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.400
so I know I'm
going kind of fast.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.700
If you have any questions, let
me pause here briefly to see.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.800
Yeah.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.884
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
that last point about--

00:22:50.884 --> 00:22:52.300
you're saying
flipping the switch,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.350
changing the dynamics
of the situation.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.370
MICHAEL NAGLER:
Flipping the script.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.911
AUDIENCE: Flipping
the script, sorry.

00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:57.280
MICHAEL NAGLER: Yeah.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.400
AUDIENCE: You know,
in psychology, there's

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.655
also discussion about
sociopaths, people

00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:05.650
who would perceive the
emotions of others,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.380
but don't experience that
kind of empathic response.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.020
How do you account for that
or how do you respond to that?

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.936
MICHAEL NAGLER: Right.

00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:14.410
What do you do with
a real sociopath?

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.810
Well, that's going
to be hard, and it's

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.000
going to be a lot harder
than with a normally

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.280
empathic person.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.530
But it turns out that even
there, it's not impossible.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.770
And when we do the
workshop right after this,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.140
we'll show you some
examples of that.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.190
Because what you're doing is
actually appealing to something

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.110
even deeper than that
sociopathology, which has been

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.450
conditioned into the person.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.180
Something inside of
them which they are not

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.694
even consciously aware of.

00:23:45.694 --> 00:23:47.110
In fact, that's
one of the reasons

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.170
that nonviolence is such
a powerful contributor

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.620
to positive social change.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.630
It elicits things from
people that they're not

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.870
even aware is there.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.110
I have a very dear
friend whose parents

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:05.860
were in the
underground in Warsaw

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.230
during the Nazi occupation.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.900
And a Gestapo came
to their apartment

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.740
and found these
incriminating papers,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.450
was about to arrest them.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.520
Needless to say here,
Jewish in the underground.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.030
But this couple had
a four-year-old boy

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.420
and he was fascinated by
the buttons on the Gestapo

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.160
captain's uniform.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.215
So to the horror of
the parents, here he

00:24:32.215 --> 00:24:34.270
is playing with these buttons.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.480
The captain looked down and
suddenly, he just completely

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.820
changed.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.160
He said, I have a little boy
at home who is just his age.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.590
And he said, I miss
him-- excuse me--

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.700
I miss him very much.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.760
And then he ordered his
men to leave the apartment.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.040
And then the couple
survived the war

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.145
and actually became the parents
of a very good friend of mine

00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:01.290
who's in the peace movement.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.930
So what we do in
nonviolence is we

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:09.830
learn the techniques to elicit
that change deliberately.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.671
We will go into that
in the workshop.

00:25:12.671 --> 00:25:13.170
Good.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.067
Any other comments
before I roll on?

00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:18.150
AUDIENCE: I had a quick
question about the trailer

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.054
that you just showed us
and general questions

00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:22.220
about a reformative justice.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.610
I'm happy to wait if
that's something that's

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.026
going to be featured
in your talk,

00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:27.630
but otherwise I'll
go ahead and ask.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.120
I mean, is reformative justice--

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.620
MICHAEL NAGLER:
Restorative justice?

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.400
AUDIENCE: Restorative justice.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.790
MICHAEL NAGLER: Yes.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.248
AUDIENCE: Is that something
that you're going to touch upon

00:25:35.248 --> 00:25:36.719
during the course of the talk?

00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:38.760
MICHAEL NAGLER: Now that
you brought it up, sure.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.175
Yes, I'd be happy to.

00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:40.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.790
MICHAEL NAGLER: Restorative
justice is based on the idea

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:49.800
that when there's
been what is otherwise

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.200
called a crime, what's
actually at issue is harm.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.610
Not a crime in law, but
harm to human relationships.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.980
And you want to restore
that relationship.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.610
You don't do that by locking the
person who offended you away.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.930
You make it impossible to
restore that relationship.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.670
So you bring them back in
and set up a safe zone where

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.980
they can say two things.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.990
They can say here's
why I did it.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.130
And sometimes, these people
have horrendous stories of abuse

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.870
in their background,
which changes

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.760
the atmosphere a little bit.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.340
And then they take
responsibility

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.470
and say, what can I do?

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.780
A lot of this
restorative behavior

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.280
has been practiced in indigenous
cultures for a long time.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.390
And in one case that I
find really dramatic,

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:47.190
there is a large community
in sub-Saharan Africa called

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.300
the Bemba.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.820
And when somebody offends
in that community,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.630
they are made to sit in a
circle with the whole village

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.310
around them.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.090
And they go around that circle
and everyone in the village

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.617
is required to say something
good about that person.

00:27:03.617 --> 00:27:05.700
And when they get about
halfway around the circle,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.270
usually the person, the guy--
it's almost always a guy--

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.150
breaks down and has a
complete change of heart,

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.500
and then they work
out a restitution

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.700
for the harm that's been done,
and they rebuild the community.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.020
So we were in a meeting in
the Santa Rosa school system

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.920
not long ago where they had
introduced restorative justice

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:35.520
in the schools, and the
expulsion and suspension rate

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:41.320
went from 60 cases to
two in the first year.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.500
It was on its way to being zero.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.620
There was one
educator down south,

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.446
San Diego, who was
completely against this--

00:27:49.446 --> 00:27:50.820
it would never
work in my school.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.590
It's way too tough.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.810
And he's now one of
the biggest supporters.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.910
And I asked him, what
was the big change?

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.480
And he said, every time
I did the normal system,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.740
I lost a relationship.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.050
That's because that's what the
"normal," unquote, system does.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.160
Every time I do restorative
justice, I gain a relationship.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.290
So we have a long range
program at Metta Center

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:20.010
to try to get restorative
justice into the schools.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.770
And then when it's really
established in the schools,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.222
get it into the prisons.

00:28:24.222 --> 00:28:25.680
And when it's
established in there,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.721
we could get it anywhere.

00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:30.880
We could get rid of
the whole war system.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.860
So as Martin Luther
King would say,

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:38.500
I may not get there with
you, but it is a very good

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.620
trajectory to work on.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.140
OK.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.240
So let me now take us
a little bit deeper

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.690
into what nonviolence is.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.240
And these have been
very good questions,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.830
so please keep them coming.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.490
So this is just our
introductory slide,

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.040
helping people practice
nonviolence more

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.200
safely and more effectively.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.430
I think you know that gentleman
with the spinning wheel.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:13.190
So I wanted to illustrate what
the Old Story is doing to us.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.170
This is a billboard
that was not far

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.750
from our office in Petaluma.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.200
And I wanted to emphasize
the motto in red

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.610
at the top of this billboard,
"Our Pain is Your Gain."

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.190
In other words, if you can
make us suffer, you win.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.950
You'll be advancing
yourself by putting us down.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.340
Now, let me project this
against a model that

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.490
was developed by one of the
greatest peace researchers

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.380
that we had in the English
language, Kenneth Boulding.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.230
And towards the end
of his life, Kenneth

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.770
wrote a book called "The
Three Faces of Power."

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.650
He said we have three
ways of getting a person

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.060
to do something,
otherwise known as power.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.210
There is threat power, where
essentially you're saying,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.960
do what I want or I'll do
something you don't want.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.390
There's exchange power, where
essentially you're saying,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.860
give me something
I want and I'll

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.050
give you something you want.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.930
And finally, but the
most important and least

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.610
studied, is one called
integrative power,

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.840
where you say, I am
going to be authentic

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.750
and we will end up closer.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:32.630
Now, exchange power is kind of
in a middle zone between threat

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.180
power, which is
clearly violence,

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.720
and integrative power,
which is nonviolence.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.410
And you can run exchange
power in both ways.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.650
Here, we have an example
of exchange power

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.580
being used to create
violence on a subtle level.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.450
While it's selling
you some real estate,

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.060
it is also selling you
on the Old Story idea

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.500
that in order for
you to be happy,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.400
somebody else probably
has to suffer.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.860
I promise you the
tour of the Old Story

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.520
is not going to be too long.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.300
We'll get to nonviolence soon.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.590
But here's another
subtle example of it.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.230
The reason this
offends me so much--

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.760
may not offend you--

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.440
is that inner peace is
a very important concept

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.700
and to trivialize it with the
idea of outer purchasing--

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.800
and we've gotten inured to this.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.660
It goes on and on.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.720
But my PhD was in a subject
called comparative literature,

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.970
so I'm very sensitive
to what people are

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.310
being told under the surface.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:43.250
It's subtler and more
powerful than what they're

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.870
being told on the surface.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.270
So on the surface, you're being
told buy a Dell hard drive.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.400
Don't want to mention
brand names here.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.510
Under the surface,
they're saying--

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.050
as we said, it's showed
in the animation--

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.750
the way to happiness
is through purchases.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.210
In other words, there is
no happiness within you,

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.800
which is a huge lie.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.300
OK.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.650
So this is probably a stark
statement of the New Story.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.800
When you want real wisdom in
this world, where do you go?

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.210
You go to bumper
stickers, right?

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.590
There was a bumper sticker in
my part of town a while back

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.190
which said, "My wife says
I don't listen to her.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.350
At least I think
that's what she said."

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.550
And this one says, "We are
not human beings having

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.820
a spiritual experience"-- which
you will hear every other day

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.410
in Marin County--

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.910
"we are spiritual beings
having a human experience."

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.585
In other words, we
are fundamentally

00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:45.660
a spirit who have
entered a human context.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.490
Again, I'm moving
very fast, so please

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.730
feel free to stick your
hand up or jot down

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.870
a question for later.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.550
Now, in the trailer,
you saw an interview

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:00.350
with a woman named
Erica Chenoweth.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.390
To back up a second,
back in the '70s,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.260
there was a book
by a couple called

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.460
Lind, Staughton and
Alice Lind, called

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.190
"Nonviolence in America."

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.340
That's an arresting
title, to be sure.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.150
And yes, it was a full
book, believe it or not,

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.902
with actual content and a
table of contents and an index

00:33:20.902 --> 00:33:22.110
and all of those good things.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.360
You get a PhD on this stuff.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.240
And one of the things that
they said in their introduction

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.080
to the book is the way
that social science

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:38.430
has ignored this story and let
it disappear is a disgrace.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.820
So fortunately, in just
the last few years--

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.410
just the last few years--

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.180
this has changed.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.000
And Erica Chenoweth
and Maria Stephan

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.760
have written a very
compelling book called

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.310
"Why Civil Resistance Works."

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.580
They're using the word civil
resistance for nonviolence.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.700
And just to summarize
some of their discoveries,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.490
they explored almost
300 cases of what

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.910
we call insurrectionary
movements, regime

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.850
change through uprisings.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.130
And if they were
violent, they were

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.389
successful 26% of the time.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:20.909
If they were nonviolent,
meaning weapon-free, so forth--

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.900
depending on strikes and
non-cooperation techniques,

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.219
things of that kind--

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.820
they were successful
56% of the time.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.690
If they were violent,
they took 9 to 10 years

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.570
to run their course,
usually ending up

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.719
in a battle of attrition,
kind of a civil war.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.949
If they were nonviolent, it
took from two to three years.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.550
And they were more likely to
lead to democratic conditions

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:51.630
five years down the road,
even if they, quote, "failed."

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.400
Failed, that is to say,
to overthrow a dictator

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.760
or whatever it was
they were aiming at.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.600
So you overthrow a
dictator through violence,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.070
you don't get a
free civilization.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.562
As Gandhi said-- he kept
coming to Gandhi and saying,

00:35:08.562 --> 00:35:10.770
when are you going to stop
with this nonviolent stuff

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.870
and get to the real revolution?

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.630
And he said, violent
revolution will

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.495
lead to violence [INAUDIBLE],,
a violent regime.

00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:24.690
A nonviolent revolution will
lead to a nonviolent regime,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.660
even if it "fails,"
quote, unquote, to do

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.920
what you were trying to do.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.860
I can expand on any
of these points,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.710
but I think, for now, I'm
just trying to introduce you

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.590
to the scope of things.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:43.420
So this gives us an
idea of what nonviolence

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.470
looked like in the Old Story.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:50.060
And we usually, today, call
that strategic nonviolence.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.510
And what it looks like in the
New Story, and that's called

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.790
principled nonviolence.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.320
So we'll take this one episode.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.930
This is an uprising in Yemen.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.080
You can see those people
are pretty agitated.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.950
And they had a
slogan, which was,

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:11.060
"They can't defeat us because
we left our weapons at home."

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.310
Now, that is basically true.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.330
It turns out that
if you use weapons,

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.570
you're actually
producing violence.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:25.430
Something like 70% of
homicides these days

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.880
are what's called victim
precipitated homicides.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.180
You pull out a weapon to defend
yourself, you get blown away.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.780
So I'm not disputing
the truth of that,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.630
but in strategic
nonviolence, you

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:44.450
look at a person as a rational,
cost benefit calculator

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.990
and try to, more or
less, force that person

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:52.130
to do what you want by
changing conditions.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.170
Whereas in principled
nonviolence,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.554
you might have said, "We
will win them over"--

00:36:57.554 --> 00:36:58.970
instead of "they
can't defeat us."

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.680
"We will win them over because
we left our hatred at home."

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.150
And that's why it is difficult
to understand real nonviolence

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.380
in the Old Story because
we do not acknowledge

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.905
the power of inner states.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:24.000
So here's someone who
acknowledged them.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.490
And this is one of the
most important statements

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.470
in the history of nonviolence.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:35.900
"I have learnt the one supreme
lesson to conserve my anger,

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.920
and as heat conserved is
transmuted into energy,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.700
our anger controlled can be
transmuted into a power that

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.810
can move the world."

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.580
One other little
complaint that I

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.640
have about Richard
Attenborough's film

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.040
is it does not show you
how angry Gandhi was.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.270
Oh, my gosh, was he angry.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.730
But he had something to do with
it, and not just let it out,

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.964
which is a huge mistake that's
done with many movements today.

00:38:04.964 --> 00:38:06.880
A lot of people think
that all they need to do

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.850
is show others how
angry they are,

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.350
and they will have
made their point.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.320
Well, given the mirror
neurons, if you show people

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.330
how angry they are, they'll
get much more angry at you.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.630
And where do you go?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.880
So because this
is so important, I

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.400
like to dwell on it
just a little bit more.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.570
"Civil disobedience," a part
of one of the nonviolent

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.810
strategies, "is a
sovereign method

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.790
of transforming undisciplined,
life-destroying latent energy

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.580
into disciplined,
life-saving energy."

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.070
So again, this capacity to
talk about our inner energies

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.770
is made much more
possible when you

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.920
see that we are body,
mind, and spirit and not

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.950
just molecules
being knocked around

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.940
by other molecules for
no particular reason.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:03.070
And Martin Luther King
enlarged on this when he said

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.720
almost exactly the same thing.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.040
"We caused no
outbursts of anger.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.960
We expressed anger under
discipline for maximum effect."

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.200
And this is what Gandhi did.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.630
I mean, my meditation
teacher claims

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.300
that Gandhi was one
of the angriest people

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.650
in the 20th century, but he
expressed it under discipline.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.140
Meaning, I am not going
to put up with this.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.630
I'm going to make
this situation change.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.785
So he's thrown off a
train in 1893, the march

00:39:33.785 --> 00:39:35.600
in Pietermaritzburg.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.790
He is volcanically angry.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.680
But instead of saying,
they did this to me,

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.290
they can't get away
with it, he said,

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.990
this is man's inhumanity
to man, and we

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.820
must do something about it.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.910
And you see that in
the Attenborough film.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.710
And when you choose
a constructive path,

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:59.240
the anger is converted
into creative energy.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.730
You don't have to actually
know how it's happening

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.970
and do it, you just make that
right choice that you are not

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.800
going to yield to
anger, you're going

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.480
to do something constructive.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.590
All the power of that anger,
which is considerable--

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.250
playing upon that power,
as somebody recently said,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.640
which got us the President that
we have now in this country,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.550
no names please.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.120
So that power is
there in all of us.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.280
And for those of us who
are sensitive to injustice,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.040
that power can be very--

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.850
it can be extreme.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:36.610
But if we know how to deal
with it, it enlarges us,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.160
it advances us
spiritually, and it changes

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.880
the situation for the better.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.060
That's nonviolence
in a nutshell.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.940
One of the things that is useful
to know about any conflict

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.220
is how far along you
are in that conflict.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:02.130
So we've created this kind
of pseudoscientific graph,

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.470
if you will, that plots the
level of dehumanization, which

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:11.420
is what makes conflicts extreme,
and the amount of violence

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.230
it leads to.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:17.960
And generally speaking, the
escalation of conflict goes--

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.380
it can shoot up very rapidly,
especially in the presence

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.990
of a weapon or so forth.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:28.190
Now, what we want to do in
nonviolence is de-escalate,

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.300
go back in the other direction.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.420
That is simple enough.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.670
But it's helpful, we find,
to segment that curve

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:41.540
into three sections, and know
which section your conflict

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.950
is at.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.760
Partly, we'll be
doing some exercises

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.790
on this in the workshop.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.460
In the first level, you see
the level of dehumanization

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.730
is very low.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:59.600
You can communicate verbally
or through petitions

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.390
or whatnot with your opponent.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.680
Tell your opponent we don't like
this, we want you to change it,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.280
and they can
conceivably respond.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.980
So the big question is,
yeah, but what if they don't?

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.550
Well, that's when you have
to go into satyagraha.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.700
You have to resist
through nonviolent action.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.900
And the point of that, again,
to fall back on Gandhian

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.870
terminology, is when you
really want something

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.560
important to be done, it's not
enough to appeal to the head.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.950
You have to be able to
move the heart also.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.350
And that is that
empathetic response

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.150
that we've been talking about.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.540
When you conquer and
convert your own anger,

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.610
it has a powerful effect
on everyone looking on.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.890
And what if you get to a place
where even that doesn't work,

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.180
and it's something that you
really, really care about?

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.150
Well, you have an
ultimate weapon.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.060
Yes, I have used
that term advisedly.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.060
You have an ultimate
weapon in nonviolence,

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.090
and we hope you
don't have to use it.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.380
But that weapon is if you are
willing to risk your life,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.950
it can have a tremendous impact.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.890
I don't like this idea
any more than you do.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.390
So what we try to
do is intervene more

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.540
at its lower level, at an
earlier stage of the conflict.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.680
But it's critically important
to know what stage you're at.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.380
The classic example
that I like to use

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:38.720
is, in 2003, they were getting
ready to wage war on Iraq.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.930
12 million people, worldwide,
protested and said,

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.480
we don't want this.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.690
And the then-President
of the United States

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.600
said, I don't have to pay
attention to those people.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.390
They are just a focus group.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.480
Terms that you're
familiar with here.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.820
So what was he
saying, in our terms?

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.990
He was saying, sorry,
people, we're in phase two,

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.800
not in phase one.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.700
You're petitioning me
is not going to work.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.030
You now have to go
into satyagraha.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.500
Even if we understood
that, which few of us did,

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.990
we didn't know how to do it.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.690
We didn't have anything
really prepared.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.880
The famous episode where
Gandhi was getting off

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.730
a train and people come
at him with lathis.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.926
They want to beat him up.

00:44:26.926 --> 00:44:28.300
He said, you know,
it's not going

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.950
to help you any to
break this head.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.590
And he's like, well,
we want thus and so.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.200
And what should we do then?

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.480
He said, well, you
must petition me

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.270
and then if I don't
respond to your petition,

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:44.810
you must undertake a
hunger strike against me.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.990
And if I don't respond
to that hunger strike,

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.070
you have to fast unto death.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.700
And they said, well, we're
not prepared to do that.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.200
He said, well, then
you're not going

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.240
to change my mind on this issue.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.940
So in the first stage,
you can negotiate,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.360
and the techniques of conflict
resolution are what you use.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.860
In the second phase, you
must go into satyagraha.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.360
And in the third
phase, you must be

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.940
ready to make the
ultimate sacrifice.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.480
All along, you can also be
doing constructive program.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.920
Question.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.436
AUDIENCE: So in
your Iraq example,

00:45:23.436 --> 00:45:25.810
it was too late to negotiate,
so resistance at that point

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.942
would have been like the
soldiers just refused to go?

00:45:28.942 --> 00:45:31.150
MICHAEL NAGLER: If you were
a soldier, refusing to go

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.780
would be very dramatic and a
correct and appropriate way

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.170
to do it, and some of them did.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.160
But if you are an
ordinary citizen,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.180
you had other
methods open to you.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.780
I've had friends who got in
the way of troop trains, who

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.530
blockaded army.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.740
There are many
people right now who

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.080
are going to Creech
Air Force Base

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.820
and protesting
against the drones.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.260
And not just holding up signs,
but blocking traffic in and out

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.820
of the base.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.660
And there are a couple
of hundred techniques

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.550
that are available to
us, if you went on.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.350
Now, all of them involve
risk-- the risk of arrest,

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.150
for example.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.870
But if you care enough, on one
hand, that this thing really

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.870
has to stop, I'm not
going to live with this,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.360
and on the other
hand, you have faith

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.530
that nonviolence is a powerful
technique, that's what you do.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:28.750
And there have been some--

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.330
the book that Nathan
was kind enough

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.540
to mention with a
little prompting,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.640
"Search for a
Nonviolent Future,"

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:42.010
we have maybe 60, 70 examples
of how satyagraha has worked.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.140
There's an eight-year
satyagraha that's

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.070
been carried on in British
Columbia against an oil

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:52.390
company that wanted to frack
their land, you know, come in.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.940
They had, like, 10
projects and they've now

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.150
had to give up seven of
them because they just made

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.670
it too uncomfortable for
them, and showed them

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:06.352
how much they cared that they
did not want this to happen.

00:47:06.352 --> 00:47:08.560
And that's one of the big
changes that's taking place

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.350
in nonviolence, actually.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.570
The way indigenous communities
have been becoming conscious

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:18.230
of their power in organizing.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.940
OK.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.790
So those are the three
conflict resolution techniques,

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.120
satyagraha, and finally,
the ultimate sacrifice,

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.680
if you have to go that far.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.470
Now, I wanted to
quickly share with you

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:36.090
a scientific study that Frans
de Waal, who you heard from,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.500
carried on.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.830
They had this colony
of rhesus monkeys.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.930
Rhesus monkeys are
pretty bad hombres,

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.900
as you can tell from this
picture, which of course, I've

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.889
chosen for the purpose.

00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:49.680
Here's another one.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.060
I had to think of
this guy in New York.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.040
"You got some kind
of problem with dat?"

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.740
So in this colony
of rhesus monkeys,

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.600
they introduced a
colony of stumptails.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.800
Aren't they cute?

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.340
Now, stumptails are a little
bit bigger than rhesus monkeys,

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.510
but they're also much,
much less aggressive.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.600
So the experiment
was to see, how long

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.820
is it going to take
for the rhesus monkeys

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.050
to wipe up the cage with
these less aggressive guys?

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:25.400
So a stumptail would
be sitting on a branch

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.760
and a rhesus would come over
and say, get off of my branch.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.320
And the stumptail
was saying, I refuse

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.600
to put up with your
injustice, but I'm open to you

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.260
as a primate.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.290
And sometimes,
they would actually

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.520
offer a finger to be bitten.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.580
The rhesus would bite
the finger, which hurts.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.815
I mean, these guys
are jaw muscles.

00:48:43.815 --> 00:48:49.560
[INAUDIBLE] But they
wouldn't back down.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.090
And to the astonishment
of the scientists,

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:59.290
within a short period of
time, this stumptail culture,

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.500
so to call it, had been
adopted by the rhesus monkeys.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.120
So here's these
animals, they never

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.030
took my nonviolence
class, and yet

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.370
they could be reached by basic
nonviolent techniques, which

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.800
required sacrifice and cost.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.610
But their little primate
brains were changed.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.610
And so that was the
second big surprise.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.310
The nonviolent
resistance was working.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.250
The amazing thing was that
the rhesus adopted it.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.690
And now comes the third.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.090
Third is the winner, right?

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.810
So they took the stumptails
out after a while

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.900
and watched to see, how long is
it going to take for the rhesus

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.310
to go back to their bad
old, New York subway ways?

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.110
And guess what?

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.100
They still haven't done that.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.980
So the conversion to
nonviolence is a robust change.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.260
I wanted to introduce
you to these two guys

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.450
because you're going to be using
their story in the workshop.

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.170
These two gentlemen were part
of this new institution called

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:07.450
Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping
or Unarmed Civilian Protection.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.410
They were in a UN IDP camp--

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.080
Internally Displaced
Person camp--

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.580
in South Sudan, one of the most
violent places in the world

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.720
right now.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.930
And suddenly, that camp
was attacked by a militia.

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.790
These two guys ran
into a little hut

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.670
to protect, to save themselves.

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:30.660
They found 13 women and
children in that hut.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:34.020
And a couple of minutes
later, the militia burst in--

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.800
AK-47s, axes, sharpened sticks.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.060
And they saw these two, who
were obviously not Sudanese,

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.604
and said to them,
hey, you get out.

00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:46.020
Now, you know
exactly what's going

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.240
to happen when they get out.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.320
Outside the hut, they're
listening to gunfire.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.050
But these two showed
their badges and said,

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:59.770
I'm sorry we're international
protection officers

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.500
and we're not leaving.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.110
So there's this flipping
the script, right--

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.690
intense moment of
confrontation--

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.930
and the militia turned
around and left.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.290
Not only that, but in the 20
minutes that this raid went on,

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.390
this happened three times.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.340
Militia came in
and said, you know,

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.048
we're going to kill
you, get out of here,

00:51:19.048 --> 00:51:20.670
threatened them with weapons.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:26.280
And these two refused to back
down, and the militia left.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.150
Outside that little
hut, 60 people

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.210
were massacred in 20 minutes.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:35.570
Inside the hut, nobody was hurt.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.980
There's a very
dramatic illustration

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.169
of the power of nonviolence.

00:51:41.169 --> 00:51:42.210
So that's the background.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.130
We may be using
this story later.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.300
So what can we do about it?

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.070
I'm just going to have to
go over this very quickly.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.990
We have a scheme
called Roadmap, which

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.650
divides up the
problem into three

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.690
and guides you from
personal empowerment,

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:01.770
take us through a constructive
program, to resistance.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:05.310
You can find this and
much supportive material

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:06.480
on our website.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.670
But what I wanted
to share with you--

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:13.410
and if this works, by the
way, this next move of mine,

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.920
it's going to be the greatest
technological triumph

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.060
of this slideshow.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.350
So wish me luck.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:22.230
Here we go.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.690
Cha.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:27.480
Thank you, Marie.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.480
So this is the inner circle,
which we've just enlarged.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.770
And we have these
five suggestions.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.020
You want to be very
careful about your exposure

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.750
to violence in the mass media.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:44.610
I'm really particularly glad to
be sharing, with you, this idea

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.700
because I think here you can
have some influence over how

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.850
the mass media works.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:53.880
Learn everything you
can about nonviolence.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.980
You'll never guess
where I will direct you

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.570
if you want to do more of that.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.970
Mettacenter.org.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.380
Take up a spiritual practice.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.110
I know Meng isn't
here anymore, but we

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.680
do have mindfulness
that's going on here.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.370
We recommend one called
passage meditation.

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:13.200
It's what most of us
do at the Metta Center.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.890
And the website
there is bmcm.org.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.331
Stands for Blue Mountain
Center of Meditation dot org.

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:24.420
Re-personalization, just
be more personal with all

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.620
your human interactions.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.280
And finally, it's
quite helpful if you

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.820
learn the basic outlines
of the New Story

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.610
and be ready to share
it on any occasion

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.220
because that's how
paradigms change.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:38.827
Nandu?

00:53:38.827 --> 00:53:40.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just want--

00:53:40.035 --> 00:53:43.357
AUDIENCE: They use violence
and somehow nobody gets hurt.

00:53:43.357 --> 00:53:44.440
MICHAEL NAGLER: Oh, right.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:44.939
Right.

00:53:44.939 --> 00:53:45.470
Yes.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:49.640
That's one of the real delusions
about-- thank you, Nandu--

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.510
one of the real delusions
about the Old Story

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:56.670
is that it's safe
to use violence.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:00.110
And so you have Superman--
and this is very embarrassing

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:04.520
because I actually wrote
some of the scripts

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.880
for some "Superboy" comics
when I was very, very young.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.212
I just plain didn't
know any better.

00:54:10.212 --> 00:54:11.420
I was growing up in Brooklyn.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.220
Anyway, never mind.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.490
The idea is if you
use nonviolence,

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:20.450
people are immediately
overcome, the problem is solved,

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.270
and you don't get hurt.

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.910
Whereas the reality is that
if you incarcerate people,

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.240
they will recommit crimes
when they get out of prison

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.070
at a rate of 76% nationwide.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.340
In restorative justice, the
rate will be more like 2% or 3%.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.020
Thank you.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.070
Thank you very much.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:43.120
[APPLAUSE]
