00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Are you ready for this?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.840
I am a sociology major with a minor in Asian American studies.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.940
I'm an applied math major.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.600
Russian, geography and environmental studies.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.460
I am a sociology major.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.680
I'm a math econ major and a film minor.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.220
Class of 2017.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.780
You know, it's always about the sunshine here in Los Angeles.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
It's kind of a blessing and a curse because I need to study but every weekend there's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.560
always something I want to be doing more.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.260
There's like so many different cultures and foods to explore. I'm a huge foodie so.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.680
I like that there are places open past 9 o'clock.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.840
My favorite professor was Elizabeth Olsen.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.600
Going to class didn't feel like going to class. It felt
like I was going and getting to like

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
watch a great Netflix special or something.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.140
His name was Dr. Keith Camacho.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.860
I've enjoyed all the times that we've hung
out.  And we even BBQ'd.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.700
The class I'm taking right now. Barbara Boyles.  It's a producing class.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.580
Learn about how  to actually make a movie in Hollywood.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
I would tell my freshman self just to explore new things.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
And be excited with the people you encounter over here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940
Just to enjoy the roller coaster ride.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.720
The future is what it is and just enjoy the present.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.640
Obviously, classes are a big part of UCLA

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.580
and it's important to focus on things
like internships and classes and jobs.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.620
But, nothing is really more important
than the personal relationships that you form here.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.760
I'd tell this freshman self to get a haircut.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.820
You're going to make all the right choices. 
You're going to have a great time.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.260
Don't stress too much about these choices. And live life to the fullest.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400
Eat enough food. Drink enough water. Get enough sleep every day.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.380
Do the school spirit thing. Go to the bonfire go to the games.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.600
Tip number one:  make your meals ahead of time.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.580
Tip number two: visit the Writing Center more often.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
Broaden your horizons. Not just take a class because it fulfills a requirement

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.700
or fits for your major. Take classes that you're really generally interested in.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.620
Extra tip: say thank you to mom and dad every week that you're on campus.
