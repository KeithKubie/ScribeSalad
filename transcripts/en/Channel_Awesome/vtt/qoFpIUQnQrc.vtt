00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.220
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.499
With Ben Affleck now being chosen
 as the new Dark Knight,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
you have to wonder if anyone ever gave any consideration

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.980
to having Ben Affleck play a superhero in the past--

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.080
IT'S DAREDEVIL ISN'T IT?!

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.260
NO! No no no no no no no!

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.880
You don't understand! This isn't just a bad comic book movie,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.980
This is a bad comic book movie from the EARLY 2000S!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.749
You know how comic book films are huge now? And smart and funny and clever?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.700
Well, back in the day, comic books were still kind of seen as kid stuff.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.889
And films like THESE certainly didn't help its case.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.539
So, comic book movies back then had to try even harder to be taken seriously, which surprisingly backfired in how repetitive they became.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.239
Every movie had to be DARK and GRITTY and PAINFUL. Which isn't bad once in a while,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.300
But when every single fucking one of them starts to look like that, they start to come across as mopy,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.860
complainy, and downright not fun.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.560
Don't get me wrong, some films did it okay, but ones like Daredevil?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.679
Ugh. Let's just say it's something I'm really not looking forward to reviewing alone.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.100
[???] You won't need to, Critic!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.140
I will help you!

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.940
Who are you?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.760
I am a superhero from the early 2000s, simply known as...

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
THE ANGST.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.580
Well, that's great. I could use some help reviewing this. Here, why don't you come sit next to me--

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.920
Thank you, but I must stay here. I have so many brooding poses on top of rooftops to show.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.680
Oh yeah, I guess that was kind of a thing for a while.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.000
But we will get through this together, or my name isn't THE ANGST!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.420
[sigh] All right, prepare for early 2000s super cheese with...Daredevil.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.120
It makes me want to hang my head in contemplation!

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.160
As the credits roll, blood drips down a stained glass window of the Virgin Mary while our hero hangs in pain off the cross at

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.900
the top of a church.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.380
Yep, it's that kind of movie, kids!

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.040
Why don't you just throw in God weeping in the corner saying, "What poetic despair has life become?"

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.480
We then flash back to the good old days of the bad old days, when we see Affleck playing Matt Murdock growing up in a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.220
part of town called Hell's Kitchen.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.340
Yeah, you know it's coming, so here it is.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.340
THIS IS FUCKING PAINFUL!

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.500
Back to the review.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.080
When he was a young boy, he was always beat up by the kid from--ah shit,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.660
there's a Sopranos joke too? Crap, where's that joke filed under? Um...

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.360
OF COURSE!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.920
No...

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.880
I WAS FROZEN--

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.080
No...um...

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280
So...that's why you were interrogated in Law &amp; Order?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.980
[Booing]

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.240
What do you want?! They sprung it on me!

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.340
[Booing]

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.720
He's upset because his dad used to go nine rounds with Heavyweight Louis;

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.000
Now,he goes nine rounds with Heavyweight Heineken.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.120
Dad: You don't hit nothing but books, get me?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.200
But when he discovers his dad was working for a crime boss,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.229
he stumbles onto some hazardous chemicals that make him blind.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.180
You know...

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.540
Why is it anything that can give you superpowers is not better protected?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.880
You can write "BIOHAZARD"

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.800
all you want on it, but when kids are allowed in the area

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.199
and it's fucking everywhere like goddamn Candy Crush, you might want to rethink security a little bit!

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.240
Dad: I'm sorry, Matty.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.819
His dad gives up his life of crime, but he shouldn't feel too sorry,

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.280
as the chemicals heighten Murdock's other senses,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.480
allowing him to see the world like every special feature in a PS3 game.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.080
Bully: Hey Murdock! Round two!

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.300
'Yeah, that's right! We're such one-dimensional bullies,
we're ACTUALLY gonna beat up a blind kid!'

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.660
We kind of have no souls!

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.440
Next, we're going to teach tap dancing to people in wheelchairs!

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.300
ALSO while beating them up!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.360
It's a thug thing, you wouldn't understand!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"Oh no, he has a cane!"

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.820
"All I can do is just stand here and take it, I guess!"

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.070
He's even become so good that he can even tell when his father is... losing a fight.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.900
Murdock: Come on, Dad! Come on, get up!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.120
So, wait a minute. His powers are so good he can hear punches over a screaming crowd

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.300
AND he could take on bullies all by himself?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.320
Oh, yes, super powers can do that.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.880
I'm actually completely deaf.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.820
You are?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.840
Yes! Chemical liquid goo made me lose all my hearing.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.300
But it also gave me super listening powers as well!

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.760
So...there's totally no point to you being deaf, then.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.260
Huh?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.160
If one thing was taken away from you, but then given back in a different way,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.680
there's totally no point in losing it.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.620
Of course there is!

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.740
It gives me an EDGE!

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
No! It doesn't! If anything, you can sense things better than you could before!

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.900
Look at our hero!

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.760
He doesn't even need the stick!

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.600
Not only is he a better fighter than most,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.360
but he's pointing out when to cross the street better than mandatory cameos can.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.300
So the disability is totally pointless!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600
In fact, it's almost like you don't even have a disability!

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.570
Well...

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.820
I also broke my arm.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.740
Did you get it fixed?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.240
Maybe.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.120
THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER!

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.100
It doesn't impact anything with your character!

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.540
I AM THE ANGST!

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.000
Does a gush of wind ever just push you off a building?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.940
Not yet.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.320
Wh-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.200
Ooh! Oh-hoh! Ohohoho! Almost got me there! Hehe. Ooh!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.800
Ahahaha--ANGST.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.980
So because his father doesn't throw the fight, he's killed by a bunch of thugs,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.470
with the final punch being given by a villain called

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.559
the Kingpin, who leaves a rose with all his victims because...

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.280
...it'll leave no trace that way???

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.280
Dad: "Bruuuce. I mean, Peeeter. I mean, Simba! I mean--"

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.720
"Oh, you know what to do with this."

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.780
Virgin Mary: "Umm...hi, audience!"

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.920
"Uh, the director has decided to hold on me for a bit..."

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.920
"...so, ummm..."

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.980
"...it's the VIRGIN MARY SHOW!"

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.800
"DADADADADADADA"

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.140
"Hey, what are you doing today? Oh, I'm gonna learn all about it--"

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.440
"Oh thank God. That was getting really awkward."

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.200
"I am Count Afflecula! I have come to suck..."

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.000
...and that's it."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.800
So. Rather than, oh, I don't know, hand himself over to science to help other blind people

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.880
sense what he does,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.920
he decides to become a lawyer, because...

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.680
...let's face it, saying the "justice is blind" phrase is just too tempting not to use.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.060
Murdock: Justice is blind.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.880
See?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.960
Obvious Rapist: I stopped off at Josie's bar after work after a few nights. She asked me if I wanted to stick around...

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.980
...for some fun. (DUN DUN DUN.)

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.880
Uh, yeah. Listen to his heartbeat to see if he's lying.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.080
Not the SO OBVIOUSLY LYING TONE he's so OBVIOUSLY LYING WITH.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.500
Obvious Rapist: Miss Sutton...Miss Sutton enjoyed every minute of it.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.740
Murdock: It's not right. Another rapist back on the streets.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.800
This, of course, forces him to take justice in his own hands!

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.940
That was totally necessary!

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.050
Is that guy for real?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.630
Yeah, he's for real.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.090
What do you want?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.680
Okay, I'll give you three guesses what he's going to answer that with.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.400
Just assume a superhero's answer for anything is justice.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.660
"How are you?" "JUSTICE."

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.040
"What are you eating?" "JUSTICE."

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.140
"How do I get to your house?"

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.520
"Oh, just take a right on Michigan Avenue off the corner of Wabash and JUSTICE!"

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.000
He tracks him down to a subway where he finally gets the JUSTICE he deserves.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.220
Daredevil: That light?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.080
At the end of the tunnel? That's not Heaven.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.020
That's the C TRAIN!

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.180
"That's right!"

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.580
"Daredevil is going to kill you because Matt Murdock is a terrible lawyer!"

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.580
"Enjoy my compensation for my terrible occupational choices!"

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.540
Determined to get his half of the story [rimshot]

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.680
Joe Pantoliano comes in playing Robert Wall (minus the humor)

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.180
Before he became Robert Wall (minus the humor)

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.960
As he suspects the urban legend Daredevil might be behind this.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.040
Reporter: Are you here to confirm that Daredevil is responsible for this, Detective?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.840
Detective: There is no proof that your so-called Daredevil was involved, nor that he even exists.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.720
Got it?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.860
"Now let me bask in how weaselly and stuck-up I am,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.200
as I know for a fact that I will in no way be contradicted at all--"

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
"WHAAAAAAA?????"

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.720
Reporter: Got it.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.440
You know...that's not exactly the most obvious or safest calling card.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.120
Say they didn't see that gasoline on the floor! Like...

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.560
most people wouldn't.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.040
What if another subway rider was just waiting for a train while smoking?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080
AAAAAHHHH!!!

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080
Oh--oh--oh my God--oh--oh--what--

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.180
Who the hell is "DD?!"

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.260
AAAAAAHHH

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Answering Machine: Matt, are you there?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.880
Of course you're not there. You're never there.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.100
Every time we sleep together, I wake up in the morning alone.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.300
I thought that if I waited...if I was patient enough, you'd let me in.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.880
Daredevil: "Ugh, fucking J.Lo. Will she ever get the message?"

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.420
After chewing his pills,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.240
because that's what HARDCORE people do,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.840
he goes to confession, as the priest is apparently the only one who knows his secret.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.200
Daredevil: Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.860
"For I am making Daredevil."

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.050
Priest: "Your penance is 10 years obscurity. Do one Argo, one Gone Girl,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.800
and maybe, one day, you will be Batman."

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.940
Foggy: Eyewitnesses say that Casada (?) was singled out by the demonic vigilante...

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.260
He then meets up with his partner, played by Jon Favreau,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.240
clearly taking notes on how NOT to direct a superhero movie.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.800
Foggy: Mr. Lee, he made his first payment.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.080
He paid in fluke.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
What? What? Where? Where? Where?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.820
Murdock: The door...mumble mumble mumble.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Ah, yes, those chemicals also gave him super-sniffing-through-glass-able-to-detect-attractiveness-and-not-just-a-really-nice-perfume-powers, too!

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.700
It's a...strange cross to bear.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.720
This, of course, is Jennifer Garner,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.740
who doesn't seem to grasp that love is blind.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.060
Hey, you know if the film thought of that joke they would've said it!

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.340
Murdock: I didn't get your name.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.480
Elektra: I didn't give it.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.740
Foggy: Okay, some people have no compassion for the handicapped.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.040
No, she left because he was Ben Affleck.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.160
Though I guess in some respects, that's kind of a handicap.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.380
Elektra: What do you want?

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.580
Murdock: I just wanted to get your name.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.000
He follows her outside to get her name, but...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.500
Oh, I can't even explain it.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.800
Just watch.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.440
Murdock: Wait a second.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.680
Which time we could do like just we'll start there

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:54.829
Okay, so...

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.819
Where do I begin with this?

00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:59.389
First of all, I think she's making it pretty clear

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:01.459
she's not interested in your stalker ass!

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:05.208
If she wanted, she could call the cops on you for being a creeper and grabbing her.

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:10.560
But nah! It makes much more sense to fight him, which leads to the second and most obvious problem:

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.660
SHE'S FIGHTING A BLIND GUY!

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.640
She doesn't know he has super senses, and neither does anyone else,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.720
So really, what is there to gain?

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.620
If you lose, you got beaten by a blind guy.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.440
Pretty pathetic.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.960
But if you win, congrats, you beat the shit out of a FUCKING BLIND GUY!

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.860
How does anyone come out looking good in this scenario?

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.580
Elektra: My name's Elektra Natchios.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.820
No, really, what--what's your name? That so obviously can't be it.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.460
Elektra: My name's Elektra Natchios.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.280
"Yes, you should meet my other parents with obvious real names!"

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.300
"Anastasia Steele and Harvey Manfrenjessindin!"

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.320
So Murdock and Electric Nachos seemed to hit it off as they go strolling together.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.438
Murdock: Where'd you learn how to fight like that?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.000
Elektra: My father.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.700
He had me study with a different sensei every year since I was five years old.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.360
Murdock: Sounds like he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.140
Elektra: No.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.220
Just not a victim.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.180
"Which is clearly all I am if I don't learn how to kick ass!"

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.480
"He's very equal that way."

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.660
Murdock: Watch your step.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.340
Elektra: Oh. Thank you. I didn't even--

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.440
Wait.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.780
How'd you do that?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.760
Oh, NOW you're asking how the fuck he sees stuff?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.740
Because that shit back there,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.240
pff, I've seen Ray Charles do that on fucking Pepsi commercials!

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.740
watching screen a paper Trail

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.920
One that can be traced [will] not you give me bulls on

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.830
We're then introduced to our villains of the film: Michael Clarke Duncan

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.520
as the Kingpin, and Colin Farrell as Bullseye.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.980
And I swear, these guys are having the time of their life whenever the camera is on them.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.720
It's like they know the movie is totally fucking ridiculous, so they're just gonna have fun with it.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.750
They're like Honey Badger!

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.740
They don't give a shit!

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.540
Old Lady: But he did very well for himself, on the internet.

00:12:50.609 --> 00:12:54.000
But don't ask me how. So I said--

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.409
Oh my God. I swear, if Nicolas Cage was a drug, he smoked two bags worth.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.460
Attendant: Oh, she's sleeping.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.620
Can I get you anything before we land?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.680
Bullseye: More peanuts. Please.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.920
We hope you enjoyed this...

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.480
...charming "choking the old lady" scene.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.300
Stay tuned for more uncomfortable dives into the director's psyche!

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.800
So Daredevil hunts down another criminal preying on the weak

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.320
when he comes across an onlooker.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.780
Boy: Please don't hurt me!

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.700
Daredevil: I'm not the bad guy, kid.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.160
"Why is it just because I dress like the DEVIL, everyone assumes I'm the bad guy?!"

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.940
I'm not the bad guy.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.660
I'm not.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.660
...The hell was that about?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.560
BROODING!

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.520
Brooding.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.760
Yes. Every early 2000s superhero has a moment where he has to stare into the distance to THINK.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.960
Yeah, but those other superheroes usually have something to think about.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.589
He scared a kid because he was beating up a bad guy!

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:05.280
How does that make him question himself?

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.700
We don't need a reason! We just need to BROOD.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.600
Oh Jesus. Who are you?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
I am...

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:14.760
ANGSTINE.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.860
My God, where did you learn karate?!

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.660
My father didn't want me to be a victim!

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.980
I'm AMAZED!

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.380
Uh, you do know women learn martial arts all the time, right?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.200
Impossible!

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.360
Clearly, there must be some strange reason why.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.500
No, a lot of women, just like men, take it up

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.800
just because they want to take it up.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.140
That's crazy! There's got to be a reason why!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.980
Like, her father was trying to protect her.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.840
Or her father was secretly a spy!

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.660
Or her father always wanted a son!

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.260
Or maybe her mother played a part somehow?

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.880
AHAHAHAHA

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.240
That's a good one.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.020
Yeah, in between picking flowers or NOT BEING DEAD!

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.280
These aren't real.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.120
I'm just saying, a woman learning martial arts isn't as "rare" as you think it is.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.310
Well, how else can we pretend

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.520
she's unique when she's clearly not?

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.600
I don't know, I just need a break from these early 2000s clichés.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.440
Very well.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.640
Angstine. We draw closer to the third act. You know what that means.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.140
Sexy cry?

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.640
Sexy cry.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.140
Okay.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.360
[Music]

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.860
I'm so tortured.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.480
Don't ever be heroes, kids.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.380
So Murdock brings Electra Tacos to the roof because he knows it's going to rain,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.020
and that'll allow him to see her face better.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.700
Murdock: You are so beautiful.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.880
"Wow, I'm sure this is the first time a superhero who wears all red is kissing his girlfriend in the rain."

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.080
"...But we'll be remembered better for it!"

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.980
But hero duty seems to be calling.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.900
Elektra: What?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.660
Matt, what's wrong?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.140
Murdock: "Oh, it should have been about just us,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.160
and now it's about JUSTICE!"

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.600
I have to go.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.140
Elektra: Stay with me.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.480
Yeah, don't worry about it!

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.400
I'm sure it was nobody important who was getting

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.120
hija--oh.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.980
Peter: Uncle Ben?

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.860
I'm...sure things will turn out fine.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.440
Anyway!

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.980
AAAAAAA

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.319
That's what I'm talking about.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.080
Oh, yeah.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.520
Quick sidenote: early 2000s editing seemed to really like the style that

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.620
somebody's buttcheek sat on the fast forward button and then got up just before the scene starts.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.199
This is one of the few additions

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:31.980
I actually miss from early 2000s films, because as you can tell,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.200
it gets the movie over faster.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.780
Kingpin: Hello.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.380
You're the blind lawyers from Hell's Kitchen.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.360
So he finally meets the Kingpin, who wants to bring Murdock into his business.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.940
Murdock: We can't represent you.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.220
Kingpin: And why is that?

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.040
Foggy: Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.499
Murdock: Because...

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:51.040
...we only handle clients who are innocent.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.579
HA!

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:56.560
Okay, a blind man jumping around in tights stopping crimes who can see better than most people, I can take.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.660
But a LAWYER who only takes innocent clients?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.040
I'm sorry, you totally cut the suspension cord of disbelief!

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.140
Murdock: Now I found you.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.100
"I really want to see you again."

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.680
"What do you say we pull the fire alarm and set the sprinklers off?"

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.140
But the Kingpin puts out a hit on her father, and of course,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.640
Bullseye is the one to pull it off.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.480
How the hell many assassins stand out as much as this guy does?

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.340
I mean, for God's sake, the artist rendering must be pretty easy to sketch!

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.880
Bullseye: Bullseye! Heh? Ha!

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.620
Can I adopt you?

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.600
Bullseye: Bullseye!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.420
"It's on my head! Thought I'd point that out."

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.080
"I'm Irish!"

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.220
So Electronic Honchos thinks, of course, Daredevil killed her father

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.400
and vows revenge.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.040
Meanwhile, we all giggle as one of the world's biggest comic book geeks cameos in one of the world's worst comic book movies,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.560
as the reporter realizes that the cane used as a weapon is also the cane Murdock walks with.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.800
Which is pretty fucking stupid when you really think about it.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.800
Why the flying hell would you walk around with that?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.700
Isn't that like Bruce Wayne driving into work with the Batmobile?

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.540
Somebody's going to put two and two together!

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.600
Kingpin: You know, you've exceeded all my expectations.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.800
Meanwhile, the Kingpin and Bullseye meet to figure out what to do about Daredevil.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.300
Bullseye: He...

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.880
...made me...

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.300
miss.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.880
Kingpin: Too much pride can kill a man.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.100
"Well, that's just ridiculous."

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.650
[give] [me] [lecture]. Oh my bad

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.860
He's so evil, even ROSES smell bad to him.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.500
What does he have for dinner, corned beef and Cabbage Patch Kids' heads?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.980
Meanwhile, Natchios Libre prepares for her revenge by taking on the most dangerous obstacle she can think of:

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.940
SANDBAGS!

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.060
Who the hell is even dropping those?

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.960
Is there just a really confused servant

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.060
who is not sure why she's attacking the flooding equipment in their chandelier room?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.660
Servant: "Madame, why do you want me to paint a cartoon devil on this one?"

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.900
Elektra: "Because he's the one that killed my father!"

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.380
Servant: "Of course he is."

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.520
"Would you like to tour some of the local rubber rooms in the area, by any chance?"

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:19.680
So Electron attacks Daredevil outside the one weirdo who dries his laundry at night for some reason?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.020
Daredevil: It wasn't me!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.800
I didn't kill your father!

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.540
Elektra: Liar!

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.820
Nice read on that line, Garner.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.020
Daredevil: I didn't kill your father!

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.660
Elektra: Liar!

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.920
Yeah, you could really cause people to crack with how convicted and...NOT silly that sounds.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.940
Yeah, I was just up all night watching Game of Thrones.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.440
Liar!

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.250
Okay, Walking Dead.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.780
Liar!

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.700
All right, Bates Motel.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.280
Liar!

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.460
All right, Parks and Recreation!

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.960
Liar!

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.380
All right! I was watching Downton Abbey!

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.760
I just have to know what Maggie Smith thinks of turn of the century social noooorms!

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.600
Liar!

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.700
OH, SHUT UP!

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.180
She beats the shit out of him, but then realizes the mistake she's made.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.440
Daredevil: I was trying to protect you. (?)

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.280
[wolf whistle]

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.040
"Wait, why do I smell Guinness, stale cigarettes, and Lucky Charms?"

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.420
Oh yeah, he sneers at rats too.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.720
This guy could be a song lyric for the Grinch!

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.500
Daredevil: I don't wanna lose you again.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.720
Elektra: I'll find you.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.680
"I should get you medical attention, but...

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.560
yeah, revenge is more important."

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.580
"Which reminds me, avenge me if I don't come back."

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.240
Bullseye: Come on.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.400
Elektra: "Well, I can do that, too--

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.920
oh wait, I forgot I suuuck."

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.460
"You wouldn't be so hot if you were a sandbag!"

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.200
Bullseye: "Does this annoy you? Does this annoy you?"

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.500
"I'm not touching you!"

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.660
Elektra: "I don't get it! I did so good at fighting a blind guy and--"

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.340
"Oh, NOW I'm putting the pieces together."

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.960
Daredevil: "We really suck."

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.120
Elektra: "Yeah. Yeah, we do."

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.800
So she gets axed off as the police tried to track him down,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.260
leading us to where we started.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.940
Speakin' a gettin' started,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.860
Ha, that's what I plan to do, hyahaha!

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.580
By God, an eccentric, big-eyed villain!

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.160
Classic trademark of the early 2000s.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.860
Who are you?

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.640
Name's Target, hahahaha!

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.679
Let me guess, because you always hit your target?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.400
No, I just really like clearance places. Hahahahaha!

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.960
Right, you know what we need to do.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.500
You're both going to defeat him?

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.460
Nope! I'm going to defeat him while she either gets captured or killed.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.960
What?

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.460
It's an early 2000s thing.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.059
We make me look all tough, but in the end,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.660
I've got to be saved or mourned.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.580
Or you could work together?

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.168
No, this works.

00:21:39.168 --> 00:21:41.240
Right, lass! You're good at catchin' things?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.080
Well, catch this!

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.660
Don't worry. I'll stop it with my head!

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.780
Uh, I don't think that's a good idea--

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.720
Well, that--wow.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.540
Hoho! Hehe! Haha!

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.240
Right! Now I know even MORE what to do!

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.400
Finally fight?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.120
No.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.300
Mourn in agony while he mugs for the camera.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.620
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.740
Okay, you do what you...feel you're compelled to do

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.280
while I get back to the review.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:06.940
Wow.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.540
[anguish]

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.840
Bullseye tracks Daredevil down to the church

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.800
and they partake in Toccata and Fuck You.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.060
Daredevil: "Wow, I dodge bullets and siamese stars and yet somehow I miss THAT?"

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.020
"The only thing consistent about my powers is how inconsistent they are!"

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.520
Bullseye: Mumble mumble fear.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.360
Looks like I found something you're afraid of.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.880
Let's bring on the pain.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.580
"Oh, begorrah and potatoes!"

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.500
But he gives him a touch of stigmata because...

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.000
I don't know, are we doing Jesus symbolism in comic movies yet?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.800
And he wishes him a nice fall.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.100
Whoa!

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.760
Daredevil: Bullseye.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.860
Hmm. I also would have accepted,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.360
Daredevil: "Knock knock."

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.860
Bullseye: "Who's there?"

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.780
Daredevil: "JUSTICE!"

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.700
Priest: Good luck, son.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.540
"Do the Lord's work."

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.580
"Kill them! Kill them fucking all!"

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.500
Kingpin: Send the guards home.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.720
Wesley: B-but, sir--

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.240
Wesley: I was raised in the Bronx, Wesley. This is something you wouldn't understand.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.980
"Yes, I have to go one-on-one...

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:20.500
...even though every other murder I've committed has always been done by the hands of others...

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.760
...in fact, I even had others kill Daredevil's father and only delivered the final punch..."

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.052
"It's all about honor!"

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.020
"A very, very, VERY inconsistent honor."

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.780
Daredevil: Kingpin.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.220
Daredevil tries to fight him, but forgot he sucks,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.900
So he figures maybe the sprinklers will help.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.380
Because...yeah, his powers that could sense all these tiny things

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.080
apparently can't pick up a 300-pound 7-foot giant for some reason.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.780
Daredevil: I've been thinking about this day since I was twelve years old.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.120
Kingpin: "Uh. I wonder if he knows he missed."

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.860
"Uh--ooh!...You got me!...I'm dead!"

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.860
I don't understand.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.500
Daredevil: I'm not the bad guy.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.520
Oh, no shit!

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.120
Try telling that to the two halves of the guy you let get run over by a train!

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.240
Daredevil: That's not Heaven!

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.240
That's the C TRAIN!

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.620
"By the way, I'm totally not the bad guy--"

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.420
"He knew what I was saying."

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:29.220
Kingpin: I swear I'll tell them who you are.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.220
Daredevil: Tell the guys at Rikers all about how you got beaten by a blind man.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.040
Kingpin: Don't worry about that.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.720
'Cause I'll get out.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.680
Daredevil: Yeah. I know.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.300
And I'll be waiting.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.720
Justice is served.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.200
Wait. You're not killing the guy,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.780
he just said he'll get out to cause more chaos BECAUSE of the faulty justice system--

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.760
a justice system you're a part of--

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.940
and then you said:

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.380
Justice is served.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.120
Yeah, until he gets out! Then it's NOT, you fucking idiot!

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.580
Justice is served.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.360
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.360
So the Kingpin is put away until he's let out again,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.780
but it's okay--justice is served!--

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.980
And we cut to later, where we see Murdock...

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.300
...smelling someone who looked like his dead girlfriend.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.660
Makes about as much sense as the other stuff.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.800
when we then cut to the reporter deciding whether or not to reveal Daredevil's identity.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.240
Reporter: Go get it, man.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.640
"This is probably withholding evidence, and I'm not sure why I was writing about it instead of going to the police,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.040
but I have little to no part in this movie, so why make an impact now?"

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.260
[anguish]

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960
OH, WILL YOU GUYS STOP IT?!

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.780
Thank fucking God these clichés are so rarely done anymore!

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.700
You could point to every comic book movie before it that this film was trying to imitate,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.240
from Batman to Spider-Man to Blade.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.740
But while those movies at the time

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.920
offered something new, this just throws in what it heard worked in the past together

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.620
without attaching any emotional logic or character to it.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.800
Once in a while you'll have something kind of neat,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.280
like the blind vision is kind of cool and some of the fights work,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.740
but they're way too few and far between.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.000
It was when the old and tired comic book cliches were fading away

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and the new and inventive ones were starting to take over,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.480
and all I can say, is it was definitely for the best.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.900
That's all fine and good, but what about our current situation, buttercup?

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.440
Oh, don't worry.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.420
I know the one thing that can stop every early 2000s hero or villain.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.760
Really? What's that?

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.300
Look to your left...

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.520
...now.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.840
[peaceful music]

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.540
Aw hell, the bloody sun came up.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.920
We can't fight during the day, we only look cool at night!

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.240
Well...I'll see you in the sequel that'll never happen.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.480
Angstine: I'm getting a sequel?

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.540
Nah, you're dead, it wouldn't make any sense!

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.420
I'm Target! Hee-hee-hee-ha-hee-hee-ha-ho-ha-ha!

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.320
So? Now what?

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.660
Well, isn't it obvious?

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.020
I jump through the city looking awesome while an early 2000s song plays!

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.520
Oh, you mean the ones that always sound like a southern hick is singing with a golf ball in his mouth?

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.320
The very one.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.340
I'll see you whatever justice is needed, Critic.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.320
I will have no fond memories of you, Angst.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.240
Until then!

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040
