00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.160
We have a certain intuition about
what objects will feel like, and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.750
what we can do with them,
just by looking at them.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.470
We call these affordances.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.680
Take for example,
this piece of paper, and this apple.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.440
I know from my previous experience with
paper that I can easily pick it up.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.990
I can twist it.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.890
I can tear it, and so on.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.780
I know that the apple has greater mass.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.970
It'll be harder to pick up,
but that I can throw it up or

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.690
even take a bite out of it.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.850
Now these learned expectations
help us to quickly recognize

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.900
how we can interact with objects.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.420
Now completely recreating real world
objects in our UIs can be limiting and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.500
have some adverse affects.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.220
We can, however, take advantage of some
of these basic principles of affordances

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.160
and tangibility to make
our UIs more intuitive.
