00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.440
We’ve all heard the statements and stats
about the ominous timeline our planet is on.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.600
To avoid the worst effects of climate change––from
natural disasters to mass extinction––we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.300
know that we need to reduce our greenhouse
gas emissions. And fast.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.910
And when we stop literally lighting things
on fire to power our world, we can build something

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.750
that looks more like this. When you plug in,
you’re pulling from a resilient local network

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.610
of abundant and affordable clean energy that
keeps the sky blue, the storms at bay and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:48.480
the birds, well… alive. So, how close are
we to a zero-emissions grid?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.580
Greenhouse gas emissions primarily come from
electricity, transportation, and industry.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.740
But in a zero-emissions future, this chart
actually looks more like this. Because in

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.460
post-carbon world, almost everything relies
on the electrical grid.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.240
This means we’ll need a way bigger grid
than we have today –– maybe as much double

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.820
the 4100 terawatt hours the U.S. currently
uses per year. Right now that’s served up

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.460
through a high-voltage power system that draws
primarily from centralized coal, nuclear,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.039
and natural gas plants. Three main grids then
deliver power by the minute to the eastern

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.770
half, western half, and the Texas… half... of
the country, through local distribution networks.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.939
We use almost no oil in the power sector to
generate electricity, which is a good thing.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.440
In 2017, we were 28% cleaner than we were
back in 2005.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.220
Two thirds of our power still comes from coal and natural gas, so we have a lot of work to do.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.689
So what is that work, exactly? Well, electrical
engineers see the life cycle of energy in

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.219
three main phases: generation––making
it, transmission––moving it, and distribution––metering

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.470
it out. And to build a zero-emissions grid,
each of these stages has to be clean and efficient.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.899
So let’s start with generation.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.890
If you look at how clean we are, nuclear makes
up about 20%, Hydro is around 7.5% or so, and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.360
then wind and solar together are getting close to around 8% and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.110
then very small amounts of geothermal and
some other renewable technologies.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.450
So, how can we bump those numbers up? The
fact is, most renewable sources are highly

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.209
variable. And finding a way to store that
sunshine for a rainy day is challenge #1.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.629
Often storage seems as the Holy Grail to allow
us reaching a low-carbon society. Solar PV

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.280
and wind turbines are intermittent energy
resources; if we need to have energy available

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.579
all the time, they cannot supply it.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.189
Today, the most common and widely used technology
to store energy is pump storage, huge dams

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.580
with large lakes at the top and when we need

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.060
the energy we just open the dam and water
is running down and generating hydro-electricity.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.689
Compressed air is another viable solution
for underground storage, and then, of course,

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.620
there are batteries, which are becoming cheaper
and more widely available by the day.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.760
With batteries, typically you just have a
few hours of storage. We're going to need

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.000
longer periods of storage, not on the order
of hours but on the order of weeks.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.239
The problem is, pumped hydro storage, while
powerful, has already been developed in most

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.310
of the places it can be. It has a huge ecological footprint and until materials scientists crack the immortal battery––and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.689
don’t worry, we’ll let you know––
renewables are just too flaky to rely on entirely,

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.819
without some additional help.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.890
Nuclear power has been a very reliable source
of zero emission power in the U.S. People

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.420
like Bill Gates and some other groups are
helping to provide support for development

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.129
of advanced and small-module reactors. These
are safer, cleaner, generate less waste than

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.329
the generation of nuclear reactors that we
have right now.

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.370
What we call carbon capture and storage that we install
on fossil fuels power plants —what it can

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.960
do is capture the CO2 before it reaches the
air and you put it back to the ground. This

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.820
technology is not yet mature, it's very expensive. But this is definitely one of the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.280
tools and one of the technologies that we would need to develop.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.350
Of course, if we could just crack nuclear fusion, that
would be another story. And maybe we will.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.410
But once we’ve generated all the clean energy
we need, our next challenge is to transmit

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.630
it. This is challenge #2, and as it turns
out, it’s one of the biggest.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.420
There are some areas that are just more geographically
endowed with good renewable resources.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.431
Places like Washington state create more hydropower

00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.850
than they actually use so they have a high
voltage direct current line from Oregon down

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.150
to the suburbs of Los Angeles that delivers
that clean energy to Southern California.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.780
Unfortunately, large infrastructure projects
like this are a challenge to move forward,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.930
because let’s face it: no one wants a power
line running through their view––and building

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.600
them underground is a spendy endeavor.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.770
We need to bite the bullet. We're going to
probably need tens or hundreds of large power

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.220
lines constructed for this power grid of the
future.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.870
And putting up with some black lines of sky
seems like a fair price to keep the whole

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.870
sky blue.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.120
But, even the most efficient power lines still lose
some heat through transport. And that brings

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.069
us to the final piece of the puzzle: distribution.
Once the power gets where it’s going, it

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.770
has to get metered out to industrial, commercial,
and residential consumers. And we’re working

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.090
hard to give many of these ancient systems
a digital facelift. By learning about people’s

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.020
energy consumption habits, a so called ‘smart
grid’ can actually adjust prices to keep

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.080
up with supply and demand.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.340
Energy efficiency should be promoted first.
Any megawatt which is not consumed is a win-win here.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.440
There are millions of smart meters that have
been deployed throughout the US. They'd get

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.030
a signal, maybe perhaps through their thermostat
or their smart device that would tell them

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.430
that prices are high right now and that they
might want to hold off on doing the laundry

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.759
or running the dishwasher during the peak
time of day.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.639
But what if that kind of communication went
both ways? Generating and storing power locally,

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.949
like using rooftop solar panels or electric
car batteries, eliminates the need for transmission

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:52.479
entirely. And this is a concept known as distributed
generation, or a ‘microgrid.’

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.740
Instead of pulling a set amount of power from
a distant main source, microgrids allow custom

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.970
power delivery from a suite of sources as
close as your own neighborhood, and this turns

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.440
its participants into “prosumers,” because
they are both producing and consuming electricity.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.139
A device called a microgrid controller acts
like a dj, dropping live beats to match the

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.550
energy of the crowd… or the energy consumption
of a neighborhood. And this allows prosumers

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.742
to buy and sell cleaner electricity to and
from their own individual power systems, saving

00:07:24.742 --> 00:07:25.740
time, dollars, and carbon.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.000
A microgrid manager or controller knows what the weather forecast is for the day, it knows how much solar you're

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.060
going to be able to produce, how much storage
is available and knows when to have the natural

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.180
gas backup kick in. It knows what the power
prices might be and when it can be selling

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:52.180
power into the grid or buying power for very
cheaply from the main grid.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.229
It can be optimized based
on producing the fewest amount of greenhouse

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:57.229
gases.

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:02.169
Some countries are getting close to a zero-emissions
grid. Iceland has so much hydropower that

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:03.560
it sustains their entire nation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.860
Tackling climate change and reducing emission
is a global challenge. So even if California

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.060
and Germany and all Europe becomes zero carbon
it doesn't matter if the whole world won't

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.660
unify and act together to achieve this goal
because a molecule of carbon does not care

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.820
if it was emitted in China or in Israel, it
will impact the climate the same.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.860
And that’s not even counting the billion
people in developing nations who are expected

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.570
to become energy consumers in the next century.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.170
The truth is, energy is different everywhere. But what all
of us need is a healthy mix of renewable and

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:49.540
zero-emission sources; next generation storage
solutions, more transmission lines and less

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.050
need for transmission at all––namely,
a smart distribution system that shows us

00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.390
exactly when and how all this energy is moving
around, helping us save megawatts and dollars.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.320
Experts agree that we must make big strides
before 2030, and reach complete carbon neutrality

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.680
by 2050, to avoid the 1.5º threshold that
spells climate chaos.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.920
Currently we are headed to 3.2 degrees celsius warming. If we want 1.5 degrees celcius, we need to do five times more.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.520
We kids shouldn’t have to do this. I wish the adults would take their responsibility

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.320
but since no one’s doing anything, we have to.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.600
So… how close are we to a zero-emissions
grid?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.800
We are not so close. Actually, we are not
close at all, but we definitely have means

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.370
and tools to accelerate this transition.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:51.590
We're still emitting somewhere north of 50
gigatons of greenhouse gases every year. We

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.029
need to stabilize that.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:59.840
We can get there but we need to do it faster,
we must be more ambitious, put more effort

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.880
and think in the box, out of the box, underneath
the box and all the way that we can promote

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.940
this really, really important goal of low
carbon society.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:18.820
