here's an example you're working on a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
here's an example you're working on a
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.640
here's an example you're working on a
project it either has an Achilles heel

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
project it either has an Achilles heel
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.720
project it either has an Achilles heel
or it doesn't would we like to discover

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
or it doesn't would we like to discover
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.319
or it doesn't would we like to discover
that Achilles heel if it exists now or

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
that Achilles heel if it exists now or
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.040
that Achilles heel if it exists now or
later if you say later you've just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
later if you say later you've just
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990
later if you say later you've just
signed up to be intellectually dishonest

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
signed up to be intellectually dishonest
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060
signed up to be intellectually dishonest
you're not really gonna sign up for that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
you're not really gonna sign up for that
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.819
you're not really gonna sign up for that
as soon as you acknowledge that should

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
as soon as you acknowledge that should
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920
as soon as you acknowledge that should
it have an Achilles heel we'd like to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
it have an Achilles heel we'd like to
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.709
it have an Achilles heel we'd like to
know about that now rather than later

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719
know about that now rather than later
 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.600
know about that now rather than later
then it becomes the right way for us to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
then it becomes the right way for us to
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479
then it becomes the right way for us to
behave to check to see if it has an

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
behave to check to see if it has an
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.260
behave to check to see if it has an
Achilles heel now right now if it has

Achilles heel now right now if it has
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270
Achilles heel now right now if it has
the Achilles heel we'll end the project

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
the Achilles heel we'll end the project
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220
the Achilles heel we'll end the project
and we'll go find something better to do

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
and we'll go find something better to do
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319
and we'll go find something better to do
and if it doesn't have an Achilles heel

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
and if it doesn't have an Achilles heel
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020
and if it doesn't have an Achilles heel
we can move forward with that increased

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
we can move forward with that increased
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179
we can move forward with that increased

it done it will look like you've made

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
it done it will look like you've made
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810
it done it will look like you've made
progress but you haven't you've made

progress but you haven't you've made
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.410
progress but you haven't you've made
motion we can all sit there look at your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
motion we can all sit there look at your
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.289
motion we can all sit there look at your
cockpit and say the chances that we

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
cockpit and say the chances that we
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929
cockpit and say the chances that we
succeed are exactly the same as they

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
succeed are exactly the same as they
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.359
succeed are exactly the same as they
were before we've not actually made any

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
were before we've not actually made any
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.310

progress because all of the risk was on

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

the part you chose not to do what you

the part you chose not to do what you
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.219
the part you chose not to do what you
should have done first was the other one

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
should have done first was the other one

should have done first was the other one
so the way that our shorthand for this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
so the way that our shorthand for this
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.869
so the way that our shorthand for this
at X is that we we joke hashtag monkey

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
at X is that we we joke hashtag monkey
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.150
at X is that we we joke hashtag monkey
first similar to the time

if you're trying to get a monkey to
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
if you're trying to get a monkey to

stand on a pedestal 10 feet high and
recite Shakespeare monologues and you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
recite Shakespeare monologues and you
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.380
recite Shakespeare monologues and you
have a choice between training the

have a choice between training the
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.720
have a choice between training the
monkey first and building the pedestal

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
monkey first and building the pedestal
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.910

if you build the pedestal first when

if you build the pedestal first when
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160
if you build the pedestal first when
your boss walks by he's like hey nice

pedestal and then you feel good you just
did something useful you just got a

did something useful you just got a
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.840
did something useful you just got a
little bit of you know attaboy that's

wasted your company's money if you build
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.530
wasted your company's money if you build
the pedestal first because all of the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540
the pedestal first because all of the
 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.229
the pedestal first because all of the
hard part is getting the monkey to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239
hard part is getting the monkey to
 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.270
hard part is getting the monkey to
recite Shakespeare if you can get the

monkey to recite Shakespeare we can

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
monkey to recite Shakespeare we can
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.130
monkey to recite Shakespeare we can
always build the pedestal afterwards but

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
always build the pedestal afterwards but
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.440
always build the pedestal afterwards but
if you can't thank goodness we didn't
