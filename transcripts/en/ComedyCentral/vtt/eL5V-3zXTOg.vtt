<i> - She's looking at me, going,</i>

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.539
"Too long. Come now."

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.008
I'm like, "I'm trying!"

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.809
I mean, I can't piss

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.445
if my brother's on the same
floor as me at this age.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:16.182
She's yelling at me right here,
like, "You come now! Too long!"

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.318
I'm like, "I'm fucking trying!"

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.520

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.002
- My dad has night terrors.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.741
[laughter]

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.276
Real fucking deal, too.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.745
Night terrors is when you yell
in your sleep

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.115
for no goddamn reason.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.117
Aah.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.586
Aah-aah-aah.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.155
Aah-aah-aah-aah.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.592
Coming from my parents' bedroom.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.760
Aah-aah-aah-aah.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:10.964
My entire childhood.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.267
Aah. Aah!

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.770
[laughter]

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.973
Like a drunk ghost.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.542
Aah. Aah!

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.446
But my mother
only recently told us...

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.148
out of nowhere.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.816
Recently.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:32.152
At a family party, she's talking
to one of my fat aunts.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.953
[laughter]

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.156
All of my aunts
are built for winter.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.458
Let's...

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.093
Out of nowhere, she points.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.163
She goes, "Tom, your father
has night terrors."

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.631
I was like, "What?"

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.466
Then she tells me what they are.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.968
And I was like, "Do you realize
for, like, 30 fucking years

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.905
I thought Dad was just
a passionate lover?

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.608
Just coming from his heels
every night, like...

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.878
[moaning loudly]

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.186
Every time I'd hear his death
rattle from the bedroom,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.455
like, "I guess we're getting
another little brother."

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.325
And I was six. I was always
wondering about sex,

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.827
so I was like, "I'm going in!"

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.663
Charged down the hallway and...

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.031
Aah. Aah-aah.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.999
It's building up.
I jam the door open.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.734
My mother's stiff as a board,

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.137
already looking directly at me,
wide awake,

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.506
like she was fucking waiting
for my arrival.

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:29.209
My dad's going, "Aah-aah."

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.211
She very calmly says,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.879
"Go back to sleep, hon."

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:37.350
And I was like, "Well,
I'll never truly sleep again."

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:41.154
Do you realize for years, that's
how I thought sex worked?

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:44.524
The man just lays on his back
fist-fighting the night like...

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.161
[grunting]

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.165
And the woman guards the door
for intruders.

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:56.069
Like a fucking bridge troll,
going, "Go back to sleep."

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.138
[laughter]

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.375
It's how I first learned
about sex.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.710
My whole family's fucked up.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.345
Whole family is fucked up.

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:07.714
Crazy, real crazy,
like the real kind--

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.383
mental disorders,
drug addiction, alcoholism,

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.186
abuse, violence, partying, sex.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:17.390
And one night all of these
things happened at once.

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.092
I got two older brothers.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.361
My middle brother, Brian, got
kicked out of Texas A&amp;M

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.730
for hitting some dude over the
face with a pool stick

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.897
in a bar fight.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.899
My oldest brother's bipolar.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.169
That's like being in a bar fight
every night...

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.340
With yourself.

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:37.410
But I convinced myself
I'm different.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.578
"You're different."

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:39.946
Then I got older.

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.781
I'm like, "You got to be
just like them,"

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:44.751
'cause we all fell
out of my mom's saloon doors.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.552
I got to be next, right?

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:49.922
Just waiting for the old crazy
switch to click the fuck on.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.592
My brother used to throw
the wildest parties,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.160
my oldest brother,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.763
and coming out the morning after
one of his parties

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.598
was like coming out
from an underground bunker

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.466
after a tornado hits.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.935
There's just debris everywhere,
and you're whistling for a dog

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.438
that you know in your heart
is not there.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:08.941
[laughter]

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:11.611
And one night--
I was 15 years old.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.313
I was a sophomore
in high school,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.847
and Steve was 21.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.516
My parents decided
we were finally old enough

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.618
that they could go on vacation
for the very first time.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:20.320
We're mature enough.

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.422
My brother took this opportunity
to gain my parents' trust,

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.424
and he threw
his biggest fucking banger yet.

00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:26.793
Plastic on the carpets.
There was a keg in every room.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.796
There was a nitrous tank
in the kitchen.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.431
His friends were huffing nitrous

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.802
out of my mother's
blue nursing surgical gloves.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.970
But this party was big
for me, too.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.273
This meant Kristen could sleep
over for the first time.

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:42.975
15, that's a big fucking deal,
you know?

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:46.446
When you're 15,
any touch is a good touch.

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:50.016
If I grazed a pillowcase at 15,
I'm like, "I'm up now.

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:53.186
I am up."

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:55.154
I wasn't a virgin
in high school,

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.723
but I got laid in high school

00:05:56.822 --> 00:06:00.493
the way white people eat
Indian food...

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.161
once a year,

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.765
but you don't shut the fuck up
about it for six months.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.670
So Kristen and I finally get
to my parents' house,

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:12.205
and it's a mob--
there's kids on the lawn,

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.207
kids in the driveway,
kids on the back deck,

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:16.843
and I'm scared for the first
time to walk in my own place,

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.244
my own house.

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:20.012
I grab her.
I'm like, "Stay close.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.014
"These people are animals.

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.683
But I'm not like them."

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.418
I walk in the door.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:28.187
I'm greeted by the ugliest man
I've ever seen in my life.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.022
He's 20 years old,
already balding,

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.392
redheaded, with a lazy eye.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.193
Let that sink in.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.730
God was clearly hungover the day
he made this fucking monster.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.867
It's like he went to get to the
second eye and was like...

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.035
[imitates snoring]

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.570
Puts his hand on me.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.539
He's like, "What the fuck
are you doing here?"

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.040
I'm like, "I live here."

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.575
Nobody believes us
'cause we're so young.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.545
So now I'm pointing
at portraits on the wall,

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.447
like, "That's fucking me!

00:06:54.546 --> 00:06:56.716
"Here we are at Disneyland
with my parents,

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:59.519
who I'll call if you keep
fucking with me!"

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:02.889
I finally find my brother in
the kitchen bent over the stove

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.725
with all four burners
on full blast.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.093
He picks his head up.

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.961
He's got a cigarette
in his mouth

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.230
that's somehow lit
in the middle...

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.566
and burning both directions

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.370
like a Wile E. Coyote TNT wick.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:20.239
His eyebrows and his goatee
completely singed.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:23.910
So now the kitchen smells like
nitrous and fucking burnt hair.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.912
And his first comment,
he goes...

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:28.080
[inhales deeply]
"Fuck are you doing here?"

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:31.083
I'm like, "I fucking live here!"

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.386
I grab her by the arm.
I'm like, "Let's go upstairs."

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.488
And I just want to cozy
into my dry-humping station.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:37.757 line:0%
And then minutes in,
all's you hear is...

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.759 line:0%
[knocking]
"Fuck!

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.327
Go away!"

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:44.597
And they just kept banging
and banging and banging,

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:45.998
because everybody else

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.934
is looking
for their own sex station.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.936
So I spent the rest of the night
cuddling her,

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.737
telling her I'm different

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:56.242
and protecting the door from
intruders like my mother did.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.411
And that's where the story
should've ended.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.614
But like I said,
my brothers are animals.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.249
So, a couple hours later,

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.284
I get woken up by my brother's
best friend, Doss,

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.953
who's also my landscaping boss.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.488
White trash.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.423
[laughter]

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:12.425
Doss shakes me.
He's like, "Get up."

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:14.260
Looks at her,
is like, "It's okay.

00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:16.128
"We're just gonna take him
downstairs real quick.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.163
We'll be right back."

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:18.998
I know this is not true.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:21.200
Walk down the steps,
go right out the front door.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.135
The landscaping truck is already
running in the driveway.

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.537
The cab is packed.

00:08:24.636 --> 00:08:26.372
And I'm like,
"I got nowhere to go."

00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:28.274
He's like, "Lay in the back,
keep your head down.

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:30.142
If you pick it up, we'll get
pulled over by the cops."

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.611
Dude from the cab's like,

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.479
"Get in, pussy.
We're getting Asian."

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.515
In my head, I'm like,
"Why don't we get it delivered?"

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.383
But I do that thing--
when you're 15,

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:39.652
you just curse unnecessarily,
and you just play along.

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.354
I'm like, "Well, fuck you.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.523
You're the one getting leveled,
you piece of shit."

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.024
And I just jump in.

00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:47.059
I'm in between two weed whackers
and a gas can.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.794
He pulls out. He's going quickly
60 miles an hour

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.963
down side streets, and I start
mapping out my route,

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.165
'cause that's what they tell you
to do when you get kidnapped.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.034
You got to map out
your fucking route.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.537
So I'm like, "Okay, we're taking
a left on Marshall Road.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.339
"That's a right on State.

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:02.542
"Why are we getting
on the highway?

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.010
Why are we getting on 95?"

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.378
30 minutes of hell later,

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.346
we pull into this small,
little back alley

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.015
in Center City Philadelphia.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.183
I get out.
I got leaves in my hair.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.185
There's just
a little flickering light,

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.388
a box window, and a camera
pointing straight down.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.422
This is 1996.

00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:18.658
Banks didn't have cameras
outside.

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:20.826
So I'm like, "Oh, this is
where bad shit happens."

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.397
So I'm like, "Hey, guys, I
thought we were getting Asian."

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.866
One guy's like, "We are."
And they all start laughing.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:28.434
[imitates laughter]

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:30.202
And so I started laughing, too.
I was like...

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.872
[imitates laughter]
Still not getting it.

00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:34.373
And like synchronized drunks,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.208
six heads just point
right at the camera,

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.877
and all's you hear is...
[imitates buzzer]

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:39.345
Door opens.

00:09:39.444 --> 00:09:41.213
Three feet, another door,
another camera.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.848
And I'm like, "How fucking hard

00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:45.685
is it to get General Tso's
in this goddamn city?"

00:09:45.784 --> 00:09:48.254
This time all's you hear is,
"You cop?"

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.590
And I'm like,
"No, I'm a sophomore."

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.224
[laughter]

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.393
One dude shakes his head.
All's you hear is...

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.628
[imitates buzzer]
Door opens.

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:57.430
This time it's staircase.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:59.865
At the top of the staircase
is this jacked Asian dude--

00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:01.300
also before steroids

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.903
This man earned
this fucking muscle...

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:05.237
in a Cambodian prison

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.906
I don't know where he found it.

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:09.742
And he had a gun obnoxiously
hanging out his belt,

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:11.277
like absurdly.

00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:13.245
You know when you see
a terrible porn movie

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.715
and the guys delivering a pizza
with his dick out?

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:18.884
And he's like, "Anybody order
extra pepperoni?"

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:21.787
We knew what was going on,
but we walk up the steps.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:24.924
I look around. There's about 30
to 50 Asian women in lingerie,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.759
some holding trays of beer,

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:29.095
some with their tits out like
they're checking the weather.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.063
And I'm like, "Oh, my God,
this is the Washy Wash."

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.967
The Washy Wash is an infamous
whorehouse in Philadelphia.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.936
It's the Fenway Park of pussy.

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:38.404
But you have to be invited here.

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:40.106
You have to be invited
by the animals.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.440
The animals are letting me
in their cage.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.442
I'm being made into an animal.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:46.579
And it hits me--I'm gonna have
to have sex with a professional,

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:49.915
and I don't even masturbate
like an amateur.

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:52.118
My head's like, "Dude,
you don't have to do this."

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:53.619
My legs are like,

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.588
"The stairs are right there.
Just walk down."

00:10:55.687 --> 00:10:59.959
And my penis is like, "Why don't
we just see what happens first?"

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.794
One dude goes,
"I want that one."

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.131
He points at the only clothed
old woman in the whole place.

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.800
[laughter]

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:09.468
That's the mama-san.

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:11.470
That's like having
your selection

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.773
from any multicolored
Lamborghini and be like,

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:17.743
"Yeah, you guys got
a Ford Taurus with no tires?"

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.816
I mean old. She looked
like a stack of mushrooms.

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:25.618
Like...

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:28.320
Just behind her,
ten beautiful women line up.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:30.156
This woman gets out of line,
grabs my hand.

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.824
Probably 'cause I was 15,
she was like,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.192
"This kid's gonna come first.

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.995
We'll end both
of our nightmares."

00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:37.363
Starts walking me
down the hallway,

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:39.365
and I'm looking back
like a toddler

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:41.233
on his first day of preschool,
like, "I don't want to go!"

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.502
'Cause I'm 15
and shitting myself.

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:45.504
And as I'm walking
down the hallway this way,

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:48.841
coming this way
are grown-ass men twice my age,

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.409
naked in towels.

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.012
But they're not towels.
They're like dish towels.

00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:54.847
You know what I mean?
Like bar napkins.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:58.017
So every, like, third or fourth
step, you just see a hammer,

00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.518
just a...

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.420
just a hammer would fly out.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.557
Imagine Snuffleupagus trying
to close a shower curtain.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.526
[laughter]

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:09.528
So then she throws me
into the room.

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:11.530
She gets right to business,
right on top.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:14.667
She puts my hands directly on
her plastic Barbie-doll breasts.

00:12:14.766 --> 00:12:17.169
And she jumps into cheat code
one, which is moaning,

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.872
'cause she knows that shit will
work, and it would normally,

00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.373
but her moan was ridiculous.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.744
Her moan just went, "Ooh.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.713
"Ooh, ooh.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.248
Ooh."

00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:31.884
It sounded like
the last puff of an air horn

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.286
in, like, a track meet, like...

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.222
[imitates horn blowing weakly]

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.891
Ken, this one's dead.
We need another one.

00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:41.393
[imitates horn blowing weakly]

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.762
She knows it's not working.

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:44.697
She flips me over.
Now I'm on top.

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:47.433
She jumps into cheat code two--
complimentary mode.

00:12:47.532 --> 00:12:50.035
She's like, "Why you so big?

00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:51.237
You play football?"

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.539
I'm like, "I'm 5'6"!

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:56.408
"I'm, like, 80 fucking pounds.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.078
"I smell like grass.
I know you smell the grass.

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:00.913
It's in my teeth."

00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:02.615
I know what she's doing.

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.284
But I looked her directly
in the eyes, and I was like...

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.253
[softly]
"Yeah, I'm a quarterback."

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:10.523
[laughter]

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.594
And then she starts looking
in the corner,

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.429
and every time she looks in
the corner, I look in the corner

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.265
'cause I don't know
what fucking lurks

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.467
in the corners of this place.

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:23.903
But she's looking at the clock.
She's trying to end this.

00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:26.071
So, every time she looks at
the clock, I look at the clock.

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.073
But when I look at the clock,
I got to reboot the system.

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:31.076
I found my cheat code.
It's a "do not come" cheat code.

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:33.746
So I'm just going up, down,
left, right, look at the clock,

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:35.447
up, down, left, right,
look at the clock.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.850
I'm fucking crushing it!

00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:40.119 line:0%
All of a sudden, down
the hallway, all you hear is...

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:41.754 line:0%
[knocking]
"Fucking not again."

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:44.824
This time all's you hear is,
"Get out! Get out!"

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.458
The guy's like, "I paid!"

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.260
"Get out!" "I paid!"

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.963
Turns out, the guy who was
trying to pick out the mama-san

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:52.364
used a fake credit card,

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:54.133
and now they're rounding us
all up,

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:55.668
door by door, closer and closer.

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:57.336
[knocking]

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:59.638
She's looking at me, going,
"Too long. Come now."

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.141
I'm like, "I'm trying!
I'm trying!"

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:03.976
She's like,
"Too long. Come now."

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:05.277
I'm like, "I'm trying!"

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:06.946
I mean, I can't piss

00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:09.648
if my brother's on the same
floor as me at this age.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:13.385
She's yelling at me right here,
like, "You come now! Too long!"

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.688
I'm like, "I'm fucking trying!"

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:18.157
[laughter]

00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:20.492
Just shit myself!

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:23.162
Door after door--
"Get out! Get out!"

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:24.864
"Come now!" "Get out!"

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.532
"Come now!"

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:29.335
[grunting oddly] I'm just
on the fucking homestretch.

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:30.903
Gets to my door.
[knocking]

00:14:31.002 --> 00:14:33.339
[imitates whoosh]
Door flips open. She dismounts.

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.774
Look, I've seen the Olympics.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.578
I've never seen a move
like this before.

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:41.680
She rolled off of me
completely nude,

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:45.351
came back up fully clothed,
just...

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.052
And then disappears
into the little light

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:52.324
in between the steroid guy
and his gun in the doorway.

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:53.726
And I can't hear shit.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.527
You know when you watch,
like, a war movie

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.062
and there's a beach blast?

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.164
It's like...
[imitates explosion, echoing]

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:01.367
And the guy's looking around
for his arm, like...

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.569
[imitates explosion echoing]

00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:05.738
Well, that's how I was,
looking for my pants.

00:15:05.837 --> 00:15:09.541
Like...
[imitates explosion echoing]

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:12.611
I sit down. My heart's beating
out of my chest.

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.916
I could see the dude
just waiting for me.

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.350
And he picks his gun up,

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.219
and he's like,
"You have 15 minutes."

00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:22.721
He shuts the door,
and I'm scared.

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.556
My hearing comes back.
Down the hall, I hear...

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:27.226
[imitates woman shouting
in foreign language]

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:28.794
Fucking mayhem.

00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:30.930
I don't even know how to get
out of this place.

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.564
I got no exit.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.566
I'm frustrated, 'cause
I've been rubbing genitals

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:37.569
with strange women
for eight straight hours.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.571
And I have anxiety
through the roof.

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.474
But I know how to get rid
of anxiety at that age.

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.877
So I look at myself
in the mirror,

00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:46.946
and for the first time
that night,

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.414
I know exactly what to do.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.749
I turn away
from my own reflection,

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:53.852
and I feverishly masturbate.

00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:00.960
Like the father of ten
at a water park bathroom.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:04.029
[laughter]

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.536
Sorry.

00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:13.272
And then shit changed.

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.441
I was different.
I was lighter.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.076
I was different.
I was a different person--

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.912
lighter on the feet,
lighter in the balls.

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:21.613
I'm walking
back down the hallway,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.315
winking at guys
three times my age, like,

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:26.085
"Have fun in there, kiddo."

00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:29.288
I get outside. All my brother's
friends are waiting for me.

00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:30.823
You know that scene
in "Goodfellas"

00:16:30.922 --> 00:16:32.791
when Henry Hill
doesn't rat on his friends

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:34.460
out in front of the courthouse?

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:38.430
And they're like, "You did it!"

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.032
They offered me a seat
in the cab,

00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:42.134
and I was like, "No, no, no.
I'll take the back."

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.635
I didn't give a shit.

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.471
I jumped in the back
of that pickup truck

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:47.639
like it was a
fucking hot tub in Hawaii.

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.842
Smiling ear to ear,
looking at the moon, like...

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.810
[howling wildly]

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:55.147
So, anytime I hear someone say,
"Yeah, my family's crazy,"

00:16:55.213 --> 00:16:57.483
I'm like, "Oh, yeah?

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:58.884
"So your first time available

00:16:58.983 --> 00:17:01.153
"to sleep with a woman
in high school

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:03.455
"were you kidnapped...

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:07.159
"thrown in the back of a pickup
truck, taken to a whorehouse...

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:10.129
"manhandled by an Asian woman

00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:12.297
"who screamed
in your face to come...

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:16.702
"while her pimp just banged on
the door with the butt of a gun

00:17:16.801 --> 00:17:18.504
"'cause your brother's
best friend

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.673
"created credit card fraud...

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.509
"so then you were forced
to jerk off

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:26.345
"to your own dimly lit
reflection...

00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:28.814
"like a vulture,

00:17:28.913 --> 00:17:32.618
and now you forever associate
sex with fear and loneliness?"

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:36.188
"Or do they just drink
wine coolers

00:17:36.254 --> 00:17:38.357
and play Cards of Humanity?"

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:40.192
[laughter]

00:17:40.258 --> 00:17:41.994
Thank you, guys.
Great crowd.

00:17:42.093 --> 00:17:45.197
<i> [cheers and applause]
 - Tommy Pope, everybody.</i>
