WOJTEK KALICINSKI: Hi, my
name is Wojtek Kalicinski,

00:00:02.346 --> 00:00:04.200
and this is Android
Tool Time, with What's

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.480
New in Android Studio 2.3.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
After the feature-packed
release that was 2.2,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.390
we are starting the new year
with Android Studio 2.3, which

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.750
offers many refinements and
fixes to existing components,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.430
as well as some
exciting new features.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.980
The first thing
I'd like to mention

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.890
is the overhaul of
the Instant Run UI.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.690
We followed advice
from developers,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.280
and now provide two buttons--

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320
Run, which you will
use to deploy and start

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.650
your app, and Apply Changes,
for any subsequent code

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.510
and resource modifications.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.900
This uses Instant Run to quickly
update the running app using

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.040
cold, warm, or hot swap, and now
requires a device or emulator

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.450
running Lollipop and above.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.080
In case you happen to see
any unexpected problems,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.760
you can always use
the Run button again

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.040
to force a full app restart.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.280
Speaking about speeding
up build times,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.900
in Android Gradle
plug-in 2.3, we've

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.570
now enabled the build
cache by default.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.450
The build cache is a shared
directory on your machine

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.670
where libraries are
extracted and compiled

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
to be used across all projects,
making both incremental

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.980
and full builds faster.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.530
We've also made some general
performance improvements

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830
in product sync and
the Gradle integration

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.700
in this version
of Android Studio,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.250
and moved to Gradle version 3.3.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.480
The ID itself brings the new
features of the IntelliJ 2016.2

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.790
release, such as the
new Inspections Tool

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.930
window, overhauled
notifications, breadcrumbs

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.460
in the Java editor, and more.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.310
The Layout Editor
received some updates too.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.990
In the Palette
window, we now show

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.772
widget previews and support
sorting and filtering by name.

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:43.170
The property inspector,
here on the right,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.090
now lets you add the
most-used properties

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.300
to your favorites for quick
access on the Overview page.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.420
And finally, the visual
editor has a new set

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.110
of controls and refined visuals
for constraint layout editing,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.970
including new
icons, an easier way

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.300
of adding baseline handles, and
support for two big features

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.620
of the constraint layout--

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.810
chains and ratios.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.700
By the way, constraint
layout is now

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.190
the default when creating new
projects with Android Studio

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.199
templates.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.080
Moving on, the vector
drawable import dialog

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.720
received a small but
highly requested upgrade.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.850
You can now search the
material icons catalog

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.980
by name, which makes
it a lot easier

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.020
to locate the one you need.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.760
For raster images, we've
added WebP support in the ID.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.950
WebP is an image compression
format developed at Google

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.370
that can replace both JPEG and
PNG images with smaller file

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.100
sizes and similar quality.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
You can now convert images
to WebP straight from the IDE

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.480
by right-clicking
on a file or folder

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.380
and selecting Convert to WebP.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.200
Since WebP support varies
across Android versions,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.610
we've also added
Lint checks that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.410
look at the content
of your images

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.470
and will warn you if they're
not compatible with the min SDK

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.730
version in your project.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.366
Next up, we have the
app links assistant.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:58.740
It guides you
through the process

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.470
of adding app links support
to your app, which includes

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.840
creating intent
filters for URLs,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.960
modifying activity code
to handle those intents,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.460
and generating a digital asset
links file for your website.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.000
For fans of Lint, we have some
new and updated Lint checks.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.770
We now support
additional annotations

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.620
such as restrict to and
visible for testing,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.840
and the Lint report
HTML file now

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.740
has a material design look
with syntax highlighting.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.010
The biggest addition, however,
is Lint baseline support,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.220
which lets you save the current
set of known Lint errors

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.920
and ignore them
for future builds.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.990
This gives you a way of
progressively dealing

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.150
with technical debt
in your project

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.250
while still having the
benefit of being informed

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.140
about any new
warnings and errors

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.270
that you might introduce.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.840
In the SDK Tools, we've recently
added a command line interface

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.350
for the SDK manager
called SDK Manager.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.630
You can use it to automate
installing or updating

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.920
SDK components, for example, in
scripts or on your CI server.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.320
And lastly, the
Espresso Test Recorder

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.420
from previous Android
Studio versions

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.360
gained a few improvements
and is now considered stable.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.200
So you can use it for
adding Espresso UI

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.320
tests to your applications.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.660
