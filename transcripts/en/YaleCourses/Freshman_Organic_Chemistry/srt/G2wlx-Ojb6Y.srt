1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:01,891
Okay.

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:06,750
So last time we saw the jeopardy approach
to solving the shredding or equation,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,350
which is to take the answer and
find out what the problem was.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,250
And we saw that for a constant potential.
You've got a sine wave,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,110
you could choose any length of sine wave
you wanted, any wave period you wanted.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,920
It just turned out to be different
energies and it had a relationship between

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:27,060
the wavelength and the energy,
the kinetic energy or the total energy.

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,040
In that case,
uh,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,990
and we saw an exponential is, um, uh,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,810
corresponds to negative kinetic energy,

11
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,630
which not very many
people in the class liked.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,300
And not very many people ever like it,

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,370
but suck it up because that's the way
kinetic energy is for small particles.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,540
If you don't like to call
it kinetic energy because
you're so wedded to the fact

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,290
that that for big things,
it's one half MV squared,

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,460
then just consider it the difference
between total energy and potential energy.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,010
Okay. But anyhow, it's
kinetic energy. Okay.

18
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,860
So we've looked at the jeopardy approach
to start with the answer and get the

19
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,120
question,
but we'd lot,

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,400
we'd rather do it the other direction
to start with the problem and find out

21
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,750
what the answer is. And you can
do that by guessing the energy.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,140
If you have a sufficiently simple system
that is one particle in one dimension,

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,890
and this is a great way to get the
idea of what's special about quantum

24
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,880
mechanics, make it as simple as possible.
And then we'll go to realistic systems.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,930
Okay, so we can rearrange
the Schrodinger equation.

26
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,520
Remember this is the Schrodinger equation.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
Hci Equals East side divide through by
Sy and split the HCI oversight part into

28
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,220
the potential energy part V,
which is a nothing,

29
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:54,120
it's given to you and the
and the kinetic energy part,

30
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:59,121
which is a negative constant that involves
the inverse mass times the curvature

31
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,640
of Psi over Psi.

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,000
So it has to do with the shape of sy.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,880
And remember if you
multiply side by a constant,

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,460
you multiply the curvature
by the same constant.

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,230
So the kinetic energy stays the same.
So it's only what we say the shape,

36
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:21,180
not really the amplitude because that
scales with the, with the curvature.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,470
Okay,

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,060
but now we can rearrange
this this way so we can,

39
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
we have a formula here for the
curvature of Psi right now,

40
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:35,880
if you have a formula for the curvature,

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,680
if you know how a curve is going to
change how a line is going to change its

42
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,830
curvature,
then you have a recipe for drawing it.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,660
If you know how to start,

44
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,790
if you start with a certain
height and a certain slope,

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,300
suppose you know that and you
know the curvature at that point,

46
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,250
then you know if you take a
little step in that direction,

47
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,450
what the next slope is going to be.
Okay?

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,710
Because that's how curved it is and if
you recalculate and know the curvature at

49
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
that point,

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,390
then you know what the curvature at the
next point is going to be in the next

51
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,320
and the next and the next.

52
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:21,640
Then you can use this to just
draw a curve that's bound to,

53
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,720
to satisfy the Schrodinger equation
because you're using the Schrodinger

54
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:30,190
equation to generate it.
Does everybody see this?

55
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,150
This is really important. You want me
to say it again? Or you've got it now,

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,690
if you have a formula for the curvature,

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,420
that's how fast the slope is changing.

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,520
And if you know the initial height
and the initial slope, right,

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,260
then if you know the
direction of the slope,

60
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,300
you know where the next
point's going to be. Okay?

61
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:53,140
So you go to that just to make a tiny.
Now this gets a problem in a computer.

62
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,460
If the thing is really going like
this and you take a finite step,

63
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,210
the slope will have changed during your
step and you won't get it just right.

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,130
So you'll have to take
smaller and smaller steps.

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,860
So that doesn't change during the step.
Genuine.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,820
Can't hear it very well. Yeah. Curvatures,

67
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:20,170
the second driven. Yeah.
Uh, we'll get to that.

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,010
But if you had the initial
slope and the initial height,

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,610
then you use the formula for the
curvature to trace out the curve.

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,510
Everybody got that now.
Okay, so that's great. And,

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,790
and it would be tedious
to do this by hand,

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,050
but that's what this little program,
urban meets goldilocks does,

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
is start the curve and draw
it out according to what
if you know everything else

74
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,060
in the equation. Okay? So,

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,360
and remember it curves away from zero
when the potential energy is greater than

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
the total energy and it curves towards
zero when the potential energy is less

77
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,270
than the total energy,
right?

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
So the potential energy being greater
than the total energy is a bad situation

79
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,050
intuitively.
Right?

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,890
It means the kinetic energy is negative
and it curves away from the baseline.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,450
And what's bad about that or dangerous
about that? Yeah. Okay. Kevin?

82
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,940
Pardon me?
Yeah,

83
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:26,620
it'll keep going until it gets to
infinity if it's curving away. Okay.

84
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,390
So that, and that's not allowed.
It has to not go to infinity. Okay?

85
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:35,080
So now do we know everything
else? Well, we know am the mass.

86
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,920
We know the constant c
and the V is given to us.

87
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,800
The potential energy is
changes with position, right?

88
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,910
But we know how it changes with position.
It's cool ohms law typically,

89
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,290
or we can do some other law if we want to.
So this recipe,

90
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,640
then you know everything,

91
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,390
everything on the right except the
total energy sigh you don't care about,

92
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,090
because you can scale it, right? You can
make it anything you want. Call it one.

93
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,130
Okay, then we can double it. Or if we
want to or whatever. So side, we know em,

94
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,730
we know. See We know v we
know we're going to guess e.

95
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,990
So that means if we know the initial
slope and for the problems we work on,

96
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,740
the initial slope will be
zero. And you'll see why. Okay?

97
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,530
Then we can use this formula
to trace out the curve.

98
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,890
And that's what the computer does for you.

99
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,450
So people were worried last night
about math. Don't worry about math,

100
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,310
you don't let the computer calculate
how these slopes change and so on.

101
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,590
Right? All you have to do is
think about the curvature. Okay?

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,980
So you just have to think about the graph.
Okay?

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,510
So we're going to talk now about nodes
and quantification in one dimension.

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,840
Using this program,
[inaudible] meets Goldie locks.

105
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,740
And there's a problem set for Monday
as you know that, where are you, uh,

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,500
where you do this?
And the answers are on the Wiki,

107
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:05,390
but don't look at them before you've given
it a good try. Okay, so let's, let's,

108
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,890
there, there are simpler things to start
with like a constant potential energy or

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,960
running into a wall or into
a pillow, more like, but the,

110
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,130
but the,
uh,

111
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,740
the harmonic oscillator or Hooke's
law is a very popular one to do.

112
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,660
So we're going to do that.
Okay.

113
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,200
So here we're looking at the potential
energy as a function of distance and also

114
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:27,680
on the side.

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,460
So you'll see the distance goes from
zero to two and a half fox drums and the

116
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:36,170
potential energy and the potential
energy goes from zero to a hundred

117
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,730
kilocalories per mole. You can change
that if you want to on the computer. Okay?

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,630
And the horizontal black line
is a completely different plot.

119
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,110
It's a plot of PSI. That's what, that's
the plot on top of this, when the,

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,210
where we're going to trace
out the wave function. Okay?

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,410
And that's zero of the wave function.
Here's zero of energy,

122
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,743
okay.

123
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,340
And the reason we put them on top of one
another is so that it's easy to see the

124
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,420
influence of one on the other
of the wave function on the,

125
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,940
on the potential energy and vice versa.

126
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,290
And because there are functions of the
same thing, what cy? A function of,

127
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,631
what's that?

128
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:22,631
A function of its function of the
position position of what the one particle

129
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,960
we're talking about.
Okay.

130
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:30,440
And the potential energy is also
a function of the position. Okay?

131
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,380
So the way we're going to do
this then is to guess an energy.

132
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,080
Let the computer trace out this
curve and see whether it's okay.

133
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,240
What will tell us whether it's okay,

134
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,050
how will we know if it's okay?
It's got to be continuous,

135
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,840
that we're not going to have a problem
with that because the computer's tracing

136
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:54,531
it out this way.

137
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:59,340
It's not going to be just continuous w
but the main thing is that it doesn't

138
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:03,420
diverge and it doesn't go to infinity.
Okay.

139
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,030
So let's just guess 21 kilocalories
per wall. Why not? Okay.

140
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,680
Now you can already tell
me something about what the
curve is going to look like.

141
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,670
Notice that at those two distances,

142
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,710
between these two distances,

143
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,400
the total energy is higher
than the potential energy.

144
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,120
What's the curve going to
look like in that region?

145
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,280
If the kinetic kinetic energy
is going to be positive, right?

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,780
What will the curve look like?

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,890
Pat?
Can't hear very well.

148
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,720
It's going to spike up in between
those two lives. It made me go up.

149
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:49,730
It may go down. Yeah. Pardon me. Uh,

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,140
it's not,
would it be a sign curve?

151
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,250
Does anybody think that wouldn't be a
curve by not Russell when the potential

152
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,140
is, that's when the potential is
constant. It's not constant through here.

153
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,610
Right?

154
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,140
So it won't be an exact sine
curve if this isn't very high.

155
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,940
It might be close to a sine curve cause
it's sort of constant dish, right?

156
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:16,560
If this is a very small distance,

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,640
but what characteristic
must have said Sydney,

158
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,160
it'll curve towards zero. So it might,
it'll, it'll look something like this.

159
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,430
Always. It's curving and going
up and down, maybe going high,

160
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,630
but it's always curving.
To go back toward the baseline,

161
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,700
it's never going to go to infinity.
Okay.

162
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,260
Now there is a problem because
if you go the other way,

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,550
the rest of the graph,

164
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,380
the kinetic energy is negative because
the potential is higher than the total.

165
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,180
So in that region,

166
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:56,181
there's great danger that the line is
going to go to infinity because it's going

167
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:00,450
to be curving away from the baseline.
Okay.

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,620
Now,
how could you possibly avoid that?

169
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,920
How could you have it such that the
curvature divided by the value of the way

170
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:15,181
you function gets very big and the
curvature away from the baseline,

171
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,240
but still it doesn't go to infinity.

172
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,420
How can the kinetic energy
be big and negative?

173
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,280
The curvature divided by
the value is enormous,

174
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,170
but it doesn't go to infinity.
How can that be?

175
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,380
Pardon me?
Bound.

176
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,560
No, it's not a question about, I mean,

177
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,260
this thing is that the particle,

178
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,860
if it has this total energy is bounded,
right?

179
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:54,370
It can't go all the way to the left to
the right. That's true enough. Okay.

180
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,510
But that's not the,

181
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,520
that's not the secret of how the wave
function avoids going to infinity.

182
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,660
Yeah.
Pardon me.

183
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,540
Uh,

184
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,250
we can't make what a constant.

185
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,010
Okay,
Russell,

186
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,830
but, but you say very
little curvature, but,

187
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,110
but the kinetic energy is enormous.

188
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,010
The curvature divided by the value of
the wave function has to be enormous,

189
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,473
Mike.

190
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,020
Ah, if the value of the wave
function is almost zero,

191
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,790
then you can have an
enormous burden. Uh, yeah.

192
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,970
Then you're going to have a tiny
numerator, hardly any curvature at all.

193
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,440
And still the quotient can be big,
right?

194
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,540
The kinetic energy can be
enormous and negative, right?

195
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,880
If the denominator is near zero.

196
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,870
So that means that if
you're in those red regions,

197
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,830
you know what the wave function has to
look like. What does it have to look like?

198
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,440
It has to get down near zero and stay
there so that it doesn't have the

199
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:19,140
curvature that will enough
curvature to pull it away.

200
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,420
So it's got to look like that on
the left. Right? Cause out here,

201
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,400
you know that parabolas going way up.

202
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:29,250
It's an enormous curvature
divided by wave function.

203
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,350
But if the wave function
is essentially zero,

204
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,960
still the curvature can
be essentially zero. Okay.

205
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,310
And the same on the right. So we know
that the curve is going to look like this,

206
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,680
something like that.
Okay.

207
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,680
And all we have to do is connect
the pieces. Okay? So let's try it.

208
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,930
We guessed 21 kilocalories per mole.

209
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,820
This we did in our head
just by thinking about it.

210
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,050
But let's let the program
do it and start at the left.

211
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,230
And now do you see why it has to
start with with a zero slope why?

212
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,310
It has to start with zero slope.

213
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,920
Because if it's out in this region
and does it has a finite slope or a,

214
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,670
an appreciable slope and it's
curving away, you're in trouble.

215
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,380
Okay? Cause it's going to go to
infinity. Okay, so here, here's,

216
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,170
so we're going to use Arabic
meets Goldilocks, this program,

217
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,520
and we're going to start it here.

218
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:27,450
It goes the curve and there there's
the part where the kinetic energy is

219
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,560
negative,
right?

220
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:32,670
It hasn't gone to infinity because it
started low enough and with low enough

221
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,610
slope out of the left.
Okay?

222
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,250
Now what's going to happen
when it crosses that line?

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,833
Hi.

224
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,560
Now the curvature is going to be toward
the baseline as we guessed it would be.

225
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,580
So I like that.

226
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:51,990
And now what's

227
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,823
going to happen

228
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,150
now it's going to start curving
away from the base line again.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,833
Aw,

230
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,050
you don't win them. All right. Okay.

231
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
Now did we have too much energy
or too little energy here?

232
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,940
Notice that. What? What did
we want it to do on the right?

233
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,210
On the left is where we started.
That looks great,

234
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,190
but on the right we're having trouble.

235
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,240
What do you need to do in the middle
in order for it to behave? Okay?

236
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,074
On the right,

237
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,610
it has to not curve so
much toward the baseline.

238
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,410
Does everybody see what I'm saying?

239
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,180
If it curved less than it could join
that other line we had originally.

240
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,670
Okay, so we'll give it a little less
energy. Let's try 20 that's too hot.

241
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,640
Okay. Too much energy. Okay, so well
guess 20 kilocalories from all. Okay,

242
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:53,870
here we go. Start out almost exactly
the same. It's nearly the same energy,

243
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,110
so it doesn't surprise you that it looks
about the same and then it's going to

244
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:01,460
curve in here. The way we expected, but
a little bit less than it did before.

245
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,870
All right,
so now we're on the way to success.

246
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,310
Yeah.

247
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,330
So what was that one

248
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,310
to coal and what do you need?

249
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,060
Someplace in between these.
There's going to be one.

250
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:27,120
That's right.
Okay,

251
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,120
so it's between 20 and 21 now.

252
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:33,900
Should we guess halfway between 20 and
21 is that the reasonable thing to do?

253
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,730
Which original guests was better?

254
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,900
Which guests was better
originally and why?

255
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,210
The red one or the blue one.
Which guests was better?

256
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,280
Why was the red one
better close to baseline?

257
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,520
It lasted longer before it
went to infinity, so it's,
it'll be closer to the red,

258
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,000
the blue,
and if you fiddle around,

259
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,790
and that's what I want you to do because
this is the way I think it gets into

260
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,810
your head, is by guessing
numbers and saying, where
should I make the next guests?

261
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,870
And so on. After you've done
this a certain number of times,

262
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,360
but enough times that it really gets into
your bones and your brain right after

263
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,230
you've done it enough times,

264
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:26,790
then you can use the function that says
solve and it will do that guessing game

265
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,840
for you. But do it yourself
at the beginning. Okay.

266
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,720
And it turns out that after you've done
that, you get 20.74 Dadadadadada. Dot.

267
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,120
I like a lot of decimal points,
decimal positions,

268
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,920
and you get that one just right.
Okay.

269
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,560
So that's the only math you need to do.

270
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,600
Is it too hot or too or just right.
Okay.

271
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,140
And do you have to know why it has to
be that way because of this curvature

272
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,950
thing? Okay, so there we
are. There we have it.

273
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,310
20.74 kilocalories per mole
is a satisfactory energy
and it comes with this wave

274
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,000
function, whatever. That's good for. Okay.

275
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,560
But the energy is what we were looking at.

276
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,800
What energies are allowed
for this system now,

277
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,460
could there be a lower energy
allowed for this system?

278
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,490
Could you imagine a less
curved wave function that
would also have this property

279
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,740
of not going to infinity?

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
Can somebody guess what
it would look like, nick?

281
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,940
Ah,

282
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,940
it could just go up and then come back
to the baseline has to come back to the

283
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,820
baseline but it could just go up rather
than curbing so much in the middle.

284
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,310
Okay, so we guess the lower one,
could there be a lower energy sy? Yes,

285
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:51,970
indeed. There could be one at
4.15 it's actually one four,

286
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,350
nine something or other.
Right.

287
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,370
Do a lot of decimal points and there
it is exactly what nick expected.

288
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,250
Okay, so you got this. Could
there be a still lower one

289
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,593
rolling?

290
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,990
Not In between.
Could there we one lower than the blue.

291
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,390
Can you imagine a way to get
it even lower than the blue?

292
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,990
Even lower curvature than the blue?
Yeah.

293
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Angela [inaudible] like the one can't
hear very well if the blue one is going up

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,630
and we weren't going down. Oh, there
could be an upside down blew one.

295
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,960
Absolutely true.
There could be an upside down blue one,

296
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,200
but it's the same thing because it's
the blue one multiplied by minus one.

297
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,580
Remember you can multiply it by any number
and it's still the same thing. Right,

298
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:49,390
so that's exactly the same energy.
It's not a different wave function.

299
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,020
It's just multiplied by a constant,

300
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,840
but you're right that
that also does the trick,

301
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,400
but it turns out to be the same thing.

302
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,400
Can you imagine anything
lower in energy than this?

303
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,840
Impossible because of it. Have it had
less curve curvature in the middle.

304
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,390
It bound to go to infinity right
when it got back in the other region.

305
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,231
Okay,

306
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:13,700
so that's the blue is the lowest one now
could there be one in between these two?

307
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,380
Yeah.

308
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,340
How it looks like. How
could you do it? Yeah,

309
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,480
Kevin,
one eight

310
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,440
oh one peak above and one
below. All right. You could,

311
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,500
could there be an energy in between?
Yes, indeed. There could be that one

312
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,820
right now.
Could there be others in between?

313
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,940
What happens as you add curvature,

314
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,270
you have these nodes.

315
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,720
I is where the wave function is zero.

316
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,230
It's not a node out here
where it's almost zero.

317
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,180
A node is when it's exactly zero and it
has to be zero because it's going from

318
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,890
being positive to be negative.

319
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:04,600
Obviously it has to go through a zero
out here and out there. It's very, very,

320
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,480
very small, but it's not
zero. That's not a node.

321
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,650
A node is where it's zero
because it's changing side. Okay.

322
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:15,370
Now nodes are related to energy.
Why

323
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,800
notice that? The lowest energy when
blue had no node, the next one,

324
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,310
the purple had one node.
The next one,

325
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,630
the bio or whatever color it is,
had had two nodes.

326
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,910
Why is there that relationship?

327
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,000
They are inflection points,
but why are,

328
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,400
why do they get higher and energy
when you have more nodes? Sam?

329
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,010
Uh,
say it in terms of energy.

330
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,080
Some people would say frequency
is energy. That's, that's true.

331
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,480
But I want you to say it in terms of,
we've been talking about

332
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,710
how do you get more nodes?
Yeah.

333
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,080
Absolute value with curvature.
Yeah. If the curvature gets bigger,

334
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,670
you get more nodes and
curvature is the energy,

335
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,170
the kinetic energy, right? So
more curvature, more nodes.

336
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,340
More energy or more energy,
more curvature,

337
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,470
more nodes. So we have zero
nodes, one node to those.

338
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,060
Those are the lowest three you can get.
And then there would be, uh, three nodes,

339
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:30,010
four nodes, five node, six notes,
had as many nodes as you want. Okay?

340
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,870
Now this is great. You can do all
sorts of neat tricks for Monday.

341
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,200
And what I want you to do with this
program is just the fiddle around with it

342
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:40,150
and make discoveries for yourself.

343
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,380
And I'll show you some of the
kinds of discoveries that,

344
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:46,900
that you can do in the next slides here.
Uh,

345
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,260
but I warn you that if you have
more dimensions or more particles,

346
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,350
right,
things quickly become impossible.

347
00:22:56,351 --> 00:23:00,490
The only thing you can do this particular
approach with is one particle in one

348
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,100
dimension.
Because if you have more,

349
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,500
if you have more,

350
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,850
then you don't know which curvature to
change. You know, the curvature Bimbo,

351
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,790
or it's a sum of a bunch of curvatures.

352
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,940
And knowing the kinetic energy,

353
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,970
the difference between total and potential
doesn't tell you which curvature to

354
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:23,140
change. If there's only one, then you
know that that's the one you have to do.

355
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,700
So it's going to be a heck of a lot of
work to do this for more complicated

356
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:31,420
systems, right? And that's
not our purpose. Now,

357
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:35,020
our purpose is to understand how quantum
mechanics works with this simple system.

358
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,650
But the question is, is it going to
be worth our effort to learn out how,

359
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,890
learn how it works if we're unable
to do anything with it. What are our,

360
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,250
another way of putting it is,
what's the reward?

361
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,610
What are we going to get out of this?
Is it worth spending some time on? Well,

362
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,280
here's the reward for science,
finding Psi,

363
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,410
the knowledge of everything,
okay?

364
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,390
For example, you know what?
Energies are allowed to assist them.

365
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,210
You know what the structures can be.

366
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,470
You know how it behaves dynamically,
how it moves.

367
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
You know how bonds work. That's
what we're really after. Remember?

368
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,600
And you know what makes for reactivity?

369
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,890
So there's a pretty good pot
of gold at the end of this.

370
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,820
So fasten your seat belts and,

371
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,790
and put your nose to the grindstone
and all sorts of metaphors.

372
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,660
And we'll do this for the
next couple of weeks. Okay.

373
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:36,980
First we'll look at allowed
energies and structure. Okay?

374
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:41,900
Now of course we already did this,
right? No nodes, one node, two nodes,

375
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,460
but what were the energies
that were allowed? Okay,

376
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:50,540
so here's a whole bunch of them,
right? No nodes. One node to node,

377
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:54,770
three nodes up to seven nodes, or
is it seven? Yeah, seven nodes.

378
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,660
Now here are the energies.

379
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
4.15 12.44 20.74 29.04 37.34 do
you see any pattern to the energies

380
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,220
you might read the title if
you have trouble seeing right,

381
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:18,200
they're evenly spaced right
after the first one, right?

382
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,010
They're evenly spaced. How about
the first one compared with zero?

383
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,310
How high is the first one?
If you know this spacing,

384
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,780
it's half the first one above zero is
half as big as the spacing of the others,

385
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,680
right?

386
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,680
So the energy is some constant and that
constant is what a 8.8 0.3 roughly times

387
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:44,510
an integer minus a half.

388
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,430
Why do you have the integers
cause nodes come in into jurors.

389
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,470
You can't have half a node right at zero
nodes, one, two, three, four and so on.

390
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,990
Okay,
so that's pretty great.

391
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,991
We know for four springs or
harmonic oscillators or uh,

392
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,870
an Adam stuck on a bond
as long as the potential,

393
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:10,370
it doesn't vibrate so much that the
potential deviates from looking like a

394
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
parabola right at the bottom of the curve,
it looks like a parabola.

395
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,020
So this is the way Adam should
behave when they're attached by bonds

396
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,410
approximately.
Okay?

397
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,590
Now remember that Doggerel poem from
1926 we only wish that we could glean an

398
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:32,030
inkling of what cy could mean.
What have we used? Cy Four so far

399
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,003
we used it.

400
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,020
It's not going to infinity to find
out when we guessed the energy, right?

401
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,750
It was just a tool for telling us
whether we had the right energy.

402
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,170
But does cy really mean something
besides just being a handy tool for this

403
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:53,790
purpose?
And it was later,

404
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:58,791
six months later in 1926 that it was
suggested what the meaning of it was.

405
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,690
And it was in this paper by Max born
that this side doesn't mean anything but

406
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:13,161
size squared is probability density or
proportional to probability density if

407
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:16,290
you scale it right.
Remember,

408
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,640
you can scale side by n multiplied by any
number you want. If you scale it right,

409
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,390
it is the probability density
of the particle. Now, here's,

410
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:28,050
here's what he wrote in German.
And what it says is if one,

411
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,200
when she wishes to translate
this result into physical terms,

412
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:36,201
only one interpretation as possible
size signifies the probability of the

413
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,074
structure.

414
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,220
But there's a footnote there cause he
made a mistake and he corrected it after

415
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,490
the thing was already set in type,
right?

416
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,620
So we've put a footnote
here, which, which me,

417
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,720
which says a correction added,

418
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:02,700
improve more careful consideration shows
that the probability is proportional to

419
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:04,140
the square of sy.

420
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,910
Why couldn't it be quite good in the
probability be proportional to cy?

421
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,390
Because cy can be negative. You
can't have a negative. Well,

422
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,720
that's one reason there, there were
other reasons too. And, uh, he,

423
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,520
I dunno how embarrassed he was by this,
but anyhow,

424
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,310
but since nobody else
knew what side was at all,

425
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,190
I think he could be proud
nonetheless. Right? But anyhow,

426
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,230
it's the square of side not site itself
that gives probability density. Now,

427
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,600
uh,
late six months later,

428
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,400
a Albert Einstein wrote a letter to
mocks born where he said something you've

429
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:46,110
probably heard, but an inner voice tells
me that this is not the real thing.

430
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,260
Theory yields a great deal,

431
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,770
but it brings us no nearer to
the secret of the old one anyway,

432
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm convinced that he does not play
dice, right? So it's not probabilities.

433
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,610
There's this fundamental determinism,
Einstein things,

434
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,530
but it turned out that in this
respect, Einstein was wrong, right?

435
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,420
It is probability.
Now it's not probability,

436
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,940
it's probability density.

437
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,650
And we have to think a little bit
about this and we can think of it in by

438
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,750
analogy with mass density.

439
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,980
Suppose you had a flask and that had
mercury in water and oil in it, right?

440
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,840
And that you're going to ask the question
if the total mass in the flask is one

441
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:31,674
kilogram,

442
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:37,550
what fraction of that or how much weight
is exactly one centimeter from the

443
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,950
bottom?
How many are,

444
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:46,300
what fraction of the total do you think
would be exactly one centimeter from the

445
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:49,240
bottom?
Anybody got a guess?

446
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,050
5% 1% half a percent 10% 12% three
there'll be this big auction,

447
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,523
right?

448
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Do I hear higher than 12% do I
hear lower than 12% who's bidding?

449
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,810
Yup. What do you say? Zero.

450
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,600
Why zero? Well, obviously
it has to do different.

451
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,270
Different heights would have
different densities, right?

452
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,500
So there'd be a lot more in mercury than
it would if I drew the line in oil or

453
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:27,610
in or in water. Right? But you say zero y

454
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,450
right?

455
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,450
A plane or align or a dot
doesn't have any volume,

456
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,020
right? You need a volume. It's zero.
You're right. You need a volume.

457
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,390
You have to multiply density,
grams per cubic centimeter by volume.

458
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,780
How many cubic centimeters
in order to get mass?

459
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,230
And the same is true of some so that in
this case the real question would be how

460
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:04,051
much is between one centimeter and 1.01
centimeters or something like that.

461
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:07,870
You could ask that question but you can't
say how much is exactly one centimeter.

462
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,110
So you have to multiply by
volume multiplied density
by volume to get the amount

463
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
right and this that and so psi
squared is probability density.

464
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,060
It's how it's how probable it
is to be in a a small volume,

465
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,740
a unit volume around
the point in question.

466
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,090
So you go to some point in question
square, cy, find the density,

467
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,290
multiply it by the volume over which sy
is constant because it doesn't very real

468
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:40,090
rapidly.

469
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,140
So he choose a really small one multiply
and that's the probability of being in

470
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:46,390
that little block.
Okay?

471
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,620
Now remember we said you could multiply,

472
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:55,621
you could scale side by any constant you
wanted to even minus one or minus Pi or

473
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,800
whatever. Okay? What
is there a good value,

474
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,920
a preferred value to scale it by?

475
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,390
You could scale it by such a number
than what it squared and you multiply by

476
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:13,090
volume over every place,
right?

477
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:16,780
Sum up all these little boxes. You
get one. Why do you want to get one?

478
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,750
Cause the total probability is
one that it's someplace, right?

479
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,800
So that's,
that process is called normalization.

480
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,130
We don't usually worry about that,
right?

481
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:34,150
We usually just take whatever numbers
we want that's convenient to plot on the

482
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:39,151
graph and know that we have to scale it
such that if we want to calculate actual

483
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,840
probability density, that's
going to some the one. Okay,

484
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:49,841
so here's an example where above we showed
two of these curves and below we show

485
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:56,060
squares of those not properly
scaled together. Together.

486
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:59,810
There's I think a little more
area in the red than in the blue.

487
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,250
Although maybe I'm bad.

488
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:05,390
They should have the same area if
the thing were normalized. Okay,

489
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,970
so that shows what it is. Now there's
an interesting thing about that.

490
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,840
If you have a pendulum or a thing on a
spring and it's going back and forth,

491
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,780
where does it spend most of its time?

492
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,380
At the extremes, right? Because
it's going so slow there, right?

493
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,230
In the blue one,
where does it spend most of its time?

494
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,800
Where does it spend most of its time?
Where is it most dense?

495
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,500
If it's the blue wave function,
the lowest wave function,

496
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,930
the zero node wave function,

497
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,580
obviously it spends its time in
the middle, not at the extremes.

498
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,830
But notice if you get to the seventh
wave function, one, two, three, four,

499
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:48,850
five, six, seven, the seventh
wave functions are going
to have seven humps, okay?

500
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,410
Then it's most profitable at the extremes,
right?

501
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,310
And as it gets, as it gets,
as you get higher and higher,

502
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,310
it gets more and more
focused at the extremes.

503
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,950
And that's why when you get to
something that's really heavy,

504
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,120
it behaves the way you expect the
pendulum or a thing on a spring to behave.

505
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,600
This is not normalized,

506
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,580
but notice something else that's really
valuable here are really crucial,

507
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,120
which is that this line is
where the potential and the
total or the same for the

508
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:26,070
red curve,
right?

509
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,760
So here is zero kinetic energy in here.

510
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:33,120
The kinetic energy is positive.
Out here it's negative.

511
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,220
And the thing can be out here,

512
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,810
right?

513
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,410
So the thing exists in a region
of negative kinetic energy.

514
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,860
There's nothing special about that.
Okay?

515
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,180
It's just that that's the way things work.
Kinetic energy can be negative.

516
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,220
And in the case of the blue one,

517
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,550
here was the point where
the kinetic energy was zero.

518
00:34:55,090 --> 00:35:00,090
And all of this out here is probability
in a region of negative kinetic energy.

519
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,210
Now what did we do it
with the Morse potential?

520
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,420
Notice if we look at the first
one with a morse potential,

521
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,700
it looks the same as it would in a,

522
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,200
in a Hooke's law harmonic oscillator.
Does that surprise you?

523
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,450
No, because the potential looks
that way pretty much. Right?

524
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,540
But as you go higher and higher
and get here to whatever that is,

525
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,340
the 12th or something like that,

526
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,110
you can see that it's very different
and it's spending a lot of time far out.

527
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,380
It's shifting.
It's average to the right.

528
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,500
But that doesn't surprise because the
well moves out to the, to the right,

529
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,720
right? As you move up in the Morse
potential as you move to higher energy,

530
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,940
uh,
because low kinetic energy,

531
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,620
which is what you have as you move
to the right means low curvature.

532
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,010
Why does that make it high probability?

533
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,540
Because as long as you have high
curvature over wave function,

534
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,430
whenever the wave function peaks up,
it gets pulled down again. Right?

535
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:16,040
It can't stay up. But if you have very
low curvature toward the baseline,

536
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,500
very low kinetic energy,
then it could go up and you don't mind.

537
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,770
Okay.

538
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,490
Cause the Connecticut,

539
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:27,050
you don't need much curvature when
the wave function is big. Okay.

540
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:27,920
So it's like that.

541
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,820
And then out in here it's pretty
much like an exponential decay.

542
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,590
Does that surprise you

543
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,240
Kate? You look like it didn't
surprise you. Why not? When do you,

544
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,490
when do you expect the wave
function to be an exponential decay

545
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,020
under what condition

546
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,580
can't hear very well is constantly.

547
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,830
Oh, when the potential energy
is constant and, and what else?

548
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:58,920
To be exponential stop sign
wave is also constantly,

549
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,123
right.

550
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,000
What makes an exponential
rather than a sine wave?

551
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,750
Yeah. Ah, the kinetic energy is
negative. Potential is higher than total,

552
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,320
but that's exactly the case on the right,
right.

553
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,630
Because there's the potential,

554
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,260
there is the total and the kinetic
energy is going down. It's negative.

555
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,880
The difference between the two.
Okay.

556
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,210
Now here are a whole bunch
of these for, for the, uh,

557
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,180
harmonic costs for the Morse potential.

558
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,410
How does it look different
from the hook's law?

559
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,570
Does the spacing of energies look the
same as it did and Hooke's law? Again,

560
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:47,770
it's zero nodes, one, two, three, four
and so on. But how is it different?

561
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,123
Yeah.

562
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,350
Ah, the spacing gets closer
as you go up. So real bonds,

563
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:01,290
which have a potential that looks
more like this than like a spring.

564
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,120
We'll have their energy levels get closer
as you get more and more vibrational

565
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:09,380
energy.
Okay.

566
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,980
They're not evenly spaced
as they are for Hooke's law,

567
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,420
the energy increases along
with a number of nodes.

568
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,020
The well widens more than it
would for Hooke's law parabola.

569
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,060
So the wavelengths become longer.

570
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,170
Those nodes are spaced over
a bigger distance. Right.

571
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,540
And the energies are lower than expected
for Hooke's law because you don't have

572
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,030
as much curvature.
You have the same number of nodes.

573
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:38,031
The like the 18th level has the same
number of nodes that would in Hooke's law,

574
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,910
but they're spaced over a wider distance.
Right.

575
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:46,510
So there's less curvature so the
energy doesn't go up as much.

576
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,330
Okay. Now this is interesting.
Look, if you have the blue energy

577
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,970
right now, the wave function looks
like this, it's no longer bounded.

578
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,130
Does it surprise you that
the wave function goes on
out to infinity when the, uh,

579
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,940
when the total energy is higher than the,

580
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,000
than that potential energy if the right,
no,

581
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,750
it means you have enough energy to break
the bond so the particle could just

582
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,060
keep going.
Okay.

583
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,790
Now what does this look
like in this region?

584
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,200
It looks like it does in a Hooke's law
or something like that, more or less.

585
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,360
What does it look like out at the right?
It's a sine wave.

586
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,930
Why Sam? Does that surprise you?
That looks like a sine wave.

587
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,560
The potential is constant,

588
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:40,561
effectively constant out there
and lower than the total.

589
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,340
So it's a constant,

590
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:47,080
it's about a sine wave because you have
a constant positive kinetic energy when

591
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,990
the total energy is above
that dissociation limit.

592
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,900
So there's the potential,
there's the total,

593
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:56,050
and now the kinetic energy is
positive and about constant,

594
00:39:56,051 --> 00:40:00,130
so it's approximately
a sine wave. Okay. Now,

595
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,190
Coolum beach potential is
a more complicated one.

596
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:06,160
The reason it's complicated is
the energy goes to infinity.

597
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,780
When our becomes zero,

598
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,600
when the positive and the negative
are on top of one another,

599
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:12,610
it becomes infinitely favorable.

600
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,570
So it's hard to do this numerically
and the program will screw up.

601
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:20,680
Sometimes when you try to
do cool omic potential,

602
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,760
but here's a,

603
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,760
and it's one dimensional and that it turns
out curiously enough that this system

604
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:30,930
is simpler in three dimensions
than in one dimension for Coolum.

605
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,810
Big potential. Don't worry about
the technical aspects of that.

606
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,960
But at any rate,
this is using the program for that.

607
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:42,040
And you can see that that the
lowest that you have very,

608
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:46,930
very high curvature when you get near
zero because you have such high kinetic

609
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:51,250
energy when the particles get
very close to one another and the,

610
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,450
because the urban program is
approximate taking finite steps,

611
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,160
you get in trouble often. Okay. But
anyhow, you get the idea that again,

612
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,330
as you get a higher energy, you get, uh,

613
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:09,510
you get waves that spread out and they
spread out a lot for the same reason they

614
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:13,440
did in Morse potential. Although
here we're using a much lighter mass.

615
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:15,490
We're using an electron,
right?

616
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,260
But it spreads out much more because
the well spreads out so much.

617
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:26,740
Okay. So higher levels spread way
out. And now the sequence of energies,

618
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,130
here's the lowest,
the next and the next.

619
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,460
They have a big spacing first
and it gets much, much smaller.

620
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,580
It turns out that the energy is
some constant divided by n squared.

621
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,140
So the number one,
uh,

622
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,440
level has an energy of minus k.
The next one is minus one fourth k.

623
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,570
It's only the Blue Line is only uh,

624
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,600
only a fourth as far down as the green
from zero, which is up at the top. Is it?

625
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,510
Well it's the zero is that
gray line at the top right?

626
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:02,240
Cause it keeps going out to zero,
far out there.

627
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,280
And the next one is one
ninth of the way from,

628
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,710
from the top to the lowest level.

629
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,120
So the reward for finding side was the
knowledge of everything we've seen the

630
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:17,520
allowed to energy and structure.

631
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,070
Now we're going to see another case
where we get structure and we also see

632
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,970
something about dynamics that's
interesting about the motion of the atoms.

633
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,700
So here's suppose this is a high,

634
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:31,810
a proton attached to a bar by a
bond to something that's heavy.

635
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,760
So the other, the heavy thing doesn't
move. The hydrogen does the moving. Okay.

636
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:41,500
And here's it's wave function. This is
the re, this is the bond to distance.

637
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,890
The minimum energy. If you stretch
the bond, the energy goes up.

638
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:46,840
If you compress the bond,
the energy goes up.

639
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,350
And that's the way you function for
the position of the hydrogen atom

640
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,023
right

641
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,290
now. Suppose we increase the mass and
instead of talking about a hydrogen atom,

642
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,120
we talked about a carbon atom,
which had a say 14.

643
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,460
Okay. Depending on what isotope
we're using, suppose we went to 14.

644
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,440
How is that going to change things?

645
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,750
If we have mass it can we use the
same function? If we use mass of 14

646
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,390
notice that we're having,
we're using the same potential.

647
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,620
So the kinetic energy at any point
is going to be the same for the two.

648
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,090
How does mass enter into kinetic energy?

649
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,633
Yeah.

650
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:37,700
Yup. Okay. Here's,

651
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,440
why do you say it would be
more concentrated? What would
make it more constantly?

652
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:47,320
They're tired, so yeah,

653
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,070
but you're not thinking about
quantum mechanics. You're
thinking that the higher,

654
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,400
uh, well no, wait a second. We're
not talking nuclear charge here.

655
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,410
All we're talking to his mass. It's
held by a spring. We're thinking, okay,

656
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,460
so the electrostatics doesn't
come into it. It's a spring.

657
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:08,150
That's stretching Elizabeth,
please.

658
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,340
Yeah. The kinetic energy
has won over mass in it.

659
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,720
So if you increase the mass
and keep the same wave,

660
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,710
what are you going to do to the energy?
You're going to decrease the energy,

661
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,890
but it's the same energy
as it was for hydrogen.

662
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:33,600
You can't just decrease the energy right
at a given position if you know the

663
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,810
total. Okay. So you want it to be,

664
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,040
uh,
you want it to be,

665
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,620
to get the same energy,
it has to be more curved.

666
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,200
Okay. Everybody with me to
be, to have the same energy.

667
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,570
If you have a bigger
mass in the denominator,

668
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,340
you're going to have
to have more curvature,

669
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,550
14 times as much curvature to
compensate for the bigger mass.

670
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,580
So it's going to curve more
toward the baseline. Okay.

671
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:09,870
So if we use that same energy
and had the higher maths,

672
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:12,120
so we got more curvature
for the same energy,

673
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,760
then it's going to curve a lot more.

674
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,730
It's going to go through and
go up to infinity and it, it's,

675
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,650
it's even higher energy.
Then the second wave would be

676
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,630
it's curved way too much.
So how would you find the lowest energy?

677
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:33,430
What would you do in your guessing?
If you wanted to find the lowest energy,

678
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,264
what would you do?

679
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,160
You'd lower your guests to make it
less curved towards the baseline.

680
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,800
Okay. Then if you do that, so lower
the energy if your math and there,

681
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:46,840
we've got the answer right.

682
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,730
So hydrogen has a much higher vibrational
energy than carbon does for the same

683
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:54,250
bond to get the lowest energy.

684
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:55,723
Yeah.

685
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,670
I think this will be clear to you
when you have time to think about it.

686
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,990
If not,
ask questions right now.

687
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:09,991
What have you had you to 35 or a
marble at the end of the same spring?

688
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,230
What do you think gets wave
function would look like?

689
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,750
The lowest energy wave function,

690
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,060
it's just the spike. The heavier
it is, the narrower it yet, right?

691
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,960
So if you have something like the
baseball held by a bond, right?

692
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,200
It's going to sit right there.

693
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,140
You're not going to be able
to see that it's spread out.

694
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,890
Electrons are so much
lighter than the nuclei.

695
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,230
Electrons really spread out.
Okay?

696
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,243
Now.

697
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
So there are the probability distributions
for hydrogen and for carbon held by a

698
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:53,790
single bond. Why is their
average not in the same position?

699
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,840
See what I mean is acceleration.
Acceleration has to do with me.

700
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,940
Yes. No, it has to do. Yeah. You guys,

701
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,430
the electrodes are not attracted. No, no.

702
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,800
It's w remember electrons
aren't entering into this.

703
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:16,130
We're just supposing that
we have a nucleus held by
a spring and that spring is

704
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:19,350
the strength of a single bond.
Okay.

705
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,660
What's the potential?
What is the potential for a bond?

706
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,740
Is it Hooke's law?

707
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,210
What's a better potential for a bond
on Hooke's law? The Morris potential,

708
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:40,510
which broadens out,
remember as it goes up.

709
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,940
So since hydrogen goes up more,
it samples further out to the right.

710
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,100
So what's the splice to the right
from the, from the carbon. Okay.

711
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,170
Now,
so let's,

712
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,400
here they are at their minimum
energy position and they vibrate.

713
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,420
The higher energy has shifted to the
right and the unsymmetrical Morris

714
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:06,250
potential and that here's the
half maximum of the problem.

715
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,093
So it spends,

716
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,820
this is it's half as probable that the
probability density here is half what it

717
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:16,900
is there. So when you say how
far does it spread out? This,

718
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,880
this thing goes out to infinity, but we
can talk about how wide it is by say how,

719
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:25,540
why did, does it half height. So the
hydrogen had half height is from,

720
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,750
from here to here, uh, from,
from, from here to here.

721
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,900
But the carbon had half height is
only from there to there. That is,

722
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,520
if you think of these things vibrating,

723
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,100
the hydrogen has a bigger
amplitude than carbon

724
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:42,690
because it's lighter.

725
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,950
So the hydrogen vibrates by 0.1
on strum 9% of the distance,

726
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,920
the carbon vibrates only half as much.

727
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,730
3% of the carbon x distance.

728
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,190
Okay. Just because of the
mass difference. And never,

729
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:11,191
we said before last time that typically
the atoms are vibrating by about 0.05,

730
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,530
uh,
Armstrong's in the crystal.

731
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,150
That's where this came from is
this quantum mechanical thing.

732
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,220
That's the least that they can pop in
when they're in their lowest possible

733
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:23,800
energy state.
They vibrate by that much.

734
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,590
Right.

735
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,980
And that's how much it is.
That little yellow dot after it shrank.

736
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:37,320
So we've seen allowed energies
and structure. We've seen
dynamics, the vibration.

737
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,620
Now next time we're going to look at
dynamics and also the payoff bonding,

738
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,900
how we understand bonding,
and one dimension.
