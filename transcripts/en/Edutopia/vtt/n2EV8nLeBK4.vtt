&gt;&gt;Jason Darnell: Somewhere down
the line learning became not fun.

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:19.006
I think somehow kids started
coming to school and saying,

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:21.156
"I'm not gonna have fun today.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:21.976
I'm going to school."

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:25.116
And the reward of Historia, it's fun.

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.926
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: Historia
is game-based learning.

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:34.076
It is a way to take a traditional
subject, like social studies,

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:39.206
but to teach it through
experience and interactivity.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Historia is using history
and learning it through game play

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:47.976
and you get to experience
it as your own country.

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:49.806
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: All
right, here we go...

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.976
&gt;&gt;Twenty-eight.

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:55.976
Oh, my god!

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:57.046
[ cheers ]

00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:59.016
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Pung: Sixth
graders, when they come

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:02.636
into school it's their first
time in a big building.

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:05.566
There's kids coming from all
different schools so they're not

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:06.996
from the same elementary school.

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:09.906
So a sixth grade mind is very social.

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:12.456
They're gonna talk to
each other at their table

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:13.746
and not necessarily be listening.

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:18.676
So when Historia comes around it's
definitely challenging the first few

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:21.586
weeks while you're setting it
up, because they are confused.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:24.266
They don't know exactly what
they're supposed to be doing,

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:29.636
but then once it gets started all
those things kind of go to the side.

00:01:29.636 --> 00:01:31.666
I still hear them talking
to their friends,

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:36.796
but the conversation switches
from the latest movie into

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:38.266
"Well, what points did you get?

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.796
How did you do?"

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:42.416
&gt;&gt;Student: The best part
of Historia, I think,

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:45.216
is being able to create
your own history,

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:48.686
because not only do you learn
about other countries during

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:52.186
that time period, you get to
learn about what has happened

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:54.806
and what can happen to you.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:56.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Have you
ever heard of "eye

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:58.186
for an eye" and "tooth for a tooth"?

00:01:58.186 --> 00:01:59.766
That comes from Hammurabi's Code.

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.666
&gt;&gt;Student: If I have a teacher
stand in front of me talking,

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:06.166
it's very hard for me to remember
'cause I get bored, distracted.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.346
With Historia it's no
place to get distracted.

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.976
You working the whole time and
making decisions as a group.

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:16.366
&gt;&gt;Jason Darnell: So what are you
finding is the most important pillar

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.596
that allows you to kind
of build the other ones?

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:20.016
&gt;&gt;Maybe education.

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:20.676
&gt;&gt;Education and government.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:20.976
&gt;&gt;Jason Darnell: Interesting.

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:23.986
&gt;&gt;It's important that
students feel success,

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:26.046
'cause if they don't feel
successful they'll give up.

00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:29.686
And at the beginning when we first
made the game, it was too hard.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:35.626
And the students would-- you would
have a group that was doing so poorly

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:39.856
that by the second half of the year,
you'd see them a little detached,

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:41.976
because they'd say,
"What's the point?"

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:46.336
You know, "I've done the best I can
and now we're still not successful.

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:47.676
I don't have time for this."

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:50.676
You know? So Rick and
I tried to build

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.666
in ways students could be successful
each week, or every other week,

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:58.006
to where it's gonna get them
to keep on coming back to it.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.906
&gt;&gt;Student: You do learn a lot because
you have to research everything

00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:05.586
and you have to learn what to do
and how to make right decisions

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.836
and you learn how to be a
government and learn how

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:09.956
to interact with other people.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:11.656
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: Who's
the monarch here?

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:12.096
&gt;&gt;Me.

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:13.316
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: Carson.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.796
Okay. So what's the bet gonna be?

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:16.066
&gt;&gt;Seven.

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:17.736
Oh, wait. Eight, eight.

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:17.986
Yeah.

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:18.296
&gt;&gt;Eight.

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:18.436
Yeah.

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:19.516
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: It's eight.

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:21.086
Okay, you all think
that's a good bet?

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:21.176
&gt;&gt;Mm-hm.

00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:23.236
&gt;&gt;Jared likes ten.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:23.776
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: You like ten?

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.926
&gt;&gt;Carson: Four hundred forty-five.

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:27.296
&gt;&gt;But then we
remembered slave revolt,

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.106
so I'm like, "Let's do eight."

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:28.316
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: Okay, okay.

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:28.856
We'll see how it turns.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:28.976
Good.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.536
&gt;&gt;If I look at my job as everything
you need to know is in my brain

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.016
and I am your source of information,

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.036
I feel like I'm sending
the wrong message,

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.956
which is "Somebody
else knows the answer".

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.696
&gt;&gt;Jason Darnell: With Historia, the
teacher is just there to facilitate.

00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:47.096
You're there to guide
the learning instead

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.196
of being the center for learning.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:52.636
You're there to help kids
learn how to research better.

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:54.876
You're there to help kids compromise.

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:57.626
You're there to help kids
learn to make better decisions

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.576
and that's how learning should be.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:04.186
&gt;&gt;Rick Brennan: In my experience,
thirteen years of teaching,

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.226
this is best teaching practice.

00:04:08.306 --> 00:04:11.846
When I didn't teach this way, I would
still have ten percent of my class

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:17.436
who I would struggle to get to pay
attention even though I did projects

00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:20.476
and games and mixed it up
in debate and all that.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.406
I tried to make the class
the best I could make it.

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:26.256
Even when I did that and worked
very hard at it, took it seriously,

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:29.226
ten percent of my class
maybe wouldn't pay attention.

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:31.366
I don't have that problem now.

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:35.786
&gt;&gt;Jason Darnell: When I
started teaching my mantra was

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.456
"I am not scared to fail."

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.226
Failing is how you learn,

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:46.646
making mistakes is how you get more
knowledgeable and become better.

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:50.526
And so I would try anything in
my classroom to make a connection

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:52.726
with my students, to make
my class more engaging.
