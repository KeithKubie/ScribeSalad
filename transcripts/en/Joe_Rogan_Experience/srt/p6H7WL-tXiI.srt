1
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,343
Oh,

2
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,983
strange

3
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,680
editing this song, all we remixing it and
everything. Video that's about to hit.

4
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,560
What does this bear call it?
What's her name?

5
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,660
I bought a bunch of their shit on
iTunes and all these Austin people were

6
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:04,010
talking shit about them. Yeah, well they
just say that to them. It's like, like a,

7
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:08,180
uh, what was that band? That cheesy
band? Uh Oh, nickel bag. Nickel bag.

8
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,810
It was like nickel back to them.
And I'm like, I don't care. This,

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,740
this song is Badass.
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:17,741
joining us on the podcast is the Great
Russell Peters from points unknown.

11
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,910
My man's a and soldier.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,220
They're making it happen.
Made it free world.

things? Fine. No fill it.

15
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,250
No one's fucked that you don't have
to worry. That's the, uh, the tissue.

16
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,240
There you go. Now you know, patent,
if you ever wondered, now you know,

want, you know, it's, it's,

18
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,990
it's very embarrassing when you're done,
but when you're doing it, it's awesome.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,910
The fact that you've done this
word guilt jazz does your fucking,

20
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,630
you've hit the bottom like
you fucked a rubber pussy but,

21
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,280
but it feels great. And if
you go to Joe rogan.net, uh,

There you go. Save some taxes.

25
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,010
Kids Save the taxes pitches.
Um,

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,370
this is the two year anniversary
for Twitter for me. Brian today,

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,490
two years in RC for Twitter.
Really? Years ago I got on Twitter.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,360
I don't know how long I've been on two.
I'm not even good on,

29
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,590
you can imagine being free of it, but I'm
at a restaurant Bro. I have to like put,

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,500
keep my shit together.
Don't check the iPhone.

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,630
Don't check the iPhone. Yeah, right.

32
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm sure it's fascinating and I might
just want to know what's happening. Yeah,

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,010
you never know. It could be some
fucking revolt and I ran some shit.

34
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:42,120
Could be don't going down right now.
Wiki leaks as you speak.

35
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,590
You up on the Wiki
leaks, man. Do you know,

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,820
I don't really know what's
happening with the wikileaks.

37
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,190
Is it one of those things that you would
normally pay attention to and you just

38
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,570
avoiding it or are you just not know?

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,090
I really just don't know
what's happening railing.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,380
You don't know anything about the story.

41
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,140
I know that this guy don't
leaks some like stuff,

42
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,040
but I don't know what he's leaked.
Have you ever been to

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,380
Wikipedia?
I have been to Wikipedia,

44
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,280
so at least you're half there and such.
Don't trust Wikipedia cause you're can,

45
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,780
yeah, I'll try and to anybody's
information. Sure. Right.

46
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,210
Wouldn't it be hilarious if someone
was just sending over some bullshit

47
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,680
documents and you know,

48
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,920
he thought that this was all US military
shit and it was actually just some

49
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,490
fiction and somebody made up to see
how much you can manipulate the press.

50
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,570
That'd be a good spin for
them. It's possible. You
know, look immediately smart.

51
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,790
They was immediately smart.
Yeah.

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,820
Well the media that can be calling him
a rapist over and over and over again.

53
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,690
Rape, rape, rape community right there.
CNN. This is the thing he didn't,

54
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,330
they're not even the women
are not even calling it rape.

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,460
But Sweden has some of the most
liberal sexual offense laws.

56
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,700
Like they have really crazy laws.
And in Sweden if you like,

57
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,330
if you're like having sex with someone
in the condom breaks and you don't tell

58
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,080
the person, then it can be considered
rape because you ruin. Yeah,

59
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,000
there's a lot of weird shit man.

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,860
If you know there's raped by coercion
and there's like instead of pimp game,

61
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,700
which is, you know what you'd call
it in America, have some flavor,

62
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,160
no how to kick it.
So the girl gets confused and fucked you.

63
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,520
What you ordinarily wouldn't in Sweden,
that shit's like a crime.

64
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,650
Like they're making being clever to get
pussy a crime and that is hilarious.

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,550
They want weak sauce.
Have you ever seen watered down milk?

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,550
Ever seen the pictures in the
Ikea things in Dubai? Yes.

67
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:25,110
They're all was very dumb looking at
us. So it was a guy lifting would. Yeah.

68
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,880
Do you the last thing you
want as a culture like that,

69
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,540
a non fucking flavorful
culture, you know, anything,

70
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,130
nothing clever comes out of their Abba.
People shouldn't be shame, ashamed of sex.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
If you shouldn't be ashamed of sex,

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,900
then you know you shouldn't have somebody
fucking crazy laws where people do

73
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,470
dumb shit and fuck. A lot of times when
people fuck, they feel bad afterwards.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
You know, they've, I shouldn't have
done that. I have better morals in this.

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,440
What's wrong with me? What if my
family knew? Well, tough shit.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,950
You shouldn't be able to cry. Rape,
you know, and a lot of people can,

77
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,480
you can just cry. Rape. You know,

78
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,650
there's a lot of feminists that absolutely
believe that if a woman feels like

79
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,970
after the sex is over,

80
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,720
that somehow or another she was
talked into this or manipulated,

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,260
that she should be able to file charges
for rape. It's like buyer's remorse.

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,510
It's crazier than buyers.
Rutgers,

83
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,420
it's the most ridiculous shit ever.
Real rape is terrible,

84
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,410
but this is just as bad as real
rape the other way, you know,

85
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,130
cause they're raping the
man. Yeah, you're, you're,

86
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,180
you're raping someone of freedom for
doing something that's natural that you

87
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,740
want it to.
You fucking skank has you dirty bitch.

88
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:34,390
You know you wanted that deck. They all
want it. They want it. It's natural.

89
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,270
If you're fucking heartbeats and
you're young and your body moves right,

90
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,800
your want some Dick.
All right.

91
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,710
I would get in so much trouble if I
was involved in that country at l.

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm of course you would. We all
would. Anybody who lives in America,

93
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,140
anybody who lives in a land of where
there's a fucking game going on. Okay.

94
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,360
All right. This is a reason why comedians
become comedians in the first place.

95
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,840
Be Honest. There is a,
there is a vaginal call,

96
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,050
Goddamn game going on and
there's a, there's a, there's
a game going on, you know,

97
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,630
as far as like a human interaction,
you can't flavor down,

98
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,530
watered down the game for
sex. You know, there's a Pr,

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,530
the personality game is the
reason why all art comes from,

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,590
why do you think biggie smalls
was such a fucking good rapper?

101
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,070
Because he wanted to be the man
so we can get some pussy. Okay?

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,210
He wanted to be a pimp.

103
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,960
He wanted to be a player who want to be
a dude at the top of a pile of money.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,900
Why? Because that's how you're going to
get the pussy when you're ugly. Fuck.

105
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,500
It's the best in your face.
The best shit you got bitch.

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,130
And if the best shit you've got gets you
locked up for coercion cause you were

107
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,510
paying at two chicks at the same time,

108
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,480
you're going to have a flavor
list fucking country. You crazy.

109
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:39,530
Cons and Sweden just cause you
make good cheese. Don't get crazy.

110
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,140
That's not the same
country, right? It's social.

111
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,390
In Sweden they hold beer very
well in Sweden. They hold beer,

112
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:47,760
they can take it and they make cheap
furniture. Oh those Paul Saint Pauli girl.

113
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,860
There's going to get cheap furniture and
strong by the way that does not a dis

114
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,620
against Switzerland was just joking.
Whatever. If you're from Switzerland,

115
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:59,180
you get all uppity. He didn't know
that. We don't make the cheese, bro.

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,990
Come on. These are jokes, man, and make
cheese and chocolate and not jokes.

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,620
Just jokes man.
But Sweden's got to lighten the fuck up,

118
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,470
but it's weird that they can fucking
Interpol warning and they're trying to

119
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,423
export,

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,030
export this guy back to Sweden from
fucking London for having sex without a

121
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,750
condom. That's ridiculous. It's amazing
though. It's so wait rans parent,

122
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,410
he had sex without a condom and that's
one of the condom broke or some crazy

123
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,480
shit. It's like they're not
revealing all of the details,

124
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,690
but no one is saying that. It's
like he took them, you know,

125
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,630
into an alley and pull their pants down
and punched him in the head and fucked

126
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:29,810
up.

127
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,930
[inaudible] I heard not even date raped
and they be calling me during the whole

128
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,040
thing is bullshit.
Anyway,

129
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,350
the whole thing was just a stupid
thing that get him for something to,

130
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,620
to do that this because of course it is,

131
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,650
but it's amazing that it's this fucking
transparent because here's the deal.

132
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,320
Okay,
one step removed.

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,160
The New York Times has released
all of the shit that he's released,

134
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,720
so what are we going to say now?

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,230
Are we going to say that while this stuff
came out and you guys knew it was top

136
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,980
secret so you shouldn't look at it and
since the the journalists did look at it

137
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,930
and then they published it,
shouldn't,

138
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,420
shouldn't in New York Times
now have to go to jail to what?

139
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,230
Who the fuck goes to jail? If this guy
was just someone who ran a site that says,

140
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,570
hey, have you got some, I'm listening.

141
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,600
Which is basically what he did and
people start sending them shit.

142
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,580
That's real journalists journalism. That's
real journalists. That's the real shit.

143
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,790
That's what we're supposed to get these
fucking cunt that are heightened all

144
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,650
this shit and talking to the government.

145
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,590
You're not supposed to talk to the
government. He's supposed to talk to us.

146
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,560
What the fuck did you learn?
Did you learn some crazy shit?

147
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,620
What the fuck did you learn?
What are they doing over there?

148
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Why are we really there?
What the fuck is what's going on?

149
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:35,720
Why are all these bees dying?
Here's one of the things that came out.

150
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,490
The EPA knew about this fucking toxic
shit they've been spraying on corn that

151
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,610
kills honeybees and they
let them put it out anyway.

152
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,670
They let them put it out anyway because
they wanted to be able to sell more

153
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,450
fucking corn so they're killing off bees.
And the EPA was aware of this.

154
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,500
We would've never found this out if
it wasn't for wikileaks. Wow. Dude.

155
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:59,370
Pfizer is bribing people in
Nigeria to stop lawsuits.

156
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,050
There's like these lawsuits against them.

157
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,970
So they're bribing people to go after
like politicians and make them look bad.

158
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,350
There's like these memos and shit. There's
a lot of creepy shit. This is exposing.

159
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,240
So you've been reading a lot of the stuff,
obviously the fuck out.

160
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:18,960
When I first heard that this guy was
getting arrested for sex without a condom,

161
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,810
I was like, what? What is
in these fucking things?

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,740
And you go in these things and it's like
it's not all bad. Islam all terrible.

163
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,300
It's a lot of,
it's a fascinating shit.

164
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,570
Like we're finding out that
other countries like want
us to do some shit about

165
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,920
Iran. Like there's a lot of people go, hey
these mother fuckers, if they get bombs,

166
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,620
we got problems like this.
People in their next door,

167
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:42,090
neighbors and shit who are Muslim
countries like [inaudible] can you guys,

168
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,660
can you hook this up? Yeah. What's
up? What's going on here? Or are they,

169
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,170
how close are they? What's
going on? You know, there,

170
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,690
I mean there's a lot of good shit that
we're finding out about this stuff.

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,480
But the point is that the government,

172
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,700
the only reason they don't want you to
know the secrets and what they're doing

173
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,140
is because they fuck up a lot and they
don't want to be responsible for their

174
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,230
actions and they want to be able to hide
shit and they want to be able to look

175
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,330
up your fucking ass hole,
the microscope,

176
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,090
because it's easy because if I
just want to be able to do it,

177
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,680
I just want to know what
the fucks up your asshole.

178
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,760
And so they want to make it that way so
that their job is simpler and they can't

179
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:21,060
get fired as easy cause they suck cock.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,960
They're terrible at their fucking job
because almost every politician is

181
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,990
terrible. Why? Because the reason why
they got there in the first place,

182
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,650
because again, all these fucking special
interest groups paying for their multi,

183
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,230
multi, multimillion dollar campaigns.
They're talking about Barack Obama,

184
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:39,450
Obama's reelection campaign.
$1 billion.

185
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,580
Where's that money coming from?
You mother fucker. That's crazy.

186
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,500
There's no way you should be able to
spend $1 billion to get a job that pays

187
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:53,100
500,000 and not have everybody go,
what are you doing?

188
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,400
What the fuck are you doing?
Who's giving you this money?

189
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,980
What happens when they give it to you?
Now? What do you have to do for them?

190
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,380
What do you do?
You got to hire them.

191
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,510
You gotta do we gotta do
you gotta Change Laws?

192
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,120
You're going to make it easier
to Trump shit into lakes.

193
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,980
What the fuck is going on?

194
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,690
They all suck and that's why they're
scared of all this information.

195
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,720
They're scared of all this information.
It's not to protect you.

196
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:19,230
That's nonsense to protect
our citizens overseas.

197
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,490
You don't give a fuck about them when
you're sending them to an an illegal war

198
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:26,460
zones or illegal war zones where
we shouldn't even be there.

199
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:29,250
It was based on a fucking lie.
You don't care about them then.

200
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,930
If you don't care about American soldiers,

201
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,990
then you're telling me you care about
them now because secrets are getting out

202
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,020
really. Fuck you. That's not true.

203
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,350
They're worried about the
moon secret getting out. Yeah.

204
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
Was there anything like
that in these wiki leaks?

205
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:46,230
Like I'm not actually going to the moon.
You're not yet. Not yet. But who knows?

206
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Who knows what this guy's got.
This guy's got some fascinating shit.

207
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,830
It seems like most of it that's gotten
out at least to the more public is the

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,070
stuff like how

209
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,500
these kings have like they're
sluts and stuff like that.

210
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,660
I haven't heard too much really.
I haven't heard that. Oh yeah.

211
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:02,890
It's like that's what Saturday night live
made fun of and the TMZs been focusing

212
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:06,790
on is all like these secret lover
relationships at all these princes and

213
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,480
[inaudible] bars. Shit,
keep alarm part of it

214
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,760
and the pallbearers do give a fuck.

215
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,780
Do you not like the guy from Abu Dhabi,
Prince Talk Moon. The guy who runs,

216
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,540
he runs the Abu Dhabi
submission combat championships,

217
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:26,220
the world grappling championships and he
also, um, like owns a piece of the UFC.

218
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,970
This guy is like some super insane
amount money millionaire type character,

219
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,180
right? This guy, he's got this, this
thing that they do the UFC, it's at,

220
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,890
it's called Ferrari world.

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,920
It's like a Ferrari fucking
like Disneyland with Ferrari
Ferrari theme park with

222
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:48,150
like this crazy ass roller coaster that
mother fucker could do anything he wants.

223
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,690
You know the like those guys, like when
you get to that level of money, man,

224
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,160
that people would be surprised that you
would find some guys a prince in Saudi

225
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,180
Arabia and he's got some hookers.

226
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,250
He's got some chicks living in his mansion
and he wouldn't even know that it's

227
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,940
still there. Those guys are ballers.
Dude, did you ever hear about that guy?

228
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,810
The Sultan of Brunei? I've
heard about him. Mother fucker.

229
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,240
This mother fucker just goes to the limit.
This is what he does.

230
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,860
He sits around right?

231
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,610
And he watches like Playboy magazine
and it reads Playboy magazine,

232
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:21,420
watches TV shows and goes, I look
hurt. I like this one right here.

233
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,340
And then he finds out what their agent
is and he gives them insane amounts of

234
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,890
money to come to wherever he is,
you know,

235
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,580
for like Brunei for just hang out
for a couple months, see what's up,

236
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:35,790
I'll give you a few million bucks.
And so these chicks cannot help it.

237
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,840
They have to go.

238
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,010
And there was one of them
who was a penthouse pad or
something like that and she,

239
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:43,020
uh, got, yeah. And she got a,

240
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,130
she got caught with a laptop she was
writing while she was over there. And uh,

241
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,530
that's how the whole thing came out.
You know,

242
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,470
that all these chicks who had been
saying they were going over there to do

243
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:53,304
modeling,

244
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,360
there's so many girls that were modeling
in Brunei and they were really just

245
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:00,880
going and getting gorilla fuck
by this print and all his boys,

246
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,860
the old assaulted and all his pals,
they had like their own club.

247
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,400
They had so much money.
They have their own club.

248
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,020
They have this gigantic insane
ballroom that's like it did the, the,

249
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,380
the ornate decorations
are like incredible,

250
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:18,240
like gold guild work.

251
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:23,241
Let's just the top of the blind and the
hottest bitches in magazines and on TV

252
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:27,570
shows and they're all
hanging out there dancing,

253
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,980
waiting to him to come out in his gold
underwear and just get his freak on with

254
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:36,900
whoever the fuck he wants. How am I
going into it? You can't hate that.

255
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,910
You cannot hate that. You cannot hate
that this guy's not doing anything,

256
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,110
that he shouldn't be doing what he's
offering them as a psalm. He's saying,

257
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:49,200
listen, you know, we don't have
to cop products, prostitution.

258
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm gonna hire you to just come hang out.
Just come hang out in a hurry

259
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,520
to party. Eventually you're going to
get horny. You cannot let me fuck you.

260
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,070
You know, I got money son. You know,

261
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,280
Super Mario Brothers is all about an
Italian that just wanting to eat mushrooms

262
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,650
with the princess,
with a princess.

263
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,570
Really Super, Super Mario
brothers. No. Honestly,

264
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,850
I don't think I've ever played
it more than once or twice. Yeah,

265
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,870
I never really got about this Italian
plumber that just wanted eat mushrooms and

266
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,290
with the trends says, but son David kept
on taking the parenthesis away. Daymond,

267
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,470
that's how you pimp these modifiers.

268
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,790
Eat Mushrooms and hanging out with
the printers. Hey, I heard you are,

269
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,491
that'd be bad.

270
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,570
I heard you are a DJ like you know how
to Dj like mixed mixed tables and stuff

271
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,850
like that. You could do anything.
He wants his Russell Peters bed.

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,410
That's like a main hobby of yours.

273
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,580
I started doing that in 85 really
now I've always experiment,

274
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,290
play around even and have the iPad app
where you can try to mix and stuff he's

275
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,000
into and beef make scratch my stores,
something like that.

276
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,030
It doesn't work that good but it is.
Is there like a,

277
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,180
is it easier nowadays to try to like
match beats and stuff like that and easier

278
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,210
way? He's written in a
file right in front of you.

279
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,990
You just hit a button now and it just,
man, no, no. You'll have your bpms listed,

280
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,120
right? Wow. Are you
going to do is keep your,

281
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,900
hear your pitch at the same
level and you're good to go.

282
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,960
So do you ever throw parties where
you're just the Dj and you're having this

283
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,960
huge Kyle and end up getting, I have
turntables and every house, so yeah,

284
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:09,830
I always make sure.
Right.

285
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,620
Do you really like, so you throw
parties at your house and you not even,

286
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,200
I just do it for me.
And then if people are there I'm like,

287
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,191
what do you want to hear?

288
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,710
And then I just started playing
shit when Tommy Lee was doing that.

289
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,680
What was that? That rock star show the
dude was doing, what is that called?

290
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,260
The rock star Supernova or something.
He wanted to have a fight with kid rock.

291
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,740
So this was like they were,
they were really upset at each other.

292
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,140
And so you want him to meet me.
So yeah,

293
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
because my friend is one
of his bodyguards. Okay.

294
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,860
And my friend is this fucking gorilla.
Just mountain of a man.

295
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,530
You've met John Rollo, right? So John
Rollo takes me backstage. I meet them.

296
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,720
And this is what a Tommy Lee does at the
end of every show. He's got a DJ set up.

297
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,270
Like he makes his own party and he just,
he like,

298
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,810
he just brings his friends over and he'd
fucking plugs in some turntables and

299
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:56,540
just starts to starts to mix it up.
Like people who DJ,

300
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,400
like even Michael Bisping the fighter.
He's still djs being djs. Yeah.

301
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,820
I didn't know that. People apparently
people who DJ just fucking love Dj.

302
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,580
I love comedies. My career.
Yeah. Hello. You love Dj.

303
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,700
And more than comedy.

304
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,930
I could sit there and do it all day.
Why not? Amazing. See I want to,

305
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,750
I've always wanted to get addicted to
it cause it seems like something that's

306
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,580
right down my, my, my

307
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,300
lane and explain it. Tell me what it
is. Cause that's shocking coming from,

308
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,690
you know, such a, a successful
comedian and someone who,

309
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,740
who's I love standup but deejaying
is on another level from,

310
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,120
makes me like want to try it.

311
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,350
Exactly.
It's kind of like MMA for you.

312
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:38,100
You know your job is
comedy but you love MMA.

313
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,710
I look, I, you know what? I love
both. Honestly. I love them both.

314
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,700
I don't have a preference. Like I'm like,
I'm never like when I'm doing the UFC,

315
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,370
I'm always excited to be there. I'm never
like, fuck, I wish I was doing comedy,

316
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,050
you know? But what I'm doing comedy, I'm
never thinking, I wish I was at the UFC.

317
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,400
That's the same with me. Okay, so, so you
just have an equal love for the it is,

318
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:59,190
but, but you see one of those things
you can do at anytime, anywhere.

319
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,810
You don't need people around you to do it.

320
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,440
You don't need to people to be
totally focused on you either.

321
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,390
Like either do it in the
back requirements, you know,

322
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,650
attention requirements for standup need
people to be focused on you the entire

323
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:14,760
time and not interacting, not talking to
you. Whereas if you're teaching and man,

324
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,460
everybody could be just doing their
thing. You know, people just what?

325
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,660
You need nobody to talk to you.

326
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:23,400
Then you don't want people talking
about it because you get in the zone and

327
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,030
you're like,

328
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,770
can you play dancing queen?

329
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,830
And you're like, can you fuck off? You
know, it'd be bad. What would be bad ass?

330
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,640
Here's what be fuck your crossfader here.

331
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,870
I'm going to describe to you guys
the greatest show of all time.

332
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,850
Russell Peters d chain while Joey
Diaz talks on the microphone.

333
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,400
Let's try it. Let's try this little
gizmo out. What is this thing?

334
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,110
It's Dj mixer for the iPhone.

335
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,820
Dj Mixer

336
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,630
to do all this stuff, man. Like yeah, if
you go to youtube and type in my name,

337
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,460
there's like videos of me scratching
with like with Dj Kubert and stuff. Wow.

338
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:05,140
That's awesome dude. I have a video.
Me and Jazzy Jeff d together too.

339
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,520
Damn. That's sweet. Jazzy Jeff.

340
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,810
That guy is

341
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,400
the uh,
Art Garfunkel.

342
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh,
rap music.

343
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,180
Yeah. This doesn't work. Socks
right a little bit. Jazzy Jeff was

344
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,480
paired up with will Smith,

345
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,390
man, I couldn't hate that
more. Yeah, that's terrible.
Don't do that again Brian.

346
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:28,440
I throw that thing in the garbage.

347
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,150
I'm going to have to hit your iPad with
a hammer. Now I sound like an old man.

348
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,230
These kids, what? They're scratching.
That's me. How, how bad is Jazzy Jeff?

349
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,830
He's pretty wished that he somehow or
another hit that will Smith height.

350
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,950
He's so far off. I mean, in the
DJ world, he's highly, I don't,

351
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't mean, I don't mean
in any bad way. I mean this,

352
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,420
these weird must've been
your billion dollar art,

353
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,840
Art Garfunkel and pulse on where
the most fuck his art Garfunkel.

354
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,960
Most djs are introverts. So they, uh,

355
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,820
when you have two people
like that and one person,

356
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,170
they're both involved in a team.

357
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,510
You don't think there's some
weird thing when one guy becomes,

358
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:07,470
we'll fucking Smith. Well remember George
Michael had that other guy in wham.

359
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,310
Yeah. With that guys just getting steady
cock. That's all he wanted originally.

360
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,370
If you look at that guy,
all that guy wanted was cock all day.

361
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,000
That's what he wanted. And so George
got him close enough to that. It's like,

362
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm good, I'm good. I've got a stockpile.
He's not even thinking about money.

363
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,100
I think one of the
coolest things about Dj,

364
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,850
one of my good friends is
that his name is Keith.

365
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,070
He's that main editor for South Park.
And he,

366
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,890
every time they have a party he'd
always djs at their parties and stuff,

367
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,820
but he is just like the point where that's
all he, that's his favorite thing. He,

368
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,980
that's all he wants to do
is deejaying and stuff,

369
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,110
but what's really cool is that him mixing,

370
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,990
like I saw him mixed like golden
girls the other day or something.

371
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,360
Yeah. I like doing crazy
shit like that. Do you? Yeah.

372
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,020
Do you do a lot of do and shops and we'll
see you again now they're called Mash

373
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:50,621
was back in the day.

374
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:54,790
We just call them mixing like I took this
record in this record and came up with

375
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,760
this mix. Do you have one mass
or mixed that's your favorite?

376
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Goto from back in the day I used to do a
give it all you got by Afro Rican and I

377
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,820
would mix moments in love with it because
after Regan was like a really fast

378
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,030
song in the moments in love was a slow
song and I would actually have to pitch

379
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,810
down moments and love to get it
on beat. Wow, that's awesome. Wow.

380
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,440
You put last time at the fights and I
hear the Dj there and all they do is sit

381
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,870
there going here for fucking murder.
This guy on the turntables,

382
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,270
sometimes they have djs that uh,
when,

383
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,350
when you go to like the fights
and stuff like that, we'll,

384
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:31,180
they'll have like 15 seconds of a great
song and just start getting into it.

385
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,340
I've got an immediately
transitions to another song.

386
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:37,570
Like what are you even doing when he's
trying to get an add motherfucker?

387
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
He's trying to get as much music in,
in his one minute that he's got the play.

388
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,750
That's weird though, right?
Well because he's like shit.

389
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,010
Otherwise they could get
anybody to just hit play. Right.

390
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,840
So I want to show you what I can
do in this short amount of time.

391
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,420
He annoying being annoying to a drum beat.

392
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,860
It's more just showing the skills that
they DJ instead of actually playing a

393
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:59,980
song. And every time I listen to my
God, Oh my God, it's cuts or lays.

394
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm Dj Jazzy Jeff is, he's like, he's
like the pimp DJ who's like the best Dj.

395
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,280
That's a tough call.
I think he's horrible.

396
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,330
I would never put DJ in front of his name.
Really?

397
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,600
I want them to get the bag can
take fucking success though. Right?

398
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,430
Can terrible man.
I think it's cock cancer.

399
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,640
This dude that I know that's like
some serious ball or character.

400
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,070
He's like one of the
friends of the Fertittas,

401
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,650
he's like one of those yacht characters,
you know,

402
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,360
just fucking yacht and
around the world and shit.

403
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,440
And he was talking about going to see
Dj ts two at new years that it was the

404
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:35,030
thing to do. And I was like, well what's
the second best? Those are people,

405
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,440
the people that go to see him and know
nothing about music or DJ this is that

406
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,510
what it is? They just like, this
is what the height thing is.

407
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,290
I should probably say, but we should state
in advance that you don't do ecstasy.

408
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,590
No,
Si true.

409
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,410
These fucking people that do actually
maybe with Tsa is doing is hitting this

410
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,790
frequency that only got two
people who do ecstasy can feel.

411
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,290
Who are you guys just talking about by
the way? Which the project yesto okay.

412
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,370
That's who you wouldn't
even put gigantic Dj. He is.

413
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,070
He makes like super huge famous.
They were telling me,

414
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,740
the guy was telling me that on a shelf
in front of 50,000 people for new years.

415
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,060
It was just insane. New Years. She
couldn't let me tell you what he does.

416
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:16,390
This is the worst part about it.
Okay. He doesn't do shit live.

417
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,780
It's all prerecorded.
So it's basically you put on your,

418
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,060
it's like you recorded a DVD,
stand up,

419
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,080
a video of you doing stand up and you put
it on your stand in front of it and go

420
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:30,010
and lip sync. The fucking act. Oh
Wow. That's, and you're not even lip.

421
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,720
You're not even trying to
pretend that you're good at it.

422
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:35,830
You're just like this like when I get
old and I just want to be so high all day

423
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,760
that I can't think that's,

424
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:38,920
what am I doing when a prerecord
all my steps in advance,

425
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,880
Ashley Simpson was a world they
just go, go add. That might be one,

426
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,270
a funny show and then people try to hacky
throw you off the fucking things just

427
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,360
play on the ground like you just keep
motoring through. They don't even know.

428
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,190
You have to stop. Hey, stop, stop, stop
the stop the recording to fuck dude.

429
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,400
Have you heard that Dj game
for the x box or a hero? Yeah.

430
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,210
What do you think about that? I've never
played it. I just don't get it right.

431
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,010
I guess it's like a guy
really plays a guitar.

432
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,270
Does he really want to
fucking play guitar? Do you
play video games at all? No.

433
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,971
So you don't,

434
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:11,210
so you don't feel that that's like real
DJ and even though it's like what he's

435
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:15,590
doing is just crafting a party. Right.
He's putting together in advance.

436
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,230
He doesn't even have to think
anymore though. It's just like,

437
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,650
so once he gets to the live audience,
he doesn't have to think.

438
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,470
There's a lot of thinking that must
go on to create it right now. No, no.

439
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,680
Gives you really to,
it's fucking like 150 bpms.

440
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,630
This I have never listened to it.
I can pull some of that shit up.

441
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,670
Pulls from rash. Let's, I need to hear it.

442
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,400
I need to know what the fuck I'm
talking to. All of those big name Djs,

443
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,700
people telling me shit about
something like that and I,

444
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,870
I've never heard about it before. I always
feel like, how did this happen, ma'am?

445
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,410
Yep.

446
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,410
Djt yesto t e V.

447
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,440
E. S. T. O. R. E. S. Fuck. Oh,
there's a big sign. I think it
was in Vegas. Oh, about his,

448
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:58,070
one of his appearances? Yeah.
He's there in ears. Right?
I don't know. I don't know.

449
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,210
Um, you know who else is like that?
Is that [inaudible] Guy? I don't,

450
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:02,870
I've never heard of him.

451
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,990
He's the guy that produced all that shit
for black eyed peas that I got feeling

452
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:08,450
shit. Oh really? Yeah, but now he like,

453
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:13,451
they hire him to Dj parties and there's
a video of him on youtube where his shit

454
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,680
just canceled on him like he's playing in.

455
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,440
The first one is the guys are playing cds,
which is even more horrible to me.

456
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,430
You're a final guns. Yeah. You can't blame
school. Russell Peters, just old school.

457
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,110
I like it. I like that idea
of records and shit. Fuck.

458
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,660
She gotta bring crates and Shit. I
still use Serato, which are the, uh,

459
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,800
software. But I use the turntables with
it because he can control it better. Oh,

460
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,210
okay. So more like real
djs. So you have turntables,

461
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,420
but you don't have records? No, I have
the two records in, that's it to rack.

462
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:48,080
I have all my records in Canada. Okay.
But I'm not bringing them all back to la.

463
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,790
So when you Dj, you Dj there mp3s are
some, you're cutting up MP three files.

464
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,710
Wow. So you can, there's software,

465
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,480
then there's a machine that lets you
manipulate an MP three the same way you

466
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:01,000
would manipulate a record,
right. Sort of thing.

467
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,620
And it takes MP three and converts
it to the test to underrate it.

468
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,560
So when you have your hands on the wheels,
the MP three is playing.

469
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,290
You have the same manipulations that
you would as if it was when you touch it

470
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,900
and it'll stop.
If you move your hand slowly,

471
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:16,110
it'll make the same slow record
noise. Wow. Now there's one that best.

472
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,670
There's one at best buy
that I always look at.

473
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,610
It's like $500 would you recommend
something like that? There's a,

474
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,600
there's a system called itch itch, which
is good. Serrato makes that too. Okay.

475
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,930
Is this Dj ts two that you're
playing? Yeah. Let's hear.

476
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:32,870
It reminds me of like beyond
the mind's eyes soundtrack. Now,

477
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,840
just thinking about yourself.
Blasted on two hits of ecstasy right now.

478
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,060
This doesn't sound like, yes, Duh. Yeah.
Yeah. This doesn't sound right, Brian.

479
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,230
This sounds like seven k
Swedish fucking pop music.

480
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,980
All right, here's DSF versus
Diablo T. Esto versus, no,

481
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,440
not even a versus, because now they
have have versus, but it's now really,

482
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,933
what does that mean?

483
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,793
Okay,

484
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,570
let her, all those people
are in it. It just walks out.

485
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,010
You know what else snuck up on me, man?
Juggalos Juggalos Smash Ogling on me.

486
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,720
Exactly.
You know,

487
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,230
you don't know what Juggalos I dunno
what juggling exactly to Juggalos are.

488
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:17,231
The fans of the insane clown
posse I remember are fucking huge.

489
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,520
And it's amazing,
man,

490
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,450
because it's like they call out family
that's like a thing that they yell out in

491
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:25,550
the crown.
It's like a theme with them.

492
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,090
It's like they like everywhere out there,

493
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,240
there's somebody like you and
they might not be near you,

494
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,720
but you can find these mother fuckers
and if you could figure out how to put

495
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:39,260
them together and put them all
together in one group, you know,

496
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,490
all of a sudden you've got something.

497
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,220
And that's what happened with
the insane clown posse. These,

498
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:47,720
these fucking people are lost
from all over the world, man.

499
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,700
And they found the insane clown
posse Zaga launch. No fucking way.

500
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:56,240
They're huge dude. Remember
when they tried beefing with
m and m back in the day?

501
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,330
Well that didn't work out well,
that didn't work out.

502
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,960
But right now there are gigantic man in
m and m can't leave his fucking house.

503
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,080
Right. You know, there's something
going on with those guys.

504
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,140
Okay, look, look what he's doing. He's
not doing anything. This is hilarious.

505
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,000
Fucking dancing guys got in front of him
in front of a mixing. Yeah. You guys got,

506
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:16,490
by the way, check out this video. It's
called Siesta versa. Dip. I limbo. Right?

507
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,500
Come on here. He's just
sitting there dancing. You're
playing play like pressing.

508
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:24,070
Wow. Look at all those. He's not doing a
fucking thing that's not deejaying. No.

509
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Put your hands down and look at
the fucking turntable all. Yeah.

510
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,370
It's like he says hello.

511
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,690
Yeah. You're not doing any say that
fucking record didn't, you didn't do shit.

512
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:36,440
Yeah. He's so, he's not doing
anything. No. They do this all night.

513
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,580
He's dancing for you.

514
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,330
That the way you want to see some fucking
queer dance like that all night. Yeah.

515
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,020
Well he prepared this shit, man. He
didn't prepare shit. People there, man.

516
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:47,900
Look at all those people. Something's
going on the pay like right. Okay.

517
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:51,170
What do we attributed to drug
Tribbey twos at an all time high.

518
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,930
It's not just a man. If you were
there and you just wanted to dance,

519
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,830
that's pretty fucking fun. Yeah, but
that, but it's just him pressing play.

520
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Whoever had a louder [inaudible] nothing.

521
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,980
Nothing is happening is just
enjoying the fuck out of it.

522
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:05,210
See something is happening.

523
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,860
There's an awesome no being always in
the pudding are easy to trick Brian.

524
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,620
If they act it, enjoy. It is a
trick. Partying. It is a trick.

525
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,330
You're there and you're on ecstasy. You
don't want eight cars drive by. Okay?

526
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,890
You want to be listening
to shit like this.

527
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,070
You don't want to be alone by yourself
in that spot where there's nothing going

528
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:25,910
on. You hear a dog barking or do you
want this guy to hook up this wild,

529
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:30,200
crazy fucking light and music show that
is dope as fuck and there's a million

530
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,600
other people, they're just
all sweaty together and
you're all got bottled waters,

531
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,490
right? Everybody has a goddamn good
time. You can't call that nothing, right?

532
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,070
It could call him that. He's not a
good Dj. Kresge lay. My argument for

533
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,330
him is that he's not a DJ. No, he's
not. He's like a radio station Dj.

534
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,100
But what is it?
Because he's making this crazy ass music.

535
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:52,590
Could everybody fucking diabolical
genius who's mastered this?

536
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,000
He's the carless of soulless people
that have no luck and spines.

537
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,780
Not with his music. It's
more with how he does it. No,

538
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,530
it's the fact that people call him a DJ
and they're like, keep them [inaudible].

539
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,200
I'm like, he has, he's not a d,

540
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:11,201
so it's like calling an actor a stand up
or a comic comic that just steals other

541
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,630
people's jokes. A comic,
you know? Right. Okay.

542
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,680
Well Eve or an actor that
plays a comic and a move. Yeah.

543
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,860
And then he's such a good comedian. Well,
you hear that all the time about actors.

544
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,330
You know that he's a comedian
office, I guess, or the Canadian,

545
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:29,560
sort of like a guy who studied a
role to be a comedian. Yeah, man,

546
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,040
we all know who the comedians
are. I mean, everybody liked that.

547
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,770
Isn't that one question that you'll always
ask when you hear about a guy's funny?

548
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,600
Like did he just stand up? Yeah,
that's exactly what I asked. Right?

549
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:41,080
Like Seth Rogen, the, one
of the first things someone
said to me when I said, God,

550
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,790
that fucking dude is funny. I love
his movies. This guy goes, you know,

551
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,440
used to be stand up like immediately.
Like comics want to tell you that like,

552
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:51,160
he's like, he's like for real,
he's a real comedian is not.

553
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,090
So that's what bugs you. Yeah. That
he's a fake Dj. This mother fucker.

554
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,180
It's actually making that music.
Then he, here's the thing,

555
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:00,400
when you get that much
success in that much money,

556
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,030
all you gotta do is everybody's going
to be handing you their fucking demo.

557
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,160
Right? And you go, here's 10 bucks. Oh my
God. Testo bought my song and thank you.

558
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,480
Thank you. Thank you. Now I'll just
compile it onto a disc and yeah,

559
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,870
so he just takes other people's shit and
puts it on. Why not? What's stopping him?

560
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,490
He's actually, I don't know. I mean,
is that really what he does? Or he just

561
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,390
clearly he said Joe Rogan
experience is not support these. Oh,

562
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,400
like me if that's the case.
Yeah.

563
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,020
A Dj battles just called out
for in Dj fight or a fight.

564
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:37,060
Fight. Both. You don't, while
you're deejaying, you have to fight.

565
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,470
I am so passionate about it. Wow. Where's
this testo fellow from? I don't know.

566
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,560
It looks like the gay
sweet and fucking hero.

567
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,040
The case was over.
We talked about earlier.

568
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:51,590
That might be the name of a town gay swim.
Now how was I DJ and you're walking,

569
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,510
you're walking around pointing his finger
in your fucking focused and your DJ

570
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,590
that's walking around and clapping.
When did this become entertaining?

571
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:01,760
It's not even entertain it.
I liked the way he moves.

572
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,000
I wish she never would have showed me
this. This is the most awful thing.

573
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,400
Punch them in the files
that you guys are haters.

574
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,740
I like the way that young
man gyrates his hip.

575
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,820
He said Michael that even knew
about it that much. He's not.

576
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,170
He's doing it like some stiff European
move. It's like John Tesh of Dj.

577
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,430
It's like a Saturday night live sketch.

578
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,740
He's exactly the kind
of guy that would that.

579
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,850
Where's that a hardy and fucking worst
or religion Saturday night live should do

580
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:28,330
a sketch about a Dj like that.
It's just fucking stands on stage.

581
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,790
Impresses me with that funds.

582
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,280
That should be just as impressive
as watching them do it.

583
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,840
That might be a funny sketch
man. Why is he there? Well,

584
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:39,650
let's just press play and get out
of their fucking terrible, you know,

585
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,820
dance with us.

586
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,350
You fuck when I know like some of the
best djs in the world like that are my

587
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,360
good friends and to me
and not even just to me,

588
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:50,630
they really are the most talented
guys you'll ever see on turntables.

589
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,080
You when you get onstage. Okay.
And you know, you start your show.

590
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:58,960
Do you have a planned out DJ set or do
you just let the shit flow? Like no,

591
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,300
like, like a real comic. You get on
and you do what works for that room.

592
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,730
Just moving around. We can
do that, right? Yeah. And,

593
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,500
and these other little
fucking prepackaged,

594
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,470
it's a performance thing. It's,
yeah, it's kind of like, you know,

595
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,670
it's a tuning in thing.

596
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,610
So you got it with is on what they're
into and then go with them with,

597
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:17,420
from there.

598
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,000
I mean obviously those people are there
because they want to hear the horse shit

599
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,430
that he's playing. Right,
right. But you know,

600
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,430
he's not really fucking doing anything
but that they couldn't do themselves.

601
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,650
Right.
They could've stayed with your iPhone.

602
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,720
You could probably make those
same songs on your iPhone.

603
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,440
I used to work in factories
and both arguments though.

604
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,810
I used to work in factories and,
and when the machines were going,

605
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:39,080
it would sound exactly the
same and, and, and, and,

606
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,810
and worked in a printing press.
The fucking same noise, dude. Dude.

607
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,160
Dude, dude. Yeah. After
every time it's due.

608
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,370
It's cutting the paper. Yeah, that could,

609
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,140
it's not good if you're
trying to read something.

610
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,770
Maybe we're too old for this shit.
Maybe. Dude. I say that every day now.

611
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,130
Every day I'm like my father
or something. I'm some, some,

612
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,130
I really am becoming that I am everything
I thought I would never be what

613
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:08,030
happens and you know, when you have kids
that's, that's exactly how it goes down.

614
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,080
It's like, oh, I get why everybody's
just grumpy and wants to be left alone.

615
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,860
You know? That's what it is.
You naturally just getting old.

616
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:18,820
You're tired of this nonsense. Like if
you want to hear like really talented Djs,

617
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:23,210
go to Dj's, spin bad.com do
you just spend bed? Phenomenal.

618
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,490
Starting from scratch.
Dj NSFS podcast.

619
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:31,280
I've SFS podcast.com I appreciate that.
When I'm, when I'm out or, uh, look,

620
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:31,881
uh,
you know,

621
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,570
club in Vegas or something like that and
one guy just hits the right songs over

622
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:40,160
and over and over again. It just gets a
good mood going. I know when to expect it.

623
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,900
Like I know if I go to
Vegas and I go to a club,

624
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,510
I'm going to hear the shit that you
hear on the radio that I don't like,

625
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,390
but everybody's having a good
time, so I don't mind that. Okay.

626
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,510
I know I'm not there for me. I'm there
because you know everybody else's.

627
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,540
How does a DJ get to a point
where he can sell concerts?

628
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,380
That's where does that go down?
I have no clue how that works.

629
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,100
But that girl taught guys pretty popular
and he just mashes up other people.

630
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,660
He's the worst too because he has this
program that he uses when he doesn't even

631
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:10,490
have to do shit. Do that every
now and then though. Some songs,

632
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,100
like when they're mashed up
it's like, oh, it's different.

633
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,950
But every now and then there's
one song. It's like, wow,

634
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:19,810
this is better than the original and that
he had the on and on with Biggie. Yeah.

635
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,510
Dude, he's played that start.
You start at the beginning.

636
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,150
Do you ever get a blue eyes mates?
Bedstuy no,

637
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,990
that was Frank Sinatra mixed with biggie.
I was it incredible. What's it called?

638
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,130
What's best and on, on and on. Um, dude,

639
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,230
I heard Frank Sinatra with a
continent don't like them anymore.

640
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,100
You should take picture.
I've read all this shit.

641
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,400
I know shit that's trying to catch
bro. No, the one in here. Oh,

642
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:45,660
and now in the hallway. Although the
one where he's a Mugshot, mugshot,

643
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,140
just read all this stuff about what
an asshole used to be. I was like wow.

644
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,783
It's Kinda,

645
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,240
I kinda used to think it was kind of
cool to like Frank Sinatra because he was

646
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,610
like one of those cool old guy things.
You know,

647
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:59,730
he was in the rat pack but then
you read about like his behavior,

648
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:02,870
like how he used to treat people like
this guy seems like a shithead. Right?

649
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,550
He was a boy. He was kind
of a thug, right? Yeah.

650
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,320
I don't know what the mafia to people
who were shifted was he mobbed up.

651
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,870
I mean I know he was in with the motto.
Was He mob

652
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,880
this one? No. On and
on girl. Talk on and on

653
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,470
girl talk.
Any man that calls himself.

654
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:29,190
Girl talk likes girls so don't
want to talk about girls,

655
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,280
but you know this is it.
Turn this up.

656

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,790
I can hear it right away. Wow. She
that you're still real DJ nerds do.

666
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,300
Wow. That's really impressive. Do to me,

667
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:39,970
this is like a language they don't
understand. They watch. Here you go.

668
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,390
See now at all

669
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,760
like the song, it shifts somewhere in
the middle. I don't like it anymore.

670
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,700
Now there's the house person.
It's the wrong version.

671
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,900
Got Towns the House version.

672
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,380
Try that one in order to
play. There it is. Watch.

673
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,210
You must tune to your base to up.

674
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,153
I've got

675
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,650
no idea what you're talking about.

676
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,430
[inaudible] oh shit.

I don't even here.
There's a break in it coming up.

678
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,610
I'll tell you exactly where
he took it from right here.

679
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,040
This sequence is wow.

680
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,840
The government.

Go to the other side.

684
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,930

685
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,100

686
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,360
Jean Hours. Ah, it was awesome.

687
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,440
That was some amazing shit, dude.
How did you do that? Has so cool.

688
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,240
I'm a music nerd with this shit too. That
was the coolest fucking thing, man. Wow.

689
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:32,170
It's like, dude, you just deciphered
some fucking Mayan Hieroglyphs Joe.

690
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:35,500
And that's why I think we even need to
both by DJ tables and start practicing

691
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:39,160
going are you used record stores and
trying to find cool mascots and kids.

I don't have any fucking time. And get
them involved. Time you come to La,

693
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:46,150
you come to my house? Yeah, we will
throw down. It just looks so fun.

694
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,460
I can't get into anything else.

695
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,750
There's not enough time in the
day for all the shit that I enjoy.

696
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:56,350
Things out that gets you, hurts you and
gets you know, diseases all the time.

697
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,220
Yeah, I'm sick right now. I got
a sick when I was in Montreal.

698
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,150
I haven't been able to train all week.

699
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,040
Instead of watching eight
documentaries a day,

700
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,310
you take two out and take those four
hours and put it towards you don't

701
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:11,050
understand me. You don't understand me.
I'm not a normal person. I'm an obsessive.

702
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:12,480
I have issues.
I okay,

703
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,930
I'm managing my issues and my issues is
I can't get into anything. What's that?

704
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,330
Where are you training? Uh, I don't
want to tell people this facade castle.

705
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,840
I mean curves one of
hug because the curve,

706
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,670
take those fat bitches don't
choke the shit out of him. Um,

707
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,620
been sick all week, man. What's that?
Oh Shit. I forgot to turn my phone off.

708
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,060
Your phone's ringing. And Brian, really?

709
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:38,900
This is like podcast number 750
and look at what kind of gay,

710
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:41,080
I got mastermind hitting me and one of my,

711
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,670
one of my good friends who was a
phenomenal DJ back in any retired

712
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,530
and he had, he hit me with a text
saying, you're a traditional Dj.

713
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,010
Hard to explain the passion in
that nowadays. No, it's not hard.

714
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:57,790
You explained it very well. I don't
think it was hard at all. I get,

715
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,150
I totally get what you're saying would
that guy does is a different thing than

716
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:01,930
when you do,

717
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,470
but what I'm saying is that he's providing
something that all these people enjoy

718
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:08,980
the fuck up. Yeah. That I'm not mad
at. I'm just mad at Paul with Dj.

719
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,650
It's not even the people that are
like, he's the best Dj. I'm like,

720
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,830
it's not a fucking Dj. How dare someone
called my mom is calling you now.

721
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,520
[inaudible] dare you.
Why is my mom calling you?

722
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,400
My voicemail is not set up,
unfortunately. It's fucking Susman.

723
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,050
Chandra, Shandra, unfortunately
ladies and gentlemen.

724
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,513
So,

725
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,143
mmm.

726
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,840
Have you ever Dj and underwater?
You should do that.

727
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,510
It wasn't a time I electrocuted myself.
It's funny,

728
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,760
my dad just got me one of
these things for Christmas.

729
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:48,030
He just sends me a box of miscellaneous
things and it's always tools and stuff

730
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:52,200
and it looks like a pin and it's to
detect if there's any electricity in

731
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:54,600
something. So like if you want to
know, like you're changing an outlet,

732
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,000
you want to know if there's a
debt or if it's still hot or not.

733
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,690
It goes and I'm like thinking, wow, that's
kinda cool. But then I'm thinking, wait,

734
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,260
I've never ever changed or
needed this ever in my life.

735
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,520
So now I'm just like Harry Potter
walking around the house going,

736
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,040
we don't want to look, dude, I've got a
stud finder or want to hang things up.

737
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:14,130
Right. And you move it along. And
also know I w I did carpentry,

738
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,700
I worked as a carpenter's assistant
when I was, when I was a kid.

739
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,530
There are a lot of construction labor
or construction sites, you know,

740
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:21,360
and a lot of it was hammering
nails and shit like that.

741
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,400
But you used to have to tap on things and
listen to the sound of where the studs

742
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:29,130
were. You ready to try to figure it out?
Then you would go away using your years.

743
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,470
Yeah. And then you're find
healing and then you'd find you'd,

744
00:42:31,471 --> 00:42:34,970
you'd measure off 16 inches
really accurate. By the way, the,

745
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,680
was there ever a need to
go past just knocking? Yes.

746
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,940
Because this thing is dope as fuck the
sick as you make more off of the stud.

747
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:42,571
Right. But usually, yeah,

748
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,130
you can catch the center of the Stud
now you get the center. I mean, look, I,

749
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:49,140
I kind of get the idea that what way
we're losing all this, you know, this,

750
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,100
these skills that we used to have but
kind of fucking skills or those, man,

751
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,980
we've got better ways of making
the houses now. Crazy breaks.

752
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:59,190
Those skills are now moving on
to actual jobs. Like pretty soon,

753
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:02,640
that person that used to check you in at
Mcdonald's is going to be gone because

754
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,510
it's the newest stuff going to be in
your robot is a stud finder now for sure.

755
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,820
But I can't reason with a robot though.
So you need,

756
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:10,960
you need human reasoning
involves, yes, you need human.

757
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,710
There's was certainly we're
gonna run out of human jobs.

758
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:16,470
It's going to be a weird thing. I mean
people worried about jobs going overseas.

759
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,710
You've got to worry about jobs
going to robots, you know,

760
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,310
that's the real fear for a lot of,

761
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,950
they get a lot of dumb Jungian
robots that's going to be terrible.

762
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,500
Indian robots will kick your
house. You know, I used to be,

763
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:29,460
I used to work for a company that I
was one of the only Americans of uh,

764
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,380
40 employees, all Indian right off
the boat or an airplane, sorry.

765
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,730
You mean none of them?
None of them spoke English.

766
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:44,020
And my job was to teach
them to be American.

767
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,380
So all they had to do
is just be around me.

768
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,590
And like I would sometimes tell
them to do something here and there,

769
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:52,830
but mostly I felt it was right after
nine, 11, two. And I was like, wow,

770
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,710
why are all these people
here? I, I don't they,

771
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:58,410
I think they're Indian by Indians
that didn't speak English.

772
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:01,980
They're generally of highly educated.
I, they, I mean they did, but very hard.

773
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:06,210
And with, uh, the biggest problem was, is
that a lot of them didn't wear deodorant.

774
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,190
And unfortunately, unfortunately this
room was like 40 of us in this room.

775
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,320
And I was like [inaudible]
that you dated a chick,

776
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:16,740
ones that didn't wear deodorant. Oh yeah,
yeah, no. Oh my God, I've done that.

777
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,010
It's terrible. Awful little.
Yeah. Little Esther. But, uh,

778
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,970
[inaudible] is too,

779
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,740
I don't know if anybody's heard of the
way I had to go cause it got so bad

780
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:29,070
because this room was so packed with so
many employees and it just smelled so

781
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:32,580
bad. I had to go to like, uh, the, the
president of the company. Like, sir,

782
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:34,950
may I please speak to you for
a second and be like, Hey,

783
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:39,090
you know this one guy in general
just really smells really bad.

784
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,940
Like there's a fence. It was
really fun. I know it was, but I,

785
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,800
but I didn't know what to do.

786
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:47,430
I couldn't work anymore when it was
just smelled like a big bio armpit into

787
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,350
everyday.
It got bad.

788
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,710
And so I finally had to break in and tell
him and I felt so bad and he was very

789
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:56,070
understanding. And the next day the
guy comes in like a full suit and tie.

790
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,790
Oh here comes and goes. How
do I smell now? And I'm like,
Oh, I'm sorry. You know,

791
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,580
first of all that God,

792
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,000
that guy's an idiot because he went right
to him and told him that you said it.

793
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,330
That guys sucks.
Whether pregnant slide it in is a Wiki.

794
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,470
Leaker the weirdest thing,

795
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,460
the weirdest thing about this company
is I never understood what that we were

796
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,610
actually doing though. Cause like
they, they didn't any of them,

797
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:19,470
none of them had jobs.
But yet it was like,

798
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,050
I didn't know if we were like
hiding people to like, you know,

799
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:25,290
distribute Indians throughout
the United States or something.

800
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,530
But I had no idea the name of the
company. You will work software, software,

801
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,070
friends, uh, and or something like that.

802
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:35,300
And they made weird things like instead
of Ebay it was called like he buy,

803
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,830
you know, and then, but you go to the
website and knock off websites. Yeah,

804
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,990
it was just knock off tons of knockoff
websites with fucking imported slave

805
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:47,700
labor. There was no like work being
made in every, I need information.

806
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:51,980
They'd be like Goggle it and like, I was
like, I was no work. There was no Google,

807
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,610
there was no real good luck. I just source
if there was no company to this thing,

808
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:57,870
it was just like what?
Whoa.

809
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,990
It was like a fake software company
and I was supposed to be like the lead

810
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,500
programmer designer and I like made
one website, interior mail for them,

811
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,390
something software friends or
something like that. Again,

812
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,270
you wonder how many dudes or Bernie Madoff
in it. So I'm like, I know Hoe. Yeah,

813
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,230
exactly.
Yeah.

814
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,770
I wonder how many people who run
businesses or like Bernie Madoff in it.

815
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,300
I wonder how many people are out there.
Just fucking totally scamming people.

816
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,530
It had to be a scam of some sort.
And it was funny because not too,

817
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,720
wasn't saying terrorism.

818
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,390
It was two months after nine 11 I got
this job or something like that and I,

819
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,370
I the whole time I'm thinking something's
not right here with this United States,

820
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,600
this,
this company right here.

821
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:36,600
There's something going on here and
some of it's being edited or paranoid,

822
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,180
you know,
like America Go America,

823
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:42,210
we've got to get these terrorists
and stuff and this seemed like, like,

824
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,070
like the weirdest thing ever told us to
Alex Jones who have some fucking reason

825
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:51,630
behind it. What state was
this in? Columbus, Ohio.
That'll do it. Henderson road.

826
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,740
Wow. It's still there and actually changed
the name of Scott software friends,

827
00:46:55,741 --> 00:47:00,330
but the home of [inaudible] crazy man.
Hey,

828
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:01,860
I'm by the way, since we're on it, right.

829
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,580
I think you should punch up
a biggie and Sinatra. Yeah,

830
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,250
I think Joe would really likes,
I think you guys are both like this.

831
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,840
What was the name of the mix
would you say? It was called.

832
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,280
It's like you want to go into
the off garden in the ghetto.

833
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,200
There you go. Try that
one. You might like this.

834
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,480
Oh, that's what I wanted to talk about.
This guy, we were talking about scams.

835
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,680
There was a guy named, uh,
you know what Gambola is the,

836
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,020
the Porsche modification company.
Okay. Have you heard of them before?

837
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,280
Yeah, they're like really famous
because they take like these crazy cars.

838
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:38,281
A Carrera gt is like a $400,000 car and
they take it and they make this extreme

839
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:41,940
moms when they make it like they
make the body kit looked different,

840
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,850
put like insane amounts of horsepower
on it. This guy was crazy and he's like,

841
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,770
did the wild shit, the cars,
1000 horsepower, 650 horsepower,

842
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:51,880
twin turbos and shit.

843
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,970
And apparently it was like ripping
people off left and right. And uh,

844
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,620
he went on a trip and someone picked
him up. It was like a business trip.

845
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,570
Someone picked him up at the
airport and just jacked him.

846
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,130
They just fucking handcuffed him and
shot him in the back of the head.

847
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,960
They made him call his wife and, and
try to get them to uh, send money,

848
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:11,620
send a million euros and the guy
only spoke English so he made his,

849
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,950
he called his wife in English and he's
talking to his family in English so they

850
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:16,200
knew something was wrong,
you know,

851
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,270
cause he speaks German so
then the guy just disappears.

852
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,920
Nobody knows where the fuck you went.
Nothing.

853
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:24,070
No one knows what happened and then
months later they find his bottle was

854
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:27,010
dangerous to rob rich people cause they're
always a little crazier about their

855
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:29,260
money. Yeah. It's a
crazy story though, man.

856
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,810
This guy was just trying to
fuck everybody. Just, you know,

857
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,980
just like you had one car and three
people that a paid for it, you know,

858
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:39,340
it's sold it to three people who's
making it the same card, you know,

859
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,860
was just going to fuck
them. You know, and I pay,

860
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:46,690
I guess he did it to the wrong dude or
something. Probably some Russian dude.

861
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:47,524
Crazy man.

862
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,150
People get 90 when it comes to money.
Man, I don't have to tell you that. Right?

863
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,680
Yeah. I mean, I, I've never been money
driven, so I'm kinda happy about that.

864
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,280
That's the best way to things I do. The
things I love to do. That's why I like,

865
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,290
yeah,
you're right.

866
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,330
Laid back dude man. You know, as for,

867
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:06,480
especially for a guy who's successful
as you are, as far as like, you know,

868
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:10,020
you're the same with you. Stand up.
Yeah. But there is, it's rare, right?

869
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:10,920
There's not a lot of us.

870
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,730
Yeah. A lot of people you would think, oh,

871
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:15,670
that person's going to be a
little douchey buddy. Yeah.

872
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,730
I mean it's the most disappointing
thing when they are right. Yeah.

873
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,250
You're always like, ah, but it's one
of the coolest things when they aren't,

874
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,420
you know, when someone has gone
through some, I was situated,

875
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:28,300
Saturday was the first time I met Dana.
Oh really? And he was really fucking cool.

876
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,730
He's so down to Earth, man. I thought
he was going to be [inaudible]. No,

877
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,740
not at all, man. I was like,
wow. He didn't like, you know,

878
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:38,650
just meet me and walk
away was he was engaging.

879
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:42,170
And it was very cool and I was like, fuck
that. He's in the moment for real. Yeah.

880
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,450
It's a real business, you know? Yeah.
So I can't be running the business side.

881
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,660
I was very pleasantly surprised by him.
My nose is stuffy.

882
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:53,420
I'm going to have to blow it too much
through the Eritrea lights already, Joe.

883
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:54,863
I like that

884
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:55,840
slurry buddy.

885
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Miles give a warm round of applause
for the notorious sorry is God.

886
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,263
See

887
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,850
that was all a dream.

888
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:14,180
I used to read [inaudible] my ball
that we saw Mr Magic Marlin Mall.

889
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,980
I'll let [inaudible] had the red and
black lumberjack put the hat to match.

890
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,610
We'll number freshman the
hotdog and number four.

891
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,430
The dit would take it this fall,
that woman,

892
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,190
the lime light because the trade

893
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,230
[inaudible] number one,
I used to eat sardines for Canada East.

894
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,130
The broad Lucy be tick to free mass.
The flex love bugs figures can best.

895
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,210
I'm blowing homo special number.
Same Bush.

896
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:55,640
Not that many dudes
that just had everything

897
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,470
fucking rhyme. Just had that certain
beat that made your head move. Yep.

898
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,020
There's a lot of guys and I
liked their lyrics. It's good.

899
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,970
I see what you're doing. I
like it. Yeah, it's good.

900
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:07,040
But see the only guy you can take as
acapellas and put it over any beat.

901
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:10,840
And it sounds like he knew that
beat was playing. Yeah. Yeah.

902
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,420
Amazing.
I like that.

903
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,300
But I am sick of that song.
So do you do shows where you Dj,

904
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:21,820
do you let me now that you're a
famous comedian, do you ever do that?

905
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:24,880
Like should know, I have two djs on stage
with me when I'm performing. Oh you do?

906
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,960
Wow. Really? I have DJ Spinn bed and
starting from scratch. That's, that's bad.

907
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:29,980
And then they uh,

908
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,790
they play on four turntables tables and
one place instrumentals in one place.

909
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,400
Acapella isn't there. Fucking
incredible. And how do you do that?

910
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:39,670
Do you have them do it before? They do
it before the show as the warm up. Right.

911
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,850
And then I have a comment
come out and then that is bad.

912
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,100
And they play and then they played
the audience out on the way out.

913
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,770
Cause the big venues. Right,
right. That's awesome man.

914
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,450
What is the comedy Cnm
Canada like right now? Is,

915
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,720
is there a lot of come from Toronto?
I'm from Toronto.

916
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,770
I'm excited about April buddy.
Yeah.

917
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,070
It's going to be Craig
common all over the place.

918
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,500
What would you started off in Canada?

919
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,270
Toronto was 89 was that hard to start
off in Canada or in 19 and you don't know

920
00:52:05,471 --> 00:52:08,290
what you know, you have nothing
to compare it to. Right, right.

921
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,590
Or that there's a good scene
in Canada. Right. As far as,
especially Toronto. Right.

922
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:14,430
Toronto was a real good comedy scene
in Vancouver does as well, right? Yeah.

923
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,090
I think all of Canada,
I mean,

924
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,420
they're always a little gems come out of
all these little pockets of Canada and

925
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:22,210
we have to work harder
because the audiences are a
little more stiff out there.

926
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,830
Really. They're very loving and they,
and they, and they love you to death,

927
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:29,800
but you still got to earn their laughs.
Really?

928
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,480
I find that in Canada it's almost
more of a, look, we've paid money.

929
00:52:34,481 --> 00:52:39,460
You better be fucking good.
Wow. Maybe charge it to me
and they stare at, you know,

930
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,310
I'm talking about back in the
club days. That's funny. Yeah.

931
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:43,960
When you start now out, man, it's a,

932
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,750
when there's a huge difference between
people that come out to see you when they

933
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:49,330
know who you are. Yeah. And someone
who's just coming to a comedy show,

934
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:52,750
you get a little leeway then you know
you can do a little jokes that you would

935
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:54,580
never have done before.
Yeah.

936
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:57,710
And you know that they liked your
sense of humor too. You know,

937
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,490
like when someone doesn't know your sense
of humor and does know how you think

938
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:02,830
and then they come to a show and
it's like, you know, when you,

939
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,740
when you first start out,
they're just coming to see,

940
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:08,380
looks like no one ever goes to a club
that says live music and you know,

941
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:11,950
your [inaudible] golf, hoping that that's
what you get. You know what I mean?

942
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,760
But with comedy man, you know, there's a
lot of people that come to a comedy show,

943
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,450
they don't know what the
fuck they're getting.

944
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,900
They can get Barry
Manilow or guns and roses.

945
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:22,750
They don't know what they're getting.
It's true though. It's tricky.

946
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,980
It's the surprise bag of comedy.
Yeah, totally. That's why

947
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,890
when someone, you know, it's
like, like this weird music
on the Internet, you know,

948
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:32,820
and it's like you got to find what you
like and just there's one, I got this one,

949
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,460
you know it's true.
And then that's,

950
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:40,650
that becomes a problem in some areas
when one guy has one successful style of

951
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:44,580
performing and then you see all the people
around them sort of like mimic it and

952
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:49,581
morph into it like a Dave Attell type
thing like David tell has is so specific

953
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:54,570
way of talking. So catchy. I love Dave
fucking awesome. He's a great guy.

954
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:58,140
He made like a billion babies.
Billion clones.

955
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,010
The Mitch Hedberg did that
too, right? Yes. Mitch Hedberg.

956
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:04,860
Mitch Hedberg came out with this fresh
style and then you hear a lot of guys

957
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:07,740
sounding like so like it
because it was so fun to do.

958
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,470
I'm cracking the coconut water.
You mother fucker.

959
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,560
Oh c two oh coconut water
sent me a bunch of this shit.

960
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,200
I ain't never heard about us Taco.
I gotta get you some Dank,

961
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,830
so thank you very much. My friends, she
to see two oh coconut waters, the shit.

962
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:23,870
If you've never had it before. I
become addicted to this stuff. Um,

963
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,340
and people giving me shit about
getting sick, like hit. Yo.

964
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:29,640
What about your probiotics? Man, I
haven't been sick in three years.

965
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,600
The first time I've been sick,
but coincidentally his,

966
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,230
my fucking conspiracy theory, I slacked
off on the acidophilus. That was my fault.

967
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,300
But what I didn't slack
off on was the Kombucha.

968
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:42,660
I was drinking a lot of
Kombucha, but gts, Kombucha,

969
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,750
they got kicked off the shelves.
They were in the shelves at whole foods.

970
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:49,740
They got kicked off because they had
more than one half of 1% alcohol because

971
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,350
the mushroom ferments when it's inside
those things. And if you, you know,

972
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:55,560
it stays in the crates for too long
or if it doesn't get cold enough,

973
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,440
they think continues to ferment
and it gets stronger and stronger.

974
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,390
So it gets over one half of 1% but
whatever the fuck they did to keep it from

975
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:06,840
fermenting when it's sitting in the cases,
they watered down the flavor.

976
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:07,890
It's like really watery.

977
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:10,350
It's a totally different flavor
and it doesn't feel the same.

978
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:12,600
It doesn't feel like it has the
same health benefits either.

979
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,860
So I think I'm eating dead Kombucha.
I'm think I'm drinking some funk Shit,

980
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,320
mother fucker. That's why you're sick
now after you've been licking toilet.

981
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,670
Don't lick them, Bro. I don't like them,

982
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,410
but I do sit on them and
I really think twice.

983
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,040
Figure what the fuck it's going to.
You don't even put the paper down.

984
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,230
Just wipe them off.
Wow.

985
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,850
I still have not broken that
level of crazy psychological shit.

986
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,570
Think he'd get home, he'd take a shower.
You're going to be okay? I don't think so.

987
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,153
Hmm.

988
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,130
I always pee on the seat when I leave.
Just piss all over it to leave my mark.

989
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,800
Let them know you were there. Don't
let him know. No, I don't do that.

990
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,540
I always cleaned the seat.
If I piss on it,

991
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,170
don't you know I try to broaden that for
a Fab Multivitamin, Pete, and I'm like,

992
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,100
look, there's only so much
of this multivitamin, peas,
they give you away, man.

993
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,980
When people know you're healthy and they
see your page, they know it's yours.

994
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,900
That fluorescent orange shit splattered
all over the seat. Yeah. Like look at you.

995
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,680
You healthy lazy. Looks like you're
checking and fuck lava lamp when I piss.

996
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,160
Yeah. Someone else paying
on you is not good. Um,

997
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,830
let's just as a general rule,

998
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:18,893
hmm.

999
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,230
I'm reading people's tweets while I'm
talking to you. That's always a bad move.

1000
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,190
Is that cause those
motherfuckers want attention.

1001
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,080
That's true.
To start going off on you.

1002
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:32,290
They're saying props for me for calling
out yesto on being a fake ass DJ. Wow.

1003
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,040
Well, when you start a fight with
anybody, I've found in this world,

1004
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,860
when you start a fight with anybody,

1005
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,810
there's always going to be a bunch
of people that want to join in.

1006
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,060
It doesn't matter.
Even if you're right,

1007
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,610
it's like there's always a sa you
could be totally wrong and there's no,

1008
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:49,810
he's going to be like,
I got a million fucking people.

1009
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,260
You know that that were mad at me for
the whole Carlsmith see a thing that

1010
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:54,580
didn't see it for the way I saw it.

1011
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,190
And there's always going to be
people who are idiots. You know,

1012
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:59,200
there's always going to be
people who don't agree with you,

1013
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,710
but there's always also going to be
people that just want to fight about shit.

1014
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,470
So if you know, if you're going
after d JTS still, they'll look.

1015
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:06,221
You have fuck them.

1016
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:10,570
I hope fucking carful of AIDS
runs into them like people.

1017
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,180
People just will start
getting angry, man, if you,

1018
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,400
if you fucking hate somebody to get mad,
they're like too,

1019
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,360
I got duped into liking him. So fuck you.
And they're like bond with you, dude.

1020
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,550
Thank God you fucking said that.

1021
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,650
That guy could suck a fucking
million ranted decks. Whoa, Bro.

1022
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,760
I don't think it's d. Jts so that's the
problem. I think we need to sit down.

1023
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,180
You need to find out where your anger is
coming from. I need to get a group hug.

1024
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,120
So check this out.
You know,

1025
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:40,230
you heard about Miley Cyrus doing Salvia
and everything like that right? Now,

1026
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,160
imagine, uh, this something
happened to me with you recently.

1027
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,090
I realized how easy this is. So this is
a tip. If you have an iPhone. All right,

1028
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,120
everyone, tip iPhone. Um,

1029
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,200
if you have an iPhone and you plug it
into somebody's laptop to charge it,

1030
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,780
and if it's not locked,
meaning like if you're using it,

1031
00:57:57,781 --> 00:58:00,660
checking your text messages while
you're charging on somebody's laptop,

1032
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,720
they open I photo.
They can take all your photos,

1033
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:05,200
all your videos off your computer.

1034
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,820
I know off your computer
without you even knowing it.

1035
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,750
And so that is a perfect
example. Like Miley Cyrus, oh,

1036
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:15,600
my friend took a photo or a video,
you know,

1037
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,400
I'm going to use your laptop to charge
Bam. You got all of Miley Cyrus's videos,

1038
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,760
Salvia.
So that's a tip.

1039
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,880
If you're ever plugging in your
iPod or iPhone into a laptop,

1040
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,800
just make sure you're checking them.

1041
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,150
They're still plugging in your
phone that way to charge it.

1042
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,960
And you're a fucking retard. You're
at somebody's house like, Hey,

1043
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:33,870
do you have a charger? Oh, you can plug
it into my laptop. You know, I mean,

1044
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,990
that does charge it up. Right. Does
it charge it up as fast though?

1045
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,730
He's a USB port.
Just

1046
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,420
missed some calls. Right. Wow.

1047
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:46,280
In the car that's confident in old school.

1048
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,530
I don't need this. Yeah, I
can put this down. Do you,

1049
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,600
do you ever get the sense if you leave
your phone at home, you ever do that?

1050
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,300
And I got a little freaked
out. Yeah. What's up with that?

1051
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,880
I have nothing to hide in that
phone, but I get freaked out. Yeah.

1052
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,280
I don't want people answering
my God damn calls. Absolutely.

1053
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,560
I don't want to be disconnected either.
That's true.

1054
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,700
I will turn around and go home.
Yeah. Most of the time. Less I,

1055
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,230
if I'm on my way out the door to a flight
and I was halfway to the airport and I

1056
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:15,170
knew I would miss the flight. If I turned
around, I might have to turn around.

1057
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,290
Well, if I'm leaving town, fucking
I missing, what am I going to do?

1058
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:21,740
I'm going to fucking not have my phone.
I'm going to be in Cincinnati, no phone,

1059
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,760
no fuck.

1060
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,480
And then I go wait for somebody to Fedex
it to me or I'm going to go to seven 11

1061
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:30,430
and buy some phone there. You don't
know anybody's phone numbers anymore.

1062
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,540
I don't know anybody's phone numbers.
Well you do have,

1063
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,720
you have a mobile me service then you
just go online and any have your contact

1064
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:40,160
phone. Yeah. Well that is a
lot of one. You probably have
an iPhone by now. No, no.

1065
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,173
What are you on?

1066
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,810
Well I use a blackberry from a main
phone cause I liked the whole software

1067
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:49,250
better. I like, it's not as good
for sure. It gets stuck sometimes.

1068
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,750
Sometimes we're, it gets
weirded out. Sometimes it rock
shows up. Yeah, I have one.

1069
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,740
Sometimes the reboots out of nowhere.
But when you're using it,

1070
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,410
but when you're using it like,

1071
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,260
like what to answer emails or to
answer phone calls or to forward texts.

1072
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,230
Sort of doing anything for twittering
to, yeah. I don't like it for twittering.

1073
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,390
I like iPhone is better. I
think, what would I like?

1074
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,340
Iphone four I think it's a great internet
device, but the phone is dog shit.

1075
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,380
The phone, like service in, in, in uh,

1076
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:21,050
America with 18 t is so fucking Dante's
horrible. There's one can't do it.

1077
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,890
So I need Verizon and I need a phone
that's going to work when I'm on the road

1078
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,490
and I'm in other countries too.

1079
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:31,350
So January I found most likely and
then hopefully send them. Yeah.

1080
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,960
And pretty soon I don't think
blackberries going to last much longer.

1081
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:38,960
I think they're just going to become
an APP on an iPhone saying, yeah,

1082
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:41,480
you're going to have your blackberry
app so you can get used to the way that

1083
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:44,170
blackberry operating system.
You don't see your, sorry,

1084
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,800
lasting long apple friendly.

1085
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,690
I mean I'm talking about
android and fucking iPhones
that that shit's destroying

1086
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,690
all the other guys. Look at
pom poms. Thank you Riley.

1087
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,530
And I think blackberries still is a
black percentage of the market. Yeah,

1088
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:01,670
blackberry owns the business
world. Yeah. Until it's a windows.

1089
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:05,680
He would think that it would die off, but
it never will. When you see the first,

1090
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,900
when you first got into Mac and I'm
like, my God, this is so much better.

1091
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,840
Why would anybody have
viruses and registry hacks
and bullshit and fucking the

1092
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,490
pop up windows that eat
all your computer up,

1093
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:21,510
but you know from using the blackberry
how fucking annoying. So I no,

1094
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,140
no, it's a new, first of all,
the new operating system.

1095
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:27,350
You haven't used it in a long time.
I used the new one. What's her face?

1096
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,370
Is this the torch? The torch? I haven't
used the tour. What's that for it,

1097
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,420
but I have a new curve.

1098
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:36,050
The one with the flat track pad
there has never a ball has attracted.

1099
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,460
I like it man. I like torches like
an iPhone and a blackberry combined,

1100
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:43,800
so it's like the touch. It's all
touch screen. Like if I just had it,

1101
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,560
it's got one device. I might have to
order the iPhone if I on one device.

1102
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,400
Bell Mobility in Canada gave it to me.
If I could only have Canadian,

1103
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:53,500
that's why I don't know what this,

1104
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,440
if I had to use that as actually now
that you don't know about the torch,

1105
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,720
that's the new one. No, I don't. Yeah.

1106
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,460
The last thing I saw that was a
touch screen was the storm too,

1107
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:03,560
which was a piece of shit.
Yeah, that was a piece of shit.

1108
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,560
If I had to use only one phone,
I would pick the iPhone.

1109
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:10,520
But to use two is better because this
way you don't eat up your battery on your

1110
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:14,590
main phone cause I like to fuck around
with the eyes. Morphe packs, man.

1111
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,440
Those are gross. Someone that's carry
some extra ass battery. Some girl,

1112
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,070
I had had it the other day,
I saw

1113
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,960
it and I played with it. It's not bad.
You'd get used to it. Sure. It sucks.

1114
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:27,190
Giant brick that stuck on the mat as
bad as it used to be on the new iPhone.

1115
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,170
The iPhone four piggyback battery.
Yeah.

1116
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,850
Well it's kind of built into the
case so it looks [inaudible].

1117
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,440
No, it's this one's more features and
going back to the old days when you had a

1118
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:40,810
suitcase for a fucking cell phone
that's we're going to go back to,

1119
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,150
we're going to go back to you.

1120
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:45,190
You're going to need so much power to
do what you need your cell phone to do

1121
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,520
because of cell phones. Processors are
going to so far exceed battery life.

1122
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,910
You're going to be walking
around with like a suitcase nuke,

1123
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,510
like a fucking a giant ass battery
that's like a car battery on a handle.

1124
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,610
It's going to be attached to your phone
and your phone's going to be able to

1125
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:01,570
time travel. That's what's
going to happen. Russell and
my assistant has the evo.

1126
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,230
Oh yeah. That giant fucking
phone. Super battery killer.

1127
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:10,390
Oh my God. We've been making fun of him
for that one forever. Beard, Huh? Yeah.

1128
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,810
It looks like you're, uh,
you're, you're my Mac Imac,

1129
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,720
but it's cool if you want to watch a
movie on your phone. Yeah. But yeah,

1130
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,390
as a battery, the battery so horrible
that he has this giant fucking battery.

1131
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:23,790
It looks like he's walking
around with this thing. Yeah,

1132
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:24,760
that's what I'm talking about.

1133
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:28,240
That's what we're going to go into
the retard gallery. That's actually,

1134
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:33,070
it's connected to the wall and it sends
a wireless signal out to your phone and

1135
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:33,970
keeps it charged.

1136
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,360
I think projectors are going to become
a lot bigger in the future where they're

1137
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:40,390
going to be so bright and powerful coming
from your little phone that you could

1138
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:42,370
actually just make your
own screen anywhere.

1139
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:46,810
So we're going to have like a razor
phone with like the Xbox connect style

1140
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,760
projection,
wherever you want to

1141
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,280
see Olivia,
Nikola Tesla.

1142
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:54,360
If they had just listened to him and
just let him let him work his magic,

1143
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,450
we would all have wireless electricity
now and then we wouldn't have any of

1144
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:01,250
these battery issues. There'd be
electricity in the air. Oh yeah, I know,

1145
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,850
but talk nuts.

1146
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,860
You've seen that new application that
was just released called something like,

1147
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:06,880
what was it called,
Joe?

1148
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:10,810
The seaward applications words C or
something like that where you just point

1149
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:12,040
your word.
I'll check it out.

1150
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:15,670
You point your phone at any like say like
you're overseas and there's like some

1151
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:18,550
writing on the wall that you can't
understand it in a different language.

1152
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:20,890
Just point your phone at it
and it looks like a camera,

1153
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,070
but it translates it and puts it
into whatever you're looking at.

1154
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:28,390
It's almost like urban spoon. Yeah. What
did you just point your phone? Oh yeah.

1155
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:31,050
Direction. And it tells you where a
restaurant is, right? Right, exactly.

1156
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,750
Just this instant translates
anything. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

1157
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,640
It detects the translation and change it
clear. It is. It's called a word Lens.

1158
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:42,390
Word Lens. Really Pretty
fucking crazy. It's a,

1159
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:45,820
you look at it like through the camera
and the camera reads it and translates it

1160
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:50,190
on the screen. It's ridiculous. It's a
free APP. No, I think it's like, yeah,

1161
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,730
it's free as a free native
language packs that costs like,

1162
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,030
like if you wanted a different language,
it's like five bucks or so.

1163
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:57,580
That makes sense. That's
smart. By the way, by the way,

1164
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:01,510
if you are playing video games
on your iPad or iPhone right now,

1165
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:06,400
he a has all their games for 99 cents
so a lot of these games are like $12 for

1166
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:09,700
your iPad or iPhone or 99 cents right now.
So really for how long?

1167
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,990
Till through Christmas. And they have
like sin city deluxe in like Madden,

1168
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:17,860
which is like $13 usually on the iPad.
It's 99 cents. Right. So jump on it.

1169
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,420
So what, what is this like a promotion?
Yeah. Yay. Yay. Christmas sale. So wow.

1170
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,440
So a lot of these games,

1171
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,650
if I'm mad download like five games last
night and it costs me $5 and they would

1172
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,680
normally cost me like 50 or something.
What does a game cost?

1173
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:31,780
Like if you go to bio or call
of duty or something like that,

1174
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:33,990
what are they called for? Like
Xbox and stuff. It's like uh,

1175
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:38,360
anywhere from four 59 to 69 new.
Are you shitting me? Yeah. God,

1176
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,900
they used to be what? Like 39. So yeah.

1177
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:44,200
But I'm thinking about back in the day
when I was a kid and fucking Atari Games,

1178
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,660
I never was really an Atari kid. I
never had it, but I remember them. Yeah.

1179
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,381
My parents bought me,

1180
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:55,381
the bootleg system was called the Cam on
one from Sears and fucking Atari game.

1181
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:58,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even back then,
like what? Like how many people,

1182
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,610
like you talk about
teams that people get on,

1183
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:05,611
how many people were like Sony playstation
or Xbox three and they'll like argue

1184
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:09,670
back and forth and a police station
soaks and it's fucking, well,

1185
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:14,370
back in the day I was a tare versus
colecovision. Yeah. Ended up versus Sega.

1186
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:17,430
There has to be a competition
or it would suck. It's not just,

1187
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,520
it has to be competition.

1188
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:22,350
It says everyone has to pick a fucking
side and stick with it, you know? Yeah.

1189
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,420
Nobody can go, this is better on yours,
but this is better on mine. Yeah.

1190
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,250
Nobody's like that reasonable.
No.

1191
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:30,520
Everybody wants to be with the right cell
phone carrier to you ever noticed that?

1192
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:34,720
You know, if like you have Verizon
rights, fucking Verizon's a shit, right?

1193
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,660
All these idiots out there in 18 to,
what the fuck are you doing?

1194
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,350
Like they're like, want to join you
in on some fucking Verizon clan?

1195
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,360
You like sprint. Are you
with sprint? Sprint's good.

1196
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:48,190
We're sprint were sprint bros creates
cricket. You're going to get cricket.

1197
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,220
You're going to lie. There was a bunch
of those little companies, right.

1198
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,700
You know what bugs me the
most? Those metro pcs bucking
commercials. Oh yeah, yeah.

1199
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:58,090
The commercial racist commercials in
the history of prices. Commercials.

1200
01:06:58,091 --> 01:07:01,270
You know what the fuck man. Somebody,
if I ever meet those Indian boys,

1201
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:06,040
I'm slapping them in their face
trying to wake him up. Wake him up.

1202
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,960
What the fuck are you doing to,

1203
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:11,350
they sold us a commercial play it
or you've never seen the metro pcs?

1204
01:07:11,351 --> 01:07:13,850
I haven't seen it, but I think
people should know metro pieces.

1205
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,740
There are hard here. They are horrible
people in Canada. Don't know them.

1206
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:21,240
I don't think mobile
ones are brutal to you.

1207
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,740
Remember the boost mobile ones were
dudes would be like, where are you at?

1208
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,560
Oh yeah, yeah. That was the question.

1209
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:33,380
Let me give you the down low on the no,
whoa,

1210
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:38,520
sweet. Totally money. ECS is
offering unlimited talk text in bed.

1211
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,050
Just trying to be crazy.

1212
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,640
If this can be through Chad maybe.

1213
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:53,420
Okay. But this is obviously on pure
common, unlimited nationwide to authors.

1214
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,210
There's like a couple of them that are
okay little. This drives you nuts. Yeah.

1215
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,910
But,
but if you made those characters on stage,

1216
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,420
it wouldn't drive anybody nuts
because they're saying it's a parody.

1217
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:08,170
They're not actually used to sell
any. This is like one time, it's fine.

1218
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:10,480
You know what I mean? Like I understand
that they're selling something,

1219
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:12,220
but there's selling something with comedy,
right.

1220
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,190
They're trying to be funny there.
That's, that's not, it's such a poor,

1221
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,740
it bothers me. Get that.
And the fact that like,

1222
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:23,180
these guys don't ever win the, uh, like
I'm always about the underdog. This,

1223
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,040
so those would be the
underdogs in the commercial.

1224
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:29,420
I think it would be funnier if they
won. Like whatever it is, they're,

1225
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,360
the joke is, you know, okay, I
see what you're saying. So they,

1226
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:36,140
they end up being the brunt and then they
end up being the fucking brunt again.

1227
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,320
And they keep on being the
brand over and over and over.

1228
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,730
Like when they have like
this big fat chicken,

1229
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:43,820
one of the other commercials
to show 90% coverage.

1230
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,880
This guy's looking at her like,
Ooh. And I'm like, seriously, dude,

1231
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,510
are you fucking kidding me? I see what
you're saying. I see what you're saying,

1232
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,440
that it's not clever and it's kind of
mean spirited. Yeah. It's just like, Huh,

1233
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,270
look what we've done. Yeah. How
obvious. Right? Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1234
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,030
My cell phone calls,

1235
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:08,230
keep dropping if you had handy is
into it and you will find a problem.

1236
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,540
A sneaked out among all of these glimpses.

1237
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:14,530
Snake like an ice lollies.
I just laughed.

1238
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:18,010
I assume you're on the
[inaudible] network.

1239
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,760
Get Metro pcs and you'll be talking smack
on three g but nationwide coverage in

1240
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:25,900
over 11,000 cities and towns $40
I'm sorry man. Let Shit's funny.

1241
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,760
I don't give a fuck what you say, but you
know it's not funny. It's the value yet

1242
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,500
metro pcs is giving us too.

1243
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,310
We just had that nonsequitor with the
fucking snake charmer. That made me laugh,

1244
01:09:35,311 --> 01:09:38,740
man. Well, there you go. It's
fart jokes for Indian people soon.

1245
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:41,790
It's not brilliant because they're
just trying to sell some bullshit.

1246
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,660
I think they just made them
look so fucking stereotypical.

1247
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:49,150
What would you do though differently?
How would you make it different if you,

1248
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:51,780
if you had that scenario,
give them the Mexican accents.

1249
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:55,480
Okay.

1250
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,250
I would've picked really area looking
people and then giving them an idea.

1251
01:09:58,251 --> 01:09:59,350
You can always make it

1252
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,400
Nazi's. There's no one
around to stand up for Nazis.

1253
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:07,020
Nazis will be on the shit list for a
hundred years until the next group of

1254
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:09,330
fucking psychopaths comes
along. You know, it's like,

1255
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,930
I bet for the longest time Nazi
jokes were Roman jokes. You know,

1256
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,280
I'd be shitting on the Romans. Right. But
you try a Roman joke today and nobody,

1257
01:10:17,281 --> 01:10:20,360
you know, what? Are you a fucking Roman?
Yeah. No. Like what are you saying?

1258
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:24,450
There's nothing, but you hit
them with, what are you a
fucking Nazi? It's like, oh,

1259
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:28,800
that shit's still valid. That's a
good one. You zinged me. You know,

1260
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,080
I mentioned one time
they used to say that.

1261
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:35,140
What are you a fucking Roman kind
of Roman are you? What do you have?

1262
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:41,100
That was actually an insult from
the movie. The Hustler, the movie,

1263
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:45,690
the Hustler Piper. Laurie says to
a Bert, fuck, what is his name?

1264
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,160
The very famous actor
that died a long time.

1265
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:52,370
The hustler that Paul wasn't Paul Newman,
but it was, uh, the guy who played birth,

1266
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,320
fuck, I can't remember his name.
Anyway, she goes, y'all realm, but

1267
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:01,540
it's maybe in the 70s, Nazi. He
was in the, as it was in the 60s,

1268
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:05,420
so it was 1963. I believe that
all of that movie, you know,

1269
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,890
60 or 63. I don't remember. I should,

1270
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,610
I should look it up so
I don't give anybody any
misinformation and I should look

1271
01:11:11,611 --> 01:11:13,990
it up just cause I should need
to know the name of the, uh,

1272
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,970
the dude was an amazing actor.
It was it.

1273
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:19,370
So somebody like, can you guys talk
about something worthwhile? Wikileaks,

1274
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:23,240
perhaps you missed it already.
Stupid know about you. Twats

1275
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,710
I like, I like, I read the trade,

1276
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,950
the twitters now because people
are like sound looking into it.

1277
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,940
Like we're going to be the fucking reason
that there's a change in the world.

1278
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:37,400
George, see Scott, ah, George T.

1279
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,160
Scott Patton and she and
he played pattern, right?

1280
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,590
Yes. Yes. Piper. Laurie
says he already Roman Burt.

1281
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,030
You know it's her way of saying
you're a Nazi, like you piece of shit.

1282
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,370
He was pimping her.
I think he bone or two as well.

1283
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,860
It's pretty disappointing with these
early reviews of Ciaran. Oh man,

1284
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:57,620
no one's gonna see it tonight.
And somebody made a great point though.

1285
01:11:57,621 --> 01:12:01,370
It's like if Disney was going to
have a rave, would you go to it?

1286
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:05,870
What'd you think? It was good. I would
go to it. Hi Izzy. Right. But Jesus,

1287
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:09,500
if Disney Henry. Oh, come on man.
Ray would be fun. Even if you were,

1288
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,350
if it was a Disney rate, it'll be
fun. I don't know. Disney rave.

1289
01:12:12,351 --> 01:12:13,730
If you were super baked it.

1290
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:17,240
One thing to note though is I don't think
I was a huge fan of tron growing up.

1291
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:19,760
I think I was fan of the video game.
I don't think I'd like the movie was,

1292
01:12:19,761 --> 01:12:22,040
I didn't know what the video game did.
You didn't,

1293
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,830
you can just like the way it looked.
Yeah. I'd go into the arcade,

1294
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:29,120
look at the game, and I go,
cool. Yeah, the fuck does it do.

1295
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,030
How do you play this game?

1296
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:32,690
And that's kind of like the movie
kind of was a trick back then.

1297
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:36,080
It was like computers were mysterious
and weird and that's why I think I

1298
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:39,650
remember like that movie. But if you
really try to watch that movie, it's suck.

1299
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:44,150
Yeah. I ever wanted to see
trial. I'm not a shy guy,

1300
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,940
so I never wanted to see tron now or then.

1301
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:51,000
Altered states is one of
the most influential movies
on my life because of the

1302
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:54,380
fact that it got me in a sensory
deprivation tanks and I started, you know,

1303
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,710
tripping in those things. But I tried
watching it a few years back. Right.

1304
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,580
It's terrible.

1305
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,860
Yeah.
I remember the commercial for that.

1306
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:05,750
It was the guy with the movie
things on them. Yeah. Well he's uh,

1307
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,580
he was looking at the,
what happened

1308
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:13,000
was he went to like Peru or South America
or something. He takes this Iowasca,

1309
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,480
he drinks it and then he gets in his
isolation tank and he starts tripping and

1310
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:19,990
having these fucking incredible
experiences and it starts
turning them back into

1311
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:23,980
a cave man, turning them back
into some wild monkey man.
And he wants up, you know,

1312
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:28,540
running around killing people.
It looks so stupid. Oh my God.

1313
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:33,390
It's like unbearably thumb. You know,
you just, you just forget, you know,

1314
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,720
you forget.
Yeah.

1315
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:40,170
Or the also like he start realizing
special effects and and dom were a lot

1316
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:45,340
smarter now back then. It's
still the total evidence of
evolution really. I mean,

1317
01:13:45,341 --> 01:13:48,100
no one wants to think about it that
way, but it, it, it shows there's,

1318
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,060
there's an ethic.

1319
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,960
The ethic in the world is things
become evermore complicated always.

1320
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,730
And if you look at old television
shows or old music, that stuff is bunk.

1321
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,960
You know, old comedy, it doesn't
work. You know, old comedy is broken.

1322
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:06,460
Go back and listen to some old comedy.
It very rarely do you laugh.

1323
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:10,630
You appreciate the craft. You
appreciate. Well in this time period,

1324
01:14:10,631 --> 01:14:12,930
this was material and this was,
you know,

1325
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,060
it was amazing what this guy is
saying and wow, listen to them.

1326
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:19,290
They're really enjoying it. I get it,
but it's not going to get you. Yeah.

1327
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:20,950
That's why out of all
the old old stand up,

1328
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:25,060
maybe like three albums will
stand up still prior. Still does.

1329
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,760
But you know it doesn't like
it did when I was a kid.

1330
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,340
Delirious still holds up
real well does it? Yeah.

1331
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,890
I watched it again recently
and I was like, fuck me,

1332
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:36,660
this shit is still laugh out loud. Funny.
That was a powerful performance ground.

1333
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,190
Someone Carlin's old stuff
still makes me laugh.

1334
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,670
Some kinisons old stuff's still
makes me laugh too. It's a,

1335
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,740
but that's only 80 years you go back.

1336
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,730
I mean in 1980 rather go back
like 1950 go back to that stuff.

1337
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:51,120
Well Marx Brothers makes me
laugh. Still really does. Yeah.

1338
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:54,970
Groucho still makes me laugh. Oh
Groucho was brilliant guy. Man.

1339
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,930
Always had some funny shit when
he used to do you bet your life.

1340
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:02,230
It was a talk show game show.
Some guy,

1341
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:05,980
you know had like 10 kids or something
like that and he goes, he goes, Whoa,

1342
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:10,060
10 kids. And the guy goes, yeah, I love
my wife. He goes, I love my cigar too,

1343
01:15:10,061 --> 01:15:11,860
but I take it out of my
mouth every now and then.

1344
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,740
He did always come up
with those kinds of lines.

1345
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:19,450
It Bill Maher actually kind of hack that.
He did something about loving his bong,

1346
01:15:19,451 --> 01:15:22,150
but I'd taken out of my mouth every now
and now when he was talking about the

1347
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:26,980
people who are the, uh, the, the families
that have joking kids tribute. Yeah. Yeah.

1348
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,710
Attribute. You would say that. Yeah.
He would say that it was a tribute.

1349
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:33,430
You shouldn't, everybody knows that
line that maybe it is a tribute,

1350
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,870
but it's still like, or maybe just
someone wrote it for him, but you know,

1351
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,060
Groucho Marx was a,

1352
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:44,090
a guy like that was like to say that
back then he was sharp than his,

1353
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,830
his sharpness still
holds up. Yeah. That's,

1354
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,160
that's like some 2010 standup
shit. You know? I mean,

1355
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,880
this is just to say that Bill Maher has
said that, you know, look, it works.

1356
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,050
It works. Now, you know,

1357
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:00,760
there's not a lot of jokes that work
now that would work back then. You know,

1358
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,800
I wonder how, how, how much

1359
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,310
business like trench coats sales have
gone down since the invention of the

1360
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,153
Webcam.

1361
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:15,090
[inaudible] no,
kids are getting better.

1362
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,700
Thrill though is to see it's not the
real thrill isn't, you know those,

1363
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:23,090
what is that called? Chat Chat
Roulette where you just, you know,

1364
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:26,010
stand in front of a Webcam hoping
someone looks at your Dick. All right.

1365
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,890
The real thrill is being right in front
of them and pulling your dick out and

1366
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,580
like jerking off on them most if though,

1367
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,030
is it that or you could do it to like
a hundred people at once. Like man,

1368
01:16:35,031 --> 01:16:38,780
I'm doing a hundred like I'm,
I'm really down to earth science.

1369
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,090
It's just more accurate this way.
I guess that would work,

1370
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:47,750
but I don't even have to run away.
Right. To potentially take a sidestep.

1371
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,550
What level of perversity he was
here and then he sidestepped

1372
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,660
yeah,
you don't have to do much to get away.

1373
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,670
Just pull your head out of the Webcam.
That's right.

1374
01:17:01,671 --> 01:17:05,390
But then who do you throw your piss
on or you're here. Come on. Yeah,

1375
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:06,224
that's a problem.

1376
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,530
You just have like this big wall of like
a picture of a woman that you to trick

1377
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,010
yourself.
You

1378
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,020
take, you take, you take a picture
of your screen, put it on the wall.

1379
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,750
For a lot of dudes that's
like what they really liked.

1380
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,380
You take a picture of your screen,
you take us

1381
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,720
screenshot, take a
screenshot, print it out.

1382
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:26,990
Once you're jerking off and as
you're about to cum, you grab it.

1383
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,903
Fuckers.

1384
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,120
That's hilarious. You have to, how much
do you, just enough for a hundred people.

1385
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:42,270
Who was the guy that got busted? Oh,
it was Christie Brinkley's husband.

1386
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:47,320
He was in debate and Billy Joel.
No, no, no, no. The Guy who uh,

1387
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:52,020
took over on that guy, there was more
than one guy. There was a few guys,

1388
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,370
there was one guy who was a,
uh,

1389
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,180
a guy that she got in a helicopter crash
with. Oh yeah, that guy died or by,

1390
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,730
oh hey. They both survived.
No, they both survived.

1391
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,160
But because of the fact that
it got through this thing,

1392
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:08,100
then they had this like crazy romance.
It really didn't make any sense.

1393
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,140
And then wound up, the guy was
a loser and she got rid of him.

1394
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,990
But then there was another
guy afterwards who was, uh,

1395
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,130
it was a crazy beat off guy and he
would spend thousands every month just

1396
01:18:17,131 --> 01:18:18,600
fucking whacking off online.

1397
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,320
Just joined every fucking
thing that you can join.

1398
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,290
It was it 25 a month and I just beat off
on people and they had like video this

1399
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,760
guy and it was,
there was an interview.

1400
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:32,580
It was a fucking fascinating interview
where they're bringing up whether or not

1401
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:36,110
he had masturbated in front of a Webcam.
There's been allegations,

1402
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,160
have you mastered this?
And he was like,

1403
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:42,060
there was this one time he admits to
tried the Abby tried to play it off this

1404
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,470
one time and it was a
completely consensual thing
and it was not that he's just

1405
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,700
getting on the webcams consensual, don't
you just have to look away like, well,

1406
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:54,060
it's literally unconsensual that you get
the initial image in the first place.

1407
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:55,170
I mean,
if someone,

1408
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:58,230
if you're just having a little iPhone
chat with somebody a little facetime,

1409
01:18:58,231 --> 01:19:01,950
they pull their deck and start beating
off. Yeah, man, you should ask me first.

1410
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,080
That's fucking hot, man. Not Man. I think
just the shock they loan is worth it.

1411
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:11,280
Like, well Joe, why are you
wiping out your tick, Joe?

1412
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:13,970
What are you getting so mad at
worth it to you? You got one too.

1413
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,320
That would be better.
You know how uncomfortable that be?

1414
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,450
If Brian and my pull out my
Dick and start masturbating,

1415
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:21,450
that would be more uncomfortable than
you. Just like, hey look Brian, about, oh,

1416
01:19:21,451 --> 01:19:24,780
come on and be like, please don't,
don't do that. Why are you doing that?

1417
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:29,940
Why do don't do it? No, don't
do too much buildup, you know?

1418
01:19:29,941 --> 01:19:32,400
That makes it worse. Come on,
don't, don't come. Come on.

1419
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:36,010
I have had friends that have told me, come
off. You know, if you touch your focus.

1420
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,630
I had a friend that told me crazy story
about his friend getting a hooker and he

1421
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:43,320
stayed in the room and beat off all his
friend. Fuck the hooker. I'm like, Yo,

1422
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:47,370
I'm not willing to go that far.
I am not willing to go that far.

1423
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:51,930
You're gonna beat off in the room
with your friend having sex. Oh yeah.

1424
01:19:51,931 --> 01:19:53,370
What?
That's the same people that,

1425
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,560
that didn't care in the
locker rooms in high school.

1426
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:58,340
They were just walking around with their
Dick Everywhere. Same people either die.

1427
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:00,290
I was hiding in the bathroom,
shower.

1428
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:05,150
I don't think I started not caring
until I was in my twenties yeah.

1429
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,010
Lean your 20s you're like, you want
to look at my, you fucking Weirdo.

1430
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,900
Go ahead. Yeah. But when you're, you know,

1431
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,110
I did go to hedonism and get naked though.
Really?

1432
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,940
What's hedonism in Jamaica in
Jamaica just went around naked. Yeah.

1433
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,950
There was the prude side in the nude side
and everybody was having way more fun

1434
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:23,520
on the nude side. Wow. And then they
were like, come on over. And I go,

1435
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,750
I go over in my town. No one's got a
fucking iPhone on them. Oh No, this is,

1436
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:31,830
you know, like a five, six years
ago. Do they still do it now? Yeah.

1437
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:34,290
I'm going to make sure that
camera's there though. Really?

1438
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:37,300
But nowadays you can get fucking
spy cams and crazy. Right.

1439
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,300
There's all sorts of shit. He can get
hats that have video cameras on them.

1440
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,300
It's pretty nutty. What they can
do now there's the glasses member,

1441
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,490
Stan [inaudible],
Stan Opeb,

1442
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,120
that show he was doing for Fox was a
hidden camera show and he had glasses that

1443
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:50,850
were like a little camera on them.
There's a button you can buy.

1444
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,830
It looks like a shirt. Yeah,
that's all my video camera.

1445
01:20:53,831 --> 01:20:55,830
I'm always checking up on like,
like just recently,

1446
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:59,340
the guy that's small enough HD
that goes into a button I saw. Yup.

1447
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,280
Shit about getting a couple of those.
You know when you're going to need it.

1448
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,170
You never know. Just stayed at the right
girls. Get the right button, cameras

1449
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,140
hang your shirt the right way.
It's eventually wearing your shirt.

1450
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,500
It's I'm cold. Weird
button. Nothing. Yeah,

1451
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:21,570
your buttons white and that one's black.
Here's a question that wasn't glass.

1452
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,130
The bigger button. I have a question
for you gentlemen. When you have sex,

1453
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,760
do you guys make a lot of noises?
Like do you, are you loud? Yes.

1454
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:34,650
You will still make some noise.
Really? Yeah man. If I can,

1455
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,320
cause I'm not, I'm very quiet, very quiet.

1456
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:41,310
And it's not like I'm not like sad man.
I don't know why.

1457
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:45,870
But now I'm being told that I need to be
louder. Oh, I like how old are you, Brad?

1458
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,080
36 you're told.
Now listen man,

1459
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:52,800
we're not within the last year or so.
Lately.

1460
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,130
Lately people have been telling me,
let me give you some more very,

1461
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:59,770
very strong advice. Fake it and
just be, we'll switch you up to do,

1462
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:04,740
if a girl ever gets to a point where
she's saying you need to make some noise.

1463
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,340
All right, this is what you need
to do. You need to make some noise.

1464
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,490
Cause if you don't, she's going to
find someone who makes noise. Right?

1465
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,240
So do you understand that? I know, but
when I make, then I make the noise and I,

1466
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,440
I to think I about it. I know, but it's
like, it's not me and my personality.

1467
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:22,810
So when I go, you take that can, you know,

1468
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,100
I think that's a shyness because it took
me a long time to come out of my show

1469
01:22:27,101 --> 01:22:28,710
with that stuff too. So yeah. Listen,

1470
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:32,480
dude tried choking myself and
masturbating everything. No, I know.

1471
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:34,830
I got to learn how to take the potion.
How are you going to catch the combined?

1472
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,880
If you don't learn how to take the pussy,
there's, there's girls that need that.

1473
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:42,390
They need you to take the
poster. They need you to fuck
the shit out of him. Dude,

1474
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,840
I get it. I need you to talk to
them or I need you to grab them.

1475
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,320
You need to fucking start pulling
their hair. Choke them bit.

1476
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:50,100
You gotta start doing squats.

1477
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:53,430
I liked the live smack and
squats and eat a lot of buffalo.

1478
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:58,410
If you can get some bison in you, maybe
some ostrich, some meaty red shit. Steady.

1479
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:01,770
Right? If you could find on elk Cyrex,
sorry, I should go to fid. Rutgers.

1480
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,650
Kill a deer with your fucking
hands is what you need to do.

1481
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,070
You need to go on one of those Indian

1482
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,990
vision quests where you go running down
a a d or until it dies of exhaustion and

1483
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,760
then you eat it's heart
while it's still beating.

1484
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,850
And then then he'd go back and fuck the
shit out of her with the blood all over

1485
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:18,640
your chest but not at night until
you finish fucking the deer. Yeah.

1486
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:22,360
Fuck the deer first just for a warmup
just to get your kinks worked out of your

1487
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:25,630
Dick and then you'd go back home.
No sense in going in gold. Yeah.

1488
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,520
How do you make noises
when you're making love?

1489
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:29,590
I can understand chick
open the fucking door.

1490
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,340
Knowing the background you're
making brother dead animal
on the ground and youth

1491
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:38,410
howl through a conch shell.
That's what you do. Do.

1492
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:41,950
You step in and you fucking take care of
business so that, but when you do that,

1493
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:44,580
that kills the making love aspect
of your fighting. Here's the deal.

1494
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,170
Only fosters a deal buddy.
Here's the deal.

1495
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,010
Fucking the last thing you would ever
want, right is a girl who is like,

1496
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:55,760
like acting like a dude and
talking shit to you. And you know,

1497
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,140
and being all manly with you and you know,

1498
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,660
you don't want to be the sub aggressive
with you or getting weird with you rank

1499
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:05,200
that would be grossed.
Right. Well, with some girls,

1500
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,420
some girls are very girly, they're
very sexual, they're very bright.

1501
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:13,600
And with those girls they want a lot of
man. They want a lot of shit happening.

1502
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:16,750
Right. They don't want you to just be like
whimpering on top of them and shooting

1503
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:20,260
loads. Yeah. They don't
want you cuddling up.

1504
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,420
They don't want you and
twitching every now and then.

1505
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:25,940
You've got to give them what
their DNA needs, cut, talked,

1506
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,780
and you don't want to lean and go
to them. I'm sorry. That hurt. Yeah.

1507
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:33,700
Just when date after, after it's done
and you're gonna apologize. Exactly.

1508
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:37,260
Sorry about calling you. They make
a crazy moment as it normal also,

1509
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,570
that girls always say that they must
be like starting their period again.

1510
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:45,450
But you think it's because you,
you rip them what's going on in your life.

1511
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,640
It's like every time I have sex with
a girl, they're like, oh my God,

1512
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:52,690
it started again. Or, ah, but I think
I'm ripping them. What would be a huge,

1513
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,350
I didn't think so many girls
at this happened to it.

1514
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,430
Like they're always
saying that it hurts them.

1515
01:24:57,431 --> 01:25:00,840
I'm going too deep and it's hurting.
I've never had a problem with her.

1516
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:04,240
You measure your deck or you had, do
you have some crazy dick? All right,

1517
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:07,750
and here's an, here's another truth. How
big is your do not that big. Like six,

1518
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:11,900
seven inches. That's terrible, right?
That's a sad deck. I gotta say it like,

1519
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:15,580
but it's, it's girthy. Normal's like six
inches, right? This isn't that normal.

1520
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,130
I don't know. Oh, look
and think that that might,

1521
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:20,710
you're being a dick that's making me,

1522
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,190
I don't even want to look
at your fingers right now.

1523
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:27,430
I just see a dick for some
reasons. Get your finger
Dixon. Well, maybe you're just,

1524
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:30,070
you're just lucky and you dated
a bunch of shallow vagina girls.

1525
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:32,380
That's what I'm thinking. I think
that's a shallow vagina. Goes.

1526
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,860
Now here's another question. Do you get,
have you ever had sex in the shower?

1527
01:25:35,861 --> 01:25:39,940
Is it, does it make you
dizzy? No reason. No,

1528
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:43,960
but this always makes me like the other
day I you pass out in the shower while

1529
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:47,500
you're fucking two months ago I'm
having sex and I'm like, like,

1530
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:50,420
like within like a minute. I'm like,
all right, I'm getting lightheaded.

1531
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,520
And I had to go lay down. I had to
go lay down on the bathroom floor.

1532
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:59,570
And then the substitute
nick walked in the talk.

1533
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:03,020
Was this after she had told you
she wanted you to talk to her? No,

1534
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,150
this is somebody else's,

1535
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:08,210
uh, Asian, black girl and
said, but, but like, like,

1536
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,990
like within a minute like that happens.
But if like it was outside of the shower.

1537
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,240
Oh no problem at all. Good
as long as you want. But,

1538
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,460
but immediately when I'm in a shower,
it's like, what is that about?

1539
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,980
Take it back to the same standard
can kill an elk with a Bowie knife.

1540
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,580
You need to jump on his fucking back and
hold on to his horns and cut his throat

1541
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,590
as you,
you get your,

1542
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:30,230
your guard wrapped around his neck and
trips to the ground as he runs out of

1543
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:33,680
blood. That's what you need to do.
You need to fucking kill something.

1544
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:34,790
Sign when you get them from behind,

1545
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:39,050
stretch the body so your DNA is getting
watered down by technology in the

1546
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:42,380
universe. You need to take a log
and run up a hill with it. Okay?

1547
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,490
You're losing your fucking cells.
They're going away.

1548
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,850
And why did fading?
Is it normal for them?

1549
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:52,670
Put the phone next to the pill and they
have their parents listen to you have sex

1550
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,910
on her wedding night. Just kidding.
I forgot to get coconut water.

1551
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,340
What are you talking about? You just had
one. I know I'm thirsty. Stuff. Oh, okay.

1552
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,630
I get a lot. Another one. You
Freak. I'm going to cut him off.

1553
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:12,910
No more marijuana. No more coconut water.
I don't think marijuana's the problems.

1554
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:17,480
Coconut water. Coconut water is
delicious. The marijuana gets some crazy.

1555
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:21,110
We've got to get you on some elks blood.
That's where you're going to do.

1556
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:25,430
You're going to start drinking elks
blood just a couple of days a week.

1557
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,560
Small glass of eligibilities.
Yeah, no edit Nami. That's shit.

1558
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,410
Mommies. That edamame may shit makes
you grow tits that makes she estrogen.

1559
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,650
Yeah. Soy, especially that
genetic genetically modified soy.

1560
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,990
That shit will fuck you
eight ways to Sunday.

1561
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:45,980
Who knows what's going on with that?
He does that also. I don't know.

1562
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:49,250
I'm talking out of my ass.
I know nothing about vegetable growth.

1563
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:50,930
Benched a little girl.

1564
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:56,200
I don't think you're an agricultural
knowledge is disappointing. Joe Soc.

1565
01:27:56,201 --> 01:28:00,110
Sprout socks. I don't even
know what a silo is for. I
think they keep grain in it.

1566
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:04,220
Yes. They keep grain. And if you ever
hear about people dying in silos,

1567
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,240
like they fall off and they just drowned
by going right down the middle of the

1568
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:09,170
silos. Grain drown. Yeah.

1569
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:13,340
Grain drown captain that corn so much.
Oh my God.

1570
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:16,290
How do they get you out? Uh, I
don't know. I did. They asked.

1571
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,940
They start from the bottom. So somebody
has a lot of starch in the Diet.

1572
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,980
You can't swim either. Right? Right.

1573
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:26,130
You're just fucking corn everywhere in
your mind. God, that must be horrifying.

1574
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,640
I'm always, I'm, I was
always fearful of those, uh,

1575
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:32,900
those ball things that you throw
kids in the little balls. Yeah. Yeah.

1576
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:34,190
There's one thing that my,
uh,

1577
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,910
my two year old has this gymnastics
class she goes to and there's a pit they

1578
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:40,760
jump into and it's all filled with
these little spongy foam things.

1579
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,060
And I jumped into it. I'm
like, I don't like this at all.

1580
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,100
Like this feels like you
can't get outta here.

1581
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:49,820
Like it might be fun if you're 25 pounds,
you know, if you're a two year old,

1582
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:54,800
but when you're a grown man and you fall
all these balls, like this is stupid.

1583
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:59,660
Like why would anybody think this is fun?
And they're dirty, dirty mother fuckers.

1584
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,980
I do miss like laser tag though.
Do you guys ever

1585
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,280
played laser tag but at once was
pretty dope. I should say the bomb.

1586
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:08,640
They need to bring that back.
Yeah. Well they stopped it. Yeah.

1587
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:12,000
Well I don't know the place. There's a
place out here, man fog and everything.

1588
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:16,410
There's a place yet. It's not out here.
It's about 45 minutes away north. But, uh,

1589
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:17,910
I'll take you, we can
go something like, yeah,

1590
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:22,440
that's you and me and Ari and Julie to
watch on the sidelines and then we'll

1591
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:25,370
wait in line for a cabbage
patch. Kid Joel, join into man.

1592
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:30,000
What the fuck are you asking me?
Don't you know what my real name is?

1593
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,100
If he goes to the couple laser
tag champion has for you bro. Uh,

1594
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:36,270
you know my wife's last name is Diaz.

1595
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,910
Really? If you're related a
wonderful wonder, he is holy Shit.

1596
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,990
But you could also be related to Nick
Diaz if you had to choose between being

1597
01:29:44,991 --> 01:29:49,100
related to Nick Diaz and being
related to Joey Diaz, Nate Diaz,

1598
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,040
you'd go names that the neck.
But Nate and nick are the same.

1599
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,310
That's the same lineage to saint brothers.
What the fuck?

1600
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:59,060
Cock sucker stopped doing. My voice
shitty. He's Puerto Rican, right? Joey?

1601
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:03,890
Joey is Cuban always a Cuban. Does your
wife Puerto Rican? No, she's Ecuadorian.

1602
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:08,780
Oh Damn. She Ran Honduran. Cause you've
got yourself a job. I got myself on as

1603
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,080
I watched this crazy fucking,
yeah.

1604
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:17,490
I don't like those ancient ancient aliens
show. You know, you've watched those.

1605
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,560
A lot of them were kind of Hokey, but
I watched one last night that was dope.

1606
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:24,530
Which one?
The one all about unexplained structures.

1607
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:28,480
Yeah, but this, uh, about the masons
and the Menotti and everything and the,

1608
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:33,090
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no. It wasn't about that. It
was about structures like a,

1609
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:36,500
in Peru, these gigantic
stone walls that they built,

1610
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:41,540
these are like hundred ton stones
and they were carved into place.

1611
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:45,680
So they fit like a puzzle and they fit
perfectly and they fit to the point where

1612
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:50,330
you can't even get a piece of paper in
between the rocks and they have no idea

1613
01:30:50,331 --> 01:30:52,220
how they did this,
how they quarried them,

1614
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:55,190
how they moved them thousands
and thousands of years ago.

1615
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,170
These just massive walls.
I've been watching a lot of lately.

1616
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,160
Incredible Shit,
man.

1617
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:04,300
Big Alien. Shitted out Joe.
Well, that's what these guys are.

1618
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:07,690
Everyone's always claiming it's aliens.
You know that the Lizard Aliens, right?

1619
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,760
Yes.
The reptilian aliens.

1620
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:12,560
It's really silly thinking, but
it's sexy thinking. You know,

1621
01:31:12,561 --> 01:31:16,310
people love the idea of everything
being aliens. Man. There was aliens.

1622
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:19,760
Aliens did this, don't
you see? But we're aliens.

1623
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:24,170
If you look at the regular primates and
you look at us, we are fucking aliens.

1624
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,870
We know that.
We come up with crazy shit now,

1625
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:31,100
isn't it a much more likely
scenario that we have been us,

1626
01:31:31,101 --> 01:31:36,101
we have been this thing for a long ass
time and that we have been this thing for

1627
01:31:36,651 --> 01:31:40,670
maybe hundreds of thousands of years and
then we've been wiped out a few times.

1628
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,040
That's much more likely.

1629
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:43,550
We had to, yeah, the much,

1630
01:31:43,551 --> 01:31:46,850
much more like there's no way that we
were around for this long and then all of

1631
01:31:46,851 --> 01:31:48,980
a sudden in 100 years made
fucking strides letter.

1632
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,420
Well,
there's so much evidence that we,

1633
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,730
that things get wiped out
all the time on earth.

1634
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:57,390
We know that there was at
least two mass extinctions,

1635
01:31:57,391 --> 01:31:59,350
one to 50 million years ago,

1636
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:03,190
one 65 million years ago where
everything's dead except like a couple of,

1637
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:03,940
you know,

1638
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:07,570
some bugs and some rats and shit and
they figured out how to become everything

1639
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:10,870
there is now. If you believe in
all that, you take God. It's got,

1640
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:14,440
have happened in smaller ways
and just fucked up everyone.

1641
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,410
It's must've happened.
This shit that killed off the dinosaurs.

1642
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,810
It doesn't mean that it
just kills everybody.

1643
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,940
It doesn't mean that they're
the mass extinctions.

1644
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:23,170
That's the only way they happen.

1645
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:27,460
It also could mean they killed almost
everybody and there weren't as bad as the

1646
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:28,300
dinosaur one,

1647
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:32,260
but a lot of people fucking died and
they left behind a lot of crazy shit that

1648
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:33,250
they had already accomplished.

1649
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:36,580
And then everybody else
basically started with scratch.

1650
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:41,230
We started with whatever knowledge we
had been passed on to by our forefathers.

1651
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,480
Whatever was in our head.
That's what we got.

1652
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:47,770
And then we figured out how to rebuild
houses and hunt for food and we go

1653
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:51,970
through the whole thing all over again.
That's more likely. That's more likely.

1654
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:56,440
Where are you with 2012? I am
about a year and a half away, man.

1655
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,600
Come on buddy.
It was,

1656
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:02,020
you fucking left yourself that not even
a year and a half year. Two years a day.

1657
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,630
Well two December 21st. Yeah. Um,

1658
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,260
I think here they a miscalculated
the date though. That's a lot of,

1659
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,280
they don't know. The speculation is
one scarred like a hundred years off.

1660
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:16,510
Wow. I've heard it's more safe
than I've heard. It's not,

1661
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:17,820
there's a lot of problems with um,

1662
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,320
interpreting what the Mayans said and
what they really meant. You know, what a,

1663
01:33:21,321 --> 01:33:23,470
a myon, Myon, alphabet.

1664
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:27,230
The way it works is each image,
uh,

1665
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,290
depicts a sound or a word and
like a word, you know, like the,

1666
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:36,300
like the way like things were like they
would show you like a heard someone

1667
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:38,950
describe it this way.
Um, it would say, uh,

1668
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:42,850
I saw aunt rose would be an eyeball,
uh,

1669
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:47,650
saw an aunt and a rose.
That's how you would say I saw at rose.

1670
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,870
You'd have to say it like that though.
That's the other language.

1671
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:54,430
I think Mckenna said that or
explain that that way. Um, and um,

1672
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,840
so when they tried to like decipher
a lot of the old Maya and shit,

1673
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:02,470
like it's really tricky. I watched this
documentary on breaking the mind code.

1674
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:07,150
Like their language was so
different than ours. Like so alien.

1675
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:12,270
It's so hard to say like in English what
these guys wrote down in these images

1676
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:14,020
and drawings. It's like, man,

1677
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:18,430
there's a lot of like filling in the
blanks and guesswork and just just in the

1678
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:22,000
translation, you know, just,
just trying to translate it.

1679
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:24,510
It's like you might be getting
the same feeling and what they're,

1680
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,080
they're saying but might not.

1681
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:29,170
So there's so much speculation
of what does it mean?

1682
01:34:29,171 --> 01:34:31,090
What is the end of the count,
what is this?

1683
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:35,920
And then what a lot of people believe
is all it is is there's a procession of

1684
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:40,150
the equinoxes and it's a
26,000 something year cycle.

1685
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,480
And what it is is that the
earth wobbles on its access,

1686
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:48,640
doesn't spin perfectly and it create a
completes this wobble every in 26,000

1687
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:52,630
years or something like that. I
think it's that much, isn't it? Um,

1688
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:57,410
whatever the number is, but that, this
is what it was all based. And this is,

1689
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,910
these are these cycles based on,

1690
01:34:58,911 --> 01:35:02,450
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
anything happens, you know, I mean in,

1691
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:05,630
in just because they wrote it down and
made a cycle and a calendar and there's

1692
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:10,250
counts in the calendar and that this is
the end of the long count. December 21st,

1693
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:13,550
2012 unit. That is the day. It doesn't
mean that anything happens, you know,

1694
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:16,760
there's all these people like there's
going to be a great awakening and we are

1695
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:20,990
all going to come join in one
consciousness and experience mother Gaia.

1696
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:25,520
She will speak to us again as she has not
in thousands of years since the Mayans

1697
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:29,650
last saw her, her, her
society in our lights,

1698
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:31,040
in our electricity,

1699
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:35,810
in our sis sis prescription medicine
is a ruined our connection to the great

1700
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:40,811
mother maybe or maybe you're a crazy con
and you believe in palm reading and you

1701
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:42,800
just need your life to
be more interesting.

1702
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,390
That being some fat fucking cheese doodle,
Eaton Weirdo that sitting at home,

1703
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:51,650
you know, watching ancient aliens on
TV. Maybe. Maybe that's not the answer.

1704
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,790
Maybe 2012 nothing happens.
Most likely it's likely,

1705
01:35:55,820 --> 01:36:00,070
but maybe it's some sort
of a technological thing.
Maybe it's nothing. Maybe.

1706
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:02,200
Maybe it is what mostly singularity.

1707
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:05,460
I mean like seriously like what are the
odds are hundreds that other planet,

1708
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:08,830
they said he was going to hit us and can't
Brian, but you can't say that we are,

1709
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:11,390
we aren't on a very clear path.
Yeah,

1710
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:13,810
but do you really think that this
day is going to happen and then like

1711
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:16,250
everything's going to, something crazy
is going to happen for real. Look,

1712
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:18,170
if something crazy happens,
okay,

1713
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,550
and if it happens a a decade from
now or if it happens tomorrow,

1714
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,580
what's going to happen is
going to be so fucking nuts.

1715
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,600
You are going to completely be over the
fact that someone called the day that he

1716
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:33,320
nailed it December 21st he was right.
What are the odds?

1717
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,560
You're not going to care what the odds
were because what's going to happen is

1718
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:41,561
going to be so fucking world blowing or
what's going to happen is something like

1719
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:47,140
a time machine or a portal to another
dimension or some sort of experience

1720
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:53,130
interdimensional experiences that people
be able to go through or wormholes or

1721
01:36:53,131 --> 01:36:57,620
it's something fucking completely crazy
that we can't even wrap our heads around

1722
01:36:57,621 --> 01:36:59,540
now because it's beyond our comprehension.

1723
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,000
That's what's going to happen
and when that does happen,

1724
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:06,590
you're not going to give a fuck if it
was in December or July, I was there.

1725
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,250
They're going to say, look
man, we've connected all time
together in one grouping.

1726
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,160
You can dive in but you
can't dive out who's with me.

1727
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:16,190
If you go and you have to realize
that your identity dissolves,

1728
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,700
you no longer exist and you
become one of the great mind,

1729
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:22,730
do you do it or do not do it?
I called the day.

1730
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:26,480
I knew it was going to be July 13th look,
I wrote it down.

1731
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,510
No one's going to give a fuck if you
wrote it down. You dumped con you in,

1732
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,330
are you not in? Yeah, but that simple.

1733
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,920
So you're thinking that that's gonna
happen in your lifetime though.

1734
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:36,830
Something crazy, you know, dig
it that absolutely. Absolutely.

1735
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,080
The singularity will happen
within our lifetime. There's,

1736
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:42,590
it's inevitable unless some sort of a
natural disaster occurs before that.

1737
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:47,720
If something occurs before then and knocks
us back, you know, to, who knows? Man,

1738
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,260
maybe that's the earth's and knock
culation system. Maybe the earth is like,

1739
01:37:51,261 --> 01:37:53,750
listen bitch, we're not ready for you
to make the black hole machine yet.

1740
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:57,730
So the Earth fucking an asteroid
our way. Boom. I mean maybe the,

1741
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,510
we don't think of the sky
being a natural system,

1742
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:03,240
but maybe it isn't natural system.
You know, maybe just like, you know,

1743
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:05,670
bacteria is here to kill off
the old people, you know, and,

1744
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:09,230
and strong colds in one of
those. Therefore, what does
that, that battle with the,

1745
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:12,960
these invisible forces that kill our
loved ones. What is that about? Well,

1746
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:16,260
that's a system, man. It's a whole
system in place. I mean, you can call it,

1747
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:19,800
you know, you could call it bacteria,
you can call it germs. You can call it,

1748
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:24,060
there's a system. Okay? The system is
when you get weak, someone gets you. Okay.

1749
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:27,930
And it might be a the flu and might be
leukemia, whatever the fuck it might be.

1750
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:29,940
There's some crazy biological system.
Well,

1751
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,340
the main that might exist in
the software system as well.

1752
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,250
The dinosaurs might've
just got to fucking crazy.

1753
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,690
It might've just been too nuts and the
hole geological system was so fucking off

1754
01:38:39,691 --> 01:38:43,080
balance like no one's ever going to
invent anything. Okay? Here's why.

1755
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:47,910
Every time you go outside a 90 foot
lizard eats your asshole, okay?

1756
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:51,630
No one is going to ever invent shit.
We've got to kill these motherfuckers.

1757
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:56,010
And progress comes to a screeching halt
because there's these super predators.

1758
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,080
I mean they are the
epitome of Super Predator.

1759
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:03,200
Look at the t rex giant fucking thick
skin lizard monster with huge teeth at

1760
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:07,620
each all day.
Nothing ever gets done like that.

1761
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:12,621
So you've got to come up with a child and
500 mile wide chunk of iron from space

1762
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:19,850
go and 45,000 miles and hour slamming
into the cross and just fucking everything

1763
01:39:20,941 --> 01:39:25,170
up. Just fucks the whole Party
man, and when that happens,

1764
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:27,700
then everything gets to start again
and maybe we're just going to,

1765
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,860
they've rebooted.
Yeah.

1766
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:32,780
Maybe we're going to get to some point
where we're just so retarded and out of

1767
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:37,781
control and overpopulated that were
piled on top of each other and then maybe

1768
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:39,270
the universe reboots us.

1769
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,560
I think people were waiting 20s thought
the same thing probably though. Yeah,

1770
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:46,140
but they were right. They were
just wrong by the day. The,

1771
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:50,850
but the difference between 1920 2010 in
your life is a long time in the life of

1772
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:53,280
the universe. That ain't shit. Okay.

1773
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:57,510
They recognize an ethic and they
sought an advance. That's what it is.

1774
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,930
They just were wrong about the date when
they thought the apocalypse was coming

1775
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,800
10,000 years ago. They were right. Okay.

1776
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:07,470
They were just off by 10,000
years and 10,000 years isn't shit,

1777
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:09,210
but everybody was paying attention.

1778
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,250
If you look at the direction
that human beings are going,

1779
01:40:11,251 --> 01:40:14,070
we all recognize it's
going to some crazy point.

1780
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:17,710
That's not a fucking bright future.
There's no way. There's no way.

1781
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:21,030
If population keeps increasing
and increasing and increasing,

1782
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:24,630
and we keep polluting and polluting and
fighting and war in Iran gets nuclear

1783
01:40:24,631 --> 01:40:28,950
weapons, we got issues, some shit's
going to go down. It's inevitable.

1784
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:32,100
And everybody recognized that
back in the biblical days.

1785
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,300
They recognize that 500 years ago they
recognized that in the 1920s and they

1786
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:39,510
were right. They were right. It's
just, that's the way it's moving.

1787
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:44,520
It just takes time. So that's what
all this 2012 shit is, you know,

1788
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:46,950
whether it's 2012 or
when Jesus comes back,

1789
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:51,600
I've got these fucking videos that
are awesome. Okay? They are all,

1790
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:56,290
it's Kirk Cameron series, their VHS. You
gotta get, I gotta buy them on Vhs, man.

1791
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,020
That's awesome. They
are. And it's uh, it's,

1792
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:02,590
I forget what they're fucking calls like
a crazy Christian though. Right beyond,

1793
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,610
he believes the rapture that is going to
happen when Jesus is going to come back.

1794
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:10,130
All the beautiful people that love Jesus
is going to disappear and they're going

1795
01:41:10,131 --> 01:41:14,200
to leave us stranded in hell.
The hell of earth,

1796
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:16,900
the God like God is going
to come and take away.

1797
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:21,370
He believes basically that God is like
an alien who's going to take all his,

1798
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,340
his brother's back to the mothership.
He's fucked.

1799
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,080
How nutty is that concept? And people
who know it's not an alien moon.

1800
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,000
It's the rupture.
It's going to take us to heaven.

1801
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:34,390
We're going to live forever with love.
It's not like aliens.

1802
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:38,320
You're going to heaven. You're going
to space. You're leaving this planet.

1803
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:39,700
You're going to disappear.
We're not.

1804
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:43,210
No little God is going to
remove us from no you dude,

1805
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:45,340
you might as well be beaming
a board. Okay, you're,

1806
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,820
you're using magic and you're going to
go to some special place and you don't

1807
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:52,450
think that's nuts. These videos
are awesome. They're awesome,

1808
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:55,030
and he really sells them in
the videos. Oh yeah, man,

1809
01:41:55,031 --> 01:41:56,500
these people are believe in this man.

1810
01:41:56,590 --> 01:42:01,030
It's a window into madness and it's all
based. Like there's a, there's a, um,

1811
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:05,260
there's a whole book series that's
written by these two dudes that right,

1812
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:07,240
these apocalyptic,
you know,

1813
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:10,930
rapture books and they sell like crazy.
God,

1814
01:42:10,931 --> 01:42:13,510
I'm going to have to Google this now
because I don't remember the name of this

1815
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:18,220
guy. It's kind of
important. Um, because uh,

1816
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:23,140
the whole idea is pretty fucking
interesting. What's your religion man?

1817
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:26,740
Are you religious or nonreligious?
Left behind. That's what it's about.

1818
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,340
These are the books that I was raised
Catholic though, where I was two.

1819
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:34,960
That's good enough. Right? Catholic like
inoculates you, cause it's so silly,

1820
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,610
you know? Ridiculous. Yeah.

1821
01:42:36,611 --> 01:42:40,930
And everybody's fucking everybody and
hitting their money and shit. You know,

1822
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:44,920
you don't really such a ridiculous,
when I look at it now, I'm like, really?

1823
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:48,280
You're going to believe some of this
shit, any of this shit. Really? Yeah.

1824
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:53,170
It's like, it's so ridiculous. Who wrote
this book? Yeah, the left behind series.

1825
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,560
You've got to check it out. They
may, I think they made two videos.

1826
01:42:56,561 --> 01:42:59,680
I'm pretty sure how both of them,
if I don't, I'm going to buy them.

1827
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:03,970
If they come out with new ones, I'm
buying them to Blu ray there. Awesome.

1828
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:07,880
Ingredia Unintentional Kirk Cameron
on Ray, three day can occur.

1829
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:11,050
Came as curly hair will come. So if you,
if you were raised Catholic, you know,

1830
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:14,350
I have all this Indian art around my
house and you were very aware of what all

1831
01:43:14,351 --> 01:43:16,750
this shit is and you are very aware of,
you know,

1832
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,600
what the names for them and everything
like that. How do you know all that stuff?

1833
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,910
That's still, my parents
are from India. Right?

1834
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:25,120
So you used to know things you go when
you go to visit family and stuff you

1835
01:43:25,121 --> 01:43:28,550
would see not in their houses,
but like you would see it around India.

1836
01:43:28,551 --> 01:43:30,160
And I'd ask what is that?
What does that,

1837
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:34,240
it needs a pretty fascinating fucking
country when you think about the history

1838
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:38,620
of all these weird fucking really
thoughtful things have come out of India.

1839
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:41,920
You know, just uh, the, the,
the history of Yoga, you know,

1840
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:44,110
in the Yogis and the
sod dues and you know,

1841
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:46,900
all those dudes sitting around smoking
chillums and trying to figure out the

1842
01:43:46,901 --> 01:43:50,800
universe and you know,
the hot vogue Eda and,

1843
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,280
or Mahabharata

1844
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:57,080
and um, you know, what is, um, what
is the fucking, there was another one,

1845
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:00,170
another ancient texts. It's
really fascinating. She
stayed in my hot Parada's.

1846
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:03,920
What are those like little breads,
their breads,

1847
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,530
little Paratas and mom would make them,

1848
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,170
when was the first time you saw
a chicken that wasn't red? Huh?

1849
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:15,880
Chicken. It wasn't reg. Reg Chicken. Red
Chicken. The Indian chicken. Yeah. Oh,

1850
01:44:15,881 --> 01:44:20,540
turn dirty red chicken.
The BHAGAVAD Gita, right.

1851
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:22,980
That's what it's called. The new
book. The ancient Hindu book.

1852
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,600
What Oppenheimer quoted after you
fucking blew up the atomic bomb,

1853
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:30,560
which is very nice. So you got fucking
wild. That was never a religion though.

1854
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:33,470
You know, it was just a
way of life. Really. Yeah.

1855
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,150
And then somebody wrote it
down and became a religion.

1856
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:38,830
It's almost like if somebody said,
uh,

1857
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:41,420
wrote down the rules to yoga and
then people started following it,

1858
01:44:41,421 --> 01:44:44,360
like a religious will. They
do. Yeah. Right. So look,

1859
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,830
I know people that are younger people,
you know,

1860
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:51,020
they classify themselves as yoga people.
They might as well be in a cult.

1861
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,490
I mean they really might as well be.

1862
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:55,820
I mean it's very beneficial and it's
helping them a lot. Certainly helps. Like,

1863
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,760
they all, they all have great energy and
they're all like really friendly people.

1864
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:02,030
But it's, um, it's, it's, might
as well be a cult, you know,

1865
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:03,320
it's like sort of the same sort of thing.

1866
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:07,940
They start talking and there's one chick,
you fucking ring your phone again, dude.

1867
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:12,530
No, that's wrong with you. What was
that? Zoom and sound like a song. Huh?

1868
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,250
This one. Any religion though,
the minute it gets written down,

1869
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:17,600
it becomes a religion I guess.

1870
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:20,050
But I mean the yoga thing is a
fascinating thing because it really,

1871
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,980
but it really is, is some sort of
a body maintenance thing, you know,

1872
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:28,910
they figured out how to maintain your
body in maintaining like your health and

1873
01:45:28,911 --> 01:45:31,250
maintain like a certain
certain sense of clarity.

1874
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:35,630
And a lot of that shit came out of
India. Man. A lot of that shit, you know,

1875
01:45:35,631 --> 01:45:37,370
came out of the, uh, you know, the, the,

1876
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:41,230
like a lot of the ancient India
way of way of life, like with,

1877
01:45:41,231 --> 01:45:45,020
with the saw do's and with these, uh,
these yogis. And I always wonder like,

1878
01:45:45,021 --> 01:45:49,370
why this one area, you know, if you look
at all these different areas of Europe,

1879
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:53,900
all these different areas like India
especially has a lot of like really trippy

1880
01:45:53,901 --> 01:45:56,360
shit that came from India.
Like all your artwork,

1881
01:45:56,470 --> 01:46:00,610
the Indian artwork and not your artwork.
I'll yet people, you know, you people,

1882
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:05,780
the Canadian Indian artwork is all so
fascinating, man. It's all really trippy.

1883
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,630
Like, you know, she Eva's with, you know,

1884
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:11,570
they're fucking six arms and shit and
like, it's all really, really bizarre.

1885
01:46:11,571 --> 01:46:15,260
Like psychedelic heady stuff
I talked about. It's a,

1886
01:46:15,261 --> 01:46:18,650
it's a very state of mind
country. Yeah. When you go there,

1887
01:46:18,651 --> 01:46:22,510
I talk about it and funny
enough in my act, but um,

1888
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:26,420
no, I'm good. Thanks.

1889
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:32,570
Did you happen to see that Yogi bear
parody where Yogi kills a booboo?

1890
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,790
No. Did you see that? So
talk about nonsequitors.

1891
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,070
You mother fucker ever talking
about India? Well, trippy MD.

1892
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:44,480
We're talking about yoga.
Yoga. This is yoga. That is
not what we're talking about.

1893
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,500
I'm not talking about Yogi bear.
I,

1894
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:50,030
he's brought that up because
no one was saying anything.
So, oh, I see. Oh, why was

1895
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:54,390
it saved us clever things to say
about those index. Good. Safe.

1896
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:59,010
Why don't you try yoga, Brian? Maybe
that'll bring it job fucking hard, dude.

1897
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,860
I done it a few times. It's great.
Especially if you're single.

1898
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:06,690
It's the best place ever to go to meet
girls and see they're buttholes and stuff.

1899
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:10,290
See their bottles. Just see him move
around. They're barely wearing anything.

1900
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:14,760
Especially you get the hot sweaty one.
They're like, it's, it's just amazing.

1901
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,880
It's just naked chicks pretty much.

1902
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:20,610
And it's naked chicks that looking
out for their health. Yeah. Right.

1903
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:24,240
So they're healthy, naked, good bronze.
Yeah. Especially the eat like good stuff.

1904
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:26,510
Eat good food.
Right.

1905
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:30,760
You know what? Some chicken hot dogs all
the time with that stinky as beer pussy.

1906
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:35,070
Yeah, totally. But too much vegetables,
micro farts thing. So yeah. Really? Yeah.

1907
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:38,990
More than meat. I don't know.
I find vegetarian Scully,

1908
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,730
vegetarians have the worst far
too ever. Oh my God. Oh Man.

1909
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:46,240
I guess eve you think about it
until like one vegetables rot. Yeah.

1910
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:50,360
Shit is terrible. Meet Roddick
smells worse. It's got to
smell worse, man. You know,

1911
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:54,610
it's really gross. It's not meet Rod.
I challenged. I was challenged by a,

1912
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:56,530
I was defining it in my head by thickness.

1913
01:47:56,531 --> 01:48:00,360
You've never smelled my
friend Tate Fletcher's farts.
Now I'm kind of great shit.

1914
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:03,010
Really do that. Sometimes you don't
even know what you're talking about son.

1915
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:04,870
You think you do you think you know,

1916
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:08,380
smelling farts like when you get like
one of these UFC motherfuckers farts on,

1917
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:11,840
you rotate dudes who are digging pro tubs,

1918
01:48:11,841 --> 01:48:16,180
the synthesix all day and I try to
stay a maintain it about two 39,

1919
01:48:16,181 --> 01:48:20,540
239 pounds of muscle and they fought
and just clear out buildings. Yep. Yep.

1920
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:23,830
Yo our friend Tate. I always
find the better, uh, the shape.

1921
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:27,060
The persons in the worst. Their farts
are really, it's cause the protein man,

1922
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:31,130
they a lot of protein that should
cakes up inside you and formed pockets.

1923
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:34,810
Just stews and then finally
comes out in a gaseous form.

1924
01:48:34,811 --> 01:48:37,080
I've been having some pretty bad
ones lately. I don't know why.

1925
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:39,070
And I keep reviewing my
diet and my head and go,

1926
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:42,940
what the fuck is causing this dead
animal in my body to come out?

1927
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:46,750
I love Indian food man.
And if you eat Indian food,

1928
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,610
you know there's a place
down the street from me.

1929
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,960
You know the reason why you
know your farts smell that way.

1930
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:57,760
Like when you smell Indian food,
Indian food farts are very specific to,

1931
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,860
because they're very normal to me.

1932
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:04,510
See for me in our house it'd be like
somebody with a partner would smell.

1933
01:49:04,511 --> 01:49:06,250
My Dad boy who ate macaroni and

1934
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:13,380
somebody's been eating shit in this house
in fifth grade they let a hamburger in

1935
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:13,801
fifth grade.

1936
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:16,890
Our teachers actually had to pull the
whole class aside cause our one Indian guy

1937
01:49:16,891 --> 01:49:19,010
named Omar for sure they had they,

1938
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,380
I guess everyone made fun of his farts
cause they smelled different than owners

1939
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:26,160
and so they had to like explain to our
class when he was out in the hallway that

1940
01:49:26,161 --> 01:49:29,160
do not make fun of him. He eats, he
has a special diet and they have,

1941
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:33,120
that's hilarious.
I remember that clear as day Port Omar,

1942
01:49:33,121 --> 01:49:35,460
if you're out there religious
special diets or the other

1943
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:39,500
shit man, I have a buddy of mine that
was, makes me lucky and he was a fighter.

1944
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:43,340
He was a taekwondo fighter and
he used to on Ramadan, you know,

1945
01:49:43,341 --> 01:49:46,580
you're not allowed to,
I don't know exactly what the masses,

1946
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:49,480
you fast until sun down down.
You think you're allowed to drink

1947
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:53,510
water, right? Nothing. Yeah. I don't even
think you could do shit. And so, you know,

1948
01:49:53,511 --> 01:49:56,900
he would still compete even though
he had to do this, you know,

1949
01:49:56,930 --> 01:50:00,710
but it would just just wreck him
physically. He was just useless, you know,

1950
01:50:00,711 --> 01:50:03,920
like it didn't, one of them was there a
basketball player that did that as well.

1951
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:07,940
There was like a famous basketball player,
Chemo Xuan I believe it was,

1952
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:11,540
was it him? I don't remember what it was
cause I'm not really a basketball fan,

1953
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:13,610
but it was one shut up man.

1954
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:16,280
There was one famous basketball
player who used to do this.

1955
01:50:16,281 --> 01:50:17,960
He's to the Robin Don
thing and he couldn't eat.

1956
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,350
Then he would go play basketball suck.
They're like, whenever the fucking,

1957
01:50:21,351 --> 01:50:23,840
you know, people would get pissed off
and over Ramadan would come around.

1958
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,730
I don't remember who it was, but uh, it's,

1959
01:50:26,731 --> 01:50:31,580
it's weird when people stick so fucking
rigidly to like weird little rules.

1960
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:34,850
Like that about eating. You know,
like, yeah, I don't get that.

1961
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,970
That's a luxury of people
that have too much food.

1962
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,270
If that's what you're coming up with,
you should be just eating to stay healthy.

1963
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:45,410
All right. Stop. Stop with the, you know,
if you're going to fucking love God,

1964
01:50:45,411 --> 01:50:48,970
go love God. You don't have to love God
with your food. You fucking freak. Yeah.

1965
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,590
You have to deny yourself
a food when you have it.

1966
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:54,470
Jesus Christ who put the food there.
If you believe in God,

1967
01:50:54,471 --> 01:50:56,690
don't you think he'd put the food in
your life? He wants you to eat it.

1968
01:50:56,691 --> 01:50:59,930
You fuck it doesn't want you to
starving yourself all day for his love.

1969
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:01,430
He made the whole universe.

1970
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:04,340
He you think he's impressed with
you starving yourself all day,

1971
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,360
dear God, I did not eat that pig
today. Yeah, it gave me the eye.

1972
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:13,440
I'm addicted to Crock pots right
now. Really? Tell me what's so nice.

1973
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:16,410
You just throw chicken in there.
Put some lemons in there. Wait,

1974
01:51:16,411 --> 01:51:20,310
six hours later you have like
our real hardcore meal, you know,

1975
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:24,980
hardcore chicken and lemon in a
crockpot. Yeah, the old south.

1976
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:28,350
Delightful. I'm staking some
vegetables in there. Bam.

1977
01:51:28,351 --> 01:51:31,530
You got these steps a difference in
you and I right there in a nutshell.

1978
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:36,050
I like cooking over fire
when it's cold outside.

1979
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,730
Outside. Yeah. Like, and I like real wood,

1980
01:51:38,731 --> 01:51:42,750
but what you're talking about Goldie
three here, it's been 83 here in la.

1981
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:46,680
40. I used to like do it in Colorado,
but I did it with a gun in my pocket.

1982
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:51,120
But I lived in Colorado because I
was cooking meat outside, you know,

1983
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:55,200
with fucking wild animals. I
lived in the woods. Dude. I know.

1984
01:51:55,201 --> 01:51:57,930
I remember when you left. Yeah,
I lived there for a few months.

1985
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:00,930
If it wasn't for the wife, I'd still
be out there. I remember you, uh,

1986
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:04,140
listened to our one podcast when
we were talking about third base.

1987
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:07,840
Remember he was texting at the time.
It's right, right. What was it?

1988
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,050
What was the issue that came
out and I can't remember.

1989
01:52:10,051 --> 01:52:15,051
You guys were looking for the name of
pace that that leads to search [inaudible]

1990
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,450
Minister Pete. Nice Prime
Minister Pete. Nice.

1991
01:52:18,451 --> 01:52:22,320
And there was in search and Richie
rich, I believe was their Dj. Yeah,

1992
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:25,500
those guys were good dude.
Why? What happened to them?

1993
01:52:25,501 --> 01:52:30,360
How come they disparage started a clothing
company and why did he stop rapping?

1994
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:33,870
I don't know. You can't
wrap forever. Why can't you?

1995
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,130
Why not to stand up? There's only
so many and do stand up forever.

1996
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:41,310
You can't be too successful and
just keep wrapping. You know?

1997
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:46,010
Why not babies? I don't
know. Why can't you? I

1998
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,250
know. It's a young man's sport.
This rapping. It's like a,

1999
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:51,710
it's almost like an a
a sport. Really? Yeah.

2000
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:54,240
Why is it is because the young man are,

2001
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:58,590
we appreciate a certain amount of swagger
and cockiness and confidence in young

2002
01:52:58,591 --> 01:53:01,200
men when we see it. An
old man. It's stupid.

2003
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,890
Especially men that aren't too old yet.
Yeah.

2004
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:05,820
We'll accept it again once you hit 90

2005
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:08,560
yeah, exactly. You know, it's like
watching old fighters. You're like, man,

2006
01:53:08,561 --> 01:53:12,770
I remember when you were good. He
slowed down. Yeah. You're not going to,

2007
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:14,110
reflexes aren't the same.

2008
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:16,710
What was that her days?
Oh,

2009
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:20,890
that's one of the weirdest things ever
is watching a fighter deteriorate. Very,

2010
01:53:20,891 --> 01:53:23,880
very strange thing. God dammit. Jeff,

2011
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:26,710
you mother fuckers is m yes it is.

2012
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:31,690
I'm doing a podcast,
I'll tell you about pop goes.

2013
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,410
Yeah, that was a good one.
That was a, they were,

2014
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,870
see this is like one of
the first hater songs.

2015
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:42,760
They were upset at a vanilla ice
getting paid. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

2016
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,160
For turning this out.
Turn this up.

2017
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,800
That's right. He's dressed up as
vanilla ice. The complaint is,

2018
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:52,820
I should have started when was against
phony phony entertainers like what

2019
01:53:52,821 --> 01:53:56,960
they're doing is valid bulletin veil.
Isis doing was not paid.

2020
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,610
It's 91 so something's got to change

2021
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,910
10 years ago.
Pick the music and makes sense.

2022

01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:46,110
but they're right here so
you don't make fun of them.

2048
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:49,290
I have a slight possibility to
sleep with Britney spears zone.

2049
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,010
Well he definitely did that.
You know,

2050
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:56,280
in the right category still vanilla ice
was like legit superstar performer for a

2051
01:55:56,281 --> 01:55:59,430
short period of time. Had a few big
hits. Scott that do it yourself.

2052
01:55:59,431 --> 01:56:01,920
Sean has come up. Do you
remember what Vanilla I, he does.

2053
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:07,110
He's a renovation show on like the HGTV.
Really understand. That's hilarious.

2054
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:11,390
Do you remember when a vanilla
ice boxed Todd, what did he do?

2055
01:56:11,391 --> 01:56:16,200
Did he bought Todd bridges? Todd bridges
beat the fuck out of Vanilla ice horse.

2056
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,980
Of course.
Sort of bridges is black.

2057
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:24,981
That and the other guys trying to be
black and now he's doing [inaudible].

2058
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,070
It's always any kind of trying
to be blind. For instance,

2059
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:31,650
I have a real black blacks,
always real black.

2060
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,500
Oh Dude, that's, there
is some logic and science

2061
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:41,350
to what you just said. Yes, of course.
A guy who's trying to be black,

2062
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:46,510
talking to a guy who's black
fighting. So true. So true.

2063
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:50,680
There's no way he could win. Never. He
should have known going into that contest,

2064
01:56:50,681 --> 01:56:51,350
still

2065
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:52,500
can deliberately newsy.

2066
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:56,670
Maybe thought that Todd bridges was
a fake black because he was a child

2067
01:56:56,671 --> 01:56:59,490
celebrity and he was on different strokes,
raised by a white,

2068
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:03,690
but he was only raised by a white
on TV and not collated from that.

2069
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,310
All that Hollywood shit crack cleaned
them out of that crack, cleaned that out,

2070
01:57:08,311 --> 01:57:11,640
and brought him back to his roots ghetto,

2071
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:16,380
back to his inner ghetto tide had Dana
on this side too. Not White either.

2072
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:23,010
Plato. Mm. That was a,
that's a disturbed show, man.

2073
01:57:23,011 --> 01:57:25,260
When you look at all the things that
happened to those people on that show,

2074
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,690
you got to go, Whoa, what the fuck,

2075
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,050
Tom?
He's the last man standing.

2076
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:34,360
Yeah,
and and Dana Plato all fucked up.

2077
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:38,200
Huge celebrities on TV.

2078
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:42,280
Everybody's had them and now he's doing
ICDC commercials. What does that mean?

2079
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:46,420
I is it ICDC? Yeah, the
College Community College,

2080
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:50,790
we had them on the fear factor who
was, um, it was a very angry guy. Man.

2081
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:52,620
There's some dudes where you,

2082
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:55,410
you like you're hanging out with them and
you're talking to them or whatever and

2083
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:58,050
you go, oh, okay, I can, I
can tell you in 10 minutes,

2084
01:57:58,290 --> 01:58:02,280
90% of what's wrong with your life.
It's the way you're fucking acting man.

2085
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,440
Who's like a spoiled child.

2086
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,190
Like when he lost and he got eliminated
from the shell, he goes, okay.

2087
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:09,740
Oh, I see what's up. I see what's
up. You guys don't want me to win.

2088
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,770
Like he was like, like a child and
he was like a man in his thirties.

2089
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,780
I went to shake his hand and need the
cockroaches. I wanted to shake his hand.

2090
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:18,410
Yeah, exactly. He wouldn't shake hands

2091
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:22,240
me. And I'm like, okay, good, good.
I'm glad. I'm glad to get out of here.

2092
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,430
Who Was it? That one episode where the
guy wanted to, we had to slap down. Yeah.

2093
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:29,900
Oh yeah, there was a couple, there
was a couple. And they've, they've,

2094
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:32,720
they've fought with each other all the
time and screamed and yell at each other

2095
01:58:32,721 --> 01:58:36,110
like one, one time on a, on a show.
He had thrown her to the ground.

2096
01:58:36,111 --> 01:58:38,360
I'm one of the shows and another
reality show they were on.

2097
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,010
So we had been told that this guy was
like violent and they could be dangerous.

2098
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:44,470
And so, um, we, uh,

2099
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:49,060
we did the show and the girl had been
taunted the whole time the show is going

2100
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:53,290
on. It was the guy, the guy's name was,
um, Jonathan and I forget what his wife's,

2101
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,960
Victoria was, his wife.
And there was another kid,

2102
01:58:55,990 --> 01:59:00,850
the dude who got fucked up by Danny
Bonaduce once he was on survivor,

2103
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:05,380
Johnny, fuck, I can't
remember his name. Anyway,

2104
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:09,430
Johnny. Anyway, what happens was
this kid is an awesome shit talker.

2105
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,680
And while they were off,
they're doing their stunts.

2106
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:16,540
He was like screaming at them,
Jonathan, you can do better.

2107
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:21,010
She's dead weight. She's dead weight
man. And she's holding you back.

2108
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,690
And it was really funny,
man,

2109
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:26,020
because they were frustrated and yelling
and screaming at each other and he was

2110
01:59:26,021 --> 01:59:30,820
like dumper, and she was like, Yo,
shop. And he's like, you see this man,

2111
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,920
this is bad energy, dude.
You don't need this.

2112
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,620
And so he's like totally torturing
them while they're don't go into their

2113
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:37,810
stunting, they're fucking up and
they can't find their flashlight.

2114
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:41,380
It's a disaster. Right? So when, when
they come back, after they got eliminated,

2115
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:43,480
the girl walks up to this Johnny kid,

2116
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:47,980
Johnny fucking forget his name and
punches him. Just straight up hits him.

2117
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,650
And I go, Whoa, Whoa, what the fuck?

2118
01:59:50,651 --> 01:59:55,030
You can't assault people
trying to fairplay thank you.
That's him. And I'm like,

2119
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:55,930
just because you,

2120
01:59:55,931 --> 01:59:59,110
you fucking hit your husband doesn't
mean you can hit other people.

2121
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:01,180
And then the husband goes,
hey.

2122
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:04,930
And he gets in my face and all I could
think to say was, no, hey, hey, hey.

2123
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:08,180
He says, hey, hey, hey. So I said, no.

2124
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,690
All I can think of is this guy's
going to hit me. Like for sure.

2125
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:15,750
He was a total loose cannon and he was
screaming and yelling at his wife just

2126
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,070
seconds ago,
and now he's like in my face and I'm like,

2127
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:21,580
this guy easily could hit me. So
I shoved him away from me. I said,

2128
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:24,610
get the fuck out of my face. Don't
touch me, don't come close to me.

2129
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,390
And then he came back again and he goes,
touch me again.

2130
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:31,690
And then I just pushed him again
and then I grabbed his head.

2131
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:34,450
Then I grabbed the back of his head
and I just held onto them. I was like,

2132
02:00:34,451 --> 02:00:34,931
if he hits me,

2133
02:00:34,931 --> 02:00:38,710
I'm going to nee is fucking brain
into another part of the universe,

2134
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,110
but I'm not going to do anything
until he tries to hit me.

2135
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,260
So I just held onto him, but I was
convinced that he was going to hit me.

2136
02:00:44,261 --> 02:00:46,780
It was like, you just go straight.
Held him down on, anyway,

2137
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:49,060
I just grabbed the back of his head.
I got him in a Thai clinch,

2138
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,210
has grabbed the back of his head. I
just, it was right there, just grab it.

2139
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:55,800
I was like, I wasn't gonna choke him. I
thought about choking him, but I'm like,

2140
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:57,310
if I choke them,
then I've done something to them.

2141
02:00:57,311 --> 02:00:59,050
Right now I'm just holding
onto him. Oh, sorry.

2142
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:03,700
I just grabbed a hold of his head and I
just handled them until they pulled us

2143
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:07,160
apart. But no, nothing ever
happened. But it was, uh, it's,

2144
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:10,900
it's weird when there's someone that's
that dangerous at someone's, that,

2145
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:15,100
that has that little control over their,
their physicality and their emotions.

2146
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:18,040
Those are usually the guys that I've
never been punched in their face usually.

2147
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:20,380
Yes.
Usually guys that I was run off with,

2148
02:01:20,381 --> 02:01:24,580
the lips never been punched in the mouth.
Usually he completely panicked.

2149
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:27,520
Once I grabbed him, he went like a
child. He didn't know what to do.

2150
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:31,060
He didn't know to hit me or push me away.
So he didn't do anything.

2151
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:36,040
He kind of just flailed his arms in
this weird, like panicky moving thing.

2152
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,940
You know, most people are
not used to conflict like
conflict. When you do Jujitsu,

2153
02:01:40,941 --> 02:01:44,070
you know, you used to physical conflict
all the time. It's like a normal thing.

2154
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:46,820
Just, it's not, it doesn't seem unnatural.

2155
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:49,280
But for a lot of people
don't fucking hyperventilate.

2156
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:52,880
Like I've seen people in the street street
fights just straight hyperventilate,

2157
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:56,420
freak out and not know what to do,
not know how to handle themselves.

2158
02:01:57,470 --> 02:02:00,830
It's not cool. It's not good to be
around fucking crazy creepy people,

2159
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,920
but if you're going to be around
crazy creepy people, it's way better.

2160
02:02:03,921 --> 02:02:04,850
If you know how to fight,

2161
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:08,120
the last thing you want is them knowing
how to fight and they're crazy and

2162
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:13,121
creepy and you're the last fucking this
fucking drowning in this ocean of panic.

2163
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:15,160
What are you doing?
Reading

2164
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:17,040
tests? I'm reading, I'm
reading these walks your talk.

2165
02:02:17,041 --> 02:02:18,560
One sided conversation where him,

2166
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:22,030
I'm listening and I'm reading
these and maybe we should end this.

2167
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:25,720
Maybe it's time has come. This is
what I did is what happens when every,

2168
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:30,050
every show comes to an end.
Eventually after a while.
Brian, so do it. We're going,

2169
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:31,420
what are we going to keep talking about?

2170
02:02:31,870 --> 02:02:34,230
Carlos Newton at the fight
when I was there. Did you I,

2171
02:02:34,270 --> 02:02:37,660
I trained with him a couple of times.
How long have you done Jujitsu?

2172
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,950
I just used to roll around with the,
there's a comedian named Ron Jostle.

2173
02:02:40,951 --> 02:02:44,200
Leta a Canada. Oh yeah, back in
[inaudible] 97 I used to bark.

2174
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:48,610
I stopped boxing in 94 but he wanted to
learn how to strike in [inaudible] 97

2175
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:52,600
and he was doing Jujitsu and I was
like you will never get past the boxer.

2176
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,451
Oh that's fun.

2177
02:02:53,451 --> 02:02:56,890
And in seconds I was screaming like a
bitch cause he had me in an arm bar.

2178
02:02:57,430 --> 02:03:00,520
And so then you learned it? Yeah, I
try trained with them for a little bit.

2179
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:03,340
That's cool. Do you do anything now? No.

2180
02:03:03,341 --> 02:03:05,620
That's why I was asking because I
want to go somewhere and do something.

2181
02:03:05,621 --> 02:03:08,170
Cause where do you spend the majority
of your time? While on the road.

2182
02:03:08,171 --> 02:03:12,700
But I'm gonna be here now for a while.
Okay. Well with the new developments.

2183
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:16,510
Yeah. Where? Well you don't want to
tell me where you live on the air.

2184
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:20,790
Just fucking people are creepy man.
Angeles. Whoa. That's very savvy.

2185
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,040
They want to know where you are.
They, where are you Russell?

2186
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,390
I need to talk to you.

2187
02:03:25,391 --> 02:03:28,040
I tried to look in the bag and have
given you scripts and shit. Yeah,

2188
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:31,450
it didn't have a TV show
coming out. I have, I have a
deal with NBC, but we don't,

2189
02:03:31,451 --> 02:03:34,840
you know, waiting on that script.
Right. I don't get any scripts. No.

2190
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:36,850
You don't get any scripts?
What do you mean how?

2191
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:38,530
I mean the agency sends them to me,

2192
02:03:38,531 --> 02:03:42,460
but it's not like here they want
you for this film. It's like,

2193
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:46,020
see if you like anything in the here and
then I'll try and get you an audition.

2194
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:49,360
I'm like, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm not
going to start fucking reading things.

2195
02:03:49,361 --> 02:03:50,920
Guess it just for the sake of you.

2196
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:54,330
Well, I think that with your
popularity is a comedian.

2197
02:03:54,331 --> 02:03:55,860
Doing a sitcom would be a natural thing.

2198
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:59,340
It would just get somebody really good
and write something for you. Totally.

2199
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:03,550
The fuck is wrong with them. Cooking or
writing more time shutting up. Brian,

2200
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:08,890
fuck is wrong with you, Brian. How about
a news radio type of thing? That was,

2201
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:12,640
that was so high. Can my brother,
my brother has every season on DVD.

2202
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:16,210
It's hard to do one of those though.
You got to get the most important things.

2203
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,880
You have to have a powerful
writer and a powerful producer.

2204
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:22,120
The guy's got to be good.
They have to good with good sensibilities.

2205
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:24,430
There's just not a lot of them.
There's a lot of them are hand.

2206
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:27,640
You had a lot of good people
and you, yeah. Yeah. You
can get good people though.

2207
02:04:27,641 --> 02:04:30,460
There's a lot of good people. You
could do three, four, five, six,

2208
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:33,010
seven casts of good people in La.

2209
02:04:33,011 --> 02:04:36,880
You can find a lot of talented
comedic actors, you know,

2210
02:04:36,881 --> 02:04:40,320
that could put it into TV shows and if
you figured out how to write specifically

2211
02:04:40,321 --> 02:04:43,800
for them, you could have it really good.
It's, you know, a lot of that is luck.

2212
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:46,710
It's really hard as finding the
right writing and find, cause look,

2213
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:48,720
look after news radio,

2214
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:52,890
how many of us went off and did and did
successful sitcoms on our own? None.

2215
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:56,520
None of us did. You know, everyone
tried. I had a couple of pilots.

2216
02:04:56,521 --> 02:05:00,900
I had a couple of things
that I was writing and things
that I did or things that

2217
02:05:00,901 --> 02:05:04,260
I went up for. It's just, it's too
hard to find something good. You know?

2218
02:05:04,261 --> 02:05:07,620
I would get these things and I would
read them and I'd be like, fuck man,

2219
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:10,560
I couldn't do this. Like
this is clunky, dumb,

2220
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:14,700
hacky horseshit and once you do like
a really good show, it's hard man.

2221
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,740
So terrible feeling for a stand up to
be doing shitty comedy and might even be

2222
02:05:19,741 --> 02:05:23,130
able to change it.
That's a terrible feeling that I get to.

2223
02:05:23,131 --> 02:05:26,580
I get that story edit once it's
written, so that's good. Yeah.

2224
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:30,330
You get to the story on it. Oh that's
great man. If you write your own shit,

2225
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:33,240
if you had your own idea and sat
down and came up with your own shit,

2226
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,920
that would be the move,
man.

2227
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:38,220
That would be the move because you're the
only guy that really can write for you

2228
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:41,640
and you can't get some fucking dude
who's not really even a standup.

2229
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:42,770
It was like some sort of a,

2230
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:47,670
you've got to find like a really
powerful fucking really bright guy

2231
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:52,520
to news radio but haven't podcasting.
I'm listening and it's our life,

2232
02:05:52,521 --> 02:05:54,950
Brian. It's 24 hours a day.
Right. And just because,

2233
02:05:54,951 --> 02:05:56,540
I mean if you think
about it like the news,

2234
02:05:56,541 --> 02:05:59,900
radio things good like radios are pretty
much dead. Dad seen on the new things,

2235
02:05:59,901 --> 02:06:02,280
podcasting have a sitcom
around podcasting and mixed.

2236
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:05,210
It was mixed up with friends.
Maybe have like a little black child,

2237
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,820
like different strokes.
That's not a bet. No,

2238
02:06:07,821 --> 02:06:12,200
you don't want to go different strokes.
You're on Fox right back then. No.

2239
02:06:12,201 --> 02:06:13,310
NBC News Radio.

2240
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:16,870
You see I was on a show on Fox before
that they'll call hardball. That was full.

2241
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,220
There was only like seven episodes,

2242
02:06:19,221 --> 02:06:23,420
I think aired maybe six [inaudible]
seven shot, terrible show.

2243
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:26,690
And there was a yours? No,
it was, I was the star of it,

2244
02:06:26,691 --> 02:06:29,210
but it was a baseball show
on was one of the stars.

2245
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:32,270
There's a bunch of other people
in it. But uh, it was, uh,

2246
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:36,020
it was one of those shows that
was really funny at one point.

2247
02:06:36,021 --> 02:06:38,650
And then you got butchered.
The guys who wrote it as guys,

2248
02:06:38,690 --> 02:06:41,900
Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran,
they wrote for um, uh,

2249
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:45,320
they wrote for a married with children.
They wrote for the Simpsons. Really,

2250
02:06:45,321 --> 02:06:49,970
really funny guys. But the network didn't
think that they could produce a show.

2251
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:52,970
They didn't think that they could, like,
they were hard enough to run a show.

2252
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:57,050
So what they wanted to do was give it to
a producer and that producer took over

2253
02:06:57,051 --> 02:07:00,080
and just started rewriting everything
and turned it into their show runner.

2254
02:07:00,081 --> 02:07:03,350
Jack that up. Shit, it became dog shit.

2255
02:07:03,351 --> 02:07:07,450
Just total hackneyed obvious dog shed.
And um,

2256
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,700
that's not fun, you know, and
that's what a lot of happen.

2257
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,590
A lot of that happens in Hollywood.
You know,

2258
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:16,100
there's a lot of weird nepotism where
they know that a guy worked on a

2259
02:07:16,101 --> 02:07:20,090
successful show. It's like he must have
the magic. He worked on coach. Yep.

2260
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:22,370
You know, so they, they
bring the coach man in. Yeah.

2261
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:25,190
The system, the from called. They
always do that with 10 coach.

2262
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:29,480
They always do that with me. Yeah. You
know, Russell, this is, this is, this is,

2263
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:32,210
this is what we've done before
and it's worked, and I go, well,

2264
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:36,160
clearly everything I've done in my
career is not been the regular. Right,

2265
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:36,940
right.

2266
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:40,990
I didn't get to this level because I fall
on the same path that you think is the,

2267
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:45,460
the, the, the key to success here.
The key to humor too. Yeah. Yeah.

2268
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:50,650
Yeah. The key to humor is like, man, it's
so hard to gauge one person's humor. Like,

2269
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:55,930
I don't know if I could do it as,
as a comic and a comedian and a writer.

2270
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:58,780
I don't know if I could
take someone else's comedy,

2271
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:02,590
I would have to be so intimate with that
person's comedy till I try to write a,

2272
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:07,180
a plot or an idea for them, like
you're going to get, you know,

2273
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:10,000
your idea of what their ideas would be.

2274
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:12,680
I think Louie CK did it the
best thing I did it, I'm, so,

2275
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:15,550
that's probably the best example
of how to do it. Perfect.

2276
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:18,760
Is that a new show on Fx, right?
Yeah. The new show. Yeah. Yeah.

2277
02:08:18,761 --> 02:08:22,960
He totally got it right. I
watched a couple episodes.
He, he's, I love Louie. Yeah,

2278
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:26,140
he's perfect. He's doing exactly the
right way. Why don't you marry him?

2279
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:30,520
You married him. You guys aren't
gonna marry him, ginger babies.

2280
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:34,150
Um, no, we're not going to marry him. I am

2281
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:38,140
Brian.
I think you died 10 minutes ago.

2282
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:44,260
Your body's being run by bacteria.
Coconut water, your body. Yes.

2283
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:47,650
Your body is being run by bacteria that
was living in the coconut water and I

2284
02:08:47,651 --> 02:08:50,950
die. It's going to be like aliens where
that robot dyes and all that milk starts

2285
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:53,500
coming out of them. Let me ask you a
question that you already asked me.

2286
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:57,820
What do you think about all
this? 2012 Shit? Um, I dunno.

2287
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:02,980
I keep watching all these things and uh,
what's that? Uh, no. Bureau, that planet,

2288
02:09:02,981 --> 02:09:04,810
they said it's going
to hit us. Well, yeah.

2289
02:09:04,811 --> 02:09:09,610
Well there they did discover a large
object they believe exists way outside of

2290
02:09:09,611 --> 02:09:14,430
Pluto, some large Jupiter sized
object. Have you ever had meat,

2291
02:09:14,431 --> 02:09:16,060
you Kako on your show?
No,

2292
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:19,660
but I got a chance to talk to him once
on the opiod Anthony show and ask them a

2293
02:09:19,661 --> 02:09:22,600
bunch of questions. He was on the
phone. It's fucking great man.

2294
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:25,660
That guy's awesome. I do love
that guy. He's, he's really smart.

2295
02:09:25,661 --> 02:09:27,580
God there's people like him out there.
Yeah.

2296
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:31,920
Cause I don't have that kind of patients,
you know, like these theoretical planes.

2297
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:36,700
Well he's so educated and intelligent
and his whole life has been, you know,

2298
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:40,690
in this pursuit of wisdom. I don't
know if that kind of devotion to shit,

2299
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,890
you know,
it's like my,

2300
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:47,310
my thing about so many things is like how
much time would it really take to kind

2301
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:50,200
of understand what the
fuck this guy really knows.

2302
02:09:50,201 --> 02:09:52,570
Like when you hear about string theory,
you know,

2303
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:54,940
and you hear about like you
just the idea behind it,

2304
02:09:55,120 --> 02:10:00,070
how long would you really have to study
it before you truly understood what the

2305
02:10:00,071 --> 02:10:00,880
fuck they're talking about?

2306
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,570
I've watched documentaries on string
theory a bunch of times and I never really

2307
02:10:04,571 --> 02:10:06,940
know what I'm taking away. But I know
I'm fascinated with the whole time.

2308
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:10,750
Fascinating the whole time. But just
like what you know, there could be,

2309
02:10:10,751 --> 02:10:14,740
I watched one with c w with Michio Kaku
where he's talking about there could be

2310
02:10:14,741 --> 02:10:19,741
another you and another dimension that
took a left when you took a right and he

2311
02:10:19,931 --> 02:10:24,040
went out on a totally different life
journey is happening right now, Simon,

2312
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:28,060
talking about parallel universes and
that there might be an infinite number of

2313
02:10:28,061 --> 02:10:32,260
used doing the same life and going in an
infinite number of different directions

2314
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:35,300
all at once. And then there's
the other thought that you, your,

2315
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:40,330
you are traveling and transgressing
through different parallel dimensions all

2316
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:41,270
the time.

2317
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:44,930
And the one you exist in right now is
the one you exist and because of your

2318
02:10:44,931 --> 02:10:48,790
choices and literally is not the same
one as the one you started off in,

2319
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:52,070
that you have been with every
decision you make in your life.

2320
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:56,060
You're moving into a new dimension.
You're moving into some new universe,

2321
02:10:56,061 --> 02:11:00,380
some new parallel existence.
What the fuck are we talking about?

2322
02:11:00,381 --> 02:11:02,420
Folks were talking crazy shit.

2323
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:08,080
Um, I was in Houston. I'm, I'm almost,

2324
02:11:08,081 --> 02:11:12,090
I'm so fascinated by the moon
landing thing. Oh, are you? Yeah.

2325
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:14,350
You may as well because I was,
so,

2326
02:11:14,351 --> 02:11:19,351
I was in Houston recently and there was
this Indian girl waiting by the bus for

2327
02:11:20,231 --> 02:11:24,100
an autograph and a picture.
Very nice, very innocent.

2328
02:11:24,101 --> 02:11:27,760
And she was like, I just wanted to take
a picture. She's from India to write.

2329
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:30,100
I was like, cool, no
problems. She goes, you know,

2330
02:11:30,101 --> 02:11:33,520
my whole class at the university is
all big fans. I'm like, that's great.

2331
02:11:33,521 --> 02:11:36,490
Thank you very much, didn't
you? I go, what are you guys
studying? And she said, uh,

2332
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:40,870
um, astrophysicist. I'm
like, are you kidding me?

2333
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:42,250
I go so well,
like,

2334
02:11:42,251 --> 02:11:45,820
what do you mean you designing spacecrafts
who were studying it and we're,

2335
02:11:45,850 --> 02:11:49,240
you know, we, yes, we are. That's
ultimately what we're doing. And I said,

2336
02:11:49,241 --> 02:11:53,560
so let me ask you a question. Have we
gone to the moon? And she goes, they say,

2337
02:11:53,561 --> 02:11:58,270
we've gone to the moon. I go, I
go, what does that mean? Well,

2338
02:11:58,271 --> 02:12:02,860
they said, we went to the moon. I go, so
is it possible that we went to the moon?

2339
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:05,860
No, it's not possible that we went
to the moon, but they've said,

2340
02:12:05,861 --> 02:12:06,694
we went to the moon.

2341
02:12:07,690 --> 02:12:12,550
It's physically impossible to go to
the moon in this day and age. She said,

2342
02:12:12,551 --> 02:12:14,800
that is not possible then
how would it be possible now?

2343
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:17,140
What was her reasoning for
saying that it's possible?

2344
02:12:17,141 --> 02:12:21,970
She said the van Allen Radiation Belt,
she said it would peel off your skin.

2345
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:25,210
She said, it's not like, you know, it's
not like it would affect your later.

2346
02:12:25,211 --> 02:12:28,050
She said it would literally your
skin would fall off. We can't

2347
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:29,710
devil's advocate though.

2348
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:34,090
There are readings of the
Van Allen Radiation Belt
they've released online that

2349
02:12:34,091 --> 02:12:38,020
you could find where they show the levels
that are out there and the amount of

2350
02:12:38,021 --> 02:12:41,200
exposure to the astronauts would have
gone through if they did what they said

2351
02:12:41,201 --> 02:12:41,980
they did.

2352
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:45,430
And there's a bunch of people that
have said that they would survive it.

2353
02:12:46,330 --> 02:12:47,650
That's all just on paper though.

2354
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:51,640
My problem with it is they never sent
a fucking chicken in the space and have

2355
02:12:51,641 --> 02:12:55,210
that motherfucker come back alive
and they did it with astronauts.

2356
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:58,420
They did it with American civilian
or American, uh, you know,

2357
02:12:58,421 --> 02:13:02,530
astronauts during the apex of
a 20 year solar cycle. Really,

2358
02:13:02,531 --> 02:13:03,780
you went all the way out there?
Yeah.

2359
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:06,730
Yeah. She said it's just too
far to, it would take too long.

2360
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:10,240
There's no way they got up there and
then send a transmission back that quick

2361
02:13:10,241 --> 02:13:13,780
either. Yeah. That's kind of trippy
to, she's like, there's no way.

2362
02:13:13,781 --> 02:13:16,300
Like there's just,
it's not physically possible.

2363
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:20,260
What's really trippy is that only did they
do that. They actually timed the, the,

2364
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:23,000
the,
the panning of the camera from,

2365
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:28,060
from Houston to catch the lunar module
as it separates from the moon surface and

2366
02:13:28,611 --> 02:13:31,190
they follow it up.
The time the Pan,

2367
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:36,300
like they timed all that on a delay from,
from Houston. Like maybe they did it,

2368
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,310
maybe they did it.
She knew I wasn't there.

2369
02:13:38,311 --> 02:13:41,670
She literally pointed at my iPhone and
said, you have more technology in this,

2370
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:45,120
true than you did. And all of that.
It's not just about technology,

2371
02:13:45,121 --> 02:13:48,780
it's about calculations. It's
about thrust, it's about speed.

2372
02:13:48,781 --> 02:13:51,690
It's about catching the,
the, you know, the, the,

2373
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:54,240
the rotation of the movement
coming back along with it.

2374
02:13:54,241 --> 02:13:58,380
It's the slingshot effect. And, but I'm
not saying that they, I'm not saying that.

2375
02:13:58,381 --> 02:14:00,840
I think they did do it cause
I'm not convinced they went.

2376
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:05,460
But you got to make sure that when
you argue about things like this,

2377
02:14:05,461 --> 02:14:08,220
like that the science,
the science is really tricky.

2378
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:11,010
Like you have to know way too much to
really know what the fuck you talking

2379
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:15,930
about. I don't, I don't, but what
I do know is I know bullshit.

2380
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:21,030
Okay. And I'm real good at bullshit. I'm
Mama if you lie to me, man, I can tell.

2381
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:25,320
I can see twitches in your eyes.
I can smell bullshit a mile away.

2382
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:29,190
I've been around so many creeps
my whole life I just fucking,

2383
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:33,300
and just being a comedian and being
a student of the human animal,

2384
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:36,660
when you watch the Apollo 11
press conference when they,

2385
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,130
the post flight press conference,

2386
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:42,990
that to me was one of the biggest pieces
of evidence that something's really

2387
02:14:42,991 --> 02:14:46,530
wrong because they're
clearly bullshitting.

2388
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,700
There's no doubt about it. If you
watch the Apollo 11 press conference,

2389
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:54,450
the post five plus post flight
press conference, they are,

2390
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:59,310
they're talking about this
like, like they're just like
making shit up. It's like,

2391
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:03,340
it doesn't seem like they have any
connection to what they're talking about.

2392
02:15:03,341 --> 02:15:07,200
It doesn't seem remotely like it was a
part of their life that you're describing.

2393
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:10,860
It seems like Horse Shit and it seems
like horse shit and they're nervous and

2394
02:15:10,861 --> 02:15:14,730
they're answering questions. You
know, it's, we've never gone back.

2395
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:15,840
We've never even come close.

2396
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:19,530
The only time human beings I've ever been
more than 400 miles above the earth's

2397
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:22,860
surface was them. The all
the, uh, the moon missions,

2398
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:26,130
all the ones when they flew over it and
didn't land and the ones that they did

2399
02:15:26,131 --> 02:15:28,710
land between 1969 in 1972,

2400
02:15:28,711 --> 02:15:32,160
they went and landed and
supposedly and came back. It's far,

2401
02:15:32,161 --> 02:15:37,050
it's 250 million or 250,000
miles, which is, think about that.

2402
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:41,220
Think about the fact they did that in
69. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.

2403
02:15:41,221 --> 02:15:43,470
Moving into 2011.
Yeah,

2404
02:15:43,471 --> 02:15:47,160
we should have had some
sort of a that's so revisit.

2405
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:50,700
Let's check and see what's that.
If anything's changed up there,

2406
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:53,700
but people look at it, man,
it's like a technological Jesus.

2407
02:15:53,701 --> 02:15:57,120
You're not supposed to question it. It's
a deity. It's a technological day day.

2408
02:15:57,270 --> 02:16:00,210
Well, yeah, I mean, but at
the same time we're also in,

2409
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:03,570
in the space race with Russia. We
had to beat them at something. Yeah,

2410
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:06,930
but did we even are where we even,
you know, at the highest levels,

2411
02:16:06,931 --> 02:16:07,461
and I wonder if,

2412
02:16:07,461 --> 02:16:11,220
what if we're going to find out a shit
and wikileaks at the highest levels.

2413
02:16:11,221 --> 02:16:14,820
I wonder how much corroboration there
is between governments and I wonder how

2414
02:16:14,821 --> 02:16:18,270
much of the fucking Cold War it's just
to keep everybody in line. You know?

2415
02:16:18,271 --> 02:16:18,871
Who knows,

2416
02:16:18,871 --> 02:16:22,860
who knows how much at the highest level
there was actual real communication and

2417
02:16:22,861 --> 02:16:26,190
exchanging of information. You know,
I don't, I don't fucking know, man.

2418
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:28,410
I don't know.
I would not pretend to know.

2419
02:16:28,411 --> 02:16:31,630
I know exactly what's going on because
then, you know, people say, well,

2420
02:16:31,631 --> 02:16:34,990
if the Russians were weren't in on it,
why didn't they write America out?

2421
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,440
I don't know. You know that doesn't mean
they didn't fake it. You know there's,

2422
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:40,700
there's a lot of fucking shit.
Yeah.

2423
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,060
Cause they never come out. Because if the
government can lie about that, they can.

2424
02:16:44,061 --> 02:16:44,990
What else can they learn?
Right.

2425
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:47,770
Everything from 1969 is cheaper,

2426
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:52,000
easier and faster to do today except
go to the mode and it's like there's

2427
02:16:52,001 --> 02:16:55,450
nothing else that jets are faster.
The weapons are better,

2428
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:57,640
the technology is better
for communication.

2429
02:16:57,910 --> 02:17:01,230
Everything's better except space travel
and everybody's will Dutch cause it's a

2430
02:17:01,231 --> 02:17:05,530
lot of money. Maybe. Maybe it's
possible that that's all it is.

2431
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:09,340
It's possible that everybody just looks
for a conspiracy and everything and it's

2432
02:17:09,341 --> 02:17:12,070
like you're just looking too hard.
And it shows, it seems crazy,

2433
02:17:12,071 --> 02:17:15,550
but it's just because there's
an atmosphere list object
and it's out in space.

2434
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:20,050
Maybe. Or maybe they faked
it. That's possible too.

2435
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:22,780
There's a lot of weird shit to it.
There's a lot of weird shit.

2436
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:25,870
But the fact that Neil Armstrong
becomes some sort of a recluse and stops

2437
02:17:25,871 --> 02:17:28,660
talking to people and
Buzz Aldrin goes insane.

2438
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:31,690
Fossil Algebra became like a serious
alcoholic after the moon landings.

2439
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:34,000
It's a weird fucking,
there's a lot of weird

2440
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:36,060
something has to get into your
head to make you turn this.

2441
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:39,720
Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit
with the fucking lunar orbiter,

2442
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:40,990
the lunar module he ever,

2443
02:17:40,991 --> 02:17:43,950
he ever watched like them try to
do that thing on earth and what,

2444
02:17:43,951 --> 02:17:48,060
there's a famous video footage of Neil
Armstrong in that thing and he objects

2445
02:17:48,210 --> 02:17:51,780
and it falls to the ground explodes
and blows up in flames. But Dan,

2446
02:17:51,781 --> 02:17:54,210
that bitch worked like a charm when
they were up there on the moon though.

2447
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,080
They got that off the whole re
engineered and figured out perfectly.

2448
02:17:58,081 --> 02:18:02,100
So it worked flawlessly on every mission.
Maybe.

2449
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:06,480
Then there's the prime minister of
Holland was given a moon rock by Neil

2450
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:10,380
Armstrong and buzz Aldrin
and they fucking recently,

2451
02:18:10,381 --> 02:18:13,380
like within the last couple of years they
found out that it's not a moon rockets,

2452
02:18:13,381 --> 02:18:18,300
petrified wood. This is in a plaque
given to them by the astronauts.

2453
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:21,360
Like here we've brought you back a
souvenir from the moon, sir. Why?

2454
02:18:21,361 --> 02:18:22,770
I picked this one myself.

2455
02:18:22,980 --> 02:18:26,520
I chipped it off and we brought it to you
because we value the relationship that

2456
02:18:26,521 --> 02:18:30,270
America has with your country.
Emails. A piece of petrified wood.

2457
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:33,510
Yeah.
I got duped into buying a watch that,

2458
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:38,580
so I'll let you watch allegedly made from
the face of a moon surface of the Moon

2459
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:41,100
from the moon rock.
Really? I saw one of those,

2460
02:18:41,101 --> 02:18:44,820
I saw it was in one of those
super rich guy magazines like a,

2461
02:18:44,821 --> 02:18:48,390
it's got Ferrari's on the cover, the
dupont registry, you know, is that,

2462
02:18:48,391 --> 02:18:52,800
where'd you got it from? No, I was in a
store that sold high end watches. Tell me,

2463
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:58,400
I'm a watch nerd. So I was like
this company Ro ro Manger Jerome.

2464
02:18:58,950 --> 02:19:01,020
How could they possibly get moon rocks?

2465
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:04,320
I don't know that that's going to be
listening. What does it mean? You know,

2466
02:19:04,321 --> 02:19:07,800
it's a federal crime to be in possession
of a moon rock. Uh, allegedly.

2467
02:19:07,801 --> 02:19:11,490
There was one point in time where they
had auctioned off a piece of moon rock

2468
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:13,560
and they'd just grounded
down to mid company.

2469
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:18,450
This company may took it and made the
inside face of the watch. Oh really?

2470
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:20,310
Just like a little thin layer of it.

2471
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:24,570
And then they made it to shape
like the moon. And then I,

2472
02:19:24,571 --> 02:19:27,920
and that same company got a piece
of the titanic was auctioned off

2473
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:30,160
and uh,
and uh,

2474
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:34,290
they made the Bezel of the watch with a
piece of the iron from the titanic. Wow.

2475
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:37,370
That one's going to believable for me.
That's totally believable. Well, I mean,

2476
02:19:37,371 --> 02:19:40,580
I guess they did bring back, no matter
what, even with unmanned spacecrafts,

2477
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:44,600
the Russians brought back a
bunch of moon dust, you know,

2478
02:19:44,601 --> 02:19:48,470
not a bunch like enough to make
100,000 fucking watches, but you know,

2479
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:51,230
there's enough to study,
you know, the, um,

2480
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:55,280
the whole subject is such a controversial
subject because it's one of one of the

2481
02:19:55,281 --> 02:20:00,281
very few subjects where people immediately
think you are fucking crazy if you

2482
02:20:00,471 --> 02:20:03,380
even think about it. Yeah.
And that's a weird thing.

2483
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:06,200
Whenever you get a subject
that's like that, where if you,

2484
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:09,440
if you even consider it, if you don't
even take a stand, if you consider it,

2485
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:13,490
you're a quack and a crazy person, it's
like, I, there are things like that,

2486
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:16,400
like the hollow earth. Yeah,
there are things like that,
but even the hollow earth,

2487
02:20:16,401 --> 02:20:19,400
I'll listen to what they have to say.
It sounds completely insane,

2488
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:23,900
but I'll listen to it. When I listened
to my Brian, I just, that hurts him.

2489
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,870
What'd you hear?
Sound like a Dork.

2490
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:30,830
Fucking see I in or knocking
or sounds to fucking see NASA.

2491
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:34,680
They're coming, they're coming
for Ya. You know, and it's,

2492
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:36,020
it's one of those things where you use,

2493
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:40,070
a lot of people don't want to talk
about the subject because if you pick a

2494
02:20:40,071 --> 02:20:43,880
position or if you do agree that there's
some anomalies and there's some weird

2495
02:20:43,881 --> 02:20:46,270
shit to the photography,
the photography,

2496
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,770
it looks like they're in spotlights
and you know, there's all,

2497
02:20:48,771 --> 02:20:52,250
there's all these discussions about
Pr, you know, intersecting shadows,

2498
02:20:52,251 --> 02:20:54,650
shadows coming from different
light sources, that kind of stuff.

2499
02:20:54,651 --> 02:20:56,930
I find a little corny,
but it is a little corny,

2500
02:20:56,931 --> 02:20:59,300
but the spotlight shit's
not corny. It's like, yeah,

2501
02:20:59,301 --> 02:21:01,700
this guy is very clearly
under a light source.

2502
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:05,780
And there's also photos where it looks
like a guy's very clearly filled in.

2503
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:09,210
Like the, the idea the moon is that it's
supposed to be, you know, in, you know,

2504
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:12,520
it's like a zoo, really extreme
contrast. A lot of the photographs of,

2505
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:13,670
of dark and light,

2506
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:17,630
except when there's astronauts involved
when they want a nice clear shot of a

2507
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:20,570
guy coming out of the lunar module.
Meanwhile the sun is behind him.

2508
02:21:20,571 --> 02:21:21,830
He should be in darkness.

2509
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:25,670
It's a lot of tricky shit and a lot
of people will come up with excuses.

2510
02:21:25,671 --> 02:21:27,200
They'll say, whoa, we could be this,

2511
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:31,730
the contour of the surface of the moon
and reflects like, yes, it could be that.

2512
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:33,080
Or it could be.

2513
02:21:33,081 --> 02:21:37,190
There was a dude standing there with a
big fucking piece of aluminum foil and it

2514
02:21:37,191 --> 02:21:40,540
was making sure the light fills in that
photograph because they were doing it in

2515
02:21:40,541 --> 02:21:44,810
the Goddamn movie studio. That's possible
too, man. When I think area 51 is for,

2516
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:48,020
it's all for developing weapons.
That's what I think.

2517
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:51,980
I think all those things that people
keep seeing in the sky that to Ufo man,

2518
02:21:51,981 --> 02:21:54,280
those are easily to be drones.
You know,

2519
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:57,710
that to me is more likely than
aliens wanted us so badly.

2520
02:21:57,711 --> 02:22:01,190
They wanted human fetal tissue so
badly that they were willing to give us

2521
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:04,280
fucking flying saucers.
Yeah. Like, come on man.

2522
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:07,820
I don't believe there has been over
11 flying saucers have crashed.

2523
02:22:07,821 --> 02:22:12,730
So we have possession of really,
okay. Really Matt Etsy, one crashing.

2524
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:15,980
I could see, I could see a bunch of
crashing over the course of human history,

2525
02:22:15,981 --> 02:22:17,240
but I think there'd be some evidence.

2526
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:21,020
I don't think you'd be able to hold that
back. People have stories about shit,

2527
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:24,890
but I don't know if I believe I need to
talk to him about a lot of other shit.

2528
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:27,150
You know,
you start talking to me about Ufos.

2529
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:29,970
I need to know what you
think about ghosts. You know,

2530
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:32,940
I need to sit you down and you know,
do you think that you can read minds?

2531
02:22:32,941 --> 02:22:37,400
Do you believe in palm reading what he
bought? What about Tarot cards? You know,

2532
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:38,520
I'm not into that stuff.
Yeah.

2533
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:41,590
But you know what I'm saying when I'm
talking to dude who believes in Ufos,

2534
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:44,580
I need to know if you believe in
chem trails, motherfucker, I need to.

2535
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:47,010
But if you believe in a lot of weird shit,
you know,

2536
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:48,780
are you one of those weird shit,
believe and dude's,

2537
02:22:48,781 --> 02:22:52,080
cause there's a lot of people that just
love to believe in crazy shit. They just,

2538
02:22:52,081 --> 02:22:56,400
they look forward to be more interesting.
Yes. It's sexy. Aliens are sexy.

2539
02:22:56,850 --> 02:23:01,830
So, so hot right now. So Bro,
I mean, isn't it 2012 or sexy?

2540
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:06,060
You know, any, anything crazy and
unknown, bigfoot, sexy, loch ness monster,

2541
02:23:06,061 --> 02:23:09,210
sexy killer. Whales aren't sexy
there at fucking seaworld, right?

2542
02:23:09,211 --> 02:23:13,110
It's easy to get to there, see them all
the time, but they're just as fascinating.

2543
02:23:13,111 --> 02:23:16,890
If you didn't know, you know, the, if
you didn't know that an animal existed,

2544
02:23:16,891 --> 02:23:20,910
that's almost as intelligent as a man
that has this incredibly varied language.

2545
02:23:20,911 --> 02:23:23,520
Speaks with sound.
It actually breeds a hair,

2546
02:23:23,521 --> 02:23:27,540
but it lives in the middle of the ocean
and it kills fish and fucks up sharks.

2547
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,430
He'd be like, Whoa, this is real.

2548
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:33,090
That's would be way crazier than a
lot of animals that are mythical.

2549
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:37,050
I can like the loch ness monster was
that fucking pussy do that piece of shit.

2550
02:23:37,051 --> 02:23:39,720
I don't even know what that was.
I've never boughten into the button.

2551
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:43,740
I've never bought into the Loch ness
monster tells you ologies a weird field

2552
02:23:43,741 --> 02:23:45,810
because there are things
that we have not discovered.

2553
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:48,120
Definitely there's that
fucking gorilla that they've,

2554
02:23:48,121 --> 02:23:51,960
or the chimpanzee they've
recently discovered in the
Congo. It's a giant Bondo.

2555
02:23:51,961 --> 02:23:52,591
Ape is huge.

2556
02:23:52,591 --> 02:23:55,770
Chimpanzee is over the last couple of
decades they've figured out there really

2557
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:59,390
is this giant subspecies of
chimpanzee cause they can't, yeah.

2558
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:02,850
So now it's like six feet tall,
but they can find things.

2559
02:24:02,851 --> 02:24:05,310
There's a few things that are out there.
Like in New Guinea,

2560
02:24:05,311 --> 02:24:09,990
they found like some crazy fucking
frog and some weird psychedelic looking

2561
02:24:09,991 --> 02:24:10,501
animals.

2562
02:24:10,501 --> 02:24:14,790
And if they find weird shit and like
rainforests and in places there stuff that

2563
02:24:14,791 --> 02:24:18,030
we still probably haven't seen yet.
But there's not a lot, you know,

2564
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:21,420
there's not a lot of stuff. It's
not, it's not like the old days.

2565
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,180
Some of the old days when they
discovered gorillas. I'm like,

2566
02:24:24,181 --> 02:24:28,050
what the fuck is that? You
know that happened, man.

2567
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:31,060
It was like not that long ago where
they discovered gorillas like,

2568
02:24:31,070 --> 02:24:35,370
you gotta be fucking checkmate.
Nobody knew this. Europeans man,

2569
02:24:35,371 --> 02:24:37,020
when they went to Africa
for the first time,

2570
02:24:37,230 --> 02:24:40,710
do you know how fucking crazy it must
have been the first time they discovered a

2571
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:43,710
gorilla? You know they're
walking into, what else is here,

2572
02:24:43,711 --> 02:24:47,790
John Welders and the size of your
hand, Fred, give me the machete.

2573
02:24:47,791 --> 02:24:51,030
What's hacked through some,
what the fuck is that?

2574
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:57,060
Just a big giant silver back comes running
at you and they have to shoot it and

2575
02:24:57,061 --> 02:25:02,061
then they fucking kill it and put it up
on ropes and shit and carry a big log to

2576
02:25:02,101 --> 02:25:06,600
the village and w what the fuck is this?
And they're like,

2577
02:25:06,601 --> 02:25:09,840
that is our fantasy cover. That
shit dude. People back then,

2578
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:12,300
that will lived around gorillas.
They weren't writing books.

2579
02:25:12,301 --> 02:25:14,200
They're in the right shit.
They didn't even, you know,

2580
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:18,310
they didn't have any paper to do.
They were just had a religion. Oh,

2581
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:21,960
did they? I don't think they even did
the people that live in the Congo,

2582
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:25,120
what kind of religions do they
have in the Congo? I Dunno.

2583
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:28,690
People that like those people that like
you ever see the people that like hang

2584
02:25:28,691 --> 02:25:33,640
off of trees and catch fish from the
river with nuts. It's fucking nuts.

2585
02:25:33,641 --> 02:25:37,600
Hang upside down. They just hang with
their hands and feet there barefoot.

2586
02:25:37,601 --> 02:25:41,230
These people are living like they lived
a hundred thousand years ago and they do

2587
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:42,670
that still to this day.

2588
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:45,520
There's all this video of him too that
people have gone there and even video in

2589
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:48,850
black and white like way back in the
forties and the 50s and these people climb

2590
02:25:48,851 --> 02:25:50,560
out on these trees that,
that,

2591
02:25:50,650 --> 02:25:54,460
that hang over the Congo over the
river and they're, they're literally,

2592
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:56,800
they fall in your dead man.
You're fucked.

2593
02:25:57,130 --> 02:26:00,130
And there's all these people and loved
ones and they're catching fish with nets

2594
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:02,530
and they're just so good at it.
They've been doing it for so long.

2595
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:05,650
It's like they grew up climbing
on these trees, hanging over the,

2596
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,250
hanging over this raging fucking
river and scooping fish out of it.

2597
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,910
That video you tweeted the other day
where the guy was climbing that tower,

2598
02:26:12,911 --> 02:26:17,670
by the way. That was fucking
scary. I hate that shit. Which one?

2599
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:21,610
There's a video or do tribes?
It's like well over a thousand feet.

2600
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:25,150
It's one of those, uh, electrical
towers was, it was a radio tower.

2601
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:28,810
It's like a radio towers.
Yeah, same. Same as that.

2602
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:32,300
The empire state building. Is that what
it was saying? It was the same time.

2603
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,960
Something along those lines is insane.
How tall it was.

2604
02:26:34,961 --> 02:26:37,100
And this guy was free climbing it.
You know,

2605
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:38,860
the elevator takes you
up to a certain point,

2606
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:41,200
but once you get to a certain point,
then you have to free climb.

2607
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:45,820
And he was free climbing. Fuck, walk
carrying this bag. That's like 30 pounds,

2608
02:26:45,821 --> 02:26:50,410
30 pounds. It's tools, tools cause
he's got to fix this fucking thing.

2609
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:52,930
Oh this is a real,
I think it wasn't doing it for fun too,

2610
02:26:52,931 --> 02:26:56,470
but there's a whole a part where
he's climbing where he's outside.

2611
02:26:56,530 --> 02:27:00,720
There's some part of it. It's the freak
out is he's inside this thing, you know,

2612
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:02,390
inside the structure.
This.

2613
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:06,250
Eventually he gets outside the structure
and he has to climb all the way to the

2614
02:27:06,251 --> 02:27:08,110
top because it gets thinner
and thinner and thinner,

2615
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:12,760
so it's just a pole with some things
that stick off the side that you have to

2616
02:27:12,761 --> 02:27:16,660
grab a hold of them, handles and
climb. It's such a freak out dude.

2617
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,840
You could see 50 miles in
either way from up there.

2618
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:24,400
I had to turn that shit off to to freak
you out. I started freaking myself out.

2619
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,970
When it gets to a certain part of
heights, I'm just like, all right, that's,

2620
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:31,240
that's crazy heights or scary as
fuck man heights or scary as fuck.

2621
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,460
There's something about it,
man.

2622
02:27:33,461 --> 02:27:36,370
It just makes your toes curl and
your butthole clench his shit

2623
02:27:38,830 --> 02:27:42,610
and an honesty. If it was the
opposite, like extreme depth,

2624
02:27:42,730 --> 02:27:44,560
I'd probably be the same way.
Like if I was like,

2625
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:48,430
you know the same distance like underneath
the water. Did you see that video?

2626
02:27:48,431 --> 02:27:50,560
The guy free diving.
There's a video that's online.

2627
02:27:50,561 --> 02:27:53,860
Then I'll tweet it later on today.
There's a video of a guy free dive diving.

2628
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:57,250
Any free dive. Some insane
amount, like a hundred meters.

2629
02:27:57,660 --> 02:28:01,900
[inaudible] yeah, I guess that's
what we can do. He can do 124 meters.

2630
02:28:01,901 --> 02:28:05,140
I was like the most he's ever done.
You know how, how do they engage?

2631
02:28:05,141 --> 02:28:08,920
That is watched with a stop. They
hair. I don't know. Got a world.

2632
02:28:10,630 --> 02:28:13,300
No, they can hold their breath
for like five minutes, man.

2633
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:16,630
Some of these free divers and
more five minutes, six minutes,

2634
02:28:16,631 --> 02:28:20,320
seven minutes underwater. I think
about that shit. Fuck that. Yeah.

2635
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:21,410
Why do you want to do that man?

2636
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:26,000
That's just doesn't seem like a smart
thing to do. All right. People are home.

2637
02:28:26,001 --> 02:28:28,340
They're making noise right here,
ladies and gentlemen.

2638
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:30,260
Thank you Mr. Russell Peters.

2639
02:28:30,690 --> 02:28:34,550
You're a scholar and a gentleman
and a fantastic standup comedian.

2640
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:37,520
And if people want to get in contact
with you, uh, what is the best way?

2641
02:28:37,550 --> 02:28:42,040
The Real Russell pee on Twitter? That is
correct. At the two s's. Two L's correct.

2642
02:28:42,041 --> 02:28:45,620
The Real Russell P at Twitter.
And uh, what's your website?

2643
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:50,270
Russell peters.com shall
Sam bitches much love.

2644
02:28:50,390 --> 02:28:53,750
Thank you to the fleshlight
for sponsoring this show.

2645
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:59,110
Thank you to Brian Red van
for his technical expertise
and his human roadblocks

2646
02:29:01,211 --> 02:29:05,660
skills. Thank you to uh, to everyone,

2647
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:09,020
ladies and gentlemen, to all you.
Freaky bitches. February 4th,

2648
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:12,140
Mandalay Bay theater. Me, Joe Diaz,

2649
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:16,550
Ari Shaffir Superbowl weekend.
Friday night. It's going down.

2650
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:20,150
Get on in. We're going to have
a crazy party. Russell Peters.

2651
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:21,800
What are you doing on
February 4th weekend?

2652
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:25,250
I'll be in Toronto on
February 2nd or third.

2653
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,140
Are you going to be in a corporate gig?

2654
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:31,030
You're going to be in Vegas for
the UFC weekend? That weekend? Yes.

2655
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:36,980
If I, uh, if I can be, I will be
if my gigs not on the same night.

2656
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:40,670
Yeah, I can tell you right. Saturday
night. Tell me cause it's the fifth.

2657
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:45,680
The fifth is UFC. The fifth is the UFC
and Russell Peters is a big UFC fan.

2658
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:48,770
Did you see Anthony Pettis
is fucking kick last night.

2659
02:29:48,910 --> 02:29:50,720
Did you see what happened last
night? Oh, what am I missing?

2660
02:29:50,721 --> 02:29:53,240
You know who Anthony passes?
Showtime Pettis.

2661
02:29:53,330 --> 02:29:55,730
He's now the new WEC lightweight champion.

2662
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:59,420
He fought Ben Henderson and there was
a crazy back and forth fight until the

2663
02:29:59,421 --> 02:30:00,230
fifth round.

2664
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:05,230
He jumps off the size of the case side
of the cage with his foot kicks off the

2665
02:30:05,481 --> 02:30:10,370
cage and flying through the air kicks
Ben Henderson in the face and knocks him

2666
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:15,230
down. It was the nuttiest
shit in my life. No,

2667
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:18,410
no, no. I went to a decision, but
looking at that and fucking kick.

2668
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:22,220
Ben Henderson's a bad motherfucker. It
was a great scrap. Up until that point,

2669
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:26,210
there was a lot of back and forth action.
He had a Henderson's back.

2670
02:30:26,211 --> 02:30:29,210
Henderson had his back.
He had Henderson's back standing up.

2671
02:30:29,330 --> 02:30:33,890
It was real back and forth for a while
until like the last round man pedis

2672
02:30:33,891 --> 02:30:37,610
really came on strong. The last
round was pedis. You know, he, he,

2673
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,600
he heard him a couple times with punches,
but even then he, in that last round,

2674
02:30:41,601 --> 02:30:44,810
Henderson had Pettis on his back.
It was a really enter any,

2675
02:30:44,811 --> 02:30:48,620
I believe you had Pettis is back to,
it was a really interesting fight, man.

2676
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:52,370
It was a wild scrap.
Anthony Pettis is a bad mother fucker,

2677
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:55,580
but the fact that he pulled
that off was just insane.

2678
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:59,900
The fight was a really closely matched
fight. You know, I think pedis.

2679
02:30:59,901 --> 02:31:03,290
Who did I definitely one the decision.
Ben Henderson's a bad mother fucker too.

2680
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:05,900
Didn't he fight for cowboys?
Serone no, he's bigger.

2681
02:31:05,901 --> 02:31:09,830
He's won 55 Henderson
fought a cowboy Cerrone.

2682
02:31:09,831 --> 02:31:11,450
That was a great fight to great fights.

2683
02:31:11,810 --> 02:31:14,160
And the last one he caught him with a
Kia guillotine and he's Kinda Taichii and

2684
02:31:14,161 --> 02:31:17,730
team. It's got a good submission
game, good standup game, pedis,

2685
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:19,680
just better puncher.
That was one of big things in it.

2686
02:31:19,681 --> 02:31:21,900
And Pedis is wilder and you know the,

2687
02:31:21,901 --> 02:31:24,630
the pet or pedis had better
success at the ground too.

2688
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:27,780
He was able to hold onto Henderson a
little bit better than Henderson was able

2689
02:31:27,781 --> 02:31:30,810
to hold on to him. But it was close. It
was good. It was a fucking, you know,

2690
02:31:30,811 --> 02:31:33,660
it was one of those matches
where even though, you know, yes,

2691
02:31:33,661 --> 02:31:35,700
the decision was the correct decision.
Like man,

2692
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:40,110
while it was happening was so suspenseful
because both guys were so good and so

2693
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:44,040
much action was going on and both guys
knew that you couldn't fuck up even for a

2694
02:31:44,041 --> 02:31:47,790
second. Cause if you did,
you'd get jacked. Like for
one guy would make a mistake,

2695
02:31:47,791 --> 02:31:49,640
the other guy would have his back.
You know, one guy made a sec,

2696
02:31:49,650 --> 02:31:53,220
the other guy would be on
the top, you know, it was a,
it was a really high paced,

2697
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:53,701
you know,

2698
02:31:53,701 --> 02:31:57,600
really exciting fight until that last
kick and that that was the nuttiest shit I

2699
02:31:57,601 --> 02:31:59,730
have ever seen in my life is pretty crazy.

2700
02:31:59,910 --> 02:32:03,240
It's just a few seconds to go in the
last round per minute to judge kicks.

2701
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:07,350
It's not major extent that
guys, he's a, on another level,

2702
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:09,300
this is the new level.
This is back.

2703
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:11,790
You know when hoists Gracie
was around and you know he,

2704
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:16,410
you angled triangle Dan Severn off his
back and I was like, this is crazy.

2705
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:19,110
He's on another level.
This is the next level.

2706
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:22,860
The next level is dudes are jumping off
the cage and fucking kicking you in.

2707
02:32:22,861 --> 02:32:25,890
You've got all these kids that
just studied MMA their whole life.

2708
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,960
They didn't study one or the other.
Well,

2709
02:32:27,961 --> 02:32:31,440
he actually started out a taekwondo
black belt though. Taekwondo guys.

2710
02:32:31,441 --> 02:32:33,440
Just think there's a couple of
the new guy named John Mack.

2711
02:32:33,441 --> 02:32:37,710
Jesse to fought in Toronto or in
a Montreal rather. And uh, he's a,

2712
02:32:37,711 --> 02:32:40,830
another taekwondo guy.
Two's got these wild ass fucking kicks,

2713
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:46,050
these taekwondo class chances. Well, most
of it sucks. Yeah. Most of it is like,

2714
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:48,540
probably the problem with tag window
is you got to keep your hands down.

2715
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:51,330
Everybody keeps her hands down. That's
what they fight. And it's mostly,

2716
02:32:51,331 --> 02:32:53,160
you can only kick to the face.
You can't punch to the face.

2717
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:56,510
So it's a really unrealistic style. I
mean, that's what I started out as like,

2718
02:32:56,550 --> 02:32:59,010
that's why I did a long period in my life.

2719
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:03,300
But what's good about that is you've
developed crazy leg dexterity and you

2720
02:33:03,301 --> 02:33:07,500
develop the ability to do God's
shit. No, he never tried any kick.

2721
