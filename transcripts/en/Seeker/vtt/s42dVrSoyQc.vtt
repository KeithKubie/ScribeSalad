00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.450
Geoscientists spend their lives studying features
in nature that move very, very slowly.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.350
Glacial melt, plate tectonics, things like
these take their sweet time to develop.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.070
So, when an entire river vanishes in just
four days, it’s safe to assume geoscientists

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.349
are going to freak out.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.259
A paper recently published in Nature called
this very sudden disappearing act “river

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.259
piracy.”

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.089
Sadly, there were no actual pirates involved
in the making of this study … but river

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.349
piracy, or it’s less exciting name, “stream
capture”, is a geomorphic phenomenon where

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.910
one river captures and redirects the flow
of another.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.910
In 2015, a team of scientists observed that
the Slims River in the Yukon was [quote] "swift,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.910
cold and deep," flowing from one of Canada’s
largest glaciers north to the Bering Strait.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.300
Luckily for us, NASA was watching.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.300
Check this out.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.860
In 2015, a team of scientists observed that
the Slims River in the Yukon was [quote] "swift,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.480
cold and deep," flowing from one of Canada’s
largest glaciers north to the Bering Strait.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
Then in 2016 they came back and the river
was completely different.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.480
Its waterflow was at a near screeching halt.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.480
THEN in 2016 NASA took this picture.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.850
The scientists on the ground came back and
the river was completely different.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.600
Its waterflow was at a near screeching halt.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.470
It looked more like “a long, skinny lake,”
and they could see the water level dropping

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.940
by the day.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.500
What had happened was, a tall canyon had formed
at the end of the nearby glacier,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.080
rerouting melt water from the Slims to the
Kaskawulsh River, joining the Alsek River

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.110
south.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.970
Basically, the Slims river was stolen by another
river, and it just completely changed course!

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.220
This shift is affecting fish populations,
wildlife, lake chemistry in the area, even

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.470
sheep are changing their grazing patterns.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.370
Which all sounds kind of meh.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.370
BUT.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.790
Think about how this could affect everything
else!

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.400
Land degradation and lack of freshwater will
impact billions of people globally.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.590
Plus, there may be more consequences that
we haven't even thought of yet!

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.470
This is the first time in modern history that
scientists have actually seen a river do this.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.510
A whole river was going north, now it’s
going south!

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.520
That’s huge.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.530
And why?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.060
Of course you already know.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.500
Man-made climate change.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.890
But not global warming as a whole, instead,
one of its many facets: glacial retreat.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.500
Glaciers are these massive bodies of snow
and ice that change in response to temperature

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.880
and precipitation.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.840
When a glacier starts to retreat due to high
temperature or less snowfall, glacial melt

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.000
will outpace new accumulation of snow and
ice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.930
This affects the availability of fresh water
for animals, plants … even humans!

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.980
This connects to the river piracy in the Yukon,
because the massive Canadian glacier that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.120
fed the Slims River is in retreat, thanks
to a cold period centuries ago called the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
Little Ice Age and warming due to greenhouse
gases.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.621
Now while this study was just one glacier
and we shouldn’t generalize too much, glacial

00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.790
retreat is a worldwide phenomenon.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.780
Glaciers in the Himalayas, Andes, Alps, and
Rockies are all backpedaling at greater speeds

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.710
in response to our globe’s changing climate.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.350
Of course, glacial melt is happening in some
of the farthest corners of our planet and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.310
only a small number of communities are directly
affected, for now.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.840
So, while global warming is a multi-century
process; things can happen quickly…

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.340
Consequences of global warming and climate
change are being seen now.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.850
And huge parts of the environment can change
course in just a matter of days…

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.540
And no one knows what this will mean for the
future…

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.350
So if all these glaciers keep retreating,
what happens if all the world’s ice melts?

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.680
Check out this video here to learn more about
that.

that climate change is happening?
