- And I said if you got to
hold him in the fourth grade,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.900
you got to hold him in the fourth grade.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.733
Let's do this sugar.

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.566
- Hey Gene.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.410
- I think the kids sleeping.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.243
Come on, Randy.

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.719
Let's go upstairs, it's
the bedroom on the left.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.340
(fire crackling)
(rock music)

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.630
it's the Bonfire, Comedy
Central radio series XM 95.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.180
I'm Dan Soder, that's Big Jay Oakerson.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.161
This is music that your mom gets boned to.

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:22.994
- Boned.

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:26.050

Friday at 11PM on Comedy Central
called Positive Influence,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.940
the Sam Morril.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.311
- It's gonna be so good.

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:40.250
- So good, so god damn good.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.470
You will enjoy it, DVR it
right now you mother fuckers

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.950
or I will come to you with
my new knife collection

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.400
and bring hell with it.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.051
- I got excited, me and
Christine's relationship

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.100
has kind of spanned the time
of me watching guys like Sam,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.210
Mark Normand, and those guys
that come through New York

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110
and come, its great to see you guys who.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.919
- I mean, I'm in the same
class as them, I would say.

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:01.929
With Sam.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:02.762
- Soder was a little before us.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:03.595
I mean.
- a little.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:04.590
You were, you were like
a little bit before them

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.090
but to see these guys
where I was already kind of

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.990
like looking outward,
you know what I mean,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.860
not looking back,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.570
seeing these guys who
just caught my attention

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.770
for how funny they were

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.350
and that cream is rising to the top, man.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.576
Its fucking fantastic to see you.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.543
- Always rising, yeah.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:21.100
Cream always rises, uh huh.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.410
- We started talking
earlier about post comedy.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.834
Which I'm always excited
to get into it about.

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.700
We try not to drag
anyone's specials by name

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.653
and anything but,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.900
I don't know what the hell.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.850
Everything's a new uh,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.570
Norm MacDonald just
spoke on this, actually,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.030
on Stern today, it was pretty interesting.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.863
His take on it.

00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:43.188
He said.

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:44.021
- Do you think he loses the show?

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:44.854
- I love when he says--

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:45.910
- No, I hope, I mean I
wouldn't be surprised

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.760
but I really hope he doesn't.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.738
- I hope not but I wouldn't
be surprised either.

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:49.571
- He's one of the best.

00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:51.200
- But he uh, you know,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.195
its funny how fast they
can fucking turn on you

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.630
but he said on Stern
today, it was a great line,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.463
he goes, well Stern's like,

00:01:57.463 --> 00:01:59.130
"Yeah, well Norm you
kind of always subscribed

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.020
to, you know, comedy's
supposed to just be funny,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.780
its not supposed to have to make a point.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.613
Its got to be funny"

00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:07.007
He goes, "Call me old fashioned."

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.910
Which is a great like definitive
line to make for that.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190
I don't understand why.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.060
- Cause these people who are like,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.690
its got to be anti-authority,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.610
its got, and you're just like,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.630
well some comics can just make jokes.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.420
Not everything has to have, you know.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.530
- Why is not okay?
- a message.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.081
- Yeah, its a weird thing where

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:29.390
I think all comedians are
pushing back in a certain way

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.730
of like this kind of don't tell us what

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.627
to joke about

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:34.410
and then now they're also saying like,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.107
and there's no jokes.

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:37.690
Like don't joke around about,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.470
like you can't choose
what you joke around about

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.820
and don't make it funny.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.945
Cause its,

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:46.710
there, there seems to
be a thing of outrage

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.480
begots more outrage

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270
and they just can keep stirring the pot

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.050
and being like, I'm fucking mad,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.143
and its like,

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:55.870
its an activity now to get mad about shit

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.830
that you read online.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.070
Its like a thing you can do.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.760
Its like playing a video game.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.480
You're like, I'm gonna go on Twitter

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.530
and get fucking furious about some shit

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.010
and maybe take away someone's fucking job

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.710
and its like, its kinda fucking crazy.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.587
- I think a lot of comics that I think

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.260
are hilarious.
- of course he compounds it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.372
cause what he said is,

00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:14.220
Christine just pulled
up an article that says

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.270
Norm MacDonald--
- the joke he made

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.180
after the whole thing?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.310
- Yeah, which I told you,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.630
that's the one joke I heard

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.070
that Ryan Beck even like text,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.460
DM'd me to be like,
"Dude this is hilarious"

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.490
but Norm MacDonald said,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.550
you know, to not think the me,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.520
to not think Me Too was good,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.420
he's like, "You'd have
to have Down Syndrome."

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.420
And so that's like.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.834
- Oh shit.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:32.839
- Oh that's fucking amazing.

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:34.050
- So he was like defending
the Me Too movement.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.379
- But still didn't do it right.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.212
- And then he didn't do it right

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:37.045
and like, ah points.

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:38.040
- And he didn't say the R word,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.590
he said the actual medical term.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.730
- Yeah, when discussing the
trauma that sexual abuse

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.820
victims faced, Mr.
MacDonald said of course

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.195
he understood the consequences.

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:49.120
He went on to say, "You'd
have to have Down Syndrome.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.152
My new word."

00:03:51.152 --> 00:03:52.556
Interpreted.
- My new word.

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:55.107
- "Down Syndrome, good word."
- my new word.

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:56.270
I love him so much.
- Its funny when you break

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.800
down hilarious people talking.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.730
Like if they did this with our,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.420
if you wrote an article like our show,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.890
like, they talk, they slut shamed moms.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.770
Its like we were talking
about our own moms

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.603
getting fucked.

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:08.436
Did you know how,

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.290
you know how incredibly
exposing that is to yourself,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.770
to be like, yeah remember
these awful comments

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.360
that I'm laughing about at 35

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.170
with some of the best comics in the world.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.003
- Yeah.
- I think...

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:19.360
- Well you guys are super self deprecating

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.670
and it's like, I think it all started

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.410
when comedy became super personalized

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.670
and when like the story
became bigger than the joke.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.580
- Yeah.
- Do you know what I mean?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.830
When it could be like,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.450
oh this could go on for seven
minutes with no punchlines

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.090
and then there's like
one big pop at the end,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.430
you're like, well, that's not a bit.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.350
That's a different genre of comedy

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.000
and its cool that comedy's expanding,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.500
but don't tell us that it has
to be this one fucking thing.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.420
- That's my argument.
- You can tell comedy

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.253
with jokes.

00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:43.260
- That's point for point
my exact argument about it.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.420
I, I, my problem with Nanette

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.350
or Hannah Gadsby comments after that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.550
was you're cutting out
so many comics who I love

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.920
by saying that comedy has to
have a much greater point.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.131
I'm like, so Dave Attell, Bryan Reagan,

00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:57.250
even Carrot, should Carrot Top,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.290
multimillionaire Carrot Top, not be.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.123
- I know, right?

00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:01.680
- Not be in comedy some how?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.135
I mean how do you argue like?

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.390
- But its good for comedy
that its broadening.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.700
- Of course.
- And the Hannah Gadsby thing

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.560
is good for comedy.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.240
It means its being taken more seriously

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.670
and its good to have
different parts of comedy

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.600
but don't tell us its like the most

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.210
close minded people telling us that comedy

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.537
has to be this one thing.

00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:15.450
Its the dumbest argument.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.770
- There's also some people
that are sneaking into comedy

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.470
and Tim Dillon made
this argument perfectly

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.060
that there's some unfunny people

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.290
that are trying to fucking
kneecap other people

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.210
to be like, yeah this
is my thing, you're out.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.480
- Yeah.
- I couldn't do the thing

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.728
you did, I couldn't be funny.

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:29.150
So know I can't be funny

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.470
so I'm gonna kneecap you and now

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.140
what I do is funny.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.240
You're like, but its still not funny.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.860
- In order to break the rules,
you have to know the rules.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.886
You know what I mean?

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:37.719
Its like some shitty ass
- That's a great point.

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.010
- Director and you're like,

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.680
no you got to know how
to make a good movie.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.580
You can't just make a
shitty movie and be like,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.683
I did that on purpose.

00:05:43.683 --> 00:05:44.690
- Yeah.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.964
(laughter)

00:05:45.964 --> 00:05:46.830
- Its ridiculous.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.850
- Even at some point in
there, Norm MacDonald said,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.550
he goes, "you know its
not, its a one man show.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.260
Its not a standup special."

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.920
and he goes, "I completely respect those."

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.390
- Yeah.
- Like he was being serious

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.223
and sentimental.

00:05:58.223 --> 00:05:59.230
He's like, "Those are great."

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.720
- I think the templates
that lead comedy change,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.150
when I think when I was coming up

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
the templates of the time were very much

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.800
Attell, Dane Cook.
- yeah.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.727
- Do you know what I mean?
_ Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:12.930
and you'd see molds.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.927
- Maybe Marc Maron sort of had that

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:15.760
in like the alternative circuit

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.097
but the kind of molds you kind of,

00:06:17.097 --> 00:06:19.080
and when you're doing
you're create a creator

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.680
in a video, its like where you start

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.400
and my, me, Kurt, everyone
was definitely in the vain

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.330
of like watching Attell and being like,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.860
I, and I don't even think,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.940
Kurt I guess more so

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.130
but I never even had my comedy

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.220
was never in the vain of Attell's so much,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.140
like set up, joke

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.410
but its in the voice, the style of,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.128
the genre, the genre of, is what I mean.

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.610
- But you're gonna be
influenced by someone

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.450
who's much greater at it than you are

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.283
when you start.

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:44.360
- Of course, but all the
templates used to at least,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.900
if nothing else, Marc Maron,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.600
whoever you choose in that vain.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.970
Sarah Silverman for a long time

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.803
for girls.
- Louis.

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:50.670
- Hedberg.
- Louis.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.163
All of them were like,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.896
there was no argument that
it was funny or not funny,

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:57.530
the templates that people start following

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.220
start getting further away from funny

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.280
and falsely so, its like a Doug Stanhope,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.480
that became a big
template like a generation

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.350
behind me in comedy.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.300
- You know what's crazy,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.820
cause that was my generation and I saw

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.060
a lot of guys being like.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.454
- But Stanhope pulls off,

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:12.870
this unique thing he does

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.480
and he's very very funny
the whole way through.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.710
And a lot of people come
out and mistake funny

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.180
for like, I'm gonna hammer home a point

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.560
you people don't want to hear.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.460
Like you just go against the grain

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.530
and then walk off stage.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.000
Where he's going against the grain

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.058
and making you laugh.

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:26.891
You know, there's a thing behind it.

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.152
- What you're talking about

00:07:28.152 --> 00:07:29.029
seeing coming up,

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:30.017
what I saw coming up,

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:31.150
is you'd see guys that weren't funny

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.370
that were doing the Stanhope

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.710
and kind of disguising not being funny

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.350
under like, what you guys
don't want to hear about this,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.560
my plans for abortion?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.490
- Its too real for you?

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.980
- Its not.
- Can't handle it?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.367
- You're just not fucking funny, dude.

00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:45.670
- But Norm called it
out too, on Stern today,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.030
same person, I'd say kind
of like that Stanhope

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.736
was the beginning of that, the template

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:50.830
that people put him next to.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.012
- Or Hicks to another extent.
- Hicks was before that.

00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:54.331
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:55.591
But Stanhope's hilarious.

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:56.830
- Or Lenny Bruce before that, right?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.230
There used to be like
two political comics.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.020
It was like Lenny Bruce and then Mort Sahl

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.430
and then it leaves like everyone,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.299
now its like everyone's like,

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:05.132
heres the problem with Trump.

00:08:05.132 --> 00:08:06.100
- That's true.
- You've been to open mics.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.870
- But Jon Stewart, saying Jon Stewart

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.170
was the other one that kind of subtly,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.980
even when he wasn't doing
standup necessarily,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.813
I know he is a standup,

00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:13.240
but not doing standup,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.880
like that thing became like,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.450
kind of like that preach thing

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.799
but that's a show, its
a different formant.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:20.840
- But Stewart's a great joke writer.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.107
- Fantastic, no, no he's hilarious.

00:08:22.107 --> 00:08:23.130
- I agree with you

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.310
but its like that, there was that,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.250
now like those guys who were just doing a,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.630
heres my point, couldn't handle it,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.100
can't, the walking people

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.020
and thinking it's cool.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.230
Its like no, Bill Hicks
would go to fucking

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.055
Alabama and Arkansas and
kill with these liberal bits.

00:08:36.055 --> 00:08:38.030
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's the power of that.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.910
- He was funny and he had
like jokes, like jokes.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.230
Like you would watch
and be like, fuck man.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.810
And he was, he was taking it to them.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.180
He was taking away games.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.502
He wasn't at some safe space.

00:08:46.502 --> 00:08:47.340
- It makes you laugh with him

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.683
at the idea that he doesn't
believe in evolution

00:08:50.683 --> 00:08:52.006
and that's hilarious.

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:54.620
That's a testament to how
fucking funny someone can be

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.453
with a joke.
- Totally.

00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:58.190
- Credits to Yannis Pappas, in 2009

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.730
he goes, "Do you know
who the most alternative

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.000
comic in New York City is?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.833
Nate Bargatze."

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.570
he was like, he's a southern guy.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.692
- How bout Joe Mackey, dude?

00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:05.525
- Yeah he's a southern guy,

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.580
he's saying Walmart's great
in these Brooklyn rooms

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.340
and they're like, ah fuck.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.930
He's like, I don't even
have to put stuff back

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.700
and you're like, that's a
testament to great comedy

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.040
is when like, Bill Burr,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.900
like watching him explode.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.960
Remember going to his shows,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.940
his live show at Caroline's,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.517
he'd start a thing where you're like,

00:09:20.517 --> 00:09:21.750
oh this fuck, this is, what?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.583
I don't agree with that

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.850
and then by the end
he's just hammering home

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.950
funny, and you're like, ah
that's fucking hilarious.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.783
But you're right, Joe Mackey.

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:29.140
Joe Mackey.
- Nick Di Paolo.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.260
- Yeah, uh yeah.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.718
But Mackey's like a guy
who's fucking hilarious

00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:34.999
and if you sit and talk to him

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:35.832
you're like, oh we don't have,

00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:37.430
our morals do not.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.155
You're such a better person than me.

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:40.820
- He really, it makes me
want to go take a shower

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.400
every time I hang out
with him, I feel so dirty.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.890
- Ryan Hamilton's not a
guy where you're like,

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.757
this is clean comedy.

00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:45.590
You're just watching him,

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.750
this guys fucking hilarious.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.417
- So good.
- I didn't cuss once.

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:50.720
But it doesn't mean it's better or worse,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.300
it just means he's fucking super funny.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.620
- Yeah.
- So to take the funny

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.020
out of it, I think is like,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.410
its, I don't know.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.860
You think its a template now?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.232
- I think the templates
people are looking,

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.603
they're just looking to
the wrong templates now

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:03.630
because you want to make headlines

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.170
over...
- Yeah.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.256
- Do you know what I mean?

00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:07.089
- Its like going to an ice cream store

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:08.391
and then being like,

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.894
ice creams not gonna
be sweet anymore, okay?

00:10:09.894 --> 00:10:12.710
- You, I'm not saying
anyone's lying about anything

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.370
but you can get a legit
chance for a career bump

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.220
if you fucking say somebody harass,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.367
if you're like a young comic, girl comic,

00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:21.710
and you say somebody with
power did something to you,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.871
you can get a bump,

00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:26.050
you get a momentary
minute in the spot light

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.198
to try to bump and I think
some people do that, for sure,

00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:30.147
which I think, I always hate that

00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:31.570
cause it trivializes
real victims and shit.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.210
- Yeah, like the people that use it.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.043
Well that's what.

00:10:34.043 --> 00:10:35.570
- Joe Mackey molested me.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.760
- Yeah.
- That's huge bump.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.402
- By the way your special's
coming out on Friday.

00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:40.580
- Joe Mackey.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.413
- Do you know what I'm saying?

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:42.804
- I'm gonna touch you, now.

00:10:42.804 --> 00:10:43.637
(laughter)

00:10:43.637 --> 00:10:45.112
- Watch out, get those pants off.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.810
Here we go, buckaroo.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.820
- Its touch time, baby.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.370
- I think I told you I
was watching Bill Maher

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.490
today, that Jim Carrey was just one,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.323
at the end of it,

00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:57.230
he uh, he goes and he's
defending Al Franken,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.450
which I'm not even against,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.450
defending Al Franken

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.100
but its just, I said this to you outside,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.128
its so funny like,

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.347
Al Franken, there's a
picture of him doing the joke

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:06.710
picture of him squeezing a girls tits,

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.920
I don't think its a major deal but.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.417
- Its a USO tour right?

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.480
I mean its all about sex and whatever.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.165
- If the girl did have a problem with it,

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:14.730
then he shouldn't of done that.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.563
Whatever people are saying

00:11:15.563 --> 00:11:17.280
there's a lot of like,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.830
Al Franken's accusations are like,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.610
he really squeezes pretty tight

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.460
when he puts his arm around
your waist for a picture

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.293
and its like, okay.

00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:24.840
So Bill Maher's lobbying like,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.130
well listen, I believe Al Franken.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.650
So, I think--
- Well, you believe

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.483
your friends.

00:11:29.483 --> 00:11:30.700
- I think he should come
back and run for something

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.260
and I know, and I go at the same time,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.500
really if your major sticking point

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.590
of Trump's thing, like
what piece of shit he is

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.040
in that regard, he said to another dude

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.820
that he thought the cameras were off,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.700
you can fucking just touch a chick's pussy

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.220
when you're famous, man, they love it.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.080
That's really what he did,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.410
you know what I mean?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.660
And I'm not fan of Trump, get
him out of office tomorrow,

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.493
I don't give a shit.

00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:50.240
- But you made a point after that

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.410
that its like, its like
when you're dating someone.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.250
This was the point that I was like,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.140
this is hilarious.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.500
Cause you like, eventually people's wives.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.960
At one point, someone's husband or wife

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.800
was their boyfriend and girlfriend

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.970
and you had a dirty
conversation with your friend

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.400
about that person.
- Absolutely.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.581
- Oh fucks like a champ, dude.

00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:07.210
And then like two years later you're like,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.540
that's my fucking son's mother.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.890
You're like yeah, you told
me that she deep throated

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
you on the second date

00:12:12.723 --> 00:12:14.495
you're like, oh that was a good date.

00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:15.640
(laughter)

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.370
- Dean Edwards.
- Those were the days.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.670
- Early in me and Christine dating,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.700
Dean Edwards, we were standing outside

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.533
of a comedy club.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.253
Christine came out, walked back in

00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:25.020
and he looked at Christine from the back

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.420
and he looked at me with like a,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.550
he didn't know I was dating her.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.010
- Yeah.
- And he goes,

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.180
I saw his face getting
ready to say something.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.970
So you want to give him that,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.150
I go dude, me and her are dating.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.110
He goes, "oh nice"

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.980
and I was like, oh yeah,
she throws it down.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.521
Like right away.

00:12:38.521 --> 00:12:39.528
(laughing)

00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:40.361
She throws it down, dude.

00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.355
- Yeah but I mean, Christine.

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:42.617
- That's like a good friend interception,

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:43.840
right there.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.673
- Women do that?

00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:46.750
I mean that's across the board, right?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.970
- Yeah.
- You definitely told a girl

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.851
about how I fuck or something about it.

00:12:49.851 --> 00:12:51.129
How would you not?

00:12:51.129 --> 00:12:52.136
- Yeah like.

00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:53.080
- I don't know if it changes so much

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.349
from like a guy you're dating to

00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:57.280
like that's my husband.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.950
I think we get a little more territorial.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.670
- No but I think that
women are more territorial

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.854
but I think over time

00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:04.130
you discuss less,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.078
both sexes discuss less sexually

00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:08.357
about their partners with their friends.

00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:09.750
- Well they don't do radio shows together.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.130
- Also nobody wants to hear about

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.300
the sex you're having with you're wife.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.701
- That's disgusting.
- dude, we're really

00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.565
hammering it down.
- I was like fuck yeah.

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:18.304
God you guys love each other.

00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:19.630
- me and Catharine, dude,
we go fucking crazy.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.140
- Mrs. Fiona and I.
- oh god, Mrs. Fiona

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.717
and you love each other so much.

00:13:22.717 --> 00:13:24.892
- But yeah I said I wanted to
make like a joke about that.

00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:27.605
Every perfect family you see

00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:29.570
with a husband and wife
who love each other

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.410
and three kids in a beautiful house.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.261
At some point, that guy
went to one of his buddies

00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:36.060
and was like, dude that girl
I went out with last night,

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.130
she goes fucking takes it to the balls.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.403
I mean, I never seen a
girl take dick like this.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.810
Pretty impressive.
- and then five years later

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.796
its like (mimics baby crying).

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:46.260
she's like, Johnny, help me in the kitchen

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.160
and you're like, weird.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.081
- She's the strongest women I've ever met.

00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:51.360
What I saw her go through
in that delivery room

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.030
has changed my whole opinion about women.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.781
- That's my hero holding my other hero.

00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.162
My baby girl.
- oh god.

00:13:57.162 --> 00:13:59.370
♪ I can be your hero baby ♪

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.410
- Seven years earlier

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.440
its all, dude that chick sucks dick

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.677
like a fucking monster, bro.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.245
Eight years later, there she is.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:08.407
- That's my baby right there.

00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:09.973
- That's my queen.
- my baby holding my baby.

00:14:09.973 --> 00:14:11.370
- Baby holding my baby.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.203
- But that Bill Maher thing,

00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:13.900
I'm just, he's coming out for Al Franken

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.057
and defends Al Franken,

00:14:15.057 --> 00:14:16.428
its just like.
- yeah.

00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:17.620
- Its your buddy, you're calling for,

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.879
its okay for your buddy.

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:19.940
I don't know.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.090
- Okay liberals, if you want
to write off Al Franken.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.303
- Kyle Dunnigan's Bill
Maher is fucking spot on.

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:28.049
- He's so funny.
- Perfect.

00:14:28.049 --> 00:14:29.190
- Its the best.
- He's hilarious

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.373
but everything's so bipartisan now

00:14:31.373 --> 00:14:32.870
that that doesn't matter anymore.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.703
You know what I mean?

00:14:33.703 --> 00:14:34.630
Like he's on that team,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.090
so Bill Maher's on that team.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.640
Its like, I'm defending that.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.828
If Trump was on his team,

00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.340
he would defend that.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.530
That's just what it is, now.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.603
Its so fucking split,

00:14:43.603 --> 00:14:45.373
its laughable.

00:14:45.373 --> 00:14:46.850
Its that bipartisan.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.683
Its like.
- That's everything, too.

00:14:47.683 --> 00:14:49.420
- But its also shitty
when people defend someone

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.520
and then like with Norm,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.470
its like, well even if
you don't agree with him,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.200
which I'm sure most people don't,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.033
based on this,

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.440
I mean to just,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.080
I don't like the erasing of people.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.460
I don't like the, you're
not banned from this show.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.360
You're now not allowed,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.520
its such mob bullshit.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.738
- Yeah.
- it really is.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:05.571
- But even with the positive, too

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.702
when they go back to, what's this?

00:15:08.702 --> 00:15:09.711
- I was gonna say.

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:10.544
Read this, this kinda touches

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:11.970
on that a little bit.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.500
Just this idea of like,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.010
like we banish people
now when they fuck up?

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.370
Like they're just done for good?

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.420
- I've been saying its like,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.020
it feels like now culture
is a figure skating routine.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.060
Like you fall down,
you're done, you're done.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.391
You fell, he fucking slipped.

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.800
But he wrote, what you highlighted,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.370
Norm MacDonald said, "I
meet all kinds of women

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.740
that have terrible stories
about what happened to em."

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.470
MacDonald said, "I wasn't
talking about the victims.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.970
They asked me about Roseanne.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.640
They asked me about Chris Hardwick,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.660
they asked me about Louis and I told them.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.060
You know if someone on
murders someone, you know,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.820
and goes to jail, right?

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.380
And then he gets out
of jail after 10 years

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.850
and you go, I'm gonna give this guy a job

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.330
washing dishes because
he's done his penance.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.830
Nobody goes, well what about
the people he murdered?

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.100
Well of course, they had it off worse."

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.340
it turned into a Mulaney at the end.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.470
I apologize.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.610
Tried to keep it MacDonald
but it moved into a Mulaney.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.870
- No look, he makes a good point

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.550
and they said they asked
him about something specific

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.947
and I don't think they spun
his words, necessarily.

00:16:06.947 --> 00:16:09.340
- But I'm saying, people now,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.437
because of how comfortable we live,

00:16:12.437 --> 00:16:17.040
its an activity to get
fucking furious online.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.873
- Totally.
- You can,

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:20.460
I can choose right now to go online

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.430
and find something that
fucking makes me angry,

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.200
under tipping, a fucking,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.613
you know, you can just pick something.

00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:27.590
- It's so addictive.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.070
- But I mean the big thing, again,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.303
I think a lot of comics, great ones,

00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:36.665
and I think me personally
float in like the gray area

00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:39.470
of the world, like seeing
the ridiculous on both sides,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.630
I kind of pick it apart on all

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.530
but its not that way.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.080
Like most of the world needs you to like

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.590
pick this fucking side.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.167
That's my point.

00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:48.174
It makes me.
- I don't know

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.260
isn't an answer anymore.
- so one makes me hate

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.560
like or want to not like the other thing.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.890
How much I'm just inundated
with anti-Trump shit

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.723
I know he sucks.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.470
I wish, I, me, I wish Obama
could just be president

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.260
again tomorrow just because,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.707
will everybody be happy
now and like shut up?

00:17:01.707 --> 00:17:03.243
- Yeah.
- But the way they talk about

00:17:03.243 --> 00:17:05.060
him, we had an amazing president

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.710
who got the world back on track,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.670
I'm like, I bet if you dug,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.210
if I was a politics person who dug deep,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.050
I bet there's plenty of Obama policies

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.500
that are fucking, nothing to
do with his black or white,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.620
just shitty puppet.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.950
He knows how to get on the thing,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.254
he did that speech was it,

00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:19.539
the end of last week&gt;

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.527
- It was the best.

00:17:20.527 --> 00:17:21.630
It was--
- Fucking amazing.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.310
The guys like smooth
jazz that calms you down

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.287
but he didn't say shit.

00:17:24.287 --> 00:17:25.732
He, there's nothing to do.

00:17:25.732 --> 00:17:27.345
He said vote, he said go vote.

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:28.650
- Trump is like a professional troll

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.476
so its like, people that hate him

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:32.080
you're just gonna keep
hating him more and more

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.860
every day.
- he's doing the thing,

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.660
you're doing the thing he wants you to do,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.306
when he's being like, you're stupid.

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:40.857
You're like, what the
fuck did you say to me?

00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:43.260
And he goes, he just
starts grinning, he goes,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.093
I said you're stupid.

00:17:44.093 --> 00:17:45.960
- Jim Carrey, pretty smart
thing he actually did say

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.783
of all the goofy Jim Carrey shit he does,

00:17:47.783 --> 00:17:49.670
I think he said on--
- That's what hundreds

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.503
of millions dollars,

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:52.470
two decades of hundreds of
millions of dollars give you.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.668
You lose all fucking touch.

00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:57.061
- Once you start painting,
something happened.

00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:59.680
(laughing)

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.660
- Dave Smith.
- George Bush

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.493
and Jim Carrey?

00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:02.350
That's who it is?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.610
- Bush and Carrey.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.870
Have I told you those were the painters

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.860
of the fucking new generation?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.240
- And Hitler.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.848
- Well, that didn't go well.

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:13.050
- Jim Carrey came out for,

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.450
before I said he came
out wearing like Nike's

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.330
making a big Colin
Kaepernick thing, whatever,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.760
but then he goes, he's like lobbying,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.617
I talked to Dave Smith about this

00:18:20.617 --> 00:18:21.690
and it is funny

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.390
he's lobbying for socialism

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.410
in a country that capitalism
has made him a bizillionaire

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.567
and I'm certain, Dave
said to me, he's like,

00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:31.380
"I'm certain he hasn't given
of 200 million dollars,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.080
I'm sure he hasn't give 199 million

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.480
to like charity and good faith"

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.560
- Yeah just be like, I need a little bit

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.010
to live off of.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.130
- People are looking to be angry

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.010
and you can be angry.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.600
Calling all the
celebrities, and he told me,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.400
Dave Smith told me too
that Bill Burr has a joke

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.980
I don't think I've ever
heard, made me laugh,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.080
about all the, I go, its
made me not like watching

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.860
Alec Baldwin stuff, even if he's funny.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.780
- Yeah.
- Cause he was just one

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.299
of the guys like, if Trump
wins, I'm moving to Canada.

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.295
I'm like.

00:18:53.295 --> 00:18:54.940
That's not an impressive
thing to say, like.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.690
So you're gonna live
in a mansion in Canada?

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.820
Like congratulations.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.653
- You're still rich.

00:18:58.653 --> 00:19:00.099
- I don't give a fuck where you live.

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:01.230
Like Phil Collins live in Switzerland.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.063
I don't give a shit.

00:19:02.063 --> 00:19:03.650
- I actually.
- They say it like they're

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.840
moving to Fallujah.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.860
Its like you're moving to
a fucking nice country.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.693
- Yeah, its not that.

00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:08.910
- Canada's a nice place.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.350
- You guys keep playing this way

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.200
and I'm gonna move to a nice

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.034
17th century Victorian in London.

00:19:15.034 --> 00:19:16.177
- Yeah I mean like.
- I won't,

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:18.405
I won't enjoy it cause I won't be.

00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:19.740
- But he said, he said
Bill Burr's got a joke

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.810
he goes, how narcissistic
to even announce that

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.643
to the world.

00:19:22.643 --> 00:19:24.270
You think somebody's getting
ready to pull that lever

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.990
he goes, I want to vote for Trump

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.321
but I don't want to lose Cher.

00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:29.109
(laughing)

00:19:29.109 --> 00:19:29.942
that's fucking great.

00:19:29.942 --> 00:19:31.810
- That is brilliant.
- that's such a funny joke.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.732
That would affect your decision?

00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:35.929
Alec Baldwin's gonna move.

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:38.290
What if Jim Carrey goes back to Canada?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.230
- Its so weird, man, because its like,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.210
this is a symptom of
comedy being very popular.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.250
Its like, there's a lot
of money involved now,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.570
so people are making
money in different ways.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.460
In some ways that people have found money,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.720
one of my favorite people to watch,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.930
if you are bored and you have Instagram,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.927
follow Micheal Che, Chethinks,

00:19:55.927 --> 00:19:58.470
and watch his posts about comedy bloggers

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.470
that he calls Megans.
- Megans, I love it, dude.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.410
- And its one of, its some
of the funniest reading

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.390
cause he just proves time and time again,

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.010
he's like, "there's people just out there

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.560
just to say they hate shit

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.980
just so people will click.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.954
Just so that other websites
will share their click bait."

00:20:12.954 --> 00:20:14.790
and he just likes points
it out in such a way

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.620
that its so fucking funny.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.550
That it is, its an interesting to watch

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.760
because him now commenting is an activity

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.350
the way them getting mad
about comedy is an activity.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.590
So just feeds off itself.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.580
Its this weird incestuous like,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.870
okay now I can watch this
person get mad about this

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.900
and what's this person's
opinion about this person

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.100
getting mad?
- Right.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.580
- Taking Twitter off my phone.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.860
- Greatest thing in the world, I bet.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.510
- Its so--
- Ari Shaffir follows

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.960
no one and he's got like
hundreds of thousands

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.793
of followers.

00:20:40.793 --> 00:20:42.220
But I'm so like jealous of him

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.268
to be like--

00:20:43.268 --> 00:20:44.390
- Doesn't he have like the smart phone?

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.400
He's never--
- He's got a flip phone.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.980
- Flip phone is what I mean.
- But it really is a thing

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.783
where its you can, when you get off like,

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.730
is this like a blog about it?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.610
- This were the screenshots from him

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.910
where he, it was right
after he defended Louis

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.450
and then he was posting other blogs.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.769
- Yeah, that became news.

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:03.602
When just his opinions.
- Che's.

00:21:03.602 --> 00:21:05.910
- Its admirable how reckless he is.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.270
You know for his fame.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.103
- With the status he has.

00:21:08.103 --> 00:21:09.500
The job he's got.
- I think that's,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.676
that's what I always like.

00:21:10.676 --> 00:21:11.509
I love--
- He's been apart of some

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:14.389
fucking deep Legion of
Skanks and STR episodes, Che.

00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:15.910
- But Che's like--
- He goes for it.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.109
Never gets in trouble.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.097
- I tell you this, funny.

00:21:18.097 --> 00:21:19.287
He's funny.
- He's hilarious.

00:21:19.287 --> 00:21:20.150
- Just fucking hilarious.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.020
- Never a whiff of hack,
he's a great comic.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.310
- Yeah and that's...
- Such a nice dude, too.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.980
- But I think that's also
what you're seeing is

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.730
and that's back to that
Tim Dillon argument

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.010
where its like a lot of unfunny people

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.410
try to take down being like,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.200
fuck this guy's funny, I got a shot

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.760
and I'm not talking about everybody,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.390
I'm talking about malicious people

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.223
that are in this business.

00:21:36.223 --> 00:21:38.135
- Town criers who don't
write fucking jokes.

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:39.520
Who are like, we just have to be like,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.010
oh they're funny, I guess.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.910
They've...

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.743
- Well that's what I was saying

00:21:42.743 --> 00:21:45.870
but its been proven if
you make some allegation,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.660
you'll get your moment to possibly

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.885
pop and break through,

00:21:48.885 --> 00:21:49.894
you know what I mean?

00:21:49.894 --> 00:21:50.727
- Well you'll get your shot

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.360
but it won't be a long lasting shot.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.140
Like, its funny who I talk to,

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.540
especially like, across the board.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.780
I'm not talking about just white dudes,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.810
I'm talking about like when
I talk to Michelle Wolf

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.770
or like Mariana Franklin

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.700
and you talk to these
people and you're like,

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.533
yeah its bullshit.

00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:04.366
And they're like, oh yeah
there's a lot of bullshit around

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.199
here right now.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.090
There's a lot of this.
- It's really weird

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.030
- A lot of this is
filled with fucking murk

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.460
and like this is bullshit.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.110
- Look, for whatever you
think of the special even

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.890
like Drew Michael's say
pretty early in his thing

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.010
about like, disability, that word,

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.290
its like, so he has to separate himself.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.680
I'm a straight white man
but I have a hearing thing.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.325
The guy who's way--

00:22:22.325 --> 00:22:24.080
- That's how far its gotten now.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.020
- Who's wailing it.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.084
- Guys I'm slightly off in terms of.

00:22:27.084 --> 00:22:28.427
- It is.
- I'm not perfect.

00:22:28.427 --> 00:22:30.370
- I have a stigma, so.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.950
- Do you, but you have to
agree how important that is

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.070
in that special for what
he's trying to accomplish.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.077
- I'm a straight white

00:22:36.077 --> 00:22:37.270
but there's some colors
I can't make out fully.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.230
- Yeah.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.390
A little colorblind.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.265
- I'm a straight white
guy but my cursive is off.

00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:42.739
(laughter)

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:45.350
Can I get an hour special?
- I'm ambidextrous.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.610
- I once had bronchitis.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.270
Its been up and down.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.550
- The guy who is murdering
on America's Got Talent,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.900
I mean walking his way to the finals

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.930
is a guy who has Tourette's.
- Okay

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.320
- His eye blinks a little bit

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.910
and its every joke is about it

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.140
and they standing ovation
him every single time.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:05.973
I've never heard of him before.

00:23:05.973 --> 00:23:07.270
- But I mean it is,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.680
its so direct, its so direct to like.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.530
- Play it.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.880
Just enjoy.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.080
- Fuck you Heidi, sorry, sorry.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.030
- Does he, pause it, pause it, pause it.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.490
- I think Andrew Scholz looks great.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.460
- I hear a slight wigger accent.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.293
Am I wrong?

00:23:21.293 --> 00:23:22.809
- Well its more
- Am I wrong?

00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:23.796
- Its not wigger.

00:23:23.796 --> 00:23:24.900
I'd say its fat black southern momma voice

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.733
for some reason.

00:23:25.733 --> 00:23:27.004
Like he's got waffles in the back.

00:23:27.004 --> 00:23:28.680
- It kind of sounds like
Cleveland a little bit.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.770
- Yeah, go ahead.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.820
- Right, is that?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.099
Black Lou, am I right?

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:33.287
Yeah.

00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:34.298
- [Comedian] Recently.

00:23:34.298 --> 00:23:35.700
- Oh yeah, what's up so, girl?

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.680
- Oh totally.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.430
This guys only black sir,

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.263
he has jokes,

00:23:39.263 --> 00:23:41.990
he has jokes about being
at like black house parties

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.529
and the cops come and think he's like

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:45.440
fill in the blank, go ahead Dan.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.273
What do you do?

00:23:46.273 --> 00:23:47.649
This is Christine's favorite
game to watch me do.

00:23:47.649 --> 00:23:49.577
As we're sitting and
watching this he goes,

00:23:49.577 --> 00:23:51.560
"the cops come to the party and they go"

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.570
and I go, just pause, "Are you okay?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.973
Do you need some help?

00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:58.073
These are my friends."

00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:00.460
and its like, and just hit
play and watch it happen

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.470
exactly like I said.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.960
- I'm not joking when I say this,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.057
you probably saw it
cause you lived with him

00:24:04.057 --> 00:24:06.910
but Sam, its a legitimate
talent that Jay has

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.106
to, like he'll know a hacky premise

00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:11.538
and finish the joke in
a way that you're like,

00:24:11.538 --> 00:24:12.870
that's fucking crazy.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.300
Some of them.
- I did them all

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.505
on super 8 tape in between
my mom's tit shows.

00:24:17.505 --> 00:24:19.330
- I can, I can do some of them.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.260
- I between that,

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.707
I'm fucking,

00:24:21.707 --> 00:24:23.440
its my mom fucking on stools.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.557
- This the way Big Jay eats some pussy.

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.200
And I go, Jay, oh my god
are you in a Fubu shirt

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.360
humping the stage?

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.820
But it is one of those talents,

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.950
its like crosswords puzzles.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.910
- It's amazing.
- I'm not,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.080
I can get the easy ones,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.760
but Jays like, no 19 down,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.783
that's anamorphic

00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:40.616
and you're like, huh?

00:24:40.616 --> 00:24:41.449
How the fuck did you get that?

00:24:41.449 --> 00:24:42.282
- Yeah, you nail em.

00:24:42.282 --> 00:24:43.153
- I remember you telling me

00:24:43.153 --> 00:24:45.090
that you and Jay would
go to like Governor's

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.660
and see like just guys pop in.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.493
- We didn't, no, no, no.

00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:48.420
- That was a specific night.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.610
- We went one night.
- Oh, okay.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.443
- And it was very specifically--

00:24:50.443 --> 00:24:51.580
- I don't want to say the
name if you don't want to.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.810
- Nick Cannon, we watched
his special on this show.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.360
- Alright.
- no, we broke down

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.610
his latest special on this show.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.938
Pete Davidson got us tickets.

00:24:57.938 --> 00:24:59.491
- Yeah.
- He was like,

00:24:59.491 --> 00:25:00.324
"Do you want"

00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:01.667
he's like, "I'm opening for Nick Cannon.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:02.500
Do you want to see him opening night?"

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.840
- Sadly, it was before
the gun shaped microphone

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.510
era of Nick Cannon but you know.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.343
- Which is so,

00:25:07.343 --> 00:25:09.770
you know you talk about
like jumping in on it

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.270
but he is like a guy that
went from being like,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.360
man I'm so rich, show
business is so awesome

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.810
to being like, I'm woke,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.380
what's all this fucking problem?

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.250
It was like almost by the next special

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.430
where you're like, that
much of a character shift?

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.013
Like if I do my next
special and its all about

00:25:24.013 --> 00:25:25.713
communism and socialism.

00:25:25.713 --> 00:25:27.660
You'll be like, what is Soder doing?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.640
I'm like, let me tell you the problem.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.430
- Its the alt-right Soder special.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.540
- Alt-right, I'm just like,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.137
America that I knew is gone.

00:25:34.137 --> 00:25:34.970
(laughing)

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.803
- Bring back Colorada.

00:25:35.803 --> 00:25:36.636
- Monster truck days.

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:38.780
- Viacom, more like Viacon.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.265
They're conning you, America,

00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:43.070
into believing Comedy Central's funny.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.220
- Oh dude, that's alt-left Dan.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220
- Oh I fucking love it.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.153
- That be great, just
shift back and forth.

00:25:48.153 --> 00:25:49.110
Just alt-Dan.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.020
- I don't know who I am.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.614
- Just go left to right.

00:25:51.614 --> 00:25:52.447
- Its like the Terminator scene

00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:53.280
when he's in the lava melting

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.113
into different people.

00:25:54.113 --> 00:25:55.880
I'm just like, ah fucking,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.359
abortions good and bad.

00:25:57.359 --> 00:25:58.727
Oh no.

00:25:58.727 --> 00:26:01.065
- I like, I like fucking alt-left Dan.

00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:03.740
Why don't you make illegal immigrants

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.400
CEOs of companies?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.840
Deuces.
- Deuces.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.570
- And you just go, you just go, thoughts.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.230
Pause screen.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.063
- I want to know.
- thoughts.

00:26:11.063 --> 00:26:12.556
♪ We're coming to America ♪

00:26:12.556 --> 00:26:13.389
- You call out an audience member,

00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:14.222
I need an audience member

00:26:14.222 --> 00:26:16.654
to beatbox for my closing, please.

00:26:16.654 --> 00:26:18.720
- I go, uh up in the sky, look around.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.021
Its just slam poetry.

00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:22.320
- If anybody says they have crazy thoughts

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.310
in their comedy special.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.143
I turn it off.
- Get the fuck.

00:26:24.143 --> 00:26:25.120
Yeah get the fuck out of here.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.953
- Its going right off.

00:26:25.953 --> 00:26:27.100
- What if you do, you go,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.484
I am schizophrenic.

00:26:28.484 --> 00:26:30.249
They gave me a special.

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:31.740
- Yeah, yeah.
- it's a real risk.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.380
- Unless its followed by
actually crazy thoughts

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.644
not just a shitty hack joke you wrote.

00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:38.067
He goes, oh man I got just nutty thoughts

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:39.223
going through my head
all the time, its like,

00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:41.228
I just look at Christine
sleeping there next to me

00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:43.729
and I'm like, I could just choke her

00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:45.240
and say she died in her sleep.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.760
I could put a pillow over her face,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.980
she'll never be able to stop.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.850
Nutty thoughts.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.500
I could kill a dog.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.440
- Keeps me up weeks.
- I'm so loco,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.770
I'll take a shit, I'll look at it

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.650
and I'll go, should I eat that?

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.537
Should I eat that shit?

00:26:56.537 --> 00:26:59.272
- For like a half hour I'll
have this argument in my head.

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:00.953
- Eat me, motherfucker, eat me.

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.961
- I take a cold shower with my clothes on

00:27:02.961 --> 00:27:06.060
and I go, if I could suck a ghost's dick,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.970
would I do it?

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.433
Crazy thoughts.

00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:13.433
(rock music)
(fire crackling)
