00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.040
JONATHAN VINOCOUR: ECCO, is
a conductor-less string

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.290
orchestra that's about--
we usually play

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.650
with about 18 people.


00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.100
So a bunch of us started it
back when we were just in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.360
school, or just out of school,
and looking to play pretty

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.200
much just for fun with a bunch
of our friends in a small

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.960
conductor-less orchestra.


00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.030
Most of us were playing a lot
of chamber music and just

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.140
thought it would be
fun to read some

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.250
actual orchestra music.


00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.460
When we just out listening,
it sounded so great.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.080
KATE DREYFUSS: It was inspiring
to see Jonathan come

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.380
back to Princeton, as someone
who followed the same

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.450
academic, or similar academic
paths as many of the students,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.210
and yet went on to become
a professional musician.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.250
JONATHAN VINOCOUR: I just
remember always looking

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.740
forward to coming to orchestra
rehearsals, because in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.280
orchestra it always felt like
I could just relax and enjoy

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590
the music making.


00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.900
And especially doing it with
all these other people, and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.700
knowing that there were all
these other people on campus

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.560
who wanted to be doing
the same thing.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000
NATHAN HALEY: There's
performances just happening

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.870
all the time.


00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.820
Princeton, I think in all areas,
but especially in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.770
music department, is just
bursting at the seams with

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.740
opportunities.


00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.640
And it's a great place to get
involved in all sorts of extra

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.890
curricular activities.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.020
KATE DREYFUSS: What was running
through my mind was, I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.220
just could not believe that I
would sharing the stage with

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.240
such accomplished musicians
who are involved with

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.330
ensembles all across
the country.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.190
And as I was watching them,
during the first half, I was

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.350
in awe of their energy.


00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.610
And I felt that energy
the moment that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.510
I stepped on stage.


00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.520
NATHAN HALEY: Performing with
ECCO was absolutely amazing.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.630
Their energy and their
focus is infectious.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.900
And just everyone on
the stage felt it.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.210
This warm and vibrant direction
towards the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.000
performance.


00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.010
And it was amazing to see
everyone just light up and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.680
focus, and turn to the music.


00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440
And it really came
alive for me.
