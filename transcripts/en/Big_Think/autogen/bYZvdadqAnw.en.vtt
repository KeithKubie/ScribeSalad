probably rooted someplace else and
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.370
probably rooted someplace else and
that's how you displace by delay

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
that's how you displace by delay
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.760
that's how you displace by delay

the people that within that structure

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
the people that within that structure
 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.490
the people that within that structure
