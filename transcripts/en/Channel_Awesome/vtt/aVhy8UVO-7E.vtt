00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.580
Alright, so, we're back with our first viewings, and we're going to do...

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.580
-What are we watching?
Viva Rock Vegas.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.760
Yeah, I probably deserved that.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.140
Uh, we haven't seen this, but we've made fun of this a lot.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.700
It's sort of another one of those infamous "Bad Sequels"

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.560
But we have not seen it, so...  Maybe it will be good!

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.220
Maybe we're just jumping to conclusions!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.280
-No, I...  you know what?  I will...
Just jump the gun?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.220
-I will bet you $10, right now, that we are not...

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.420
I am not gonna take you up on that bet!

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.820
I don't even like the Flintstones!

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400
I don't even like the cartoon!

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.780
I like what it did for TV and everything, and opening up prime-time animation...

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.140
- C'mon the cartoon's great!  It's all about abusing poor prehistoric animals by making them do household chores.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.180
That is the only funny part, in the cartoon, I love that part.
-Ehh

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.320
Here we go, this is our first review, our first viewing review, or whatever you want to call it, of "Viva Rock Vegas".

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.680
Oh Christ!
-Oh shit!

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000
Oh!
-Gazoo?
Oh, no!

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.040
Ah!  Ahh!!  Ahh!!  Ahhhh!!!!!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.440
Alan Cumming in his most terrifying role since "Son of the Mask"!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.520
This.  Is.  The stuff of nightmares...

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.320
Stephen Baldwin!

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.160
(Laughter)

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.160
-Like, "Usual Suspects" Stephen Baldwin, or "Slumming it, Pure Flix" Stephen Baldwin?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.980
"C'mon, we're late for God's Club!"

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.520
Oh god

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.380
So we've had aliens, cavemen, and Las Vegas...

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080
I'm sure all of these are going to connect beautifully.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.700
Who gave this very unfunny MAD TV sketch a lot of money?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.600
-You know, the CGI on that dinosaur is not very impressive.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.420
Actually, the scary thing is, his Rubble's pretty good

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.780
I think it was the role he was born it play...

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.860
"You passed!"

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.120
He'll drop it on him, drop it on him...

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.060
Drop it on him...  There you go, okay.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.720
-Wow, actual animatronics!
Yeah, I'm actually thoroughly impressed!

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.180
As Wilma?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.460
- Yuuup!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.040
That's a weird choice!

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.360
-"Incoming message from the big giant head: You've been miscast!"

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.000
She's immediately like: "What am I doing in this role?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.320
-I think that was the moment she realized: "And I picked the wrong agent."

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.540
Look there, he goes, isn't he dreamy?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.500
-Gast-rock

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.580
-I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
No...

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.340
Honestly, riding that dinosaur roller coaster looks like the most interesting thing in the movie.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.260
I'd much rather do that for an hour and a--

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.700
How are they filming it?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.520
-You don't have celluloid in...
I need to know!

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280
"This is gonna be fun, huh?"

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.240
It's Sally!
-I know!

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.720
It's not Wilma!

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.160
-And he just looks like a fat John Lithgow, maybe this is something I don't know...

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.240
That was creative, I'll give 'em that, at least...

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.780
-Yeah, a blind man gets lucky once.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.040
It's a lost "3rd Rock from the Sun" episode, where she gets a starring role in a Flintstones movie.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:13.160
Yeah, you know, I'll give it this, there's yet to be a "guy from Dune with business plan that makes no sense to screw him over"... I don't know where it's going yet.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.860
-Doug, that actor has a name.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.320
-It's Kyle Etraties, okay?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.900
Okay

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.100
Just over that hill, they're shooting "Breaking Bad".

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.460
So her mother is Cruella DeVil?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.060
-Yeah, it looks like it.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.740
-Really?  This only has a 3.5/10 stars on IMDB?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.540
-That seems pretty high!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.440
And that was comedy, apparently.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.740
-The music told me, because it went "Wah, wah".

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.300
I'm gonna go United Airlines on your ass!

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.860
-Umm, that's a horse dick he put on his plate

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.800
Oh, yeah, that's a fish.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.900
-Yeah, glub, glub, glub

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.260
"Rock Vegas, eh?"

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.900
Ahhh!
-Ahh!  Oh ho ho!
Ho ho...

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.120
Oh, and this is definitely a ride at Universal, look at that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.620
You ride the car in, and then Stephen Baldwin is literally there, not animatronic, that's just his work.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.640
"Soon, Wilma will see him for the pathetic, primitive primate he really is."

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.580
Ah, now we have the bullshit "guy trying to sabotage", okay, took a while!

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.760
-"LeWhore, I'm afraid I've been thinking..."

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.240
-So are they, like, floats for the Rose Bowl Parade?  Is that why they're decked out in flowers?  Or...

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.940
"I just found out what "calamari" means..."

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.220
Rose O'Donnell?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.880
That'd be quite an impressive downgrade, if that's her!

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.640
-"Oh, so you don't want me as Betty, but you want me as the octopus."

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.700
Well, I don't know where this is going...

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.700
Oh!  Now, where, where did that comes from?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.940
I am just shocked that's the route they went with that.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.500
Oh Christ...
-What?

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.780
We're doing this?

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.420
-No, it's okay!  I was just wiping my hot cream off her breasts!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.600
-Wait, it came out totally wrong!

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.720
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom to use the three seashells...

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.120
Really?  We're ripping off "Titanic"?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.820
Of all the scenes to rip off from Titanic, you're ripping off that one

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.420
Like, arguably the worst scene in the movie?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.860
-Wouldn't it have been so much more amazing if this movie came out first so we could say "Titanic" ripped off "Viva Rock Vegas"?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.640
"I'm systematically poisoning the dinosaur's water supply.  Their entire species will be extinct!"

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200
That was legitimately funny!

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.240
-One of the writers snapped, "Fuck it!  I'm going to have one funny joke!  Just one!"

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.280
I gotta be me!

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.860
-Oh, look what we have here, all join on this thief, oh hoh hoh hoh...

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.340
You look at Alan Cumming, and clearly put weird makeup on him

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.480
You look at Stephen Baldwin and it's like, what makeup did they put on him?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.280
No, that's just how he looks.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.300
"Hey, I might be out of a job tomorrow.  Brother's gotta have a little nest egg, ya dig?"

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.640
-No, that's getting a little too "Dumbo" for me.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.980
It's amazing how much it just so looks like he's there.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.000
-Yeah, I, I'm really something...

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.960
This is the only time where Stephen Baldwin really looks like he's looking at something, cuz this is probably what he sees every day.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.900
-Honestly, I think I would probably rather watch the Geico Caveman Sitcom than this.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.740
Don't say things you can't take back.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.620
-I don't know, I'm...  They're shorter.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.760
Ha hah, ha hah, cuz cuz it looks like it, ah, why'd you give him two...

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.160
Oh what heights, we'll hit... On with the show, this is it...

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.380
This is not the line of work for you, everyone's getting AIDS and shit!

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.480
-And somebody at Pure Flix saw this and said: "You know what, we need him for our Christian movie."

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.120
-You know, I'd be driven to Christ after this movie too, not gonna lie!

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.540
-Is he a dragonfruit?  What is that?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.860
He looks like... how babies are made, just all the sperm going into the egg.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.220
-Actually, interesting thing, they had a laugh track for this, exactly like the show

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.280
-But they couldn't even get people to fake laugh at this.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.140
-Gazoo's like: "And now, I mercifully release you from your torment!"

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.240
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.780
-There's six minutes of credits left, that that many people wanted their name attached to this film.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.200
Well, okay, ultimate question, is it worse than the first one?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.600
I feel like this one had more color to it than the first one.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.220
-The first one... this one had more color to it.  And this is scary, I feel like this one felt shorter.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.760
Yeah.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.980
And it did have that one funny dinosaur line, and I can't think of one laugh in the first "Flintstones" movie.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.960
-Gazoo will haunt my nightmares.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.480
-That's for damn sure.
Yeah, that was so terrifying!

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.000
-Oh my god...

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.340
This movie's stupid, it's just stupid.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.840
-God!

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.100
Dumb movie!

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.480
-Oh!  I've got nothing to say.  What do you say to this?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.520
Yeah, just dumb.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.880
-Rotton Tomatoes: 25%

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.780
-For the record!  I think Donald Trump  right now is sitting at 36%.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.000
-Donald Trump is doing better than this movie 
Than Flintstones
-by 11%.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.800
-Well, what can we say but "Ehh, it's a living."

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.580
-We'll have a gay old time!
We're done now.  We're done!
