00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.554
I came to talk about first principles

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.738
and communities that I love --

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:20.164
especially East Palo Alto, California,

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:22.959
which is full of amazing people.

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.595
It's also a community
that's oddly separated

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.905
by the 101 freeway
that runs through Silicon Valley.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.294
On the west side of the freeway
in Palo Alto are the "haves,"

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:35.443
on just about any dimension
you can think of:

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:37.601
education, income, access to water.

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.417
On the east side of the freeway
are the "have-nots."

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.859
And even if you don't know East Palo Alto,

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:46.145
you might know the story
of eastside disparity,

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:50.364
whether it's the separation
of the railroad tracks in East Pittsburgh

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:53.283
or the Grosse Pointe Gate in East Detroit

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:56.241
or East St. Louis,
East Oakland, East Philly.

00:00:56.903 --> 00:01:01.732
Why is it that communities on the social,
economic and environmental margin

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.327
tend to be on the east sides of places?

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.872
Turns out,

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:08.049
it's the wind.

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.307
If you look at the Earth
from the North Pole,

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.559
you'd see that it rotates
counterclockwise.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.143
The impact of this

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.292
is that the winds in the northern
and the southern hemispheres

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:21.390
blow in the same direction
as the rotation of the Earth --

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.580
to the east.

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.031
A way to think about this is:

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.019
imagine you're sitting around a campfire.

00:01:26.043 --> 00:01:29.224
You've got to seat 10 people,
you've got to keep everyone warm.

00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:33.377
The question is: Who sits with
the smoky wind blowing in their face?

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:34.819
And the answer is:

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:36.131
people with less power.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.924
This campfire dynamic
is what's playing out in cities,

00:01:39.948 --> 00:01:42.062
not just in the US,
but all around the world:

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:45.328
East London; the east side
of Paris is this way;

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:46.502
East Jerusalem.

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:49.657
Even down the street from
where we're sitting right now,

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.069
the marginalized community
is East Vancouver.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.339
I'm not the only one to notice this.

00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:56.656
I nerded on this hard, for years.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.060
And I finally found a group
of economic historians in the UK

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:03.649
who modeled industrial-era
smokestack dispersion.

00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:06.109
And they came to the same
conclusion mathematically

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.091
that I'd come to as an anthropologist,

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:12.617
which is: wind and pollution are driving
marginalized communities to the east.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:16.395
The dominant logic of the industrial era

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.156
is about disparity.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.687
It's about haves and have-nots,
and that's become part of our culture.

00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.141
That's why you know exactly
what I'm talking about

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:27.014
if I tell you someone's
from the "wrong side of the tracks."

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:31.387
That phrase comes from the direction
that wind would blow dirty train smoke --

00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.549
to the east, usually.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.863
I'm not saying every single community
in the east is on the margin,

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:40.188
or every community
on the margin is in the east,

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:44.727
but I'm trying to make a bigger point
about disparity by design.

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.964
So if you find yourself
talking about any cardinal direction

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:50.787
of a freeway, a river, some train tracks,

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.544
you're talking about
an eastside community.

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:58.020
Now, the wind is obviously
a natural phenomenon.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:02.061
But the human design decisions
that we make to separate ourselves

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.235
is not natural.

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:08.311
Consider the fact that every
eastside community in the United States

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.468
was built during the era
of legal segregation.

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.633
We clearly weren't even trying to design
for the benefit of everyone,

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:18.561
so we ended up dealing
with issues like redlining.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:21.411
This is where the government
literally created maps

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.807
to tell bankers where they shouldn't lend.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.855
These are some of those actual maps.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.276
And you'll notice how
the red tends to be clustered

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.566
on the east sides of these cities.

00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:36.186
Those financial design decisions
became a self-fulfilling prophecy:

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.179
no loans turned
into low property tax base

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:44.149
and that bled into worse schools
and a less well-prepared workforce,

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:46.022
and -- lo and behold -- lower incomes.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.164
It means that you
can't qualify for a loan.

00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:51.268
Just a vicious downward spiral.

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.141
And that's just the case with lending.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:57.623
We've made similarly sinister design
decisions on any number of issues,

00:03:57.647 --> 00:03:59.087
from water infrastructure

00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.252
to where we decide to place
grocery stores versus liquor stores,

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:08.704
or even for whom and how
we design and fund technology products.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.341
Collectively, this list of harms

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:16.805
is the artifact of our more
primitive selves.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.506
I don't think this is how
we'd want to be remembered,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.561
but this is basically
what we've been doing

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:24.963
to eastside communities
for the last century.

00:04:26.212 --> 00:04:28.653
The good news is,
it doesn't have to be this way.

00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:31.832
We got ourselves into
this eastside dilemma

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:33.034
through bad design,

00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:35.199
and so we can get out of it
with good design.

00:04:35.854 --> 00:04:39.625
And I believe the first principle
of good design is actually really simple:

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.783
we have to start with the commitment
to design for the benefit of everyone.

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:45.783
So, remember the campfire metaphor.

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:49.228
If we want to benefit everyone,
maybe we just sit in a horseshoe,

00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:51.452
so nobody gets the smoke in their face.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.139
I've got to make a note
to the gentrifiers,

00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:56.290
because the point
of this image is not to say

00:04:56.314 --> 00:05:00.084
you get to roll into eastside communities
and just move people out of the way,

00:05:00.108 --> 00:05:01.298
because you don't.

00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:02.678
(Applause)

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.402
But the point is,

00:05:04.426 --> 00:05:07.926
if you start with this first principle
of benefiting everyone,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.601
then elegant solutions may become
more obvious than you assume.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:15.212
What are the elegant solutions
to close this gap

00:05:15.236 --> 00:05:18.477
between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto
in Silicon Valley?

00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:22.552
I've got to like the odds
of starting with EPA [East Palo Alto].

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:26.561
It's in the middle of Silicon Valley,
the epicenter of innovation

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:27.808
and wealth creation.

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.688
If we can solve this problem anywhere,
it ought to be here.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:33.299
And if we can solve the problems for EPA,

00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:36.281
we could apply those solutions
to other eastside communities.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.580
If you think about it, it's actually
a massive investment opportunity

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:46.152
and an opportunity to drive
policy change and philanthropy.

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:50.656
But at the core, it's this
fundamental design principle,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.926
this choice of whether we're going
to decide to take care of everyone.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:58.601
And it's a choice we can make, loved ones.

00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:00.949
We've got the capital.

00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:03.224
We've got technology on our side,

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:04.927
and it keeps getting better.

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:08.261
We've got some of the best entrepreneurs
in the world in this building

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.205
and in these communities right now.

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.475
But the fundamental question is:
What are we designing for?

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.046
More haves and have-nots? More disparity?

00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:19.423
Or parity,

00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:21.044
the choice to come together.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.890
Because the reality is,
this is not the industrial era.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.013
We don't live in the era
of legal segregation.

00:06:32.112 --> 00:06:35.951
So the punchline is,
there is no wrong side of the tracks.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.214
And all I'm saying is,

00:06:38.238 --> 00:06:42.771
we should design our economy
and our communities with that in mind.

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:44.651
Thank you.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:49.206
(Applause)
