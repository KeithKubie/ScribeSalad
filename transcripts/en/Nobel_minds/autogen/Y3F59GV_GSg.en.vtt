which was one of the methods available

migrate properly at all and I was

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810
migrate properly at all and I was
 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.120
migrate properly at all and I was
probably disappointed but then I heard

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
probably disappointed but then I heard
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.230
probably disappointed but then I heard
of Saturday again

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240
 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.150
notice I heard of some work going on in

notice I heard of some work going on in
 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.130
notice I heard of some work going on in
the Hospital for Sick Children where

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.170
the Hospital for Sick Children where
they were using another method they were

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
they were using another method they were
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.110
they were using another method they were
using starch grains as a supporting

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
using starch grains as a supporting
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.750
using starch grains as a supporting
medium instead of filter paper and they

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
medium instead of filter paper and they
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.840
medium instead of filter paper and they
made rather like a salmon pie the moist

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
made rather like a salmon pie the moist
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.270
made rather like a salmon pie the moist
starch grains and they allowed the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
starch grains and they allowed the
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.660
starch grains and they allowed the
protein to migrate through this starch

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
protein to migrate through this starch
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.730
protein to migrate through this starch
around these starch grains and then cut

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740
around these starch grains and then cut
 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.700
around these starch grains and then cut
it up into about 40 slices and did a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710
it up into about 40 slices and did a
 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.940
it up into about 40 slices and did a
protein determination on every slice in

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950
protein determination on every slice in
 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.560

helping my mother to do the laundry when
 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.600
helping my mother to do the laundry when
I was a child and that when she starts

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610

sit around it turned into a jelly and I

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810
sit around it turned into a jelly and I
 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.290
sit around it turned into a jelly and I
thought well maybe then I couldn't

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300
thought well maybe then I couldn't
 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.420

instead of using starch grains I can

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
instead of using starch grains I can
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.300
instead of using starch grains I can
cook the starch or make a gel and then

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310
cook the starch or make a gel and then
 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.850
cook the starch or make a gel and then
all I need to do is stain it instead of

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860
all I need to do is stain it instead of
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.150
all I need to do is stain it instead of
doing all this business and that would

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
doing all this business and that would
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.650
doing all this business and that would
save a lot of trouble so I tried it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660
save a lot of trouble so I tried it
 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.750
save a lot of trouble so I tried it
Saturday afternoon

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760
 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.960
Oh since we're on the topic of Saturday

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
Oh since we're on the topic of Saturday
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.750
Oh since we're on the topic of Saturday
I should say that on Saturday you can do

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
I should say that on Saturday you can do
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.270
I should say that on Saturday you can do
or what I call Saturday morning

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280
or what I call Saturday morning
 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.830

experiments which means that you don't

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840
experiments which means that you don't
 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.350
experiments which means that you don't
have to weigh anything and it doesn't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360
have to weigh anything and it doesn't
 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.570
have to weigh anything and it doesn't
have to be rational you can do anything

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580
have to be rational you can do anything
 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.869
have to be rational you can do anything
you like on Saturday so so this was it

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879
you like on Saturday so so this was it
 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.030
you like on Saturday so so this was it
Ania and I tried this and you can see

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
Ania and I tried this and you can see
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.970
Ania and I tried this and you can see
they're about it and I made the remark

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980
they're about it and I made the remark
 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.039
they're about it and I made the remark
but the result is very promising because

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049
but the result is very promising because
 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.740
but the result is very promising because

unrolled carpet but there was something

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840
unrolled carpet but there was something
 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.190
unrolled carpet but there was something
else about this which was actually very

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200
else about this which was actually very
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.529
else about this which was actually very
accidental I had nothing to do with it

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539
accidental I had nothing to do with it
 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.170
accidental I had nothing to do with it
being important and that was that in

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180
being important and that was that in

being important and that was that in
order to make this gel I had to use a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880
order to make this gel I had to use a
 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.170
order to make this gel I had to use a
very high concentration of the starch it

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
very high concentration of the starch it
 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.390
very high concentration of the starch it
would not gel until it was a high

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400
would not gel until it was a high
 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.500
would not gel until it was a high
concentration so quite accidentally I'd

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510
concentration so quite accidentally I'd
 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.870
concentration so quite accidentally I'd
invented a molecular sieve

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
invented a molecular sieve
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.120
invented a molecular sieve
electrophoresis which turned out to be

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
electrophoresis which turned out to be
 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.180
electrophoresis which turned out to be
quite powerful and you've often used it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190
quite powerful and you've often used it
 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.050
quite powerful and you've often used it
in your poly acrylamide gel so that was

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060
in your poly acrylamide gel so that was
 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.350
in your poly acrylamide gel so that was
a complete accident but I I did then for

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360
a complete accident but I I did then for
 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.260
a complete accident but I I did then for
interest to try looking at the blood

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270

proteins and I found that I get

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
proteins and I found that I get
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.600
proteins and I found that I get
excellent separation and many more

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610
excellent separation and many more
 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.600
excellent separation and many more

that point thought were present in blood
 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.960
that point thought were present in blood
so I stopped working on insulin and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970
so I stopped working on insulin and
 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.580
so I stopped working on insulin and
began to work on blood proteins and I

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590
began to work on blood proteins and I
 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.740
began to work on blood proteins and I
was about ready to publishing and these

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750
was about ready to publishing and these
 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.520
was about ready to publishing and these
are two patents from my friend I had to
