00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
A long time ago in a lab far, far away....

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
Welcome to Science Wars

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.720
Chemistry, Bio, Physics and Mathematical!

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320
Which field is best?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.800
(PHYSICS)

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.000
I understand the force and energy

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820
Quantum mechanics and relativity

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.940
My field is pure and they rely on me

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.680
I see the universe like nobody

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.780
You may have made fun of me in high school

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.640
For being awkward and following the rules.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.400
Now I've got lazers. (Wow, that's really cool!)

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.260
May the mass times acceleration be with you...

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.600
ATOMS!

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920
ENTROPY!

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.460
DARK MATTER!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.460
STRING THEORY!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.080
(CHEMISTRY)

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.080
If you want to feel a bond

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Then I can give a you a reaction

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
The element that make up me are the essence

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.340
Are my satisfaction

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.440
All the other fields out there are so basic

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.440
Yeah, I’m the central science

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
Keep your eye on me, I’ll get you charged

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.380
If you need me, call me up on Avogadro's Number

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.080
If you leave me, take a titrant 
Shove it up your acid buffer

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.620
Dopamine and serotonin will keep you good and happy

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.480
So get your flask and your glass all set up

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
And begin to understand the world!

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.140
(BIOLOGY)

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.680
Within me you’ll find life’s beauty

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.840
From genetics to ecology

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.240
Symbiosis and not division

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.860
Unless it’s mitosis or the study of fission

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.900
Even if you don’t pass, at least you’ll enjoy my class!

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.840
Evolution has brung us along

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.020
All species singing one song

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.920
(MATH)

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.800
If you want to learn about the world I must say

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.320
I am the purest field of study you can take

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.440
Immune to misinterpretation

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.820
The blueprint of creation

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.680
The backbone of all things science

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.740
No bias, just constant augmentation

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.960
In your mind and observation

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.660
No gadgets, just your logic and your time

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.380
(PHYSICS) And Pi!

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.600
(ALL) Together we will find the answers to life!

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.680
With physics - bio - chemistry -
 and math

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.080
We can SCIENCE
