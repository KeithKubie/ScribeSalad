00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:04.755
An IntentService is the base class for
services that are used to handle

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:09.144
asynchronous requests,
expressed as intents and done on demand.

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:15.414
Your app will send a request by starting
the service and passing it an intent.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:19.560
If the service hasn't already started,
it will start if needed.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.990
And it will handle each intent in turn,
using a worker thread.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.730
When there are no more intents,
it will just stop itself.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.700
It uses a single worker thread,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.240
meaning that only one request
will be processed at a time.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.500
But it won't block the application from
continuing doing what it needs to do.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.140
In the next steps,
you'll create the IntentService class

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.890
called geofenceTransitions
IntentService.
