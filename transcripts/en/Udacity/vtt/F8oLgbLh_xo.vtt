00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.444
&gt;&gt; Alright, so Michael. Last set of features that that's come up

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:06.220
with three or four, three or four more features and then move on.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.490
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.110
&gt;&gt; So come up with a couple.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.460
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I could, sometimes I'll look at the menu that's

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.800
posted outside, and I'll see if the, you know? How pricey it is.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.110
&gt;&gt; Okay, so cost. Right, so cost can be represented as discrete

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.359
input. By the way, it could also be represented as an actual number.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.580
Right? We could say, look it's cheap, it's moderately

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.970
expensive, it's really expensive or you could have a number

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.650
which is the average cost of an entry. And it

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.850
doesn't really matter for, for what we're talking about now

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.270
but just some way of representing cost. Okay. Just

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.750
give me one or two more features but I want

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.970
to give me some features that don't have anything to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.220
do with the restraunt itself but might still be important.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.810
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.320
&gt;&gt; because, by the way, hot date probably doesn't have anything to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.130
do with the restaurant itself. So, even though we've

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.240
been talking the features of the restaurant. We've actually

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.670
been picking up, at least, one feature that doesn't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.820
have anything to do directly with the restaurant itself.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.530
&gt;&gt; Not to. So, whether I'm hungry?

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.459
&gt;&gt; I like that. Here's another one.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.630
What's the weather like. Is it raining outside?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
&gt;&gt; Which is a different sense of atmosphere.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.992
&gt;&gt; Right. because if it's raining outside, maybe it's not

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:15.360
your, your favorite choice but you don't want to walk anymore.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.750
Okay, so we have a ton of features here. We've gone

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.870
through a few of them. Notice that some of the specifically have

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.390
to do with the restaurant and some of them have to do

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.710
with things that are external to the restaurant itself but you can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.790
imagine that they're all important. Or possibly important to whether you

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.470
should enter into the restaurant or not. Agreed? And there's a bunch

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.650
of features you could imagine coming up with that probably have nothing

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.800
to do with whether you should enter into the restaurant or not.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.700
Like, how many cars are currently parked across the country.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.020
Probably doesn't have an impact on whether you're going to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.670
enter into a specific restaurant or not. Okay. So, we

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.850
have a whole bunch of features and right now we're sticking

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.700
with features we think that might be relevant. And we're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.420
going to use those to make some kind of decision. So,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.910
that gets us to decision trees. So, the first thing,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.900
that, that we want to do is, we want to separate

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.669
out what a decision tree is from the

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.840
algorithm that you might use to build the decision

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.805
tree. So the first thing we want to think about is the fact that a decision tree

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.780
has a specific representation. Then only after we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.860
understand that representation and go through an example, we'll

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.600
start thinking about an algorithm for finding or

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.980
building a decision tree. Okay, are you with me?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.730
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Okay, so a decision tree is a very simple thing.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.750
Well, you might be, might be surprised to know it's a tree, the first part of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.870
it. And it looks kind of like this. So, what I've drawn for you is example.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.080
Sample generic, decision tree. And what you'll see

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.970
is three parts to it. The first thing

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.930
you'll see is a circle. These are called

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.630
nodes, and these are in fact, decision nodes. So,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.040
what you do here, is you pick a particular attribute. [NOISE]

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.450
And you ask a question about it. The answer to that question, which is its

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.250
value for what the edges represent in your tree. Okay. So we have these nodes

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.480
which represent attributes, and we have edges

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.570
which represent value. So let's be specific about

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.530
what that means. So here's a particular attribute

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.530
we might pick for the top node here.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.070
Let's call it hungry. That's one of the features

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.720
that Michael came up with. Am I hungry or

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.220
not? And there's only two possible answers for that.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.460
yes, I'm hungry, true, or false, I am not hungry.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.240
And each of these nodes represent some

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.630
attribute. And the edges represent the answers

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.040
for specific values. So it's as if I'm making a bunch of decisions by asking

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.650
a series of questions. Am I hungry? And if the answer is yes, I am

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.870
hungry, then I go and I ask a different question. Like is it rainy outside?

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.030
And maybe it is rainy and maybe it's not rainy, and let's say if it isn't rainy

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.750
then I want to make a decision, and so these square boxes here are the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.790
actual output. Okay so it's hungry, so you're hungry, yes, and it's not

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.410
raining, so what do you do? So, let's just say you go in.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.080
True, I go in so, when it's, I'm hungry and it's not raining, I go in.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.870
&gt;&gt; And that, that true is answering a different question. It's not in the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.990
nodes I guess. So, in the leaves, the t and f means something different.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.910
&gt;&gt; That's right. It's the out, that's exactly right. The,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.300
the leaves, the little boxes, the leaves of your decision

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.020
tree is your answer. What's on the on the edges

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.830
are the possible values that your attribute can take on.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.030
So, in fact, let's try to, let's make that clear by picking a different

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.250
by picking another possible attribute. You could

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.490
imagine that if I am not hungry, what's

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.510
going to matter a lot now is say, the type of restaurant, right. Which we

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.830
said there were many, many types of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.412
restaurants. So, you know thai, I forget [CROSSTALK]

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:09.662
&gt;&gt; Italian.

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:11.450
&gt;&gt; Italian, and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.930
you know, something.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.430
&gt;&gt; French fries.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.450
&gt;&gt; And French Fries. So if I'm not hungry, then

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.540
what matters a lot more is the type of restaurant,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.060
and so I'll move down this path instead and start

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.930
asking other questions. But ultimately, no matter how I, what

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.860
this decision tree allows me to do is to ask

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.330
a series of questions and depending upon those answers, move

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.670
down the tree, until eventually I have some particular ouput

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.490
answer, yes I go in the resteraunt, or no I do

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.600
not

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640
&gt;&gt; Ok this is still seeming a little abstract to me,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.810
can we, can we maybe work through a very concrete example.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.630
&gt;&gt; Let's do a quiz.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.690
&gt;&gt; Ha, okay, let's do a quiz.
