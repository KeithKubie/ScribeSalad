IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi,
everyone. [SPEAKING TURKISH]

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.420
For the English speaking, I'll
be actually talking Turkish

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.600
so far.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.730
But now, my presentation
will be in English

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880
so you can go over it.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.990
And it has all the slides, and
the code source will be public.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.890
And I will even put this on
YouTube, once we are recorded

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.450
and this live streaming is done.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.990
So you can get it from there.

-Wouldn't it be amazing
if Google could understand

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.830
that the words that you use
when you're doing a search

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.814
weren't just words, they refer
to real things in the world,

00:23:13.814 --> 00:23:17.798
that a building is a building,
and an animal is an animal,

00:23:17.798 --> 00:23:20.786
and that they're not just
random strings of characters.

00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:24.272
If we could understand that
those words are talking

00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:26.258
about those real-world
things, then we

00:23:26.258 --> 00:23:27.758
could do a better
job of getting you

00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:30.248
just the content that
you want of the web.

00:23:30.248 --> 00:23:33.236

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.228
-Today, Google is
trying to build

00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:37.220
information about
real-world connections--

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.212
is by building a
knowledge graph.

00:23:39.212 --> 00:23:41.702
A knowledge graph is about
collecting information

00:23:41.702 --> 00:23:43.694
about objects in the real world.

00:23:43.694 --> 00:23:47.180
The object could be a
person, could be a book,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.670
could be a movie, and many
other types of things.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.662
For example, for
a famous person,

00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:54.152
we collect relevant
data about them,

00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:57.140
such as their date of
birth or how tall they are.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.124
It can also connect that person
to closely related objects

00:24:01.124 --> 00:24:03.116
in a knowledge graph.

00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:06.602
-Let's say we're interested
in Renaissance painters,

00:24:06.602 --> 00:24:10.088
or how about how many women
have won the Nobel Prize--

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:13.076
I understand the
relationships between things,

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:15.068
between painters
in the Renaissance

00:24:15.068 --> 00:24:17.219
or women and the Nobel Prize.

00:24:17.219 --> 00:24:19.052
Google can do a better
job of understanding.

00:24:19.052 --> 00:24:21.542
Google knows exactly
what we're searching for.

00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:24.530
-One of the first features
we're going to introduce,

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.016
which applies to the knowledge
graph, is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:30.008
next to the web results.

00:24:30.008 --> 00:24:31.502
-When I had a
question to answer,

00:24:31.502 --> 00:24:33.992
I wish we had come to
Google and that inter--
