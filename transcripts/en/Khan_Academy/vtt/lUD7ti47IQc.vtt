00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.790
Sometimes when you're doing
a large multipart proof

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.760
like this, it's easy
to lose your bearings.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.710
We're trying to prove
the divergence theorem.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.900
Well, we started off
just rewriting the flux

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.660
across the surface and
rewriting the triple integral

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.634
of the divergence.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.050
And we said, well,
if we can prove

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.300
that each of these components
are equal to each other,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.530
we will have our proof done.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.710
And what I said is that
we're going to use the fact

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.940
this is a Type 1 region
to prove this part,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.191
the fact that it's a Type 2
region to prove this part,

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.606
and the fact that it's a Type
3 region to prove this part.

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.400
In particular, I'm
going to show the fact

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.950
that, if it is a Type 1
region, we can prove this.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.660
And you can use the
exact same argument

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.560
to prove the other
two-- in which case,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.680
the divergence theorem
would be correct.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.520
So we're focused on
this part right here.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.980
And in particular, we're focused
on evaluating this surface

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.607
integral.

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:45.190
And to evaluate that
surface integral,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.220
we broke up the entire
surface into three surfaces--

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.720
that upper bound on z,
the lower bound on z,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.060
and kind of the side
of-- if you imagine

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.530
some type of a funky cylinder.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.885
These don't have to be
flat tops and bottoms.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.510
And for a Type 1
region, you don't even

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.801
have to have this side surface.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.010
This is only for the case where
the two surfaces don't touch

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.130
each other within this
domain right over here.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.830
So we broke it up
into three surfaces.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160
But we said, look,
the normal vector

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.940
along the side right
over here is never

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.300
going to have a k component.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.570
And so when you take the dot
product with the k unit vector,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.560
this is just going to cross out.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.080
So our surface
integral simplified

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.950
to the surface integral over s2
and the surface integral of s1.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.897
And in the last video, we
evaluated the surface integral

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:32.230
of s2-- or at least, we turned
it into a double integral

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.550
over the domain.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.960
Now, I'm going to do the
same exact thing with s1.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.850
So let's just remind ourselves
what we are concerned with.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.120
We want to re-express s1.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.000
This surface
integral-- I should say

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.730
we want to re-express the
surface integral over s1.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.864
It was r of x, y, and z.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:56.155
Up here we just wrote r, but
this is making it explicit

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:59.710
that r is a function
of x, y, and z.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.450
Times k dot n ds.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.840
And the way we evaluate
any surface integral

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.960
is we want to have
a parameterization

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.690
for our actual surface.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.440
So let's introduce
a parameterization

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.560
for our surface.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
Let's say that
s1-- and I'll use--

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440
the letter O is kind
of a weird one to use.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.939
It looks like a 0,
and we're already

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.090
using it for our normal vector.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.030
Let's use e.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.690
So the parameterization of
our surface could be x times i

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.460
plus y times j plus-- and
since it's a Type 2 region,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.120
our surface is a function
of x and y-- plus f1--

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.770
which is a function
of xy-- times k.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.420
We see f1 right over here.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.240
That's our lower
bound on our region.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.240
And then, this is for
all of the xy pairs that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.590
are a member of our
domain in question.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.120
So we have our parameterization.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.800
Now, we can think
about how we can

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.390
write this right
over here, the nds.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.652
And so n times ds-- so
we've done this multiple,

00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:14.070
multiple, multiple
times-- which is actually

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.610
the same thing as ds.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.320
We've done this multiple times.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.100
This is equal to the cross
product of the parameterization

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.740
in one direction with
respect to one parameter.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.990
And then, that cross with
respect to the other parameter.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.300
And then, that times da.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.850
But we want to make sure
we get the order right.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.360
So I'm going to
claim that this is

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.180
going to be the partial of our
parameterization with respect

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.810
to y crossed with the partial
of our parameterization

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.540
with respect to x.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.307
And then, we have times da.

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.640
But we need to make sure this
has the right orientation.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.120
Because, for this bottom
surface, remember,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.090
we need to be pointed straight
down, outward from the region.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.070
So if we're going
in the y direction,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.210
the partial with respect
to y is like that.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.550
The partial with respect
to x is like that.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.040
And if you use the
right-hand rule,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.060
your thumb will point
downward, like that.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.800
I could draw my right hand.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.850
My index finger
could go like that.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.560
My middle finger
would bend like this.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.720
I don't really care what
my other two fingers do.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.010
And then, my thumb
would go downwards.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.425
So this is the right order,
which is a different order,

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:22.550
or it's the opposite
ordering, as we did last time.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.383
You'll see, we'll just
get a negative value,

00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:26.240
but let's just work
it through just

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.750
to be a little bit
more convincing.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.060
So this business
right over here is

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.150
going to be equal to-- let's
write our i, j, and k unit

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.310
vectors.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.160
It's going to be all
of that times da.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.350
So the partial of
e with respect to y

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.640
is 0, 1, partial of
f1 with respect to y.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.920
Partial with respect
to x is going

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.419
to be 0, 1, partial of
f1 with respect to x.

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.335
And then, when you
evaluate this whole thing--

00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:09.251
and so let me draw a
little dotted line here--

00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.850
this is going to be equal
to some business times i

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.470
minus some other
business times j.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.120
And on our k
component, you're going

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.230
to have 0 times 0
minus 1 times k.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.400
So minus k, and then,
all of that times da.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.910
And now, the reason why I didn't
take even worry about what

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.540
these things are
going to be is I'm

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.840
going to have to take the
dropped product with k.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.280
So this whole thing--
all of this business

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.550
right over here-- I can now
express in the xy domain.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.450
I can now write is going to be
equal to the double integral.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.200
And let me do it in
that same purple color

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.960
because that was the original
color for that surface

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.460
integral.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.110
It's going to be the double
integral over our parameter's

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.560
domain, in the xy
plane of r of x--

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.090
let me write this a little
bit cleaner-- r of xy.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.590
Instead of z, I'm going to
write z over that surface is

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.470
f1 of x and y, so that
we have everything

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.250
in terms of our parameters.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.670
Times all of this
business k dotted this.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.740
Well, what is k dotted this?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.500
Well, the dot product of k
and negative k is negative 1.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.340
So we're just going to
be left with negative da.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.550
So we'll put the
da out front here.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.860
And we have a negative
da right over here.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.090
So we have now expressed
this surface integral

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.030
as the sum of two
double integrals.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.150
Let me find it.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.670
The sum of this, the sum of
that and that right over there.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.030
And actually, let
me just rewrite it

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.340
just so that we can
make everything clear.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.942
So this surface integral.

00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:56.400
So let me write it
right over here.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.440
The surface integral over our
entire surface of r times k

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.895
dot n ds is equal to
the double integral--

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:08.870
and I'll do this
in a new color--

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.170
is equal to the double
integral in the domain

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:18.500
d of this thing
minus this thing da.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:26.830
So I'll write r of
xy and f2 of xy,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:37.220
and that's that minus this--
minus r of xy and f1--

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.719
be careful here-- f1 of xy.

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.135
That's this thing
right over here.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:49.110
All of that times da.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.610
Now, we just showed
this is equal to this.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.760
All we have to show now
is that this is also

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.010
equal to that same expression.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.602
And we will have proven
this for the Type 1 case.

00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:00.810
And we can use the exact
same argument for the Type 2

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.360
and Type 3 cases and feel good
that the divergence theorem is

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.270
about to be proven for
a simple solid region.
