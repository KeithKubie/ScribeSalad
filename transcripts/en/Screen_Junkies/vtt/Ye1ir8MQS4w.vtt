00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.180
For years, Sony has tried to launch a Spider-Verse to call its own.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.420
Some have been good,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.400
some have been bad,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460
some have been Venom.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.420
And some never even started swinging.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.040
Now, they're back, with an all-new strategy.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.760
Saying f*** it and doing all the spider stuff at once.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.000
Strap in with this fresh take on your favorite neighborhood superhero.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.160
That's probably one of the best movies of 2018.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.920
But it's... got a lot of...

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.420
spiders in it?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.120
I dunno.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.440
This movie's a work of art, man.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.700
Maybe I'll just run out the clock on this one by pushing random buttons in my booth.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.500
Hmmm.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.480
What's this one do?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.220
Uh, that's not a good sound.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.240
Whoa! I don't think I'm in my recording booth anymore.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.080
Who are you?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.060
I'm Epic Geek Girl, the voice of Honest Trailers from an alternate dimension.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.440
Just sunny, upbeat, and emotionally healthier.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.800
And...?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.900
And what? That's all the explanation the movie gave.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.180
Want to team up for this one?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.200
Heck yeah!

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480
Suit up for a fresh new take on the Spider-Man franchise

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.340
that combines jaw-dropping camerawork and fever dream visuals

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.300
with a multicultural hip-hop fueled New York that proves Sony product placement is the one constant in the multiverse.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.920
To create a mold breaking superhero story with the meta of Deadpool and Lego Batman.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.340
Save it for Comic-Con.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.520
What's Comic-Con?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.780
The heart of Superman

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.540
and the visual style of Pix--

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.640
Actually, this movie doesn't look anything like the animation we've gotten used to.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.820
Does every animated character in your reality do the eyebrows thing too?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.500
Yep.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.740
Uhhh.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.260
This booth is getting kind of crowded.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.220
Who are you three?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.360
I'm the Epic Dungeon Master, a far traveler from a distant realm who earns his keep being critical about movies.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.480
G'day.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.280
I'm Australian voice guy.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.380
I'm Australian.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.620
Huh. How's that work?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.300
Booobs.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960
- Ohhh.
- That makes sense.
- Yeah, that works.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.560
Shall we continue this quest?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.800
Let's do this.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.080
Park your Peters, because there's an all-new Spider-Man on the block.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.360
Miles Morales.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.140
He's a relatable, sweet, nerdy high school kid that was bitten by a radioactive spider.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.100
Wait...

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.480
How is he all-new?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.940
This Spider-Man...

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.660
likes Post Malone?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.780
- Oh ok.
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Completely different.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.000
But you won't want to walk a mile in his loose-fitting shoes.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.460
Because this spider guy doesn't just have one coming-of-age problem.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.580
He's got all of them.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.740
From dealing with his demanding dad

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.780
Finding his artistic voice

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.760
To fitting in at a new school

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.800
Living away from home for the first time

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.000
And puberty

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.080
It's a puberty thing.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.740
I don't know why I said that.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.100
Crikey! Just so puberty!

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.400
Please stop sticking.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.380
But Miles isn't alone on his spider quest.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.980
Because plenty of spider folk are joining his party.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.560
From the hot bod version

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.140
to the dad bod version

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.320
Sometimes I let matches burn down to my fingertips just to feel something, anything.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.640
John Mulaney, playing himself.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.040
I just washed my hands, that's why they're wet.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.440
And one that's so anime I'm amazed she's not licensed by Funimation.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.540
Together, they'll battle all-new takes on classic spider bad guys.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.920
Like the chaotic neutral and completely terrifying Prowler

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.620
And the sexy cat lady version of Doc Ock

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.400
All led by the Kingpin.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.400
A tragic villain mourning the loss of his wife, his son,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.460
and his neck.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.580
Hey, don't take my punchlines in my own booth!

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.800
Sorry mate, sorry.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.920
Ugh, this is a mess!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.580
How did the movie keep all this manageable?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.760
So take the leap with a movie that sounded like a terrible idea when you first heard about it.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.320
But ended up being so good we can't wait for more Miles

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.720
Or Gwen Stacy

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.500
Or whatever they throw at us

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.560
I'm down.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.740
Down Under.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.620
Get it? I'm Australian.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.560
Except for that one.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.020
Well guys...

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.800
It's been fun, but it's time to wrap up.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.460
How do you want to do this?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.700
You know, you guys could always stay.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.340
We could be an epic voice family.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.380
Sorry mate, kangaroos to box.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.220
Until we meet again, my friend.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.060
Is it Tuesday yet?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.120
Plus if we stay here our atoms will explode, so later nerd!

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.940
Bye Felicia

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.960
Oh man.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.100
I hope they come back soon.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.820
Because I'm not watching the Jared Leto Morbius movie by myself.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.500
Thanks to my epic voice-verse friend, Felicia Day.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.520

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.300

Yes.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.200
Do we have a healthy history with Twilight?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.100
No.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.180
