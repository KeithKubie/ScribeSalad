00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.979
Hello Internet

00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.060
The UK had an election we need to talk about
because after the debates finished, the people

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.779
voted and the ballots tallied the results
were this:

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.260
But parliament ended up looking like this:

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.900
Which isn't, exactly, representative. And
by not exactly, I mean at all.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.609
Red earned 30% of the vote and 36% of the
seats, which is sort of close, but the rest

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.699
is madness: Orange earned 8% of the vote but
got one eighth of that while Yellow's 5% just

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.279
about doubled, and purple earned 13% and got
squat.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.670
Meanwhile blue's 37% of the people booted
to 51% of the seats in parliament. The blue

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.870
boost is even bigger when you consider that
51% of the seats gives basically 100% the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.800
control.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.530
How'd this happen?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.050
In the UK -- national elections aren't really
national, they're a bunch of local elections.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.710
The UK is divided into constituencies, each
of which elects one member of parliament (M.P.)

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.219
to represent them. This local / national divide
is where the trouble begins.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.340
Imagine a parliament with just three constituencies,
and it's easy to see how it wouldn't always

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.160
align with citizens. Some people think this
sort of result is fine -- “it's all *about*

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.200
winning local elections,” they’ll say.
“Each M.P. represents their constituency.”

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.920
And while the imbalance in this example is
extreme, but it's the same problem in the real

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.430
election and this same argument is given,
but there are two more problems with it in

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.540
reality land.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.119
1) Few citizens have any idea who their MP
is, they just know what party they voted for

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.960
-- what party they want to represent their
views on the national level. And pretending

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.750
like it's a local election is a bit disingenuous.
-- in practice it's an election for how the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
nation will run -- not really for who is going
to represent a tiny part of it.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.100
and even if it were

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.899
2) The individual constituencies are worse
at representing their citizens than parliament.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.450
Indulge this spreadsheet-loving nerd for a
moment, will you?

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.850
The difference between what a party earned
at the polls and what they got in parliament

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.590
is the amount of misrepresentation error.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
If we calculate all the errors for all the
parties and add them up we can say the Parliament

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.490
as a whole has 47% percentage points of misrepresentation
error. That sounds bad looks like a utopian

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.739
rainbow of diversity compared to any local
election because the local elections have

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:17.670
*one* winner. Out of the 650 constituencies
647 have a higher representation error than

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.430
parliament. These are the only three that
don't and they're really unusual for having

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.270
so many of a single kind of voter in one place.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.459
Most places look the The Wrekin which is dead
in the middle a mere one-hundred and one points

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.200
off. Note that the winning candidate didn't
reach a majority here. Which means more than

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.470
half of constituencies elected their MP with
a minority of voters.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.660
The worst is Belfast South at the bottom of
the list. Hilariously unrepresentative. Less

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.910
than a quarter of the voters get to speak
for the entire place in parliament. This is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.120
the the lowest percentage an M.P. has ever
been elected by.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.819
So when people argue that the UK election
is a bunch of local elections 1) people don't

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.640
act like it, and 2) It's even more of an argument
that the elections are broken because they're

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.140
worse on this level.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.150
These local elections are unrepresentative
because of the terrible 'First Past the Post'

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.810
voting system -- which I have complained mightily
about and won't repeat everything here -- go

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.319
watch the video -- but TL;DR it only 'works'
when citizens are limited to two choices.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.720
Voting for any party except the biggest makes
it more likely the biggest will win by a minority

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.060
-- which is exactly what happened.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.120
That citizens keep voting for smaller parties
despite knowing the result is against their

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.620
strategic interests demonstrates the citizenry
wants diverse representation -- but that successes

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.299
is the very thing that's made this the most
unrepresentative parliament in the history

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.940
of the UK.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.090
People happy with the results argue the system
is working fine -- of course they do. Their

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.940
team won.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.540
But Government isn't a sport where a singular
'winner' must be determined. It's a system

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.230
to make rules that everyone follows and so,
we need a system where everyone can agree

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.049
the process is fair even if the results don't
go in their favor.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.299
If you support a system that disenfranchises
people you don't like and turbo-franchises

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.340
people you do -- then it doesn't look like
you support representative democracy, it looks

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.280
like you support a kind of dictatorship lite.
Where a small group of people (including you)

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.190
makes the rules for everyone.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.740
But as it is now, on election day the more
people express what they want the worse the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.120
system looks which makes them disengaged at
best or angry at worst and GEE I CAN'T IMAGINE

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.500
WHY.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.310
This is fixable, there are many, many better
ways the UK could vote -- here are two that

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.160
even keep local representatives.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.720
And fixing voting really matters, because
this is a kind of government illegitimacy

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.990
score -- and it's been going up and may continue
to do so unless this fundamentally broken

00:04:47.990 --> 00:05:00.500
voting system is changed.
