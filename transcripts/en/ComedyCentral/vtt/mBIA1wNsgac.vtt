00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.006
IN MY NEW HOME WITH
MY NEW FAMILY.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.541
OH, I--EXCUSE ME.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.277
CAN YOU PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS
FOR TONIGHT?

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.548
PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS?

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.682
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
- NOPE.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.217
- HOW COULD I BE MORE CLEAR?

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.253
MY PRESENCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A LIVELY ADDITION

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.355
TO ANY SOCIAL GATHERING,
BUT BEING

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.023
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
WAS DIFFERENT.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.260
I'D HAVE TO BE
THE FUNNEST PERSON IN THE ROOM,

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.128
AND I'D NEED SOME HELP FROM
MY OFFICE STAFF.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.364
IF AT ANY TIME TONIGHT
YOU SEE ME FLOUNDERING--

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.199
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
OR WHAT TO SAY, OKAY?--

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.800
I NEED YOU TO VERY DISCREETLY

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.802
READ ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
ON THESE CARDS.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:39.873
YOU WILL BE PROMPTING ME TO
TELL SOME OF MY BEST ANECDOTES.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:42.042
- MR. MACNEIL,
YOU GOT A PACKAGE.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.144
- OH, THIS HAS GOT TO BE
MY NOVELTY ITEMS.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:45.412
- OH.
- YES, YES! [laughs]

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.648
THIS IS JUST A BOX FULL OF FUN.
[laughs]

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.150
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
"THE BALD MEN'S COMB."

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.586
- BUT THERE'S NO--

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.588
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO FUNNY.
- YEAH.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.490
THERE'S NO COMB IN THERE.
- HEY.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.925
both: HELLO.
- OUT FIRST GUESTS!

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.593
- HEY.
- [laughs] OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:00.928
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.095
IGOR, I GOT IT, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.263
LET ME WELCOME OUR FIRST GUESTS.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.731
WELCOME!
HEY, I HOPE YOU'RE READY

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.469
TO GET YOUR PARTY ON!
[laughs]

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:10.604
OH.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:14.608
UH--[clears throat].
SO...

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.410
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S
A TYPICAL PARTY IN MOST WAYS,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.145
UH, THAT WE HAVE PLANNED.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:22.082
- HAS ANYONE HERE EVER LEARNED
TO SMOKE THEIR OWN SALMON?

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.585
- I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.286
HOW ARE YOU?
AS MORE PEOPLE ARRIVED,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.356
I DID MY BEST TO MAKE MEANINGFUL
CONNECTIONS WITH EVERYONE.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.124
REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT
THE ARMY,

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.594
AND HOW YOU WERE NEVER IN IT,
BUT ENJOY THE JACKET.

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:38.165
HOW ARE YOU?
ARE YOU A COUPLE? [laughs]

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.166
ALL RIGHT, I CAN SENSE THAT
YOU'RE NOT

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.534
AND I MADE IT AWKWARD.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.802
SHOULD WE SHAKE HANDS?

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.704
I'M DOING FINE.
I'M DOING FINE.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.540
ANY ENTERTAINER WILL TELL YOU,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.542
ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.011
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY,

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.313
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO SUCCEED.
MY FRIEND!

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:56.450
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
[laughs]

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.852
LOOK AT THE LABEL.
IT'S A BALD MAN'S COMB,

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.120
AND THE BOX IS EMPTY.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:04.124
[claps]
[laughs]

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.292
SEAN, RIGHT?

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.493
- NO.
- NO?

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:08.161
WHO WANTS SOME MILK?
[laughs]

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.363
OH, LOOK AT THIS!

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:10.631
MILK COMES RIGHT OUT OF
THE BOOB.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.065
- WHY WOULD I WANT MILK
IN MY BEER?

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.567
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT MILK
IN YOUR BEER?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.702
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S FUNNY!

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.070
[laughs]
AS THE EVENING PROGRESSED,

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.740
I ATTRACTED PLENTY OF ATTENTION
TO MYSELF.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.742
BUT I ALSO ATTRACTED
COMPETITORS,

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.744
AND THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE
LIFE OF THE PARTY.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:27.181
HEY, WHOA, LOOK AT THIS GUY.
OH, FANTASTIC.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.249
OH, MY GOSH.
OH, THAT'S--OH, SHOOT.

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:31.218
NO ONE COULD BE MORE FUN
THAN ME.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.354
- WHOO-HOO!
- AH!

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.589
- CAN I PLEASE TALK TO YOU GUYS?

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.090
HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.258
- WHAT YOU WERE JUST DOING
IN THERE

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:39.660
WAS BEING THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:41.395
I'M TRYING TO BE
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.863
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE FOR
THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.432
AND HE HAS TO GO.
GET--GET HIM OUT OF--

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.767
GET HIM OUT.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE, GO.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.268
- OKAY.
