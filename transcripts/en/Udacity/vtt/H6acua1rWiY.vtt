00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You've already calculated the circumference of the earth.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've hopefully calculated the circumference of the moon in the previous question.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I really mean hopefully, because now I'm going to tell you what it is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because we need that number to calculate the distance to the moon.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the last problem,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we talked about the angular size of the moon.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We said that the moon has an angular size of half a degree.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, we know the circumference of the moon.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We know the circumference of the moon,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you may or may not know the formula for the circumference.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The circumference of any circle is equal to Ï€ times its diameter.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The diameter is this distance from one end to the other end.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Using this knowledge and the half a degree angular size of the moon,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you should actually be able to calculate this distance--the distance to the moon.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, this isn't exactly a right triangle,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but what we can do, because we're so, so tricky,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is approximate it as one.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Half a degree is so small that these angles are both just about 90 degrees.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When you're doing this problem pretend this is a 90 degree angle,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and let's calculate this distance to the moon. We'll call it L.

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want you to tell me L in kilometers based on this data.
