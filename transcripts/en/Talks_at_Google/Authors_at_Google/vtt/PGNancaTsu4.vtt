[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.550
SPEAKER 1: We have two
wonderful guests today.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.110
I'm going to introduce both.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.630
So our first guest
is Kate T. Parker.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.420
Kate is a mother,
a wife, an Ironman,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.929
and a professional photographer.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.720
Her book, "Strong is
the New Pretty," which

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.090
we have back there,
is a photo series

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.240
that's led to collaborations
with brands such as Disney's,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.010
Kellogg's, and NBC.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.150
And Kate is the mother to two
daughters, Ella and Alice,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.410
who's also here today.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.600
And then our second
guest is Andrew Ference.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.100
Andrew is a former NHL player.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.450
Played for 16 seasons, including
on the 2011 Bruins Stanley Cup

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.400
team.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.810
Andrew is currently the Director
of Social Impact at the NHL,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.290
and he's the father to his
two daughters, Ava and Stella.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.380
So, welcome.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.785
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:56.160
Thanks, for being here.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.064
KATE T. PARKER: Hi.

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:57.939
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.950
Perfect.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.277
So we'll get into our theme.

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:06.610
We're here to talk about
empowering kids through sports.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.830
And we'll get to
that, but I want

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.496
to start a little bit
about your careers

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:12.050
and becoming the professionals
at the highest level.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.060
So Kate, let's kick
it off with you.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.470
You're an amazing photographer,
but this wasn't your profession

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.160
at first.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.120
When did you decide to become
a full-time professional

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.850
photographer?

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.405
And how did you get into it?

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:27.780
KATE T. PARKER:
So my background,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.070
like right out of school, was
I was a video editor at CNN.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.660
And then I moved
into advertising,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.200
and I worked as a producer.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.760
So I was used to making
things on a screen compelling.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.970
And then I had my first
daughter 13 years ago.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.850
And like a lot of
parents, I started

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.260
taking pictures
of what I thought

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.880
was the most beautiful
thing ever in the world.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.870
But my taste level was
pretty high from working

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.030
with art directors
for years, and my--

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.340
like, I didn't know
how to shoot manually,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.800
so I taught myself on YouTube.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.310
And I taught myself how to edit
pictures same way, on YouTube.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.340
And no grand ambition, besides
I would just sit on the couch

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.260
and take pictures of
my feet, because that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.366
was what was there,
and trying to focus it,

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.490
and trying to make, like,
have that pretty, blurred

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.220
background.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.490
And I just shot.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.540
I mean, I think for me, because
I was an athlete growing up,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.010
I was just pretty
annoyingly diligent

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.090
about trying to get better
and to have my taste level

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640
and my skill level meet.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.270
And I'm still
working towards that.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.220
But that's kind of how
it started for me, just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190
trying to, like every
other parent, trying

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.290
to take pictures, like pretty
pictures of their kids.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.840
SPEAKER 1: Andrew, you probably
knew a little earlier on.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.090
I think you said you
left in high school

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.130
to go play at a prep team.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.780
So when did you
know that the NHL

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.794
was kind of a realistic
expectation or possibility?

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:53.460
ANDREW FERENCE: It
was late in the game.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.290
I was a multi-sport
kid growing up.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.430
I played every sport under
the sun at school-- a lot

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.820
of lacrosse, rugby, and
obviously a lot of hockey.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.540
But up until the day I left
to go play junior hockey down

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.944
in Portland, Oregon, I was still
playing all those other sports,

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:11.610
and to this day still
play other sports.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.640
So the NHL to me was always
like this lottery ticket.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.280
You know, you work really hard,
you do everything you can,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.780
but even at that there's so
much that's out of your control.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.624
So it was kind of
a dream, but not

00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:23.790
one that I really relied on.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
So probably about
like 17 years old,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.430
I started playing against
other people, guys

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.984
that were older than me that
eventually started making it.

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:33.900
And when I saw those
guys make it, I was like,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.390
I can play against those
guys, so maybe there's

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.320
a chance, right?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.280
But you know, I was probably
three years into my NHL career

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.525
before I felt like, oh,
actually I belong here.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:45.630
Like, it felt real.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.880
SPEAKER 1: So talk a little
bit about your NHL career.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.305
What was the highlight?

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:50.930
ANDREW FERENCE: Well,
highlight's easy.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.138
That's we won the Stanley
Cup with the Boston Bruins.

00:03:53.138 --> 00:03:58.380
I mean, that was far and away
the most amazing sporting

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.870
experience, and probably
even more amazing

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.160
because I had lost it.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.150
In Calgary, we lost in the
seventh game of the Stanley Cup

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.430
final to the Tampa
Bay Lightning,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.410
which quite literally--

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm almost embarrassed
to say, but I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.910
would wake up at night
years later just like,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.300
oh, like, what if?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.570
It's like just post-traumatic
about that series.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.260
So winning it was not only
great because we won it,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.020
but it actually erased all
those demons from losing it.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.234
So far and away, the highlight.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:31.900
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.760
And Kate, a little bit about
some of the iconic brands

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.060
you've worked with, like, what
has that experience been like,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.850
just reaching, becoming a
professional photographer,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.550
getting asked to work with
Disney's and Kellogg's and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.902
NBC's?

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:47.610
KATE T. PARKER: I
mean, it's crazy to me,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.780
because, like I said, I
did not go to photo school.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.280
You know?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.920
And it just started, and
it still remains, like,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.100
a one-person business
in my studio, which

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.050
is in the basement of
my house in Atlanta.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.410
So it's not like, oh, of
course, Disney's calling.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.300
Of course, you know?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.030
I literally remember
getting a phone call

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.470
from somebody at Disney.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.970
I was in the car,
and I thought it

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.090
was a friend calling as a joke.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.200
And I was like, "the" Disney?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.700
I had to double-check.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.360
But I really enjoy
it, because I'm

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.660
so passionate about the message
that my book puts forward

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.430
and that my image
has put forward.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.310
And when larger companies
with a greater platform

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.380
want to share that same
message of empowerment

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.130
for girls and self-acceptance,
I'm 100% on board.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.840
And I'm so glad,
just because I feel

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.070
like there's so much
of what our girls see,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.266
and women see, is not real
and doesn't reflect what

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:48.390
they look like or act like.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.120
So if we can put
imagery out there

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.170
that is real girls doing real
things and being themselves,

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.240
and if these larger
brands get behind it,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.380
I'm so excited because I
get to combine what I do

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.454
and what I love to do, but
with just a bigger platform.

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:05.120
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.411
So that's a perfect transition.

00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.900
I want you to explain--

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.990
we have one of the
most interesting photos

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.510
that you've shared, so
if you could tell us

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.699
the story behind this photo.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:14.490
KATE T. PARKER: Oh.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.040
So OK, this is my
older daughter, Ella.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.280
And she was-- I think
she was nine at the time,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.672
and she was getting ready
to do her first triathlon.

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:26.130
So if you've ever
done a triathlon,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.200
you go to the race
expo the day before,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.580
and they give you everything.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.050
You get your bike set up,
and you get your swim cap,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.290
your race number.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.434
But it's super intimidating
because everybody there

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:38.100
looks like they know
what they're doing.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.010
And she came back, and
she had all her stuff,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.810
and she was like,
Mom, I can't do it.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.850
I'm not ready, I
don't want to do it.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.330
And I was like,
get your stuff on,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.080
and come meet me
downstairs in the studio.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.360
And I snapped maybe
three pictures.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.790
I said to her, show
me your toughest look.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.087
Show me how brave you are.

00:06:58.087 --> 00:07:00.420
And I literally took the
camera and I flipped it around.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.300
And I said, don't you think
this girl can do a triathlon?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.360
And she was like,
oh, yeah, I think so.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.370
I showed her who she was,
she just didn't believe it.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.180
And she went out the next
day and she killed it.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.510
And one of the reasons that I
love this picture so much is

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.910
it's the cover of our book.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.400
And it just shows--

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.210
I had no idea.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.230
There was no book at the time.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.104
There was no message.

00:07:23.104 --> 00:07:27.120
I just was taking a picture
so she would go do the race.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.030
And I just love the power in
it and how strong and confident

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.080
she looks.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.910
And I just love
remembering that story.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.640
Yeah.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.890
SPEAKER 1: So we're going
to talk about your parenting

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.170
style and, just in
general, the theme.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.150
But talk to us a
little bit about how

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
your parents influenced you
both getting to the highest

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.790
level of your professions,
and how has that impacted

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.230
your current parenting style.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.530
KATE T. PARKER: Sure.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.756
You want to take that one?

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:54.630
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.210
I mean, my parents, neither
of them were big into sports.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.940
I mean, they were
active and whatnot.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.880
But my dad did some judo, and
squash, and stuff like that,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.370
but never hockey.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.650
But they always supported
whatever I was interested in.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.220
And the only thing
that they ever demanded

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.490
was that, if you start
something, you finish it.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.990
And you do your absolute best,
like you put your most effort

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.490
into it.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.020
So whether that was
homework, sports, anything.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.210
And the only time
my dad ever gave me

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.370
any, like, sporting
advice is it'd

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.200
be along the lines of, you know,
we're up 6-0 in a hockey game,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.240
and on the ride home,
he'd be like, you know,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.220
I noticed during
the third period

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.039
you kind of relaxed a bit.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.809
And he's like, that's really
disrespectful to the other team

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.150
to not try your hardest,
even though you're winning.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.944
Like, you shouldn't goof around.

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:42.360
You know, so that
kind of approach

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.230
of, always finish a job, do it
properly from start to finish,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.090
no matter the circumstances.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.050
You know, his view was, if
he walked into the arena

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.506
and we were up 8-0
or down 8-0, he

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:56.130
shouldn't be able to
tell by the effort

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.504
that I was putting
in on the ice.

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:00.990
And so that was always a big
lesson for me and, I think,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.470
carries over to my
two girls where I just

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.960
want them to enjoy what they're
doing and work really hard.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.370
And I think that those two
things combined can create

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.010
magic in anything, you know?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.170
And I don't care what sport
it is or what line of work

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.750
or whatever their interests
are, but you do that

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.977
and you'll have a
pretty good life.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.560
KATE T. PARKER: That
was great advice.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.140
Yeah.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.640
Yeah.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.720
For me, I grew up playing
soccer, and it 100%

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.950
informed my approach to
everything and my approach

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.750
to parenting, as well.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.030
My parents never, ever told me--

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.584
I have two older brothers
and an older sister,

00:09:38.584 --> 00:09:39.750
so I'm the youngest of four.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.520
And my older brothers
all played soccer.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.140
And my parents never said--

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.770
because at the time, there was
not soccer teams for girls.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.552
And they never said that.

00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:50.010
They just said,
sure, you can play.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.290
And I would play with boys.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.920
And then there became
soccer teams for girls.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.920
But they never, ever said--

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.980
you know, because I was loud
and kind of in your face.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.910
And they never said girls are
not supposed to be like that,

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.380
and girls are supposed--

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.000
I had a temper.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.390
And I mean, they would
try to curb my temper,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.600
but they never said,
little girls are quiet.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.030
And I mean, I try to do the
same and pass that along

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.630
to my girls.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.690
I never thought that,
because of my sex,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.400
I would be limited by anything.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.920
And I try to do the
same for my girls,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.490
that whatever they're
interested in, they can do it.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.540
Like Andrew said, you
know, as long as you dig in

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.290
and you work hard.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.550
I don't care what
they want to do.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.260
It does not have to be sports.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.050
Alice is 100%
interested in singing.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.820
And you've just
got to work hard.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.190
Whatever it is, we
will support you.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.875
You've just got to work hard.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.000
SPEAKER 1: So let's get
into the theme today, which

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.820
is empowering kids through
sports and, really, just

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.872
in general.

00:10:48.872 --> 00:10:50.830
So let's talk a little
about your photo series.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.100
We have a couple
more examples here.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.620
"Strong is the New Pretty,"
which you turned into a book,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.910
but also is, again, a series.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.340
How did you come
up with the idea?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.800
And where did this spawn from?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.620
KATE T. PARKER: So for
years, I just shot my girls

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.520
as they were.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.400
And after maybe
four or five years,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280
I was asked to be part of
the gallery show in Atlanta.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.250
And so I had to cull
through thousands of images

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.050
to find the 20 strongest.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.940
And at that point,
I was just shooting.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.020
I wasn't shooting
with a purpose,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.936
I wasn't shooting with
the idea that there was

00:11:21.936 --> 00:11:23.200
going to a book or a message.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.100
But looking at the 20 images
that I selected for the gallery

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.860
on the wall, I was like, oh.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.210
It finally dawned on me.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.290
I was like, oh, this is about
showing these girls for who

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.567
they are and celebrating
for who they are, which is--

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.150
for my girls and the
girls that I shot

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.870
were dirty, and fearless,
and silly, and emotional.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.970
They weren't necessarily
smiling for the camera.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:53.470
And so that gallery show was
a huge bust, and nothing sold.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.420
And that was expensive
as a photographer,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.680
because you pay for your images.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.910
And to print and
frame 20 images, I--

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.740
first, I got really
disappointed,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.230
and I was like, oh, I'm
terrible photographer.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.480
And then my temper
came into play,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.950
and I got mad because
I did so much work.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.230
And I really thought that
there was something there,

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.270
and so I sent a few like this.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.410
I would send this little
grid of images to three blogs

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.220
that I followed.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.100
They were culture and art
blogs about photography.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.800
And then it just kind of
went viral from there.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.402
It went to CNN, the Today
Show, Huffington Post.

00:12:30.402 --> 00:12:32.110
All these places were
writing this story,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.290
and I was like, oh, that's
not what I intended at all.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.280
And then the opportunity
from that came to do a book.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.740
And up until that
point, the series

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.180
was very narrow in terms
of what strong looked like,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.770
because it looked like my
daughters and their friends.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.114
So I used the book as an
opportunity to expand.

00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:53.530
I shot girls all
over the country.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.770
Just really wanted to get
diversity in the message,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.530
and in the interests, and
in where the girl's from.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.640
So that's kind of how it
started, just with me having

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.410
a little temper
tantrum that nothing

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.030
had sold in my gallery show.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.870
SPEAKER 1: And Andrew, I think
you had a little bit different.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.654
I know you said that
your daughter started

00:13:12.654 --> 00:13:15.070
figure skating, which you would
think, as a hockey player,

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.653
would be great to
be back at the rink.

00:13:16.653 --> 00:13:18.125
But that wasn't
the case, was it?

00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:19.000
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.641
I mean, my story's
all over the map.

00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.140
I grew up with a sister who was
involved in a lot of sports.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.084
And I think, to Kate's
experience, she had no limits,

00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:28.000
do whatever she wants.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.958
But she was really into
dance, and so I kind of

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.330
knew that world.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.700
And then having my own
daughters, same thing.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.460
We opened up the books to them,
like try whatever you want--

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.160
multi-sport, multi-interest.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.190
But both of them
actually did trend

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.950
towards figure skating early on.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.650
They also loved going
to Disney and getting

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.230
the bippity boppity
boo [INAUDIBLE],,

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.470
the whole nine yards.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.740
I'm like, all right, I'll
support that, whatever.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.280
Just kind of same thing.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.640
You know, I tried to nudge
them one way or another,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.290
but they determined
their own path.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.750
So the path was figure skating.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.950
And the only reason
that sport frustrated me

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.680
was because I would go
and watch their practices,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.060
and it's an incredibly
athletic sport.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.020
They'd try over,
and over, and over,

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.640
and fall down, and get up.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.450
And to finally nail a new
trick would take so much effort

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.560
over weeks, right?

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.930
And bumps, and bruises,
and frustrations.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.490
And when they would
finally, nail it,

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.100
I was like, man, that's
incredible just how much effort

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.900
went into that.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.620
And think of all the
lessons that they learned.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.260
But the kicker was always
the competition day.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.820
And they had to have
the full makeup.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.260
They had to have
the shiny dress,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.770
and they had to smile when
they're doing the routine.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.230
And that was the part that
just always just got me,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.350
because you get less
points if you don't smile.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.809
And I was always
just like, really?

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:49.308
You know?

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:51.450
Because after all those
weeks of watching practice,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.200
and how hard they
worked, and how athletic

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.450
they were, I'm like, what
if they don't want to smile?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.730
What if they can
just be an athlete

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.010
and be taken at face
value for all the work

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.612
that they put into this?

00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:03.070
So that was always
kind of the rub.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.680
And then honestly, it
started rubbing them.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.340
And I didn't sit them down and
tell them about this or rant,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.870
and they kind of figured
it out for themselves.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.970
And that kind of, I think,
started getting to them.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.340
So my oldest daughter,
Ava, she made a big jump

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.200
from figure skating to rugby.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.687
[LAUGHS] And so now--

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:22.770
KATE T. PARKER: Obviously.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.510
ANDREW FERENCE: Now, she's
right into rugby and loving it.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.080
And you know, I
lean on rugby a lot.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.580
I love it.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.350
I played it growing up a bit.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.250
But the atmosphere--
there's a position

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.410
for every type of
athlete on a rugby team.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.835
The first practice
that she went to, there

00:15:42.835 --> 00:15:45.220
was different teams
scattered all over the field,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.089
like different age groups,
different sex, everything.

00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:49.630
But at the end of
practice, everybody

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.270
got together for a big
barbecue and had a big social.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.940
And so you're part of a family.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.690
So I saw a lot of
similarities with hockey.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.000
You know, it's a
smaller niche sport,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.960
but it has that kind
of family atmosphere

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.976
and that real strong team bond.

00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:09.760
She's good at the sport,
but that atmosphere

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.590
is what really dug into her.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.940
And she's part of a
bigger community, I guess.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.780
So to me, I think that
sports like that, that really

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.600
encourage all different
types of athletes

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.564
and different types
of body types,

00:16:24.564 --> 00:16:26.230
and you bring all
these people together,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:32.230
and you really purposely create
a community and a good feeling

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.770
when you leave the
game or the practice,

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.530
that's so important, because
that's what keeps kids there.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.410
You know, it's not
winning the medals

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.870
and standing on the podium.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.300
That's a quick hit,
and that feels good.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.850
But that atmosphere
of family and feeling

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.860
like you're part of
the big group, that

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.830
keeps you in love with
the sport for life

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.780
and active in the sport.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.867
SPEAKER 1: So this
is for both of you,

00:16:57.867 --> 00:16:59.950
but Kate, you kind of
mentioned that there was not

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.710
a girls soccer team growing up.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.369
And then rugby is, historically,
a predominantly male sport.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:10.150
So I think with the evolution
of technology and social media,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.250
how have you seen
sports that maybe

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.685
were very gender-specific now
not being as gender-specific?

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:19.060
Have you seen the evolution
with your kids from, I guess,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.950
when you were growing up?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.530
KATE T. PARKER: I mean,
my kids don't ever

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.930
think they can't do anything.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.570
My older daughter played
in a flag football league,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.560
and they were the only
girls team in there.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.800
And it's actually
like the perfect age.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.055
I think they were
11, so like right

00:17:38.055 --> 00:17:39.430
when they were at
the point where

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.870
they were taller than the boys.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.040
And they're 13 now, it
wouldn't work anymore.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.420
But they don't
really seem to feel

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:56.740
like they're defined by,
if girls aren't allowed

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.000
or whatever.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.520
I feel like they would
protest that, you know?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.420
They are strong enough to
know, no, this is unfair

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.020
and to make a stand.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.751
And I think that they're
open to anything.

00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.500
And they're like, oh,
that looks like fun.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.360
I want to do that.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.070
Of course, I can do
that, which is great.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.972
ANDREW FERENCE:
Yeah, I grew up--

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.930
we had a girl on the
hockey team the whole time

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.320
we grew up back in Canada.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.180
And so it wasn't really rare
to have a girl on your team.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.160
But looking back, it's
like there was one girl.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.540
And I imagine her
experience, being

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.000
the only girl on the team,
must have been tough.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.910
Obviously now, the participation
levels of girls in hockey

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.390
has shot way up.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.380
And that's attributed to great
work by the hockey associations

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.490
to deliberately promote
it to girls, as well.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.240
And I think that's
probably the evolution,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.960
is the governing bodies,
places like the NHL,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.240
like deliberately
entering into that space

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.950
to provide appropriate
programming for girls

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.250
and to have proper
coaching curriculum

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.560
and guidebooks on
how to make sure

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.410
that this is a good space
for girls to come into

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.610
and a good sport where
they feel welcome.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.360
Because you can't just
transfer everything

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.310
that you do,
sometimes, and coach

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.460
the same way, and everything
down to the locker rooms

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.240
that are provided.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.073
There's a lot that goes
into it to make sure

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:20.530
that, if a girl
chooses to play hockey,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.440
that she feels like she's
welcome, she's there.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.700
And so I think that's
probably the biggest change,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.750
is those deliberate
actions taken

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.030
by things like USA
Hockey or the NHL

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.310
to make sure that this is
a massive priority for us

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.080
is to get it right
and to do it right.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.750
And I think that's the big
shift is the focus that's

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.180
deliberately being put on it.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.780
SPEAKER 1: One kind of somewhat
sensitive, controversial topic

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.690
that comes up a lot with
kids in sports these days is

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.070
participation trophies.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.840
Do either of you have
strong opinions on that

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.510
that you're willing to share?

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.010
KATE T. PARKER:
I've kind of thought

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.080
about this a little
bit, and I think

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.670
the kids don't even buy them.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.450
If they know everybody gets
it just for being a part,

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.810
then it doesn't mean anything.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.080
And I'm not against
making kids feel good,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.900
but if they're smart
enough to recognize

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.620
that it's like
getting a T-shirt,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.660
I don't know that it's doing
what you set out to do.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.020
They should be sort
of the top, you know?

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.300
If you get a trophy,
it means that you won,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.080
or you were the MVP.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.750
So yeah, my kids have definitely
gotten them over the years.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.260
But the ones that they have
earned and that they won

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.240
are the ones that are
sitting out in their rooms.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.800
So I don't know that you're
not fooling any of the kids.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.265
You know?

00:20:54.265 --> 00:20:55.890
ANDREW FERENCE: When
I was a kid, yeah,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.610
I never would have wanted
the participation ribbon,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.110
or whatever.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.590
But growing up and becoming
older, and in the job

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.500
that I'm in now,
I've been able to be

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.510
part of good
presentations by, let's

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.180
say, the country of Norway,
who doesn't keep score

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.490
in their youth sports
system up until, I think,

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.440
the age of 11 or 12.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.600
They're not allowed to
put any sports scores

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.270
from youth sports in
newspapers, or print,

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.520
or anything like that,
up until the age of 14.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.250
And so they create a real
culture of not keeping score.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.270
Everybody's playing, you know,
that equality in just keeping

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.850
kids in a fun environment.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.010
And they've had
incredible success.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:40.290
Their gold medals per
ratio of population

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.840
are absolutely insane
in these sports.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.080
And so there is some merit
to what they're doing

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.410
and to the approach that they're
taking not only for their youth

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.740
sport participation levels,
which are much higher than most

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.030
of ours, they're
keeping kids in sport,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:59.230
but also producing
extremely elite athletes.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.270
So that's really swayed
me, is the results

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:07.710
that countries have enacted
these kind of rules.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.230
And it's really producing.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.450
And from our perspective,
even at a league level,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.050
our main focus is not to make
the next batch of NHL hockey

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.250
players.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.970
Our focus is to make sure that
people come away from a hockey

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.189
rink and have a good
experience, because we

00:22:26.189 --> 00:22:27.480
want them to stay in the sport.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.015
And when you ask kids,
why did you come back

00:22:31.015 --> 00:22:31.890
the following season?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.550
They're like, oh, it was fun.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.610
So to us, that means
our number one priority

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.550
is to make sure that
the sport is fun.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.000
If that means going the route
of not necessarily keeping

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.410
score, making it--

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.250
so our governing
bodies have done a lot.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.580
They've shrunk down the
size of a hockey rink,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.010
and they play a different
form of hockey in a smaller

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.380
space for little kids because
it's more fun to actually

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.710
be involved in the game, rather
than just watching the good kid

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.560
steal the puck and skate off.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.670
So there are actual
changes in our games

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.360
that we've made at a higher
level to produce more fun.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.055
And I think that's basically
what it falls down to, for us.

00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:13.430
SPEAKER 1: So
Andrew, earlier you

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.739
talked, when we spoke before,
about teaching your daughters

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:18.780
about who they are versus
who they want to become

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.990
and who they want to be.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.340
Can you talk a little bit about
how that mentality has played

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.050
a role in your parenting?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.040
ANDREW FERENCE:
Well, I want them

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.370
to, obviously, like I
said, shoot for the stars

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.430
and, if they have a
dream of doing something,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.177
know that they can do it.

00:23:37.177 --> 00:23:38.510
Like, the world is their oyster.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.240
They're obviously
extremely privileged.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.690
They have great,
great schooling.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.270
They have every
opportunity in the world,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.690
but they have to use it and
not waste that opportunity.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.050
And so I think giving
them every option,

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.489
exposing them to as
many things as possible

00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:56.280
and making sure that
they know that they're

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.192
capable to try
something new and do it,

00:24:00.192 --> 00:24:01.650
that's probably
the conversation we

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:06.426
have the most when we have
our deep dad-daughter talks.

00:24:06.426 --> 00:24:07.800
Like, why are we
doing something?

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.710
Or what is our philosophy?

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.780
It really is, as
I said, what I am

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.160
trying to give you the ability
to do is, when you're older

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.710
and you have a group of friends,
or you have some co-workers,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.310
you have a new boy that you
like or girl that you like,

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.312
or whatever it is, and they
say, hey, let's go do this,

00:24:26.312 --> 00:24:28.770
you can say, yep, let's do it,
even if you've never done it

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.010
before, because you have the
confidence and the capabilities

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.930
to try new things.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.720
I've ran into a
lot of people, even

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.460
at a professional
sports level, that

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.150
were afraid to go play a game
of tennis because they're like,

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.690
oh, I've never played tennis.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.384
And these are
professional NHL players,

00:24:45.384 --> 00:24:46.800
like, I don't want
to play tennis.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.000
I've never played that before.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.416
But what it was
is because they're

00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:51.370
scared to not be
good at something,

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.330
or they had that lack
of self-confidence

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.730
to try something
new and understand

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.220
that it's all right to
not be great at something.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.530
And so I guess
that's really what

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.130
I want to give them
the ability to,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.850
is to try as many
things as possible,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.340
to jump into scary situations,
to try something wild once

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.240
in a while and not be afraid
of being a little bit afraid.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.650
So I guess, yeah, that's a
long-winded answer to it.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.650
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.480
I want to go back--

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.120
maybe there too-- to
Kate, to your photos.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.165
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:26.540
SPEAKER 1: And this is, I
believe, a year or two old now,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.164
but why do you think
these photos still

00:25:28.164 --> 00:25:30.130
resonate so much today?

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.540
KATE T. PARKER:
Well, sadly, I think

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.640
it's rare to see-- like
on social media, most

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.970
everything we see is
filtered, or face-tuned,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:50.420
or set up to show an unrealistic
depiction of women or girls.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.280
And I feel like this
shows who these girls are.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.202
It shows a rawness
and a realness

00:25:58.202 --> 00:26:00.080
to what girls are interested in.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.040
Like, they're screaming.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.050
They're sweating.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.310
They're playing baseball.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:10.490
They're enjoying when they
clean the fire hydrants.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:15.290
And yeah, I think
that people see these,

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.880
and it either reminds them
of who they used to be,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.390
or reminds them of who
their kids are now,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.520
as parents and stuff.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.450
Like this picture in the middle
of Alice, that's my daughter,

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.950
has gotten stolen so many times.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.390
And it's a meme.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.620
It says, remember her?

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.950
Remember when you
used to be this girl?

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.800
And I don't even mind anymore.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.550
I'm like, if this is encouraging
people to remember when they--

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.640
because I feel like when
you're a kid, before you

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:55.250
reach puberty, you have
this sense of I am awesome.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.150
I can do anything.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.110
And then it just kind of
gets-- not beaten out of you,

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.930
but you just lose it.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.330
And if these remind
people of when

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.280
they had a sense of
possibility and when

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.330
they had a sense that they
were such badasses, that if it

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.830
can remind people of that--

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.005
I think that's why people
respond to it because that's

00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:16.880
what these girls are.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.640
Because when I shoot girls,
when I shoot them for the book,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.070
I'm generally shooting
them doing the thing

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.780
that they love the most, the
thing that is their passion.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.160
And they are confident, and
I think it comes through.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.380
So people want to see
that, because I think we

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.829
all need more of that.

00:27:34.829 --> 00:27:36.620
SPEAKER 1: And that's
a good transition to,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.989
what are you working on next?

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:38.780
KATE T. PARKER: OK.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.370
SPEAKER 1: We have the cover.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.245
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:43.590
So this is my nephew.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.270
And so the other cover
is my other daughter.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.270
So Alice, my
daughter, is not happy

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.020
that she's not on the
cover of a book yet.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.620
We're working on it, Al.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.620
So this is my nephew,
AND this book is called,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.540
"The Heart of a Boy."

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.010
And it was funny,
because I was asked

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.920
to consider doing
a book about boys,

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.250
and I was very reluctant
because I was like,

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.280
no, boy's voices are heard.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.470
I need to talk about our girls.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.270
You know, that's
what my focus was.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.960
I literally was crying about it.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.084
And then I was like, you
know, I told my publisher,

00:28:21.084 --> 00:28:21.860
I said, I'll try.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.210
I'll try to shoot a little bit.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.840
And I shot just a few
sessions with boys

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.040
that were local to me.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.980
And immediately, I realized that
the vulnerability and the depth

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.200
of feeling that these
boys had was something

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.250
that I wasn't aware of,
something that I didn't

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.920
realize needed to be heard.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.800
And throughout the tour for
"Strong is the New Pretty",

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.980
and every time I would
speak, little boys

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.245
would say, where's my book?

00:28:50.245 --> 00:28:52.370
Miss Kate, are you going
to do the book about boys?

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.740
And I was like, y'all
don't need a book at all.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.820
You're fine.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.050
And then I was like--

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.460
I was unaware of this.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.170
And through the
shooting of it, I

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.900
realized that-- so the
definition, and even in 2018,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.510
for girls is fairly
narrow of what they can be

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.870
and what they can do.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.650
But I feel like there's
so much that's helping

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.050
to broaden that and so many
opportunities for girls

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.010
to be who they want.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.590
And there's books, and
clothing, and TV shows.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.930
But for boys in 2018, the
definition is even more narrow.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.410
So if you step out of
that athlete-leader,

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.580
you're kind of lost.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.140
And so I wanted to take that
same message of acceptance

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.200
of self and celebration of
self and extend it to boys.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.420
So with "Strong is
the New Pretty,"

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.790
the focus was on more
about toughness and grit.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.550
And for "Heart of a Boy,"
I focused a little bit more

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.360
on the sensitivity,
and vulnerability,

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.920
and including everything.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.710
But I just wanted those
boys' voices to be heard.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.540
And I really, really enjoyed it.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.970
And I'm so excited
for it to come out.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.390
It comes out in April.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.640
SPEAKER 1: Exciting.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.025
And Andrew, you
work for the NHL?

00:30:03.025 --> 00:30:03.900
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.691
SPEAKER 1: What are
you working on in terms

00:30:05.691 --> 00:30:07.110
of the social impact?

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.800
ANDREW FERENCE: We have
a great team at the NHL.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.540
It's a new department.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.344
My boss, Kim Davis, was
brought in in January

00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:17.760
from completely
outside of hockey.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.550
And she's been just a dynamo.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.390
She's put together a team
of people here in New York

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.740
and in Toronto.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.470
We do social impact,
legislative affairs,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.860
and we help to look for growth
initiatives in the game.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.360
So I get to spread myself
out across those three.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.550
Probably right now,
the most I'm doing

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.740
is in legislative affairs,
especially up in Canada,

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.210
in Ottawa.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.450
And I get to take the passion
for getting kids involved

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:50.400
in sport and have more access to
sport specifically to females,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.280
just because the participation
numbers are lower.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.110
And in Canada, I get
the distinct advantage

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.970
because our health care
system is universal.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.050
So I can really go in
there with good hard data.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.510
We have good partnerships
through the Aspen Institute

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.660
with John Hopkins and
some different groups

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:14.610
that have some unbelievable data
on the cost of non-active kids.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.710
How much that costs us,
society-wise, as far

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.260
as health care costs,
is astronomical.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.220
So a lot of the work is going in
and having these conversations

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.860
with government
officials, looking

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.100
for more access to sport,
everything from infrastructure

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.890
funding to programming,
and really tying it

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.200
to the importance of
the investment in having

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.670
kids play sport--

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.700
physical health, mental health,
the grades you get at school,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.800
staying out of the
justice system.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.740
I think sport truly is--
it's not just a passion,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.260
and it's not just about
winning medals at the Olympics,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.750
but it really is an
incredibly important part

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.110
of the health of our countries.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.420
So yeah, going strong
with those messages

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.210
and, thankfully, have
very receptive ears.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.160
And I think that there's a lot
of really, really good people,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.770
both in not just our
league at the NHL,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.810
but across all of the
professional leagues--

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.350
we have a lot of crossover--

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.170
and then at a government level.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.065
It's just a matter
of getting it right,

00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:14.730
and making sure that the funding
is going where it needs to be,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.980
and that we're really accessing
the kids that need it.

00:32:19.197 --> 00:32:21.030
There's a lot of kids
that play every sport,

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.470
like I did growing up.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.150
But unfortunately,
there's a ton of kids

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.410
that have access to no sport.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.620
And so that's really
what we're trying to do

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.616
is making sure that
we don't have tons

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:31.865
of kids falling in the cracks.

00:32:31.865 --> 00:32:34.470
And we want those
kids playing hockey

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.834
and being introduced our sport.

00:32:35.834 --> 00:32:37.500
We really see our
sport not only as good

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.740
for being active and
whatnot, but to that point

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.990
of feeling like you're
part of a better community.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.750
And through our
curriculum and coaching,

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.400
we're really pushing
those messages

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.860
of confidence, teamwork,
humility, a family setting.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.350
Those are all extremely
important to us.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.240
Like I said, creating
the next NHLers

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.950
is not a priority at all.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.780
So I have a lot of fun at work.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.390
I've got great
people to work with.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.410
SPEAKER 1: And it's a little bit
of the Hockey is for Everyone?

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.940
ANDREW FERENCE: Hockey is
for Everyone, you know?

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.900
And we're really trying to not
just have that as a tagline,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.610
but live it.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.050
And we have a lot of work to do.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.544
Hockey is, like I said,
it's a bit of a niche sport.

00:33:15.544 --> 00:33:16.335
It's very regional.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.530
If you looked at us compared to
the demographics in the States,

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.770
they don't line up.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.170
And so that is a
big push for us.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.850
We have markets
across North America.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.270
And we need to have the
people playing our sport

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.840
look like our markets.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.340
Yeah.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.320
So that's a big job, but
it's important to us.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.390
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.260
I want to open it up
to audience questions.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.440
So we have two
microphones on both sides.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.680
While people are
lining up, I have

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.810
a question that is off-topic.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.420
But when you Google
Image search, Kate,

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.690
you get some wonderful
photos that we've seen.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.440
KATE T. PARKER:
[INAUDIBLE] This is scary.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.460
SPEAKER 1: If you
Google Image search you,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.790
Andrew, a very infamous
situation in a playoff game

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.389
pops up.

00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:01.680
And we do have a picture of it.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.050
And I think you called this
an equipment malfunction?

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.124
So I'd love to hear
what happened here.

00:34:09.124 --> 00:34:11.040
I think a lot of people
have always wondered--

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.370
ANDREW FERENCE:
It's a long story.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.184
SPEAKER 1: --the
backstory behind this.

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.310
ANDREW FERENCE:
[SIGHING] My daughter

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.268
gets this same picture.

00:34:15.268 --> 00:34:18.630
And it's even
better on Instagram

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.250
where she's got
buddies at school.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.190
She's 13 now.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.650
So she'll get the Instagram post
of funniest hockey [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.460
ever.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.969
And so she'll get
DM'd all these.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.699
And she's like,
thanks a lot, Dad.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.751
But the story behind
it is fairly long.

00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:36.250
I was playing for
Boston, obviously,

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.630
and this game was in
Montreal, in the playoffs.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.540
For those that don't
know, Boston-Montreal

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.670
is the ultimate
rivalry in hockey.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.090
This was years into the rivalry.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.610
We had faced off
against each other.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.712
And it's for real.

00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:51.420
We'd go up to Montreal
and play up there,

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.510
and they'd be outside of
our hotel at 3 o'clock

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.500
in the morning,
pulling the semi horns,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.390
like, wha, wha, pulling the
fire alarm, rocking our bus,

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.440
like all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.251
And then the Boston fans would
be just as friendly to them,

00:35:05.251 --> 00:35:06.750
probably, when they
came down to us.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.330
And so this rivalry
was for real.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.400
So anyways, in this
game, we're down--

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.400
down in the game,
down in the series.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.950
And I got kind of a lucky
bounce and scored a goal.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.820
And this is just like
pure, raw, stupid emotion.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.460
And not until after
the game, it was like,

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.015
oh, that was really dumb.

00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:26.890
KATE T. PARKER: So this
was your celebration?

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:27.495
ANDREW FERENCE: This
was my celebration.

00:35:27.495 --> 00:35:27.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:29.730
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
celebration.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.010
ANDREW FERENCE: In Montreal.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.840
And it was a really
dumb thing to do,

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.326
because obviously,
you don't want

00:35:35.326 --> 00:35:37.200
to get suspended in the
playoffs and whatnot.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.548
And so I just was like--

00:35:38.548 --> 00:35:39.339
I didn't even know.

00:35:39.339 --> 00:35:42.300
I've got to figure a way
out of this situation.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.850
I explained it to my
kids like, sometimes, you

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.518
do a lot of stupid things
in the quest for victory,

00:35:48.518 --> 00:35:50.142
and this is one of
those stupid things.

00:35:50.142 --> 00:35:52.712
So I made up an excuse that--

00:35:52.712 --> 00:35:54.420
you know, I didn't
want to get suspended,

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.400
so I said, well, I was
just giving a fist pump.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.280
And I was wearing brand new
gloves, and they got stuck.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.260
And I'm like, I'm really sorry.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.514
They're just stiff.

00:36:03.514 --> 00:36:05.055
KATE T. PARKER: Just
that one finger.

00:36:05.055 --> 00:36:06.990
[LAUGHS]

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.240
ANDREW FERENCE: The league
official on the other line,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.360
you could tell, he
was just like, really?

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.680
So I got fined.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.410
I took a pretty good
fine for that one.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.700
And I feel really bad.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.530
I feel more stupid
about lying about it.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.600
I should have just owned it,
but there's some humor to it.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.730
I get a lot of Montreal
fans that actually give it

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.996
right back to me, so yeah.

00:36:27.996 --> 00:36:28.830
[LAUGHS]

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.330
But the funniest
part of the story

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.310
is actually going
back to Boston.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.820
And Boston fans are literally
the best sports fans,

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.080
bar none in the entire world.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.240
And I end up back.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.290
And I live in the North End
in the Italian area of Boston.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.884
And I show up to my condo, and
on the buzzer board-- you know,

00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:48.300
when you buzz in to get into
your building-- so I walk up,

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.420
and there's all these envelopes
taped to the buzzer board.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.530
And I'm looking at them.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.350
Open up, and there's
notes, like, go Bruins!

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:56.070
Whatever.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.960
And they're full of money.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.405
So people knew that I had
been fined for doing this.

00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:01.530
KATE T. PARKER: Oh, my god.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.821
ANDREW FERENCE: And so the
neighborhood was taping up--

00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:04.631
KATE T. PARKER: Oh.

00:37:04.631 --> 00:37:06.880
ANDREW FERENCE: So they paid
off some of it, at least.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.140
And we ended up winning
the Cup that year.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.470
So the North End lore is that
this is what turned the tide

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.820
and got us the Cup, right?

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.910
But it's, yeah, infamous,
to say the least.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.035
KATE T. PARKER: It's funny.

00:37:22.035 --> 00:37:25.560
SPEAKER 1: Is there
anybody that has questions?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.208
I'll get this off
the screen for you.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:28.840
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.340
Yeah.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.710
I have artwork at home.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.970
And this guy made this big--

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:37.620
not collage, but kind of like
a really nice portrait of that.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.471
And I was like, oh.

00:37:38.471 --> 00:37:38.971
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:39.764
Yeah.

00:37:39.764 --> 00:37:40.626
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:40.626 --> 00:37:42.359
KATE T. PARKER: That's awesome.

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:42.900
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.209
Thanks, so much for coming.

00:37:44.209 --> 00:37:45.000
My name is Carissa.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.460
I have two young girls.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.350
I have a question
more around, Kate,

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.850
what you were talking
about, was how

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:56.010
to inspire girls to think that
they can accomplish anything.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.200
I think I've seen,
actually, a lot

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.900
of the opposite in
my daughter, who's

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.240
turning five, very early on,
saying, this is for boys,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.140
and this is for girls, coming
from a lot of different areas.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.970
And I thought taking the
picture of your daughter

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.830
and really showing her how
you see her through your eyes

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.320
and the world can see you is
a really good example of how

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.100
to inspire that.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.170
But can you talk
more about other ways

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.584
to help girls see
themselves as being

00:38:22.584 --> 00:38:23.750
able to accomplish anything?

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:24.060
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.610
I mean, that's so young.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.130
And yeah.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.440
And I'm sure if
you're questioning it,

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.420
you're not the one saying
to her, girls don't do that.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.410
And you're like, where
is this coming from?

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.180
And I mean, I think one of
the things that you can do

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:36.775
is just--

00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:38.400
I know five is young--
but you can just

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.220
have those conversations
of, no, no, no, no,

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.610
you can do anything and then
actually it going into practice

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.780
and challenging her.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:51.319
And go to a climbing gym, or
whatever she's interested in.

00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:52.860
That's one of the
things that I think

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.180
is so important for us, as
parents, is to parent the kids

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.030
that we have, not who
we wish they were.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.040
So kind of let her self-direct.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.640
Whatever she likes to do,
be fully invested in it

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.560
and take or do it.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.500
But yeah.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.900
And I feel like it's a constant.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.400
For me, it's a
constant conversation

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.270
I have with my kids.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.340
I remember, I took
a picture of this.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.810
We walked into Target, or we
walked into a store, whatever

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.440
the store is, and it
had like building sets,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.060
and then girls building sets.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.569
And I said to the girls, and
I was like, how dumb is that?

00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:31.360
And they're like, yeah,
that's really dumb.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.840
And I think it's just like a
constant, hey, do you see this?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.850
Why is this aisle pink?

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.269
Girls don't always like pink.

00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:39.810
Do you want to go
to the other aisle?

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.190
Let's go get something else.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.980
You're not always having
a big conversation.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.210
It's just little things that
you're always being like,

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.210
no, let's question that.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.260
That's silly.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.537
Why is that?

00:39:52.537 --> 00:39:54.370
And it's just like
you're always going to be

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.500
the mom questioning things.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.750
But then that's good, because
that's what she's doing.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.041
And I think it's probably
she's getting it from school,

00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:02.420
or TV shows, or whatever.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.610
So I think it's just, you
just have to be vigilant.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.690
And if you're wondering
about it, then

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.290
then you're going to do it.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.432
And I think it's getting
books that teach other--

00:40:13.432 --> 00:40:14.890
and there's so much
stuff for girls

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.810
to help them recognize
that there's not limits.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.820
It's just constantly
questioning gender roles.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.060
I have a journal, "Strong
is the New Pretty" journal.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.570
And one of the activities
in there is to go in a store

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.355
and pick out three things
that are based on gender norms

00:40:32.355 --> 00:40:34.480
and write them down, just
to make kids aware of it.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.190
Because we don't even
recognize it, sometimes.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.040
So I think it's
just being aware,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.890
and then being like,
that's pretty dumb.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.570
But it's hard.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.170
That's so young.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.330
Good job, though, good
job for recognizing it.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.610
Thanks, for being here.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.500
My name is Melissa, I
am not a parent yet.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.780
I am an athlete.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.687
I'm a fitness coach, so
this is all really valuable

00:41:01.687 --> 00:41:02.520
for me to listen to.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.480
So as somebody who
isn't a parent,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.600
but really appreciates being
involved in the athlete

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.700
community-- not necessarily
to your point, Andrew,

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.560
of developing
professional athletes,

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.790
but just getting women,
girls, involved in sport--

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.530
I think, from
personal experience,

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.905
we're living in
a space right now

00:41:18.905 --> 00:41:20.560
with all this
social media where,

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.290
even as an amateur
athlete, or as somebody

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.510
who is a local
fitness professional,

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.250
we're looking at things where
you want to become somebody

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.720
who helps inspire other people.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.220
And one of the ways
that you do that

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.660
is becoming an
instructor, being a coach.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.660
And a lot of places that
employ people like that

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.001
are asking for things like
your photography portfolio.

00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.000
They want to know what
modeling photos you have.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.666
They want to know how
many followers you

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:45.830
have on your social media.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.340
And social media is a space
where conventional beauty

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.650
is still very highly ranked.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.600
So again, as somebody
who's not a parent,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.150
but wants to support
young women developing

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.450
into that athletic
field, how do we get

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.350
involved in supporting
women, young girls,

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:07.060
now, so that we develop
them into parents,

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.130
like you, who are
confident enough

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.370
to raise their children
to grow up in this world

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.730
where social media is
possibly going to tell them--

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:16.690
do you want this job?

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.820
Do you want to inspire
other people through sports?

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.049
Be pretty in a picture.

00:42:20.049 --> 00:42:20.965
KATE T. PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:42:20.965 --> 00:42:22.581
Yeah, that's so hard.

00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:23.830
ANDREW FERENCE: There's like--

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:27.079
I mean, social media
is crazy for me.

00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:28.870
Like I said, I have a
13-year-old daughter,

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.730
so you see the worst of it.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.670
But there's so much good there.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.320
There's so much good.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:44.890
And I send her pages and posts
constantly that highlight--

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.040
you know, we all skateboard,
so girls skateboarding,

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.660
so a good trick, or there's
some great follows on rugby.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.230
The girls that are playing
rugby for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.420
down in New Zealand, or
some of their training

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.825
videos of workouts they're
doing, and your book, you know?

00:43:02.825 --> 00:43:03.700
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.470
ANDREW FERENCE: When I was
introduced to Kate's work,

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.490
I was like, oh, my god,
this is incredible.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.810
Bought her book, gave it to
my girls, read it with them.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:14.820
Our bedtime stories
are rebel girls for--

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.370
you know?

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.030
Like those great books
that tell stories.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:25.810
But sometimes those social
media platforms, I think,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.300
they can be utilized for
so much good, because you

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.410
control the message.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.159
You control what you're
putting out there.

00:43:31.159 --> 00:43:38.410
So I get that, sometimes, the
really cheesy Instagram beauty

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.770
model that's just doing the
empty shots, like the sport

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.710
model, come on, you can tell
she doesn't play sports.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.710
Yeah, she might have
a ton of followers,

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.390
but there's a huge
market for people

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.380
that don't like that, that
like the real athlete.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.700
Look at cross-fit, the explosion
of the cross-fit athlete.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.910
Those are strong athletes.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.280
They have a massive following.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.510
That's a huge market.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.410
So I think that will
always exist over here,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.880
like the pure
empty beauty stuff.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.020
That's going to happen, but
there's access now for our kids

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.480
and for everybody to follow
really great content, as well,

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.600
and have unbelievable
role models

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.330
and to actually do
that themselves.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.034
I know my daughter, when
she's doing her Instagram

00:44:24.034 --> 00:44:26.200
stuff, her big thing now,
she wants to get verified.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.440
Right?

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.311
So we have the talk.

00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:30.310
I'm like, well, you've
got to have good content.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.990
And she's actually
putting thought into,

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.090
like, all right,
the stuff that we're

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.330
doing for drills in the gym,
and I'm doing all these sport

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.340
things, yeah, I can
build up a profile

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.775
of being a strong, 13-year-old
girl doing all this cool stuff.

00:44:42.775 --> 00:44:43.650
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.191
ANDREW FERENCE: And
I was like, yeah.

00:44:45.191 --> 00:44:45.752
100%.

00:44:45.752 --> 00:44:47.710
Be one of those leaders
and one of those people

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.750
that can inspire other girls.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.340
Just like you follow
all these girls

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.320
around the world doing
all this great stuff,

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.360
people will follow you
and be inspired by you.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.360
And I just think that you can
use these platforms for so

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.530
much good, as well.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.780
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah, I agree.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:07.450
I think the more that we put
out honest, realistic depictions

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:13.000
of women and women athletes, I
think people respond to that.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.850
I think if you talk about--

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.830
I always tell my kids,
I feel like there should

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.370
be a class for
digesting social media,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.950
to recognize that's not
real, that's facetuned,

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:29.680
that is Photoshoped,
that is not her kitchen,

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.780
she's not at that
beach every day.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.390
It's like, she went once and
changed outfits 25 times.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:36.000
Like, yeah.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.480
So I feel like if you
put honesty out there,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.060
and you're real, and you
talk about your struggles,

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.930
your failures, your victories,
people respond to that.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.930
I mean, that's who I
follow on social media

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:55.610
is people that are real, and
honest, and post the truth.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.240
And I think, for my kids--

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.950
yeah, I have a 13-year-old too.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.455
And it's hard because you
look, and you're like,

00:46:02.455 --> 00:46:05.301
I didn't know you were friends
with her, but you're posting,

00:46:05.301 --> 00:46:05.800
I love you.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.910
You're so beautiful.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:12.400
And you're like, OK, let's
have a conversation about what

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.810
this is.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.180
But yeah, it's really
difficult. But I think the more

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.740
that you can put
honesty out there,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.050
then you may not have
as many followers,

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:30.710
but I feel like your followers
are going to be really engaged

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.665
and also probably who
you want, you know?

00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:35.290
ANDREW FERENCE: That's
Ava Ference too,

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:36.754
if you want to
give her a follow.

00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:37.670
Help her get verified.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.690
KATE T. PARKER: Or a blue check.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.190
ANDREW FERENCE:
You're welcome, Ava.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.100
AUDIENCE: So both of you have
daughters who are older than--

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.090
we have a three-and-a-half
year old daughter.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.710
And we try to be very
conscious and make an effort

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.780
to not comment on
appearance and not

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.535
steer her in any
gender-specific direction.

00:47:01.535 --> 00:47:04.630
And Halloween this
year, she dressed up

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.535
as a super monkey, which
we thought was awesome.

00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:08.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:08.480
ANDREW FERENCE: Awesome.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.188
AUDIENCE: But then
like, every single one

00:47:10.188 --> 00:47:12.970
of her friends in pre-school
was dressed up as a princess.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:14.680
And then we're
starting to worry,

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.470
is she going to just pick
up on this from her peers

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.970
and be like, oh, this is
what I'm supposed to do?

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.270
And you must have
been through this.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.250
I'm wondering if
you have advice.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.730
Can we do anything to
prevent peer pressure

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.910
from just subverting
everything we've tried to do?

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.850
ANDREW FERENCE: Oh, I
mean, I know that story.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.180
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.330
It's pervasive.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:35.670
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.220
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.511
ANDREW FERENCE: I always took
the approach with my kids

00:47:38.511 --> 00:47:40.840
that-- like, I grew up, I
was really into punk rock.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.106
And so I would
wear the big docs,

00:47:43.106 --> 00:47:44.980
and I had crazy haircuts,
all kinds of stuff.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.771
So I'd show them pictures
of me growing up.

00:47:46.771 --> 00:47:49.201
And I was like
the weirdo, right?

00:47:49.201 --> 00:47:50.950
But I always take that
approach with them.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.810
I'm like, you
know, what's really

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.840
important is to be weird,
to own your weirdness

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.620
and be different.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.330
I'm like, how are you
going to stand out

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:02.470
from the crowd, if you want to
be special and do something?

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.590
All kids have these big dreams,
and they want to do big things.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.080
And how do you say, OK, you
want to be an astronaut.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.580
Great.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.079
You realize, to be
an astronaut, you

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:11.874
have to be different
from everybody else.

00:48:11.874 --> 00:48:12.790
You have to work hard.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.220
You have to do all these things.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.140
And being different
is actually great.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.260
So celebrating not
being part of the crowd,

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.350
I totally bring out the
punk rock rah, rah speech

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.900
all the time, because I
really think that it really

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.070
is incredible to
stand out in a crowd,

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.340
and to embrace the
differences that you bring

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.515
to a room of people, and to make
yourself have a true identity.

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:40.640
And I always kind of took
the approach too to them,

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.324
I said, do you know what's a
really great compliment when

00:48:43.324 --> 00:48:45.490
somebody has to describe
you, and it's hard for them

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.262
to describe you.

00:48:46.262 --> 00:48:47.470
Like it takes a lot of words.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.080
It's not just like, oh,
he's the hockey player.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.700
You know?

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.960
I don't know, I don't know
if it's the perfect answer,

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.459
but that's the
approach we've taken.

00:48:55.459 --> 00:48:57.970
And I think that
embracing your weirdness,

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.950
and embracing your
idiosyncrasies,

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.650
and all these little differences
you have from the group,

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.720
if you can celebrate that
and say, that's your power,

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.440
being different is like a
superpower, it's worked for us,

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:09.950
I think.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.710
KATE T. PARKER: I mean, that's
exactly what we tell our kids.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.734
And that's exactly,
when I do talks

00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:15.900
to girls, that's what I say.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.914
I say, the thing that makes you
stand out, the thing that you

00:49:19.914 --> 00:49:21.830
might not be proud of
right now, but the thing

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.770
that makes you
different is exactly

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.240
the thing that you
need to focus on

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.640
and the thing that you need
to, sort of like-- that

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.844
is the thing that is
the best part about you.

00:49:30.844 --> 00:49:32.510
And you really need
to pay it attention.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.900
So if you tell her
when she shows up,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.870
and there's all princesses,
and she's the one super monkey,

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:43.790
you should be like, oh, my
god, look at how great this is.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:45.380
I mean, that's a weird costume.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.415
That's awesome.

00:49:46.415 --> 00:49:47.873
ANDREW FERENCE:
That is so awesome.

00:49:47.873 --> 00:49:49.379
KATE T. PARKER: You know?

00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:51.170
I think, if she gets
the reaction from you,

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.530
especially at three-and-a-half,
how cool is that,

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:56.930
you don't look like anybody
else, look at how different,

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.840
yeah, If you celebrate that,
then that will become part

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.200
of what she recognizes
when she's not with you.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.580
Like oh, I'm different.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.300
That's awesome.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.925
ANDREW FERENCE: And
the best part about

00:50:06.925 --> 00:50:07.820
that, it's not a lie.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.060
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:08.930
ANDREW FERENCE: What
was our reaction when

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.846
you said super monkey?

00:50:09.846 --> 00:50:11.280
We were like, oh, sick.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.890
That's awesome.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.520
It's true.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.160
People respond positively
to those things, right?

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.370
So you're not even
selling her a lie.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.686
It's the truth.

00:50:20.686 --> 00:50:21.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.890
So I have an older boy
and a younger daughter.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.630
She's eight months now.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.190
So she gets all
the hand-me-downs.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.330
And so obviously, a lot of it
is boyish colors, and trucks,

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:33.365
and whatever.

00:50:33.365 --> 00:50:34.740
And so my wife is
fine with that.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.290
But I'm more of like,
you know, we have a girl,

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.590
so now we can get her dresses
and lots of pink and whatnot.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.250
So I'm wondering, how much
does that really influence them

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.390
as they're getting older?

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:45.980
Or at one point,
are they just going

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.380
to be like, well, I don't
care how you've dressed me

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.780
in the past, I want
to be this person,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.572
and I want to dress this way.

00:50:52.572 --> 00:50:54.530
KATE T. PARKER: I'm trying
to think when they--

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.990
I mean, I think my
kids were always,

00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.597
from when they could talk, were
always very clear about what

00:51:00.597 --> 00:51:01.430
they wanted to wear.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.910
Like this one just wanted to
wear pajamas for like two years

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.020
straight.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.090
And I was like, all right.

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:13.160
I think as long as you, when
they have a voice, that you

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.320
hear their voice, and
you listen to them,

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:20.927
and you give them the power
to, I don't want to wear that,

00:51:20.927 --> 00:51:22.010
or I do want to wear pink.

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.926
Like that's the thing.

00:51:22.926 --> 00:51:25.160
I don't have an issue with pink.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.050
I don't an issue
with princesses.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.500
It's just, if that's
what you want to do.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.730
I love pink.

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.302
If you want to wear that, great.

00:51:33.302 --> 00:51:34.760
But if you don't
want to wear that,

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.920
I just don't feel like
you should be shoehorned

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.770
into it, as a girl or a boy.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:43.130
But yeah, I think
as long as when

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:48.200
they have a decision making and
they're making their decisions,

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.640
as long as you are
listening to that--

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.150
but now, I mean,
when they're babies,

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.670
you can kind of-- that's like,
you have a very small window

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.015
of you can make them look like--

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:02.461
put them in a monkey
costume, or whatever.

00:52:02.461 --> 00:52:02.960
But yeah.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.620
So I think as long as
when they have a voice,

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.457
you start to listen to
it, that's important.

00:52:08.457 --> 00:52:10.248
ANDREW FERENCE: Yeah,
we've done everything

00:52:10.248 --> 00:52:12.780
from Disney princesses-- and
I mean now, like one day,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.630
it'll be the unicorn onesie.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:18.140
And the next day, it's like
the Thrasher skateboard hoodie.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.750
It's just, they have their
arsenal for whatever mood

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.211
they're in, or whatever
they want to be that day.

00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:23.710
Right?

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.510
But I mean, yeah, their voice.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.560
Let them drive the bus.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.130
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.560
ANDREW FERENCE: When
they're young, I don't know.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:29.780
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.320
ANDREW FERENCE: I
can't even think--

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:30.970
I can't even remember what we--

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.870
I think we did girl's
clothes, or whatever.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.290
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah,
we did girl-- yeah.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:35.240
ANDREW FERENCE:
It's not poisonous.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.660
KATE T. PARKER: Yeah.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.160
Yes.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.418
ANDREW FERENCE: But yeah,
just like everything.

00:52:39.418 --> 00:52:40.857
Yeah, I don't know.

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.440
I never put that
much thought into it,

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.642
but we always let them pick
what they want to wear.

00:52:44.642 --> 00:52:46.100
KATE T. PARKER:
No, but I get that.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.430
I remember when I--

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.930
because my oldest was
bald for two years.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:53.375
I would always get upset
when somebody would

00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:54.650
be like, oh, what's his name?

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:58.640
And I'm like, oh, my god,
it's a girl, obviously.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.340
But I get it, if you're
constantly saying,

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.100
oh, no, this is a girl,
because she's maybe in blues,

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:04.840
or whatever.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.940
But yeah, I think now,
do whatever you want.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.214
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:09.214 --> 00:53:09.880
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.530
I know we're close on time,
but just a quick question.

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.410
Thank you guys, again,
for coming again.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.940
So twofold question.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.730
The first is, I know
working for the NHL, Andrew,

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:26.720
I am really curious, especially
talking about your work

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.420
with youth and how you're
looking to promote the game

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.330
and grow the game, what the
responsibilities you think of

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.870
are professional bodies
and governing bodies

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:40.940
for women's youth
specifically, as well.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.010
I know in general,
just the access

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:46.220
to resources for youth
sport, especially the NHL

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.060
as a men's league--

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.840
there's a separate NWHL--

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.640
how do you guys view
your responsibility

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.848
and the responsibility of
governing bodies in general

00:53:54.848 --> 00:53:58.660
towards promoting sports
equally between genders?

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:02.330
And then sequentially,
I think that there's

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:05.760
a pretty wide consensus
now, like "Strong

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.640
is the New Pretty," women
or girls specifically,

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.106
should be doing sports
and can do anything.

00:54:11.106 --> 00:54:13.230
But a lot of that perception--
and you pointed out,

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.260
Kate-- around puberty,
things start to change a lot.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.600
And access and
participation in sports

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.900
precipitously drops off, once
girls hit puberty and hit 18.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.630
So I just wanted to
get your perspective

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:27.240
on both governing
body responsibilities

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.370
and professional body
responsibilities,

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.130
as well as what
the future of-- you

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.870
know, you're a good strong girl,
but be a strong woman later--

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.709
and how you see that transition.

00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:39.000
ANDREW FERENCE: You're bang on.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.780
I think there is a
massive responsibility.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.950
And I think that,
for the most part,

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.270
we're taking our first strides
on deliberately supporting

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:49.650
female-specific hockey.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.880
Well, just a couple
weeks ago, we

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.380
supported Hayley
Wickenheiser's tournament.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.480
She's one of the greatest hockey
players of all time, Canadian.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.270
She runs an all-girls
hockey festival.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:06.210
And so the way we approach
it is, it's not just a hockey

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.060
tournament where they
go play the games

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.400
and then get the
medals and stuff.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.020
What she does is she
has hockey games,

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.390
but then she has all
this off-ice activity.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.370
So you have women
empowerment sessions,

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:19.200
and you have sports
sampling where

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.010
you can go try wrestling
with the female Olympian

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.010
wrestler who won a gold medal.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.900
She had the prime
minister's wife

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.180
come in and give a panel
on the power of women

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.290
involved in sport.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.710
And so these girls are coming
to this hockey tournament,

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.480
and yeah, they're
playing hockey,

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.140
but then they're at the
arena the entire day

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.650
doing all these other
really powerful things

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.270
and having this
great experience,

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.040
while playing hockey.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.770
So at the NHL level, we look
at things like that and say,

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:53.790
100%, this is what
we have to support.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.910
Like I said, we're not
trying to build necessarily

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.250
the next generation
of NHL players,

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.560
we're trying to build the
next generation of people

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.790
that just love hockey.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:07.200
And obviously, from a business
decision, girls, boys,

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.400
everybody, we want to watch, and
be a fan, and enjoy the game.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.080
So obviously, from a business
sense, it makes a lot of sense.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.010
I mean, it'd be crazy to
ignore the female market,

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.350
but just because it's the
right thing to do, as well.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:25.800
Our sport, the
participation levels

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.040
in both Canada and
the US, we've actually

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.190
gone up in the last couple
of years only because

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:33.160
of female participation.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.170
Girls hockey is taking off
like crazy all over the place--

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:41.370
California, even down
in Texas and Las Vegas,

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:42.660
now that they have a team.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.340
It's insane when
you see the growth

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.910
in the female part of our game.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.130
And really, for
the most part, we

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:52.980
have some clubs that are doing
incredible things at a city

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.484
level.

00:56:53.484 --> 00:56:54.900
But as the NHL,
like I said, we're

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.440
in our first strides of
deliberately supporting

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.670
female hockey and giving
them resources and supporting

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:03.450
their tournaments.

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:06.750
And even just yesterday,
for the last two days,

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:09.570
actually, at headquarters,
we had 12 powerful women

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.240
from across our sport,
from broadcasting,

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.660
to executive levels,
to players, obviously.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.690
But we're putting together
a strong advisory panel,

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:25.260
specific to help guide
us down that path.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.390
My department's majority female.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:28.350
My boss is female.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.960
So I think that
that representation

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.710
is incredibly important at an
executive level of the NHL.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:36.120
That's different.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.640
Over the past few years
of our commissioner

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.620
bringing in strong
female leaders

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.340
into the highest
positions within NHL

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.591
to help make these decisions,
that's massive progress,

00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:49.090
I think.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:53.190
And it's because of, I think,
that responsibility, but also

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:55.621
good business.

00:57:55.621 --> 00:57:57.620
KATE T. PARKER: Oh, and
then the second question

00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.730
about the drop off
of girls in puberty

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.280
from sports, which is huge.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:09.950
And I don't know how to fix
it, but that's something

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:13.387
that I definitely, moving
forward in 2019 as part

00:58:13.387 --> 00:58:15.470
of "Strong is the New
Pretty", that we are looking

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.210
to give back in that way.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.440
I mean, it could be
something simple and as easy

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.180
as some girls don't
have a sports bra,

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.540
and that is why they
are not participating.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.970
Or just like there's
these certain barriers

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:36.620
that, because at that point
it gets really competitive,

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:39.470
and its travel,
and it's expensive,

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:42.620
but there's a lot of different
barriers that, I think,

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.510
if we can keep our
girls in sports,

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:49.670
I feel like it's such a
huge part of confidence

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:53.780
and self-worth that they
need at that age, more

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.700
than any other age.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.880
And yeah, it's something
that I would really

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.030
personally like to focus
on, keeping girls in sports.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.490
And there's so many different
reasons why they're dropping

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:08.900
out, that if there
is simple Band-Aids,

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:14.120
we can get all of the girls
in Georgia sports bras,

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.709
or pedometers, or something
like that, I would--

00:59:18.709 --> 00:59:19.250
I don't know.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:21.350
I think it's something
that we need to address,

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:25.840
because it definitely
affects strong women.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.570
I played through college
and got so much out of it.

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:33.620
And it's such a huge part of
my work ethic today and sense

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:39.350
of confidence, I think, that
it's sort of like a tragedy

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.230
if people miss out on
that, if they love a sport.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.052
That's the thing.

00:59:44.052 --> 00:59:45.260
It doesn't have to be sports.

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.570
Whatever it is,
just find a passion

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.790
and invest yourself in it.

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.120
And I think it's just opening
the pathways for girls

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.120
to figure out what that is,
and then staying with it

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.100
and giving them the
avenue, and the path,

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.460
and the support to continue
with whatever they love.

01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.220
ANDREW FERENCE: Thank you.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:04.490
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:06.020
AUDIENCE: I've played rugby
for the last 12 years.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.980
ANDREW FERENCE: Yes.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.480
ANDREW FERENCE:
It's the best sport.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.906
I love it.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.030
I mean, hockey is the best.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.863
Rugby is the second.

01:00:11.863 --> 01:00:12.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.480
SPEAKER 1: Well,
Andrew, Kate, thank

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.990
you so much for being here.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.080
ANDREW FERENCE: Thank you.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.163
KATE T. PARKER: Thank you.

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:19.830
[APPLAUSE]
