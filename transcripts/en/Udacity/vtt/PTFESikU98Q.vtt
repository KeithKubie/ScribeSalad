00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.200
There are so many mutations and so many causes for mutations it's crazy.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; it's true, and we haven't even had time to cover sequence

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.780
inversions, jumping genes. Or cosmic rays

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.940
and how other chemicals cause mutations too.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900
&gt;&gt; Why don't we just stick to what happens to the mutations when we

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.280
have them and why is it that some mutations get passed down but others don't?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; Well, let's think about this in a large population. There

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.210
are many mutations or alleles that can persist. But the only way

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.950
they can persist over time is if

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.810
they get passed down from generation to generation.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.790
&gt;&gt; So reproduction is a selection point?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.570
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It all hinges on reproduction. If you can't make it

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.140
to reproductive age, then those alleles

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.670
or mutations aren't going to get passed down.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.742
&gt;&gt; So, I've heard this term a lot and I'm sure

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.569
you have too, but it reminds me of survival of the fittest.

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.783
&gt;&gt; I have heard survival of the fittest is actually a

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:50.517
misnomer in biology. It's one of the most talked about myths.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.741
&gt;&gt; So well, what's inaccurate about it?

00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:54.903
&gt;&gt; Well, I would you to figure this

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:58.055
out. Take this scenario, let's imagine we have a

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:01.410
group of about five people out camping together.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.644
Each with different alleles that affect their leg muscles

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:07.226
strength and ability to run. And suddenly, a

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:09.470
hungry bear attacks the camp to eat one of

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.140
the campers and they scatter. You tell me,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.400
how fast do you have to run to survive?
