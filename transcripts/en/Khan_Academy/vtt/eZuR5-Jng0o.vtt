00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:02.480
All right.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.390
We are on problem number ten.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.460
This says the absolute value of
10 minus k is equal to 3.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.114
And that we know that the
absolute value of k minus 5 is

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:18.330
equal to 8.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870
And they say, what is the value
of k that satisfies both

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.570
equations above?

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.680
Well let's do the first one.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.850
The absolute value of 10
minus k is equal to 3.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.750
That tells us that 10 minus k
is equal to 3, or 10 minus k

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.410
is equal to minus 3.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.710
If 10 minus k is 3, just based
on the first equation alone, I

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.940
get k is equal to 7.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.620
10 minus 7 is equal to 3.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.430
And here, k is equal to 13.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.620
So just on this first
constraint, we have k is equal

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.400
to 7 or 13.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.113
So now let's do the second
constraint, and

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:55.770
I'll do it in yellow.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.175
So k minus 5 is 8.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.470
That absolute value is equal to
8, so it's either k minus 5

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.480
is equal to 8, or k minus
5 is equal to minus 8.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.770
If k minus 5 is 8,
then k is 13.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.630
If k minus 5 is equal to minus
8, then that means k is equal

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.240
to minus 3.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.110
In order for k to satisfy both
of this equations, I've just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.570
kind of solved it.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.650
What k satisfies both
of these equations?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.580
Well 7 only satisfies the first
one, and negative 3 only

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.480
satisfies the second one.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.870
But 13, k equals 13,
satisfies both.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.200
So that is your answer.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.060
13.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.310
Next problem.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.810
Problem number eleven.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.060
I've gotta do some drawing.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.530
I think I'm going to go
for a walk after this.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.010
I need to work off
that turkey.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.850
I have a line here,
that's line M.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.119
I have line L, something
like that.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480
And then I have this
perpendicular line,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.220
up here like that.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.330
And then what do they tell us?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.580
They tell us that this
is perpendicular.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.430
Let me switch colors.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.940
They tell us that this
is 65 degrees.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.560
They tell us that this, right
here, is x degrees.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.170
Oh, and there's another
line there, I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.690
haven't even drawn it.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.050
There's another line, that I
haven't drawn, that is this.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.645
Switching back to the green.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.630
This is 20 degrees,
and so this is x.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.390
x is just this thing right here,
not this whole thing.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.900
This is 20 degrees.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.370
What is the value of x
in the figure above?

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.320
So we just gotta do what I like
to affectionately call

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.630
the angle game.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.610
And the angle game, I just try
to figure out as many angles

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.530
as I can figure out.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.360
So what is the measure
of this angle?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.880
Well this angle and this angle
are complementary.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.420
They add up to 90 degrees.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.810
We know this is 90, so this
whole thing is 90.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:37.130
So if this and this add up
to 90, what is this?

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.210
25 plus 65 is 90, correct?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.100
Yes.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.740
You can tell addition
is my weak point.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.870
So this is 25 degrees,
this is 20 degrees.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.980
Can we figure out x?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.020
Well, sure.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.090
We know that all of these 3
angles combined have to add up

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.710
to 180 now.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.630
Because they're all kind of
collectively supplementry.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.520
You go around, you go halfway
around the circle.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.611
So we know that x plus 20
plus 25 is equal 180.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:08.160
x plus 45 is equal to 180.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.762
So x is equal to, this is where
I always mess up, so x

00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:16.140
is equal to 135.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.740
So that's our answer.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.990
Next problem.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.450
So number twelve.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.250
That last problem was one that
my cousin had marked up pretty

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.720
incorrectly, so I had to take
some pause just to make sure I

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.250
didn't mark it up incorrectly.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.550
OK.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.400
Problem number twelve.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.320
The median of a set of 9
consecutive integers is 42.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.500
What is the greatest
of these integers?

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.230
So the median of 9 consecutive
integers is 42.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.160
So 42 is the middle number,
and there's

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.900
9 consecutive numbers.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.560
How many numbers are going
to be greater than 42?

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.100
Median means middle.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:28.870
So that means there are
4 greater and 4 less.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.900
Because there's a total
of 9 numbers.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.070
4 less, 42, and then
4 greater.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.572
And they're consecutive numbers,
so what are going to

00:05:34.572 --> 00:05:36.170
be the 4 numbers greater
that it?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.370
Well 43, 44, 45, 46.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.950
The question asks us, what is
the greatest of the numbers?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.010
Well sure, it's going
to be 46.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.660
And you could have written out
all the numbers, but you know

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.190
42 is the middle, there are 4
greater and 4 less, just do 4.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.900
It saves you a little time.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.715
Problem number thirteen.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.010
Let the function f be
defined by f of x is

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.260
equal to x plus 1.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.610
If 2f of p is equal to 20.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.660
So 2 times f of p
is equal to 20.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.840
What is the value of f of 3p?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.370
This looks fun.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.200
So 2 times f of p is equal
to 20, what is f of 3p?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.990
So let's evaluate
2 times f of p.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:44.520
2 times f of p, well that
equals 2 times p plus 1.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.760
We know that equals 20.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.000
And so you know that 2p plus 2,
I just distributed the 2,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.300
is equal to 20.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.790
2p is equal to 18,
p is equal to 9.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.080
We just solve for p.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.880
They're just trying to confuse
you with notation.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.330
There's nothing really
that fancy here.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.440
It's a very simple equation
to solve.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.860
And once you know p equals 9,
then we say f of 3p, that's

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.410
the same thing, because
p equals 9, f of 27.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.610
And now this becomes just a
simple function evaluation.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.150
f of 27 is equal to 27 plus 1.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.350
27 plus 1 is just 28.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.580
That's it.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.410
Next problem.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.830
Problem number fourteen.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.280
I'll do in green.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.870
Problem number fourteen.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.470
I have to do some drawing now.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.950
I'll do it big because
it looks complicated.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.100
Big line there.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.760
I have another line here that's
almost horizontal.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.010
And then this looks like it's
perpendicular, it is.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.940
And then we'll go
like that there.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.070
And add another perpendicular
line like that.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.130
That's a nice looking drawing.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:23.595
So then this is J, K, L, N, M.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.300
They tell us that this is 90
degrees, it's perpendicular.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.170
This is x degrees.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.500
They also tell us that
this is 125 degrees.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.049
They also tell us that this
is perpendicular.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:46.950
In the figure above, KN is
perpendicular to JL.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.040
We knew that because
they drew it.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.230
And LM is perpendicular to JL.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.150
We knew that because they
drew that there.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:07.420
If the lengths of LN and LM
are equal, these are equal

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.910
lengths, what is
the value of x?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.370
Well if we know that these 2
sides are equal, what do we

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.510
also know about its
base angles?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.210
This angle is going to have
to be equal to this angle.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.200
So if that angle is equal to
that angle, let's figure out

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.110
what that is.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.830
If this purple angle here
is 125, what is this?

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.540
Well they're supplementary,
so they add up to 180.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.230
So this is 125.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.060
I just realized I only
have 35 seconds

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.010
left to do this problem.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.020
Actually, I will continue it in
the next video, because I

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.620
only have 20 seconds
now to do this.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.870
So I'll see you in
the next video.
