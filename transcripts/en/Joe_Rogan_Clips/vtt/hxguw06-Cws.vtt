00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience fast,
right?
I wonder that.
Yeah,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.530
there's some people I think give him a quick dose,
you know,
like,
cause I,
I swell,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.610
I respect Brian and his further to my point,
similar to the hunt in argument,

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.950
I can be,
you know,
I happen to believe in God,
but like I,

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.960
when I talked to Brian Cox,
I got to the point where I was saying,
all right,

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.090
even though I believe in God and you are a an atheist,

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.500
although he said I don't call myself an atheist.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
Well I felt like we both got to the point where we said compassion,

9
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.360
kindness and love are the most important thing.
So in this way,
who cares?

10
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.580
So when you see there,
when you say you believe in God,

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.240
do you believe in the traditional God of Christianity?
What do you do?

12
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.600
You believe in God as a concept.
You have your own definition for it.

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.930
That I believe that that state of oneness and transcendence that you're talking

14
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.540
about when you threw your DMT experiences that says,
you know,

15
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.430
love and kindness and love and awareness,
I believe that is the most real thing.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
I think that proceeded all matter.
And I think that we,

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.500
that we can interact with it.
So I don't believe that God in a sort of,

18
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.790
in just a guy away,

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.050
that the whole world is like an interactive by biological living,

20
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.930
breathing goddess.
I believe that we,
I believe yes,

21
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.850
that and that we can commune with it.
And I am.
Furthermore,

22
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.720
the relevance of it for me is that it,

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
it suggests to me that we should be acting kindly and lovingly.

24
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.410
And when we're thinking about how do we organize our systems,

25
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.610
but our awareness of that energy accessible to all of us should be paramount in

26
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:30.690
our understanding of how we organize.

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.190
So like what I think is like that we should look at,
you know,

28
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.840
like we've been through as human beings,

29
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.970
so many advents that agriculture technology industry thinking that we were the,

30
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:43.440
the,
you know,
the sun went round.

31
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.740
They're thinking that the earth was flat with all due respect to Eddie Bravo,

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.940
you know,
and we,
and,

33
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.110
and before each of these realizations in each of these changes,

34
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.770
we always think we are at the summit.
We never know what's gonna be.

35
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.760
The thing that's going to change.

36
00:01:56.761 --> 00:02:00.720
My suspicion is that what's going to change is the way we relate to

37
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.870
consciousness and the way we see ourselves as individuals that we start to have

38
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:07.110
an understanding that what?
That that becomes a priority.

39
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.110
That thing you've described of like when I've come back from DMT trips,

40
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.630
I recognize this is just an illusion and it's not real.

41
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
I think that we'll start like I believe that we need to prioritize that and

42
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.690
progressing along that line.

43
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:23.280
What are the implications of this not being the most real frequency there is?

44
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.500
How do we organize society on that basis?

45
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.680
How does that affect how we relate to one another?
What kind of,

46
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.740
how should we be governing?
How?
How does that affect justice?

47
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.090
That that should be in the mix instead of what are many fucking terrifying

48
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.170
arachnoid weird gait robot motherfuckers.
Can we cook up,
you know,

49
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.420
like that's the way we're going,

50
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.560
the progressive technological route because it's created medicine because it

51
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:47.010
saves so many lives because it's given us wonderful technology,

52
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.100
the spirit of entrepreneurialship.
But all of that energy,

53
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.180
it all gets pushed in one direction.
It all goes that way.

54
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.820
And I feel that we need to invite that back.

55
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.220
The sacred and the divine need to be back in the conversation.
Well,

56
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 1>there's certainly going to be pros and cons with everything.
You know,</v>

57
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.430
there's definitely pros and cons with the creation of technology.

58
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.250
I think of this,
I think of human beings as com.

59
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.580
If you go back to single celled organisms,

60
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.620
they have very little awareness of their environment.

61
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.750
And then as it became primitive bugs,
you know,
as,
as,
as things evolved,

62
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.490
they develop more awareness.
But even us in comparison to certain animals,

63
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.210
certain narrow animals have heightened senses of smell and survival instincts.

64
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.450
But they're also colorblind,
you know,
and they,
they,
they don't see things.

65
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.610
They see edge detection like this.
One of the things about deer,
um,

66
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.340
they see movement.
So like if you wear camouflage and you know your,

67
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:44.290
your pattern is broken up with a grid and then you stay put,
they don't see you.

68
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.530
Yeah,
they just did.
It doesn't mean it doesn't register to them.

69
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.693
They see movement.

70
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.970
So we have a far more complex system of recognition than they do in terms of

71
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.220
like visually the way we see things.

72
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
And I think that whatever skills or whatever senses that we've evolved,

73
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.680
I don't think that's it.

74
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.990
I don't think that we've reached the pinnacle of it and I think that as beings

75
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.730
become more and more evolved,

76
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.500
they'll probably gain more and more senses and that could be directly related to

77
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:18.334
technology.

78
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.980
It's totally possible that what's going on with technologies that we're also

79
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.930
developing through external means a way for us to see the world,

80
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.080
a way for us to view like what they've done with the large Hadron collider is

81
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.400
like the best example of it,
right?

82
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.850
What they do with the Hubble space telescope and other telescopes.

83
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.770
You're using technology to gain awareness and to see more things and that this

84
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:43.990
is the good side of technologies,

85
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.020
that it's allowing us to have a far greater understanding of all the variables

86
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.140
that surround us that we might not be able to detect with our senses.
Yes,

87
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.700
this is a part of who we are and then I think when you're talking about things

88
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.930
like psychedelic experiences,

89
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.350
that's probably another realm of understanding that we haven't really achieved

90
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:07.090
yet because we're,
we're still evolving as,
as a,
as a species,
as a thing.
