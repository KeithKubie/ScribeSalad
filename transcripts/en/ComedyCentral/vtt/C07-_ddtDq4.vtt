00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.103
Now, Pokémon Go debuted only
a couple of weeks ago,

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:06.839
but it has more users
than Tinder and Twitter.

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:09.308
But some-- true--
but some say Pokémon Go

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.611
is a government
surveillance tool.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.645
(audience laughing)

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:13.980
So for more on this,
let's check in

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.648
with conspiracy expert,
Mike Yard,

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.684
in the latest segment
of The Y Files.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.525
Okay, so, Mike.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:30.463
Honestly, Mike,
do you think Pokémon Go

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.933
is some sinister tool
for spying on us?

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.769
-Is Pokémon Go sinister?
-Right, no.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:40.773
Larry, I hope you like
your new ophthalmologist, me,

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.208
'cause I'm about
to tear the scales

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.044
from your eyes, my brother.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.579
But, Mike,

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.182
why would our government make
a game to monitor people?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.384
The NSA got in trouble
for collecting phone call data.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.752
(imitates buzzer)
You lose.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.156
Of course, Pokémon Go was
created by the government, man,

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.759
but not for your
garden-variety sheeple control.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.396
Pokémon Go was created...

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.333
to discredit Black Lives Matter.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.068
Read it and weep, my brother.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.736
Read it and weep.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.039
(audience chuckles)

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.374
-Mike, that's absurd.
-(audience applause)

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.276
-That doesn't even make sense.
-It's all here, my brother.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.878
-No, no, no. No, no.
-It's all here.

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:21.981
Pokémon Go is
like a stupid time-waster.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.350
It has absolutely nothing to do
with Black Lives Matter.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.385
Oh, come on, Larry Shill-more.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:28.521
-Oh.
-(laughter)

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.491
You play by walking around
looking down at your phone.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:32.859
Okay. All right.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:34.093
What? What?

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.397
So we can't record what the cops
are doing to us.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.633
(applause)

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.901
-Wait.
-Gotta think.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.336
Hold on a second.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.039
So you're saying, like the game
is so powerful and engrossing,

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.541
you just ignore everything
around you?

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.176
Hell, yeah.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.611
It's that seductive, Larry.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.579
I mean, they got Charizard,
they got Pikachu.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:54.680
They got Vulpix.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:55.681
They got Eevees.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.350
It's like crack to us, Larry.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.351
Crack.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.119
Hello.

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:01.754
♪ Gotta catch 'em all. ♪

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.725
-I mean...
-It's not like crack, Mike.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.926
It's like crack, bro.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.194
But we have...

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.363
But, Mike, it's that way
for everybody that plays it,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.331
-not just black people.
-(scoffs)

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.267
You know what, your ancestors
must have been Nubian,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.603
'cause you love denial.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:19.238
(laughter, applause)

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.773
Let me ask you...

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.542
-Let me ask you something,
Larry. -Mike...

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.178
-What? -What's your favorite
character, huh? Chumpasaur?

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.779
Mike, that doesn't even
make sense.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.381
All right, look...
Okay, look, prove it.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.916
How is Pokémon GO a trap

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.018
specifically rigged
to catch black people?

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.020
Buckle up, buttercup.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.388
Pokémon.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.557
Poké--
a raw fish dish from Hawaii.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.559
Hawaii. Barack Obama.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.461
Obama, hated by Republicans.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.397
Republicans, Fox News.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.299
Fox News, Roger Ailes.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.001
Roger Ailes, who allegedly
fired Gretchen Carlson

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.436
for not having sex with him.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.872
Ailes is a TV set blackmailer.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.141
Anagram it.
"TV set blackmailer."

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.276
Black Lives Matter. Boom!

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.612
-(applause and cheering)
-Right there.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.981
Got to peel the layers.
Peel 'em all.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:04.417
-Boom?!
-Boom.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.886
Yeah, but, no. No boom.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.654
That's a giant pile
of horse (bleep).

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:10.523
You don't have a single shred
of proof

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.491
that the U.S. government
is behind this game.

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.493
Oh. Oh. Okay, proof--
that's what you're looking for?

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.695
-Proof?
-Okay. Yes, please.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.029
-Proof.
-Okay, fine.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.931
The company behind
Pokémon Go, Niantic Labs,

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:22.034
is run by John Hanke, who worked
for the U.S. foreign affairs.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.970
Then started a company
called "Keyhole,"

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.106
funded by the CIA's venture
capital arm, In-Q-Tel,

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.141
funded in turn by the NGA--

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:32.111
National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.046
(laughter, cheering)

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.349
Is that enough proof?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.417
Oh, Mike. (bleep)

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.952
Is... is that all true?

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.355
-Yes, Larry.
-Oh, (bleep).

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.056
-(laughter)
-My!

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.092
-Now you're seeing.
-I... man...

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.426
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.029
That's actually the most
plausible thing you ever said.

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:53.065
-I never... The NGA?!
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:56.302
And what kind of intel
does the NGA collect?

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:58.371
N-I-G-G-A.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.039
<i> -Whaaat?! </i>
-(applause and cheering)

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.041
-Hey, Mike, no. See?

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:04.543
See, you had me, Mike,
and now you lost me.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:07.642
-Mike Yard, everybody.
-(applause and cheering)
