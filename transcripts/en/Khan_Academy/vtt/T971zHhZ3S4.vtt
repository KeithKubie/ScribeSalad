00:00:00.684 --> 00:00:02.100
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.570
attempt to find the diameter
of this circle right over here.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.910
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.990
and try this out on your own.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.920
Well, let's think about what's
going on right over here.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.545
AB is definitely a
diameter of the circle.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:18.420
It's a straight line.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.290
It's going through the
center of the circle.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.250
O is the center of the
circle right over here.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.210
And so what do we know?

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.630
Well, we could look at this
angle right over here, angle C,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.090
and think about it is
an inscribed angle.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.900
And think about the
arc that it intercepts.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.800
It intercepts this
arc right over here.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.525
This arc is exactly
half of the circle.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.660
Angle C is inscribed.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.330
If you take these two sides
or the two sides of the angle,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.690
it intercepts at A and B,
and so it intercepts an arc,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630
this green arc right over here.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.694
So the central angle right
over here is 180 degrees,

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.860
and the inscribed angle is
going to be half of that.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.680
It's going to be 90 degrees.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.230
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.460
it's going to be a right angle.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.050
And what that does
for us is it tells us

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.770
that triangle ACB
is a right triangle.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.110
This is a right triangle, and
the diameter is its hypotenuse.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.560
So we can just apply the
Pythagorean theorem here.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:37.800
15 squared plus 8 squared--
let me do this in magenta--

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.890
is going to be the length
of side AB squared.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.030
So this side right over here,
let me just call that x.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.630
That's going to be
equal to x squared.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.700
So 15 squared, that's 225.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.850
8 squared is 64, plus
64-- I want to do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.650
that in green-- is
equal to x squared.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.110
225 plus 64 is 289 is
equal to x squared.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.572
And then 289 is 17 squared.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.030
And you could try
out a few numbers

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.700
if you're unsure about that.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.430
So x is equal to 17.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.130
So the diameter of this
circle right over here is 17.
