1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,930
You are listening to radiolab radio

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,870
from the beginning. W N Y. S t. E

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,620
n n. P. R. E.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,920
You ever get a good sense of what to what
you want to tell me? Yeah. All right.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,900
Hey, I'm Jen. I am Robert. This is
Radiolab, the podcast, the podcast.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,940
Can I just start us off with
a moment of appreciation?

7
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm very excited for what you're going
to play for us today because sometimes,

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,670
you know, you talk to people
on stage smart people and uh,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,510
you did one recently for the
world science festival. Yes.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,410
And we put it on every so often on the
podcast, but we don't do it enough. Well,

11
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,280
we're going to do it now.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,900
So

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,250
in, in just a moment,

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,820
I'm going to introduce you
to two gentlemen who are
nothing short of remarkable,

15
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:46,680
but before I do, I'd just,

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,460
so we go now [inaudible] and Sylvia k
auditorium at the campus at Hunter College

17
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:54,790
in Manhattan. Uh, Louise and we'll
just set it up for us a little bit.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,400
Like what are we about to
do? Um, well, so the, the,

19
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,170
the idea of this world
science festival evening, um,

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,030
there are people who wander around the
world who have a problem which is called

21
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:10,180
face blindness. Weirdly, both
these men are face blind.

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,840
So when they look at a face
for 10, 20, 60 minutes,

23
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,320
the other guy's face just doesn't
get in or sticking to their heads.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,080
I chose two people.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,710
One of them is Oliver sacks
are irregular. Oliver,

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,110
he's a neuroscientist and he's
like all over his Facebook.

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,750
Oh boy is he phased by it?

28
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean he came recognize faces but you'll
see the other guy who we are going to

29
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:35,320
call chuck, the other guy is one of the
greatest portrait artists in the world.

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,500
He has as many of you know for
decades now created art big paintings.

31
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:44,830
I'm little but usually huge
paintings, mostly of faces.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,290
Here he is chuck close.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,620
I thought it would be interesting
to bring these two people together,

34
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,431
face blind,

35
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:58,431
Oliver face blind shot and discuss what
many people think of as a very rare

36
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,590
situation. Lauren. It does. Again,

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,630
we don't know who you are yet.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,260
Both of you.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,000
How long ago did you discover
if indeed that's the right word,

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,570
that you were unusual in
this regard? I'll, um,

41
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,580
I think probably when I, hi, I can't
hear. Okay. So I'll tell you what,

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,020
I'll just stick this thing in front of
you and say something. Say something.

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,700
That's all you missed the first part of
the program. But all of it was saying,

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,920
uh, so you, you were in a class
with other kids. If you, if,

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,630
if you had a friend who
was like, you know, a pow,

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,160
would you take a bit a beat
to know who it was when? Yeah.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,880
So say Jonathan Miller became a
good friend. He's tall and gangly.

48
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:49,780
He has red hair and
his, his movements, uh,

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,360
are fluid and evocative and wonderful.

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,440
And if Jonathan Miller was brought
in paralyzed and totally straight,

51
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,990
would you know it was Jonathan
Miller? Do you have to see the hair,

52
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,130
the movements? No.

53
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,720
Um, when I, when I have got to
know someone, well, uh, then I,

54
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,750
then I will recognize the face, but
it takes a long while and with, um,

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,650
and even mirror has to be reinforced.
Right. You have to keep saying.

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,740
So if you spent four minutes with the
person and you walk away and come back two

57
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,390
minutes later, do you
know who the person is?

58
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,850
It does if 20 minutes with the person
time make a difference, um, uh,

59
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,900
I tend to lose it within
minutes. Every minute you,

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,160
same problem. Same problem. I um,

61
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,220
I can spend an evening talking to someone,

62
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,280
looking at them across the table
and I've see them the next day.

63
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,430
I'd have no idea I've ever seen
them nor do I remember their name.

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,010
But when they open their
mouth, would you say, oh,

65
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,570
that's the one or not even know.

66
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,180
And a lot of it is context.
If they walk into my studio,

67
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,840
I figured they've walked into my studio
because they're supposed to be there.

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,423
Alright.

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,080
Then I interview them for a
while to find out who they are.

70
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,450
Are you just trying to subtly
find like, so who is the,

71
00:03:57,451 --> 00:04:02,250
is that this whole is this person? Why
are they in my studio now in your case,

72
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,340
if that person were to suddenly flatten
out and [inaudible] still on a page.

73
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,170
The thing in my work is I'm determined
by my learning disabilities.

74
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,570
So face blind.

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sure I was driven to paint
portraits by being faced blind. Uh,

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,570
that is, I am, I know
now that if I can, uh,

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,710
flatten an image out and
scan it the way I work,

78
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,540
I can commit it to memory and I have
almost photographic memory for things that

79
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,180
are flat and still still, yeah.

80
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,230
Three being in space and moving
around makes the face and visible.

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,350
Fixing it makes the face men
move your head a half an inch.

82
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:47,150
To me it's a whole new, yeah.

83
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,680
Face I've never seen before. Wow. Wow.

84
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,240
Have you ever not recognized

85
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,250
yourself? Um, yeah, I'm,
I'm always, um, well,

86
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,850
several times I have started apologizing
to launch clumsy at people and realize

87
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,130
that it's a mirror. It's a
mirror, it's a mirror. Um,

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,440
but it's even going to stage further
than that. Fairly recently. I was, uh,

89
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,670
in a, uh, a cafe in Chelsea
market with tables outside. And,

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,770
um, while I was waiting for my food,
I do what people would be as often to,

91
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:26,700
I started to, to preen myself.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,360
And when I realized that my reflection
was not doing the same thing

93
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,603
[inaudible]

94
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,640
well should I, and the inside there
was a man with a beard. Possibly you?

95
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,330
No.

96
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,090
Who wondered why I was sort of, you know,

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,000
making faces with him, so,

98
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,620
so I may take out the people to be
myself as well as fun. Nice. My,

99
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,170
I just was wondering how you result

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,940
once you realize that you were preening
your beard in front of the bearded man.

101
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,250
Um, did you, could you, did you
like look down and I, yeah, I,

102
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,720
I did look abashed I often put dashed.

103
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,260
Well, now let me just ask you
about, is this just a face problem?

104
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:18,430
What about emotional? Can
you, if you can't see a face,

105
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:21,220
can you ever read sadness? Happiness?

106
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah, I don't think I have any trouble
reading, um, how someone is feeling.

107
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,560
I think I'm actually pretty good at
that. You know what the, the way,

108
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:33,561
the way I work is to make this kind of
Bob Dick Maillian world in which I make

109
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,060
the face into a landscape.

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,080
And I journey across that landscape like
Gulliver's Lilliputians crawling over

111
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,300
the face of a, of a giant,

112
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,420
not knowing that they were
on the face of a giant,

113
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,790
but knowing everything about that face.

114
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,210
And then what I do is I put all that
information together or the kind of knows

115
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,210
the nostril, low corners of the
mouth, whatever, and I can commit it.

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,530
I can commit it to memory.

117
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,680
So I know that this is no accident
that I was driven to make, um,

118
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,110
uh, portraits of people who matter to me

119
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,300
can, but if,

120
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,550
if the person who's face you can't
read lips are trembling or if they are,

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,620
have a downcast look in the
eye or if they're being brave,

122
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,900
can you assign emotion to
a facet of a face? Yeah.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,390
And you too. Okay.

124
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,040
Well, I look talked at Mike. Okay, well I,

125
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,410
I can't paint or whatever, but I think
I'm a sensitive to emotions. You know,

126
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,370
and, and,

127
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,220
and little things including little
grimaces which indicate that someone is,

128
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,810
is lying or here's a difference.

129
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,600
I sent this to complete this sort of
look of what you can and can't do.

130
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,100
Oliver can remit. I, when I ask you
about things you've written 22 years ago,

131
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,890
a lot of times if you've talked to an
author about something they wrote 22 years

132
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:57,820
ago, they give you a sad look of, you
know, well, that was a long time ago,

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,350
but you seem to remember much
of what you have learned.

134
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,850
You seem to remember
very little of what you

135
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,803
before.

136
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,870
Well, let me, let me, let me
be gentlemen about that. Ah,

137
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
when you were in high school, it
was time to take the test, right?

138
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:19,100
You once to describe to me a,
um, an all night bathtub. No,

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,970
I

140
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,880
used the kind of sensory deprivation
tank in order to memorize things and um,

141
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,610
uh, it's very hard for me. I'd still,

142
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:30,870
I don't know how to add or subtract
without using the spots on dominoes of

143
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:35,460
visual system. I still don't know
the multiplication tables. Um,

144
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,470
I didn't take Algebra, geometry, physics,

145
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,060
or chemistry at the junior
college in my hometown. Didn't,

146
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,160
I had not taken every
taxpayer, his son or daughter.

147
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,920
I could never have gone to college.
Wow. So you're a wreck. Yeah.

148
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,330
Yeah. But

149
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,940
that's the coping part
of this for both of you.

150
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,820
It's been kind of interesting because
both of you are very, very smart.

151
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,040
So you just put your
intelligence where you have,

152
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,600
one of the great quotes I've
ever heard this from, uh, the,

153
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,270
the great painter Robert
Rauschenberg, who was, uh, the,

154
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,170
about the most learning disabled,
a dyslexia person I've ever known.

155
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,690
And he said, when you're this way,

156
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:17,250
you have to find other venues
for your intelligence, right?

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,240
You have to prove to your
teachers that even, Oh,

158
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:24,120
you're not going to be able to spit
back the name of the names or dates that

159
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,130
you, that you care about the material.

160
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:31,131
And we have to prove to the people
who we see that we care about them,

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,290
even though we're not going to recognize
their faces and maybe remember their

162
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,680
names. So you have to be charming.
You have to be a bullshit.

163
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,133
Yeah,

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,130
you have to be fast on your
feet and figure out how
you're going to explain your

165
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:51,510
way out of the fact that you don't,
uh, know who they are or remember them.

166
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,870
Do you find people calling you
like a snob or I mean like,

167
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,940
like what do you mean you don't know me?

168
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm the host of this
dinner party kind of thing.

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,560
Um, yes. Um, usually my,

170
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,320
my assistant cakes will say to people
beforehand, before they come in,

171
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,570
don't ask if, if he remembers
you because he'll say no to me.

172
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,730
She says, don't just say no.

173
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,560
Say I'm awful with faces. I
wouldn't recognize my own mother.

174
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,100
Um, but I am, but I'm not good at. Okay.

175
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,150
Um, yeah, I, I tend to withdrawal.
You withdraw. Yeah. So you,

176
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,100
you solve it by going into a corner
and not talking to anybody. Well,

177
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:40,370
it doesn't solve it. I just
talked to makes it worse. But, um,

178
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,830
my approach is to be more
outgoing, more friendly, whatever,

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,420
and to try and, um, charm my way, uh,

180
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,200
through things.

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,910
And I also lecture and talk all the
time about face blindness and my other

182
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:59,260
problems. So that people are
aware that I have then Manhattan,

183
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,640
they'll cut me some slack.

184
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,310
But, but, but you, you go out
like every chance you can. Right.

185
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,480
And you stay in every
chance you can write well,

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,580
more or less. Yeah. No
I don't stay in, but I,

187
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,870
there are other things
besides human beings.

188
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,083
And um,

189
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,180
when, when for example, I first
visited Australia, I came back with,

190
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,880
with hundreds of photos and people
look through with [inaudible]. Yes.

191
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:30,380
But didn't you meet any
human beings? Books?

192
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,100
All my photos were of scenery
and plants where I'm very at home

193
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,970
and I, I noticed that when you get
in the elevator, in your apartment,

194
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,930
you don't have any idea who the neighbors
are, but you do look down. Right? Oh,

195
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,040
I know that dogs.

196
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,720
So if they were to switch
dogs, you'd just be a, yeah.

197
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,820
Well I wouldn't notice. Yeah.

198
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,530
But if you see them without the dog,
you don't know who they are. No,

199
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,190
I don't know. So,

200
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:05,800
so this charm offensive that you go on,

201
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,060
what does that like how if you
have no idea who you're talking to,

202
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,750
what are they, what are the
charm moves? Well, not always

203
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,030
charming. I didn't recognize
a woman I'd lived with

204
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,970
for a year, two years, two years later,

205
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,880
and there's no amount of charm,
but it's going to get you through

206
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,970
a mistake like that.
It's like, do you just,

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,150
do you make fun of yourself? Oh yeah.

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,420
Self deprecating humor will,
will cover a great deal.

209
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,750
And um, if you laugh at yourself,

210
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,030
you're giving permission to other,

211
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:46,770
for other people to see it as less
than the most tragic a condition.

212
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,930
It, it is funny. You know, it's
funny, I wish I didn't have it,

213
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,793
but it's funny.

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,771
What am I,

215
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:59,420
am I that I'm lots of neurological
conditions are all comic.

216
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,070
They can be both awful and comic and it's,

217
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,710
well, there's a gallows humor in
rehabilitation hospitals for that,

218
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,360
for that very reason. You know,

219
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,850
what about it that's narrowed
down the techniques here at,

220
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:17,440
can you sometimes not see
the face but see the hair,

221
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,360
the ears, the something?

222
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,010
Oh, I'm, I'm a, absolutely.

223
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,910
If someone has large out
sticking ears or hook nose or,

224
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,800
or a little triangle of beard, uh,
off the glasses of a particular sort,

225
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,760
um,

226
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm better at recognizing cow couture's
and portraits book say in a caricature.

227
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,710
Salient features are
exaggerated. And for me it's, uh,

228
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,450
to some extent I have to make an
inventory of salient features.

229
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,060
You talk about Gulliver and that process.

230
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Do you think of what you
do as an expression of the
situation you find yourself

231
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:52,550
in?

232
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,600
Sure. In every way. I mean, I'm, uh,

233
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,070
I have trouble, uh, in a
global sense with the whole,

234
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,050
but if you break it down into
small enough bite-size, uh, units,

235
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,340
incremental units,

236
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,550
then I made this big overwhelming problem
into thousands of little more solvable

237
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,910
problems. I've just found
a way to, um, you know,

238
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,460
take my deficits and uh,

239
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,270
and use them rather than the
Bang my head against the wall.

240
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,740
Let me,

241
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,600
let me show you lie all this is
Chuck 15 and then the truck 16.

242
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,880
So the truck 15, it's going to be a
person you know named who is liable. Wait,

243
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,630
now what's happening? What
is this right here? So yeah,

244
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,220
what you should do is
you should imagine a, um,

245
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,930
it's a detailed slide and what you see
is lots of boxes with almost like mirror,

246
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:49,420
like shiny nuggets in
each mocked as this one.

247
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,420
You're looking at a checklist
painting really close.

248
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,910
Is that what you're
describing? Yes. It's a detail.

249
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,940
So it's the lower lip
and chin of somebody.

250
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:00,050
Somebody who he calls the while when
people stand right in front of Lyle's

251
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:03,080
mouth, there's a little bit of
confusion. You can't quite read it

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,330
right away. Well,

253
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:07,300
the closer you get the something
normally the more information you'd get,

254
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,080
but the closer you get, the one on
mine, the less information you have.

255
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,100
You have information.

256
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,570
When you step Mack,

257
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,660
these very abstract flat little cells
suddenly turn into a very interesting

258
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,400
phase. Well, here's what I don't
understand that if he's blind to the face,

259
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,710
how do you even build it up?

260
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,430
Like don't you have to be able to see
the thing that you're building too.

261
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,010
If he can fix it, which
the photograph does.

262
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,490
Oh he takes a picture first he
takes a picture first and then what?

263
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,010
Then he graphs it. So he makes
it into lots of little boxes.

264
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:43,210
It looks like a giant checkerboard and
then he goes to into each checkerboard

265
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:48,211
and he then repaints it magically when
you step away there is the thing that you

266
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,490
can put. Interesting. So he's able to,

267
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,670
he's able to see the details within
those boxes well enough to be able to

268
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:58,060
construct them and then trust. Then
what will emerge as the face, the,

269
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,710
and the magical part is not only do you
suddenly get the reveal of the face,

270
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,470
but with the reveal comes
a sense of the person.

271
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,870
Okay, so let's go back to the situation.

272
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,310
So now all the way you have been
losing your depth perception.

273
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,390
So he, he's now go,

274
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:22,560
he takes where the world in three D and
puts it into two D in all these fleshy

275
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:26,400
and interesting ways. You have
always been all your life or 3d man,

276
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,670
cashiers here passionate.
What's happening to you now?

277
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,140
Well now I've lost the
sight of one eye. Um, I'm,

278
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,040
everything for me is on a
plane and on a flat surface.

279
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,470
Does that mean that when you look at art,

280
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,770
that things that used to bore you now the
flat things getting better and spacial

281
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:51,030
things get worse? We'll the has
been a a paradox. Um, and that, uh,

282
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,660
for me previously until a few months ago,

283
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,930
the world consisted of solid objects
residing in space and with space between

284
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,350
them. Uh,

285
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,060
now the objects are as well painted on,

286
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,500
are on a flat plane.

287
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,630
And I think that the sense
of visual composition, uh,

288
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,710
which is not a word I ever use or
to the concept I ever had strongly.

289
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:20,040
I think that is stronger.
Unfortunately I can't paint,

290
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,250
but I do in fact find myself
enjoying painting small,

291
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,350
especially sort of are
the flat medieval ones.

292
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,380
I partly feel I'm in a sort of 13th
century world and I'm sitting here with

293
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,290
one eye closed, which is what I've
done my whole life. Right. Well,

294
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,910
because I have double vision if I
have both eyes open and uh, you know,

295
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:44,420
so I closed one eye and I flatten the
world out and I have a much better chance

296
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,290
of getting around in it.

297
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,580
So you see the wrinkles on this aisle
because it's been closed virtually my

298
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,414
entire life.

299
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,450
Oh, okay. Well, by the way,

300
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,110
is there any cure for this that
we know that if you have this,

301
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,130
if this facial blindness,
does anyone get cured of it?

302
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,870
Not so far as I know.
Okay. Empty. But, you know,

303
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,320
I think it's important to
say, and, uh, you know, I,

304
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:15,980
I portrayed myself as sort of as
is withdrawn or helps us, but I,

305
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,860
I think I also have a, a vivid love
of humanity as chuck has. But for me,

306
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:25,420
the portraits take the form of
narratives, the stories smell, um, you,

307
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,640
your words paint the most, uh,

308
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,930
specific portraits of
people's lives. And, uh,

309
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,800
I always have identified
your characters as a,

310
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,810
as vivid portrait, as anything anybody
could do in any other art form. And uh,

311
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,703
um,

312
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,360
we [inaudible]

313
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,850
you celebrate your connectedness with
humanity in a really important way.

314
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:56,210
I mean, it's a way that
we can identify with,

315
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,010
even if it's a problem we don't have.

316
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:03,430
Empathy is the basis
of I think the mortar,

317
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,440
that whole society together and uh,

318
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
telling stories in a riveting way that
allows us to empathize and care about

319
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,160
these people up. My, my grandfather
had Tourette's syndrome and reading,

320
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,910
uh, about a character with Tourette's
syndrome. And what are your books?

321
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,440
I cried through the whole thing.

322
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,860
Hm. Um, can I ask about the
cause of this condition?

323
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,660
You can get face blindness from a stroke,
right? Can you get it from a tumor?

324
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,330
Ah, yes, yes. Well,

325
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,990
head injury or whatever affects
a particular part of the brain.

326
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,940
A small area in the, in the
visual Cortex, people call it the,

327
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:47,150
the fusiform gyrus,
the fusiform face area.

328
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,910
Actually there are a number of different
face areas and normally these connect

329
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,800
up with memories of faces and things. Um,

330
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,680
but something which was not recognized
until very recently and it's still very

331
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,590
insufficiently recognized
is what chuck and I have,

332
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:07,580
which has lifelong face blindness
and which is often strongly familiar.

333
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,270
And there if you do strongly
familial meaning genetic perhaps.

334
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,290
Yes. How widespread is this
condition? The tooling you have it,

335
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,810
the best estimates is
that fairly severe? Um,

336
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,740
I mean the May well abuse a
symmetrical curve. Uh, um,

337
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,410
chuck and I are in the worst two or 3%,

338
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,480
but probably not the worst 1%. There
are people who are far, far worse.

339
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,130
Um, but um,

340
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,970
so you're going to give me a guess when
you think it's like 10% of the world and

341
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,050
1% a,

342
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:46,190
the fairly severely affected
people are two to 3%,

343
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,040
which is six to 8 million

344
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,870
people in this country.
Well, let's, let me,

345
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,960
let's do a test to see whether this
audience, how, let's just see how,

346
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,430
how good or bad you guys are. We're going
to do a little fun test of your face.

347
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,580
And the way it works is the 10
celebrity faces. What does that show?

348
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:05,530
Here's what happening. We decided to
give the whole audience a face test.

349
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,250
10 celebrity faces will be flashed
on the screen for 15 seconds.

350
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,910
Each took 10 very famous celebrities.

351
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,940
They included the president of
the United States of America.

352
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,000
Fabulous movie stars from
the past and the present.

353
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,630
You just put their face up and say, do
you recommend we put their faces up?

354
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:27,610
But we erased here. Here, Huh?
Oh, just the face. Only the face.

355
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,690
That's interesting. So imagine like
Johnny Depp, but no here takeaways here.

356
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,780
The question is would they rent?
Would you recognize this person?

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
I've been thinking how we think people
would recognize. I mean, well so when I,

358
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,930
but when I read out the names,
you're hand reading out the names.

359
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,040
Number six is Johnny Depp, Johnny Duh.

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,480
That's what he's like without hair.
That's what he's like without here.

361
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,860
People Sound surprised. I'm going to
ask for a show of hands. All right now.

362
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,670
And so then I said, well please raise
your hand if you got any person, right.

363
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,850
Anyone at all. You know,
almost everybody. Oh,

364
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,830
maybe lower your hand if you
only got one or two. Right?

365
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,070
Okay. So now some hands go down.

366
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,720
Lower your hand if you only
got three, right? So now, yeah,

367
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,690
we're beginning raising this in
an odd way. Only got three, right?

368
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,370
Lower your hand if you only got four,
right? Oh, he is such a funny word.

369
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,953
Yeah. Thank you, chuck.

370
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,630
Going please now lower your hand
if you only got nine rights.

371
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,880
The remaining hands with how
many hands are up at this point?

372
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,240
That's six out of like a
thousand. Yup. How many?

373
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,710
The remaining hands I got in CN. Could
you stand if you got 10 I just like this,

374
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,820
but the number of

375
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,310
people, but wow, they're all women.

376
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:56,460
That's interesting. All right.
Sit down. Sit down. Super People.

377
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,390
How many people got none, right? Could
you please rise? Absolutely none. I mean,

378
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,800
let's see how their moral man,

379
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,650
I wanted to know if anyone was just
totally blind and about 10 people were

380
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:12,670
totally blind. Got None right
at all. My wife got none.

381
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,950
Oh my God. Yeah,

382
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,910
she was amazed. So this is the thing.
So, so, so the question then becomes so,

383
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,220
so wow.

384
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,250
A lot of people really do have this
problem so that a lot of people who may be

385
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:33,831
leading lives of embarrassment and partial
disability and secrecy and shame and

386
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,410
I, uh,

387
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:41,670
I evolved all sorts of coping
mechanisms with a dyslexia,

388
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,100
um, many of which are
now taught, you know, to

389
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,870
people who have other problems. But I,

390
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,260
but there unfortunately
no real answers to,

391
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,290
uh, to coping with.

392
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,680
Well, you have some
charm it up high. I mean,

393
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,210
um, you're,

394
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,230
you're not going to lessen the deficit
by having a good attitude or trying

395
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:12,060
harder or whatever it is what it is.

396
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,243
[inaudible]

397
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,650
I want to thank the world science festival
to Brian Green and Tracy de who run

398
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:27,520
the thing. It comes every spring in New
York City. Lots of scientists. And boy,

399
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,040
does it come, it comes
like a comment. Yes.

400
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,850
And we over at Radiolab or the
Jed was there this year. He did a,

401
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,900
he did animals. Animals, yes. And
uh, like we haven't done that enough.

402
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,250
Well like, like we don't know faces
when it's the world science festival.

403
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:46,030
So will you say hello to the world? We
say thank you to science. Thank you.

404
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,043
Two festivals.

405
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,560
We know how to body with the best of
them and thank you to you for listening.

406
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,750
Thank you. I'm Jen. I'm Robert. See Ya.
