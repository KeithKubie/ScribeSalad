00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:03.398
(beeping)

00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:09.010
(uptempo electronic music)

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.090
- So, what I'd like to
tell you about today

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.350
is our efforts to get a high temporal

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.210
and spatial resolution of
changes in membranes in the cell,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.460
and what we're doing is
using electron microscopy

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.820
with a technique that's
called flash and freeze.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.630
And the key to this technique

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.080
is to be able to synchronize the cell

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.470
at a particular time
and then look at events

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.630
that occur afterward.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.000
And so, we've come up with two methods

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.120
for synchronizing cellular activity.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.080
The first is light stimulation

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.050
and the second is electrical stimulation,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.610
so I'll tell you about both of those.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.570
So, the way a synapse works is shown here,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.570
I think a lot of you
are familiar with that.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.000
This is the vision of Barnard Katz

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.060
and here's the cell body of the neuron

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.020
and an action potential
travels down this axon

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.680
and then invades the bouton,
the presynaptic bouton.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.350
And what that does is open
voltage-gated calcium channels

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.920
and calcium channels then open up

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.150
and cause the fusion of synaptic vesicles

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.730
filled with neurotransmitter

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.620
to fuse with the plasma membrane

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.330
and release those
molecules onto ligand-gated

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.440
ion channels on the postsynaptic surface.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.330
And so, at the time this was not believed.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.810
It was thought that
these synaptic vesicles

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.830
that were observed did in
fact contain neurotransmitter

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.530
but they were lower,
just storage organelles

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.540
for neurotransmitter.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.460
And the reason was that no
one had seen these vesicles

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.630
actually fused with the plasma
membrane after a stimulus.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.870
And so, it wasn't clear

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.460
that this part of the
hypothesis was correct.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.510
And it took some 23 years
before that was proven

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.560
and that was proven by the work of

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.520
John Heuser and Tom Reese

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.030
because they built a
really cool instrument

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.810
called the freeze slammer

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.210
and that's what's shown here.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.180
So they have a piece of
the frog pectoral muscle

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.370
which is really thin and
can freeze very rapidly.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.150
And then they have nerves
that are still attached

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.040
and wrapped around stimulating wires

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680
and these stimulating wires,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.740
this whole apparatus was
attached here to this rod

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.470
and the stimulating wires went up

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.720
and could be connected to a circuit.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.110
And so, what they could do
then was release this solenoid

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.950
and then as the bar was
following through space

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.910
they would calculate five milliseconds

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.570
before it hit a copper block,
cooled the four Kelvin,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.250
stimulate the motor neurons

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.370
which would then cause an action potential

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.570
which would then cause the
release of neurotransmitter

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.190
at the neuromuscular junction.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.810
And then they could ask whether
the vesicles actually fused

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.550
and this is the image
they got out of that,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.410
absolutely spectacular.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.860
So here is a frog neuromuscular junction

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.330
which has not been stimulated.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.660
You can see that there are vesicles

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.520
that are docked at that surface.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.210
And stimulated and then frozen,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.560
five milliseconds later you
see these beautiful fusions

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.210
that are taking place that
of the synaptic vesicles

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.580
fusing with the plasma membrane

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.840
and releasing neurotransmitter.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.970
So, Katz's quantal and vesicle hypothesis

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.030
was thereby proved.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.010
But Tom and John also recognized

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.720
that there was another problem

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.860
and that is that there
was a limited number

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.960
of synaptic vesicles at a synapse.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.350
And so at a neuromuscular
junction maybe there's 300

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.620
and a mouse neuromuscular
junction can fire

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.900
at a hundred times a second.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.450
So, at these rates you can
see that the synaptic vesicles

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.930
could be rapidly consumed

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.230
and then you would exhaust the synapse

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.220
and would no longer be functional.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.140
And so they then were convinced
that these synaptic vesicles

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.150
had to be recycled locally.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.070
It would take a week for
vesicles to be transported

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.960
down the axon to replenish a synapse.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.750
So there had to be local recycling.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.070
And so, what they did was they used their

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.210
freeze slammer once again

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.610
and now instead of freezing

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.670
five milliseconds after stimulation

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.380
would freeze one second
and then two seconds

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.710
and 10 seconds, 15 seconds to 30 seconds,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.640
and then look at each of those stages

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.860
and see whether they can see
membrane being taken back in.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.150
Now this is a freeze fracture,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.590
so what they've done is
they've taken their ice block

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.210
and they've with a wedge on the side,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.360
and that ice block will break
where the weak parts are.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.070
So where are the weak parts?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.780
It's where the lipid bilayers are.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.250
So there's no covalent bonds
between those lipid bilayers,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.420
everything else is
frozen and stuck together

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.010
so when they strike the block

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.960
it splits at the lipid bilayer,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.030
they can coat that with an
electron dense material,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.260
take those replicas and put
them in the electron microscope.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.090
And this is what they saw.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.440
At zero milliseconds, that
is an unstimulated synapse,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.700
you could see these little buttons

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.310
and those are likely
to be calcium channels.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.450
At five milliseconds after stimulation

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.290
they could see these indentations

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.770
and these are vesicles

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.630
that are on the other
side of the screen, right?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.400
We're looking at the face of the synapse.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.610
Those are now fusing with the membrane

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.900
and creating these dimples.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.980
Then they looked at one second

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.380
and, you know, for three
seconds, 10 seconds and so on,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.980
and they saw nothing.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.750
And it wasn't until 30
seconds that they began to see

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.480
these proteins would come
together and form clusters

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.490
and then they would be pulled inside,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.860
So you see these little dips,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.730
this one in particular is beautiful

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.470
because you can see the
neck where it broke off

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.710
because of course you can't
break into that concave surface.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.170
When they looked at cross-sections

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.100
they saw that these invaginations

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.300
were coated with this
electron dense material

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.340
and it had been seen before.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.270
This is clathrin.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.090
And so, they now were able to say that

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.810
at synapses after stimulation

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.490
that vesicles or membranes from

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.340
that are lost to the plasma
membrane are recycled

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.620
via this clathrin-mediated process

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.150
and the process is rather slow,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.060
it takes about 30 seconds.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.520
So, we have revisited those experiments

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.710
and I think we see another
process that's occurring.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.250
We call this ultra-fast endocytosis

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.800
and in this case we see
that the membrane is

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.790
removed from the surface
between 50 to 300 milliseconds

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.810
in a mouse neuron.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.600
This then generates a synaptic
endosome within one second,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.200
these are budded by clathrin
into mature synaptic vesicles

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.510
that can be refilled and
reused in five seconds.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.830
So the process that we're
observing is much faster

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.710
than what had been observed
by Heuser and Reese.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.380
When we started these experiments

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.400
we needed the way to
replicate the freeze slammer,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.950
we needed to freeze the
samples as quickly as possible

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.350
and it needed to be deep

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.810
because the first organism

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.660
that we did this in was C. elegans

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.710
and so, it's 80 to 100 microns thick,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.430
so we needed to have a frozen
sample all the way through.

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:11.170
The way that a high-pressure freezer works

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.620
it goes from 1,000 to 2,000
atmospheres in 15 milliseconds.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.270
So the water molecules
are vibrating around

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.550
but under high pressure
they become sluggish.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.790
And if you can drop the
temperature fast enough

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.340
then you don't have
time for those molecules

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.450
to reorder themselves and
then generate ice crystals.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.790
Ice crystals will shred your cells

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.080
so there will be no morphology left.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.600
And so, by doing this we're
able to freeze the sample

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.400
without any distortions from ice crystals.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.460
So we're doing this like,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.010
the experiments I'm gonna show you here

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.380
are not done in C.
Elegans, in the nematode.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.720
They're done in cultured
hippocampal neurons.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.650
And so, now what we need to do

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.970
is we have these in the
high pressure chamber

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.590
but we need some way to
initiate a depolarization

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.130
that will then initiate
that action potential,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.110
and then stimulate this synapse

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.080
so that we can look for vesicle fusions

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.890
and endocytosis at that synapse.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.120
And the way we're doing that
is with channelrhodopsin.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.210
So, channelrhodopsin is a
light-activated ion channel.

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.930
When you stimulate it
with 470 nanometer light

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.740
you can then open that channel

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.040
and sodium will flow into that neuron,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.170
and then cause an action potential.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.030
So we now have a way to
stimulate an action potential

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.040
in a neuron that's deep inside
this high-pressure chamber.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.970
So, let me just show you
that this actually works.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.930
Here is a neuron that's
expressing channelrhodopsin.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.470
This is an on cell configuration.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.730
We stimulate with light and
here is the light stimulus,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.280
it's 10 milliseconds long

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.610
and you can see these
beautiful action potentials

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.760
that are occurring during
the light stimulus.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.060
Usually there's just one

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.890
but in this case we see that there are two

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.950
action potentials occurring.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.220
We can then move that pipette
to a postsynaptic neuron

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.300
that is not expressing channelrhodopsin

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.940
so it will not be stimulated by light

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.510
but it will receive
inputs from this neuron.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.630
So we flashed the light that
now fires an action potential

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.510
and what we can see are
these postsynaptic currents.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.970
These are synaptic
currents, they're beautiful

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.210
and you can see in this case

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.550
we also had two action potentials

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.450
that were leading to this
postsynaptic current.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.900
So then we now have a neuron

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.040
that's expressing channelrhodopsin

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.840
in our high pressure chamber

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.920
but we need to get a light
path into that chamber.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.550
And so, we modified the like

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.450
high-pressure freezer at the time.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.250
And so, it is composed
of this structure here.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.960
So here's the specimen cup,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.380
that's where our neurons are going to go

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.570
and it's held in place by a bayonet.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.110
And this bayonet will
then fire down a rail

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.170
into the high-pressure chamber,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.490
the chamber will close and then it fires

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.160
and freezes the sample.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.170
So what we did was we,

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.720
here's this little cup
that holds the neurons.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.980
There's a black diamond anvil here

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.350
and the pressure comes here

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.710
and slams out against
that black diamond anvil

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.470
and creates 2,000 atmospheres.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.870
Liquid nitrogen flows
around on either side

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.220
to freeze this sample.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.160
So what we did was we
replaced that sapphire,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.130
the black anvil with a sapphire anvil.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.210
We then drilled out that mounting screw

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.790
and we drilled out the bayonet

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.290
so that we had an LED right at this point

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.290
and now we have a light
path to the sample.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.040
So, the experiment now is quite simple.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.960
We're going to provide a 10
millisecond light stimulus

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.620
and then we'll freeze at 15 milliseconds,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.530
30 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.620
100 milliseconds, 300
milliseconds, et cetera.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.880
And these were the first images we got

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.740
and we were extremely excited by these

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.390
because they're just beautiful.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.280
So, if we freeze 15 milliseconds
after the stimulation

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.150
we see vesicles fusing
with the plasma membrane.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.330
It's just, isn't that beautiful?

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.940
It's collapsing into the
membrane here at 30 milliseconds

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.120
almost fully collapsed into the membrane.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.200
So we can capture those very rapid events

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.220
caused by an action potential
causing vesicles to fuse.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.380
So, what about recycling, right?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.170
Remember it took 30 seconds

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.830
in the Heuser and Reese experiments

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.880
and we came up, we saw
he had a huge surprise

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.650
when we saw that recycling
of the membrane was occurring

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.210
on the scale of 100 milliseconds.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.550
Here's the active zone,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.530
that's where vesicles are fusing.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.020
And at the lateral edge at 50 milliseconds

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.000
you can already see this
invagination that's building.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.850
At 100 milliseconds it's much deeper

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.240
and this one you can actually see

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.140
some electron dense material.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.330
The membrane is being cut from the surface

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.790
so that is the act of endocytosis.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.770
And then at 300 milliseconds you can see

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.980
that the vesicle's been completely cleaved

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.540
from the membrane.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.880
So, we can now calculate the time

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.050
during which endocytosis is taking place

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.590
and that is seen by quantifying

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.030
the number of each of
these structures we see.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.270
We see the first pits at 30 milliseconds

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.690
then we see large vesicles
form at 50 milliseconds.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.610
We see the last pits
forming at 300 milliseconds.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.210
And so, that determines the
first presence of vesicles

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.510
and the last presence of
the appearance of vesicles,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.500
so endocytosis is taking place

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.390
between 50 to 300 milliseconds.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.730
This is a tomogram and it's
really an important image,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.120
so I want to spend a minute on it.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.850
What we've done here is done a tilt series

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.930
and reconstructed the electron densities

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.220
inside that thick section.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.600
And we have now drawn this membrane,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.030
the presynaptic membrane
slightly transparent.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.610
You can see the postsynaptic density

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.720
which is shown in red
through that membrane

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.940
and so that defines where

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.030
the synaptic vesicles are being released

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.700
and where the receptors
are on the other side.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.610
In this synapse you can see that there are

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.550
three synaptic vesicles
fusing at this point

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.550
in this active zone.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.090
Look here already you can
see these invaginations

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.840
that are taking place at the
lateral edge of the synapse.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.330
This means that the membrane
that is in the synaptic vesicle

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.150
and is fusing is not the same membrane

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.510
that is being taken up by
ultra-fast endocytosis.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.110
Here at 100 milliseconds

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:27.330
the fusions have fully
collapsed into the membrane.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.220
Here's one of those shallow invaginations

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.700
and here's one that's being
cleaved from the surface,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.220
the active endocytosis.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.750
We're able to then follow

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.250
what happens to this membrane later

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.830
and what you can see is that it is

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.730
transported to the back of the synapse

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.160
and it makes these large
synaptic endosomes shown here.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.160
And then this synaptic
endosome is then cut apart

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.940
by clathrin into individual
synaptic vesicles.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.970
And here is a 3D view of that

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.860
and if we just focus on one of these buds,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.590
when you just look at
densities you can see

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.340
that in fact there's a
clathrin geodesic dome

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.600
or buckyball forming around
one of these vesicles.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.920
That was great.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.420
We were able to see this new process

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.240
called ultra-fast endocytosis

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.450
but it came under a lot of criticism,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.220
and I think if valid if
you're trying to make

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.550
a major claim here,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.430
one of our reviewers said

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.000
that there are 40 years of experiments

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.270
that suggest that
clathrin-mediated endocytosis

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.610
is the mechanism by which
synaptic vesicles are recycled.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.340
And there's probably 10,000 papers

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.230
and now there's one paper that says

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.970
it's not the way it works.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.260
One of the major thing
people were focusing on

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.990
is that we are seeing four
synaptic vesicle equivalents

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.520
being endocytosed.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.720
And so, why and with the dogma is that

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.740
there's only one vesicle fusing.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.430
There are people who think
that that's not true,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.870
that there are multi vesicular release

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.340
but nevertheless, that's
how people imagine

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.520
the synapse works.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.390
And they all hinged on the fact that

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.030
we were using channelrhodopsin

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.830
instead of electrical stimulation

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.350
which is what everybody else uses.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.960
And I actually have to thank my critics

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.190
because they were relentless

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.460
but they're well-meaning
because all of these criticisms

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.190
were told to my face at meetings.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.030
And they said you got to figure this out.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.640
And so, the ideas were that
there's a excess depolarization

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.830
by channelrhodopsin, that's possible.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.110
There was increased membrane
fluidity by channelrhodopsin

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.390
but also possible.

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:41.390
And that there was calcium
influx by channelrhodopsin

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.300
as well and that was leading
to these greater responses

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.840
in this unusual form of endocytosis.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.880
So the solution is obvious.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.160
Come up with a way to stimulate
these samples electrically

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.420
and we call this zap and freeze.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.160
So and I have to give credit
to my senior research fellow

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.050
who came up with this, Wayne Davis.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.760
He said this is what your
middle plate looks like

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.830
in the center of that
high-pressure chamber.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.280
And the sample is held right here.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.910
And so, the light comes in
and stimulates that sample

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.460
and causes the neurons to
fire action potentials.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.290
So he said why don't you
just move the sample holder,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.590
the sample cup to this lateral position.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.820
Add stimulating leads,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.570
add capacitors that will carry a charge

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.090
and then add a light-activated switch,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.650
so that when you now take this,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.730
insert it into the high-pressure chamber,

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.840
the light will stimulate that switch

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.840
and then cause a depolarization
of the cells in your sample

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.440
and cause action potentials.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.870
And so, this is what we did,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.730
this is what this thing looks like.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.410
It is a independent little circuit board

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.540
that fits deep into the
high pressure chamber.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.310
You can see the capacitors here

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.410
and here is where our specimens go

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.310
and then the leads are on either side.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.620
And so, these are the images,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.130
the first images that
came from this device.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.300
Here is an unstimulated sample

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.330
and then here is a stimulated sample.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.060
This is one action potential
at 1.2 million molar calcium

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.630
so this is physiological.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.140
And you can see that
there are three vesicles

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.080
that have fused with the membrane

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.060
and are collapsing into
the plasma membrane.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.450
So this is frozen after a single stimulus

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.600
and frozen 11 milliseconds
after the pulse.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.080
So what about ultra fast endocytosis?

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.490
Now what we've done is we stimulate once,

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.240
it's a one millisecond pulse

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.130
and then we freeze 100 milliseconds later.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.430
And now again here's the active zone,

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.400
postsynaptic densities marked here

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.320
and here is an invagination.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.980
Here is an invagination,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.710
Here is an invagination

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.470
and here's another invagination

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.300
at the lateral edge of the active zone

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.120
once again showing that
ultra-fast endocytosis

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.830
takes place even with
electrical stimulation.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.070
Here's the quantitation of that.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.650
Here's an unstimulated sample

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.550
and here is a sample stimulated
100 milliseconds earlier

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.960
and we see the presence
of these endocytic pits

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.760
and endocytic vesicles.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.710
So it looks like ultra-fast
endocytosis takes place

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.170
along with, well, we'll see when

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.630
a clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.110
but we see these very fast responses

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.420
that disagree with what
people have been seeing

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.970
in hippocampal neurons.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.990
The issue is why do our results differ

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.203
from those who have been imaging

00:18:32.203 --> 00:18:35.070
hippocampal neurons in the past?

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.520
And I think we know the answer now

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280
and the answer is temperature.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.700
So we did all of our
experiments at either 34 degrees

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.580
because that's where
electrophysiologists like to record.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.180
Or 37 degrees which is
physiological for the mouse.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.220
And when we do that we see these large

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.170
endocytic vesicles forming

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.770
and we see ultra-fast endocytosis.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.760
When Shigeki did his
experiments at 22 degrees,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.260
you now see that clathrin-mediated
endocytosis takes over.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.180
So you can see a clathrin coat there,

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.440
here's an enlargement of
that beautiful clathrin coat.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.720
What we think is going on is at 34 degrees

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.730
we see normal, we see
ultra-fast endocytosis

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.620
and then at 22 degrees we
see clathrin-coated pits

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.500
and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.260
In conclusion, we think that normally

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.020
we have ultra-fast endocytosis

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.320
removing membrane from the
surface after action potentials.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.890
And then in the absence
of ultra-fast endocytosis

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.860
there's an emergency backup system

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.150
which is clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.270
And with that I would just like to thank

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.150
the people who did the work.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.100
All the electron microscopy
was done by Shigeki Watanabe

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.640
who has his own lab now at Johns Hopkins.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.250
Instrumentation was from Wayne Davis.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.370
I'd really like to thank
the people at Leica

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.030
particularly Cveta Tomova.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.680
They provided us with every
one of their instruments

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.060
every summer at MBL and they would say

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.550
do whatever you want to it.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.430
We just need to take a picture of it

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.780
at the end of this summer.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.650
And so I have no financial
interest in Leica.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.070
We turned over all
intellectual property to Leica

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.030
and so these things are
now available commercially

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.863
and you can use them.

00:20:15.863 --> 00:20:19.150
And then finally my host in
Berlin, Christian Rosenmund

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.887
and thank you for listening.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.120
(audience applauding)

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.703
