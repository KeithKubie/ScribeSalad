00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:02.022
- [Instructor] So let's
review our knowledge

00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:05.022
of what it means to be an ideal gas.

00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:10.132
What key assumptions do we
make about an ideal gas?

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:11.851
Well, the first assumption is

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.518
no intermolecular interactions,

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.496
and what do we mean by that?

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:25.769
Well, an example of an
intermolecular interactions

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.142
are something like, say, a hydrogen bond.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:32.192
Well, let's say that you
have two water molecules,

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:35.423
two neighboring water
molecules, and that is...

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:38.721
So you have an oxygen with two hydrogens.

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:42.383
We know that the oxygen
end of a water molecule...

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:43.901
And this is the gas form,

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:45.817
so we're talking about water vapor here.

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:47.085
So we know that the oxygen

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:48.848
has a partially negative charge,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.448
and that the hydrogen end
has partially positive charge

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:53.759
and these are attracted to each other.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.014
These are our famous hydrogen bonds.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.468
So that is an intermolecular interaction.

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:00.842
We can think about dipole-dipole forces,

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:03.457
which is similar because of
the polarity of the molecules.

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:05.872
We can think about van der Waals forces.

00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:07.056
These various molecular interactions

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:09.062
where just random chance one side gets

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:11.392
a temporary polarity and might be

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:13.277
attracted or repulsed from the other side

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.322
of a neighboring molecule.

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.124
For ideal gases, and for the

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:19.091
application of the ideal gas law,

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:22.121
we assume that there are no
intermolecular interactions

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.536
or, if there are, that it's very....

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:26.217
We assume an ideal gas has none of them.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:27.610
And, in real gases, in order to

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.962
assume they're like an ideal gas,

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.355
we assume this is very limited

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.221
or that we can assume
they're not happening.

00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:35.596
The second key assumption is that

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:39.491
the volume of the gas itself,
the molecules of the gas,

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:43.131
is negligible relative to
the volume of the container.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.298
So, gas molecule volume is negligible.

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:00.885
Now, it turns out there are no gases

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:03.013
that are absolutely true ideal gases.

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:05.797
Obviously, all gases,
their actual molecules,

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:09.497
do take up some volume and there will be

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.651
some type of intermolecular interactions

00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:15.138
in terms of even van der Waals
forces and whatever else.

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:17.917
But it turns out, under most conditions

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:20.166
that we're dealing with in a lot of gases,

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.883
that these are reasonable assumptions.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:22.946
Or at least many conditions

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:24.992
these are reasonable assumptions.

00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:28.959
In particular, these are reasonable....

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.844
So, this is reasonable for real gases....

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:35.927
Reasonable assumptions for real gases

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.916
at relatively high
temperatures and low pressures.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.730
And, obviously, that's going to depend

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.165
on which gas we're talking about how

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:59.173
high of a temperature you
need or how low of a pressure.

00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:00.442
Or another way of thinking about it is

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:04.085
these assumptions where gases
become less and less ideal

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:07.071
as you approach their condensation point.

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:07.904
So, if you start to really

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:09.893
lower the temperature or
increase the pressure,

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:13.159
you're more likely to go from
a gas form to liquid form.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.659
And, as you approach
that condensation point,

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.156
your gas is going to behave
less and less like an ideal gas.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:22.936
But, as we've seen in many
videos, if your gas is...

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.151
If you can make these assumptions,

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.060
then it's reasonable to
apply the ideal gas law.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.048
That the pressure times the
volume of your ideal gas

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:33.296
is going to be equal
to the number of moles

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.695
times the universal gas constant

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:39.933
times the temperature measured in Kelvin.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:43.865
Now, let's, first of all, think about why

00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:46.564
this is reasonable for most gases

00:03:46.564 --> 00:03:48.896
at relatively high
temperatures and low pressures.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:51.395
And then, we'll think about
where this breaks down

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.195
as we can approach the condensation point

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:54.751
where the temperature is lower

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:57.372
or where the pressure is a lot higher.

00:03:57.372 --> 00:04:00.358
So, let's do these three cases.

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:02.118
So, the first...

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.897
Let me do it in this color right here.

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:08.647
So, high temperature/low pressure.

00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:15.361
Then, I'll do a case of low temperature.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.459
And then, I'll do a case of high pressure.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.706
So, first, why is it reasonable

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.262
for real gases to behave this way at

00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:28.696
high temperatures and low pressures,

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:31.272
relatively high temperatures
and low pressures.

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:34.869
Well, let me draw a container here.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:36.341
This is the walls of my container.

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:39.532
Obviously, this container
will be in three dimensions.

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:40.966
But I will just draw...

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:42.643
Imagine it as a cross-section

00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.690
or a two-dimensional version of it.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.166
And let me draw the gas
molecules bouncing around.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:49.598
So, it's high temperature.

00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:52.957
So, these things are really
moving around quite fast.

00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:54.228
But it's low pressure,

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.235
so there's not a lot of bouncing,

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.429
especially with the
walls of the container.

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:01.355
So, this is a real gas.

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:04.465
Its molecules clearly take up some volume.

00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:06.595
And we'll assume that
they're in the real world.

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:09.381
There are some intermolecular interactions

00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:11.221
with neighboring molecules.

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.389
But, because it's such a high temperature,

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.294
these things are really
buzzing around super fast,

00:05:16.294 --> 00:05:19.691
you really don't have the
closeness and the time

00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:21.779
for these things to really interact.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.639
And the attractive
forces that you might get

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.300
from, say, hydrogen
bonding or whatever else,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.266
it really doesn't come into play.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.313
Likewise, since it's low pressure,

00:05:31.313 --> 00:05:32.785
there aren't a lot of collisions.

00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:35.321
It's reasonable to assume that the gas,

00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.431
that the volume is negligible

00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.789
relative to the volume of the container.

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.523
At least my brain visualizes
that there's just not...

00:05:43.523 --> 00:05:47.168
That the container's huge
relative to these gas molecules.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:50.312
And so, when we consider
how they might interact,

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:51.584
it's okay to not think about

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.469
their interactions with each other.

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.008
Either in terms of
colliding with each other

00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:58.630
and having this electrostatic repulsion

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.391
or they're gonna be so far away

00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:02.639
from each other most of the time

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.401
that some type of attractive force,

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.166
whether it's a hydrogen bond
or dipole-dipole interactions,

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.209
that it's not really gonna come into play.

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:12.868
So, this is why, in these conditions,

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:16.060
it's okay, it seems reasonable
that most real gases....

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.845
Let's assume the ideal gas conditions

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.631
and that we can apply the ideal gas law.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.676
Now let's go into more of the,

00:06:23.676 --> 00:06:25.640
I guess you could say, boundary cases.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.138
Let's assume you have low temperature.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.062
So, in a situation with
low temperature....

00:06:30.062 --> 00:06:33.133
I'll draw the same container.

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:35.467
We'll draw the same container.

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:38.130
And so, now low temperature.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.137
If you are an ideal gas,

00:06:40.137 --> 00:06:43.367
a truly, this kind of mythical, ideal gas,

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:46.769
Well, the temperature
shouldn't matter so much.

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:50.619
But now that we actually
have a low temperature,

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.419
now neighboring molecules,

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.752
especially things like attractive forces,

00:06:54.752 --> 00:06:56.348
are going to have a
chance to come and play.

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.806
They're not whizzing
by each other so fast.

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:01.835
And so, if attractive forces
are starting to come in play,

00:07:01.835 --> 00:07:04.456
do you think holding the volume constant

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.870
and holding the temperature constant

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.977
at this low temperature and holding

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.776
the number of molecules constant...

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:12.928
Do you think that a real
gas at a low temperature

00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:15.382
would have a lower pressure

00:07:15.382 --> 00:07:18.382
or higher pressure than a ideal gas?

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:20.908
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about it.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.258
So, it's low temperature.

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:23.893
And so, we're assuming...

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:28.060
So, hold T temperature,
volume, and number of moles

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:33.718
for ideal and real constant.

00:07:39.116 --> 00:07:42.283
So, if we were to compare the pressure

00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.937
of the real gas to the
pressure of the ideal gas,

00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:51.270
what do we think it will be?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.358
Well, the real gas, these things are

00:07:53.358 --> 00:07:56.103
gonna be kind of moseying past each other.

00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:57.536
So, they're gonna have more time to

00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:00.033
attract each other with
these hydrogen bonds

00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:01.631
and these van der Waals forces.

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:02.940
And so, they might spend more time

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.049
bumping into each other or
clumping closer to each other

00:08:06.049 --> 00:08:08.793
than they would be
bouncing into the walls.

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:11.819
So, you can imagine, if you
hold this low temperature

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:14.959
constant for the two different situations,

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.349
ideal versus real...

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:17.536
If you hold the volume constant,

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:18.929
if you hold the number
of molecules constant,

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.430
you would imagine that the
pressure for the real gas

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.383
is going to be lower than the
pressure for the ideal gas.

00:08:26.383 --> 00:08:28.433
And think about taking
the temperature so low

00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.338
that you, once again, get
to the condensation point.

00:08:31.338 --> 00:08:33.020
Then these things are
going to be moving so slow

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.764
that they're going to start
really attracting each other

00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:37.398
or they're gonna have a chance that

00:08:37.398 --> 00:08:40.481
attractive interaction can overpower,

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:46.762
I guess you could say, the
kinetic movement past each other

00:08:48.082 --> 00:08:49.964
due to the low temperature.

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:53.126
And so, you can think of
it, capture each other.

00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:54.800
And they could go to a liquid state.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.888
And this would happen
with water vapor molecules

00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:59.833
as you lower the
temperature closer to the,

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.002
I guess you could say, closer
to the condensation point

00:09:02.002 --> 00:09:03.886
or the boiling point, depending on

00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:06.262
which direction you are coming from.

00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:07.245
Now, let's go the other way.

00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:08.840
Let's think about high pressure.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.257
And let's hold...

00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:15.017
Let's compare what a real
gas would do to an ideal gas.

00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:16.375
But we're gonna compare volume.

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.035
So, we wanna compare
the volume of a real gas

00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:21.451
compared to the volume of an ideal gas.

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:23.368
And we're going to hold

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:29.426
temperature, pressure, and
number of moles constant.

00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:32.587
So, an ideal gas...

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:34.798
Let me draw my container again.

00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:37.298
An ideal gas, right over here,

00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:44.021
it shouldn't matter
that it's high pressure.

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.987
We're assuming these things here.

00:09:45.987 --> 00:09:48.651
So, these things are really
knocking into each other

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.484
very, very frequently.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:56.634
Not only into the containers,
but into each other.

00:09:56.634 --> 00:10:00.708
And, depending on how much you
view the volume negligible,

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:01.886
for an ideal gas, you think about

00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:05.119
more about the interactions
with the container.

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:07.246
But, if the pressure is high enough,

00:10:07.246 --> 00:10:10.563
well, then there's so
many collisions going on,

00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:14.152
that, if you really wanted to
hold the pressure constant,

00:10:14.152 --> 00:10:17.691
especially if this volume
becomes consequential

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:20.677
because there's so many
collisions going on,

00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:22.806
well, then if you wanna
hold the pressure constant

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:26.000
for the ideal gas versus the real gas,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.580
you would have to give
the real gas more space.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.687
You'd have to give it more space

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:32.761
because the volume of the molecules

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.441
are becoming consequential.

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.963
You're starting to challenge
assumption number two.

00:10:37.963 --> 00:10:39.440
So, to have the same pressure,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.708
in this case, the same high pressure,

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.529
your volume of the real
gas would have to be higher

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.901
than the volume of the ideal gas.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:49.129
So, once again, getting something

00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:50.521
really, really, really high pressure

00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:53.594
is another way to get closer
to that condensation point.

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:55.110
In general, if you lower the temperature,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.298
increase the pressure, you're getting

00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:58.262
closer and closer to the molecules

00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:00.919
interacting with each
other, capturing each other

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:03.403
so that you get to a liquid state.

00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:04.957
So, the whole takeaway here,

00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:07.740
ideal gas assumptions
and the ideal gas law

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.198
reasonable for most gases

00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:13.390
when we have a high
temperature/low pressure.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.941
But then, when we test those things,

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.619
low temperature/high pressure,

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.877
well, things might start
to break down a little bit.
