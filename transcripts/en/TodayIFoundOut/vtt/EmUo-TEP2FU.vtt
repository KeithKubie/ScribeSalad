00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.770
Green Coca-Cola... and 5 other everyday myths

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.770
1.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.830
Myth: Coca-Cola used to be green.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.960
In fact, the original formula for Coca-Cola
was also brown like it is today.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.070
The whole “Coca-Cola was green” myth started
around the same time Coca-Cola was commonly

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.440
sold in green bottles.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440
(QF 681)

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.440
2.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.720
Myth: Bulls are enraged by the color red.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.170
In fact, bulls are red-green colorblind.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.300
As illustrated by MythBusters, whether the
cape used in bullfighting is red or any other

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.530
color, the bull doesn’t react differently.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.570
What gets them to charge aggressively, outside
of embedding things like banderillas (barbed

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.850
“little flags”) in their necks, is actually
the movement of the cape, not the color.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.980
The myth that the color red enrages bulls
likely stems from matadors traditionally using

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.520
red capes going all the way back to the 18th
century in Spain.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
(QF 720)

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520
3.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.610
Myth: Women Don’t Have Adam’s Apples.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.690
In fact, Adam’s Apples on women aren’t
that terribly uncommon if you were to look

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.149
close enough to most women’s throats, though
“man sized” Adam’s Apples are somewhat

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.680
rare in these cases.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.460
The “Adam’s Apple” is really just an
enlarged larnyx which becomes big enough to

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.829
be visible in your neck.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.680
For those of you who don’t know, the larnyx’s
primary purpose is as a voice box.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700
It also has an alternative purpose in aiding
in the process of closing off the airways

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.549
in your throat when you swallow.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.979
This is why it generally seems to disappear
when you swallow, as it is being pulled upward

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.360
to aid in this process.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.600
Around puberty, both men and women’s voice
boxes get bigger.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.700
This in turn makes their voices deeper, with
men’s larynges growing more than women’s

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.330
and thus making for a deeper voice, typically.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.330
4.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.190
Myth: TNT and Dynamite are the same thing.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.619
In fact, TNT and dynamite are not the same
thing at all, contrary to what the Road Runner

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.130
and Wiley coyote would have you believe.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.659
Dynamite doesn’t actually contain TNT, but
rather is comprised of an absorbent mixture

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.960
soaked in nitroglycerin, which is extremely
sensitive to shock, unlike TNT; this is then

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.360
wrapped in paper and voila, dynamite.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.829
TNT or trinitrotuluene is a yellow chemical
compound that was originally used as a yellow

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.980
dye, but later was used as an explosive material
due to a variety of convenient features it

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.490
has, such as being very safe to transport.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.490
5.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.479
Myth: James Doohan was Scottish.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.989
In fact, Doohan was Canadian and a very successful
voice actor before his role in Star Trek.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.420
When he was auditioning for the role of the
ship’s engineer on Star Trek, he went over

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.300
various accents for Gene Roddenberry for the
character.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.540
After he finished, Roddenberry asked him which
he liked best and he responded: “Well, if

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.210
you want an engineer, he better be a Scotsman
because, in my experience, all the world’s

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.480
best engineers have been Scottish.”

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.269
Although he wasn’t Scottish, Doohan described
the character of Scotty as: “99% James Doohan

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.390
and 1% accent.”

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.690
“It was a natural.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.980
When I opened my mouth, there was Scotty.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.020
Scotty is the closest to Jimmy Doohan that
I’ve ever done.”

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.020
6.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.560
Myth: A “heart attack” and “cardiac
arrest” are the same thing.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.840
In fact, “Cardiac arrest” simply implies
the heart has stopped pumping blood.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.410
On the other hand, a heart attack is a lack
of blood flow to a specific area of the heart

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.849
caused by some blockage, spasm, or rupture
in your “pipes”.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.830
People who have a heart attack are significantly
more likely to survive than those who suffer

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.150
cardiac arrest.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.170
So while both are bad, cardiac arrest is worse,
unless you really didn’t like the person

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.780
whose heart stops, then it could be good.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:26.380
It’s all about looking on the bright side!
