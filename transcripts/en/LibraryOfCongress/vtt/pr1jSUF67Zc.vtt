00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:18.640
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.050
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.520
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm John Cole.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.830
Up until this week, I was the
director of the Center for the Book

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.890
in the Library of Congress, which
was created by Daniel Boorstin

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.750
when he was librarian
and way back in 1977.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.040
You're going to get a little
reminiscing here today

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920
at this session.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.300 position:56%
I am now the -- this is my first
week as officially the first Library

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600
of Congress official historian.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.980
So I'm pleased to make that change,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.590
because for many years I've been
very interested in all parts

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.580
of the Library of Congress
and its history.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.160 position:56%
And I also started my career in CRS.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.100
So we have a special
welcome to CRS and some

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.630
of his chiefs and assistant chiefs.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.910
One of the ironies in this -- and
I don't see -- Pam, are you here?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.190
The person who's taking
my place is the director

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.730
of the Center for the Book.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.570
Pam Jackson will be
in a little later.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.480
The Center for the Book was created
in 1977 to stimulate -- to have --

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.290
Daniel Boorstin felt the
Library should do more

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.590
for the general public

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.490
in stimulating interest
in books and reading.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
And there should be -- and it was a
private public partnership created

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.940
by publishers, funded
in the beginning

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.460
with eventually the Library of
Congress picking up the salaries

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.400
of the Center as it grew.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.870
So today we are a partnership

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.240
that includes both the new Young
Readers Center, which is located

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.090
in -- not new anymore, 2009,
located in the Jefferson Building.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.610 position:56%
The Poetry and Literature Office is
now part of the Center for the Book.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.990
The National Book Festival
is an area

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.250
where we've played a major
role since the beginning.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.300
But here at LC, one of the favorite
programs has been the one you're

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.600
attending today.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.910
And these are Books and
Beyond talks about new books

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.860 position:56%
that have been published based on --
and that have a special connection

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.400
with the Library of Congress.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.650
And often it's based
on our collections,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.090
and other times it's
based on projects.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.760
And we also make a point
of promoting the Library

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.460
of Congress's publications.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.620
And when we -- as the
publishing office comes

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.850
out with books, we provide a forum.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.050
All of these talks are filmed for
the Library of Congress website,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.760
and they started in 1996.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.930
And so we are approaching
400 of these talks,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.450
which really give you the
slice of American scholarship,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.610
and also books related to
institutions, not just the Library

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.420
of Congress, but primarily
the Library of Congress.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.380
And so it's been successful, and
we're pleased that you are here.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.370
The format will be a presentation,
in this case, by Steve Hess,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.770
then a quick opportunity
for questions and answers,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.120
and a book signing
here in this room.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.200
And the books are on sale for the
Library of Congress staff discount,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.560
which is ten percent off.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.210
As I said, the programs are
being filmed, and so we are --

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.960
please turn off all
things electronic.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.490
And we also will close the doors
since we have some noise outside.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.910
I want to just one
more story, actually,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.150
relating to my early history.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.380
When I got interested in the
history of the Library of Congress,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.990
I was able to move into a position

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.840
in the old Collection Development
Office, because I knew I needed

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.670
to learn about collections.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.860
And one of the very first curators
I met -- and this was in --

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.220
it would have been 1968,
actually, as I was making the move

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.610
into the Library as a whole,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.200
was a wonderful man named Milton
Kaplan [assumed spelling].

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.950 position:56%
And he was the curator, among other
things, a prince, a political prince

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.680
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.320
And in 1968, I met Milton, and
he had just published a book

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.580
with a fellow named "Stephen Hess",

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.220
and it was called "The
Ungentlemanly Art:

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.880
A History of American Political
Cartoons", which is another side

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.700
of Steve's many interests
related to politics.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.810
And it was eventually -- and
Steve doesn't remember this,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.480
but it was through
Milton that we met.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.770
But Steve also then later
produced a book called

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.590
"American Political Cartoons: The
Evolution of a National Identity".

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.500
And you came here for a book talk
with your coauthor, Sandy Northrop.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.240
And this is a very handy book now
in paperback, which I'm also going

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.960
to try to have you sign as part
of my Stephen Hess collection.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.110
[Laughter] Stephen is right --

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.200
currently is a senior fellow
emeritus in government studies,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.740
that's a wonderful moniker,
at the Brookings Institution.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.650
He began his career in
Washington as a young speechwriter

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.880
for President Dwight Eisenhower,
who members in this audience,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.580
most of you will remember, but
for some of the younger ones,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.640
was President from 1958 to 1961.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.110
Steve also served on the staff of
President Nixon and was an advisor

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.780
to Presidents Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.470
He also has been professor
of media and public studies

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.870
at George Washington University,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.000
and has published many
books on many topics.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.880
The most recent one that we talked
about a little bit was based

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.070
on the Moynihan Papers here
at the Library of Congress,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.290
and it was a biography
of Mr. Moynihan.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.020
As I mentioned that I
met Steve through books

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.580
and political cartoons,
another part of his world.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.450
And we're just so pleased
that he can be here today.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.940
The procedure is after
the questions and answers,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.240
we will have a book signing.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.450
And that needs to start by
1:00, so there will be time

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.290
for Q&amp;A, though, as well.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:53.430
Here is the book we're celebrating,
and here is the first sentence

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.650
in this 760-page revision
of his earlier book,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.020
"America's Political Dynasties
from Adams to Clinton".

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.370
Here is how he starts it actually
in the Acknowledgement page.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.980
"If there was to have been a Rip
Van Winkle moment in my life,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.840
it would have been in February
2015 when I awoke with the desire

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.970
to rewrite 'America's Political
Dynasties', a book I had put

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.540
to bed a half a century earlier."

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.990
I will let him take it from here.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.790
Please welcome Stephen Hess.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:36.840
[ Applause ]

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.720
I'll take my book off
so you don't --

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Okay.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.320
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Stumble [inaudible].

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: John, it is always

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.080
such a pleasure to
be introduced by you.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.380
[Laughs] It always reminds me

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.050
of President Eisenhower's
favorite cartoon

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.550
from the old Saturday Evening
Post, which showed a man stand

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.260
like this saying, "Our next speaker
needs all the introduction he

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.560
can get."

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.250
[Laughter] And even
talking about my monitor,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.120
I worry about introductions,
not with John, but otherwise.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.770
I was going to give a talk
in Athens some years ago,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:23.090
and thought maybe I had best get
my resume translated into Greek.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.920
So when I went over there
and gave it to the person

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.000
who would introduce me, who of
course, spoke perfect English,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.790
and he looked at what I gave
him, and he said, "Mr. Hess,

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.790
what is your title at Brookings?"

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.830 position:56%
And I said, "Senior fellow; senior."

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.810
He said, "Oh, yes, it's been
translated as 'Ancient gentleman'."

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:49.390
[Laughter] So I'm here today as
an ancient gentleman emeritus.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:57.940
And of course, I always wanted
to connect my books and so forth

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.680
to the Library, and
this one particularly

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.350
because all the research 50
years ago was done right here.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.670
But John mentioned my
connection with Milton Kaplan.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.380
So the Library actually went back
to the first book I ever wrote,

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.240 position:56%
which was called "Hats in the Ring."

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.280
In 1959, it had come
out by Random House.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.850
The problem was it
was a little thin.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:31.610
And I figured I'd better get some
cartoons to make it more weighty.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.050
And I came over here, and
met this very nice man

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.310 position:56%
who was very helpful, Milton Kaplan.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.890 position:56%
And in the course of the friendship,
he said, "Well, you know,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.910
there had never been a history
of American political cartoons."

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.380
And that started me in a
whole different career,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.160
which was great, great fun.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.820
Because my affection for
the Center for the Book,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.190
I thought I would talk a little
differently than I usually talk

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.120
in a bookstore about any
book in which I tell people,

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.740
particularly a summary of
everything that's in it

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.900
so they don't have
to buy it, you know?

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.130
I really want to talk a bit more
about the history of the book,

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.070
because in some ways
it's also my history.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.130
[ Silence ]

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:24.720
The book really goes back to 1957
right outside Frankfurt, Germany.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.820
And I am a private, drafted
into the United States Army.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.090
And it's peace time.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.330
And I go to the Library
to look for a book.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.850
Actually, I started to look for
a civil war book at the moment.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.300
And I find instead
this massive thing --

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.970
I weighed it later it was
seven-and-a-half pounds,

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.780
which is called "The
Biographical Directory

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.850
of the United States
Congress from 1774".

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.070
I knew a little -- I'd been
a political science major

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.640
at Johns Hopkins, I knew a
little about American history.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.280
I knew about the Adams, of course,
the Roosevelts, Tafts, Harrisons.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.350
But as I just started to
skim through this book,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.630 position:56%
there it was Muhlenberg, Muhlenberg,
Muhlenberg, Muhlenberg, Muhlenberg,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.870
Bayard [phonetic], Bayard, Bayard,
Bayard, Tucker, Tucker, Tucker,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.340
Tucker, Stockton, Stockton,
Stockton, Frelinghuysen,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.250
all of these names that really
meant very -- nothing to me.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.800
And yet, there I was looking at a
book that showed that generation

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.530
after generation, they had been
sent to the United States Congress.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.830
And I thought that was
rather interesting,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.230
particularly since our
Constitution has a clause

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.730
about nobility, clause of nobility.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.240
So the Army and peacetime Army
in the evenings when I wasn't

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.970
on guard duty or something, I
would go and start genealogies.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.190
And by the time, two years,
1958, when I was released

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:01.020
and my successor -- oh God, who was
it, what was it, he was a singer.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.320
What was his name?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.620
&gt;&gt; Elvis.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.920
&gt;&gt;

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Elvis Presley,
that was the fellow, he replaced me

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.210
as a matter of fact;
it's almost true.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.930
[Laughter] He didn't replace my
unit and his unit, he replaced --

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.870
but it was his unit
replaced by my unit.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:20.420
And there I came home with 300
genealogies, and the thought

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.890
that these were really
quite interesting.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.270
It was just something
that had not been

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.880
in American textbooks typically,

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.900
that someday I would
write a book about it.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.820
But I was an unemployed
private in August.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.390
And then a very strange
thing happened.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.570 position:56%
Several weeks later, I was the
president's number two speechwriter.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.850
Now, that's pretty hard to
do at 25, and it all happens

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.900
because my mentor, Johns Hopkins,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.810
and Malcolm Moos had
just been appointed,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.640
literally just been
appointed the speechwriter.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.370
And so the president and
-- brought me into this.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.440
Later when I had students of my
own, they'd say, "How do you get

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.470
to be the president's
speechwriter at 25?"

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.880
I said, "Be very nice
to your professor."

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.920
[Laughter] And I stayed there until
the end of the administration,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.950
January 20th, 1961, when I --
gosh I was unemployed again.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:23.520
And at that time the president,
about to be the ex-president got

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.920
into his old car, and was driven
back to his home in Gettysburg,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.410
where Gettysburg College gave him
some room to make his memoirs.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.950
Totally different; they didn't
have a law then that provided all

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.880
of the housing, all of the
offices, all of the staff,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.230
all of the security that we
now give a former president.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.010
He didn't have that at all.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.610
And the Republican National
Committee said to themselves,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.420
and then to me, "If we're going

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.640
to keep this fellow
visible politically,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.350
somebody has to answer his mail.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.680
Would you be interested?"

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.590
Otherwise, unemployed, "Sure."

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.030
The problem with that, of course,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.650
is we had no idea what
we were talking about.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.400
So we wrote a contract that
was based on each letter.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.210
And I think initially I was to
get three dollars for each letter.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.620
What we didn't realize
there wasn't just a letter,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.730
there was a deluge of letters.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.490
This was the most popular man
in the world, two-time president

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.760
of the United States,
five-star general.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.320
Every high school kid
wanted his opinion

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.150
on the national debate topic.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.740
Churches wanted something
for their bazaars.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.690
People wanted his autograph,
or his picture;

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.240
people just wanted to say hello.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.770
The answer to that is that after
two years, I had a lot of money.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.550
But I should [laughter] say also I
did learn something at the moment.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.610 position:56%
They were not just people who wanted
his pictures, there were a lot

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:55.280 position:56%
of people who were very sick people
who were making threats on his life.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.130 position:56%
And that's the first time I realized
that there were people out there

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.380
that we didn't all know very well.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.500
And I called the Secret Service
and they said, "Oh, yes."

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.920
And they sent me a three-ring
binder, and they said, you know,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.380
"If anybody's name
isn't in it, call us up,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.560
and we'll put the name in there."

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.640
Okay; I now have a wife, I have
children, and about three years

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.410
in which I can do what
I really want to do,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.230
and that is write a book called,
"America's Political Dynasties".

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.520
I'm not an academic of any sort.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.520
So the thing to do is to
go the Library of Congress

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.080
and take advantage of the
generosity of all of the librarians

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.140
and staff here, which
I really, really did,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.600
often in some collections
bringing in an ancient --

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.000
but first of reproducing
a machine that weighed --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.840
it was supposed to be portable,
well it weighed about 15 pounds.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.290
And they allowed me to put it
on some papers and reproduce

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:58.770
on some little sheet of
paper that it was chemically,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.810
turned sort of pink and folded
at the edges, but it was better

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.760
than writing it all in my hand.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.530
And the book came out.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:14.440
The book really was simply
meant to be the stories

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.380
of these remarkable
people, and of this fact,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.990
which was not terribly significant
in the sense that of those

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.880
that one could call a dynasty,
three generations, four generations

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.460
and so forth, they only
amounted to six percent of those

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.430
who had served -- of the
11,000 who had served

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.010
in the United States Congress.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.600
But they were interesting
stories, at any rate.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.220
Of course, what happened,
then, as I wrote the book,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.760
is that other family came along

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.970
that were very interesting
called the Kennedys,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.870
who were not there initially
when I started to write the book.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:59.050
But we made room for them, and
the book was very well-received

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.110
and a best-seller, and
it was something else.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.860
I mean, remember, I had somehow
become successful in a line --

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.320
an occupation which is
not really what I wanted

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.280
to be or where I wanted to be.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.410
I wanted to -- well I wanted I
guess if I had my choice to start

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.060
over to be a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:26.130
So in a funny way, this book,
bestseller, turned out to be my --

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:33.180
I had no PhD, my PhD, and which
I presented to Brookings myself.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.150
Brookings, at that
time, was a place --

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.430
most of hiring in the
United States had to do

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.070 position:56%
with people just circling each other

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.710
until they were sure they liked
each, other rather than filling

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.480
out applications and giving
speeches, and so forth.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.840
So indeed that's -- the book played
a rather unique personal part

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.390
of my history.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.490
Okay; we're now 50 years later.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:04.300
And I'm thinking, "Wouldn't
it be interesting to put

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.170
out a new edition, because 2016 is
going to be a big dynasties year."

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.930
It's going to be the
Bushs versus the Clintons.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.420
We all -- [inaudible] told us that.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.760
Brookings, my publishers thought
that was a very good idea.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.750
And I set out with the
idea that the book,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.310
which was basically
16 family stories --

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.680
it's interesting in the fact

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.520
as Matthews [inaudible] said you
could kill somebody with this book.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.780
But in fact, it's really 16 books.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.000
Each of these families could
be read quite individually.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.450
And so I would have to add two
families and a new introduction.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.620
The two families would be Bush
family, who were a dynasty,

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.110
but denied that they were
dynasty, and the Clinton family,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.090
who aren't a dynasty but were
desperate to be a dynasty,

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.970
and so we had to add those.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.440
And then each chapter would just --

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.990
at the end of the chapter
of the other 16 families --

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.920
now other 18, would be what had
happened in the last 50 years.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.070
So I thought it would
be very easy to write.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.060
Adams family, nothing happened.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.870
They hadn't been around for 150
years; until I started to research,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.070
and again, the Adams family maybe
hadn't been around for 50 years,

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.070
but historians had been
around for 50 years,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.460
and the Adams have a family
that filed every piece

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.240
of paper that they ever saw.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.870
And there was a whole new even
Adams history or histiography

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.780
by the time 50 years later,
I wanted to write this book

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.290
that had to be considered.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:54.380
Particularly, in my judgment,
Abigail, who is my favorite

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.540
of the group, who had
a far better strategic

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.290
and tactical sense
politically than her husband --

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.690 position:56%
the Constitution had been rewritten,
she should have been the president

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.120
of the United States; she
would have done a better job.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.420
At any rate, here's
what's in the a part --

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.800
a little sentence or two
about Abigail that wasn't

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.830
in the first edition, because
we didn't know about it

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.700
in the first edition, but
some historians since told us.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.460
Abigail was a very
good business woman.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.690
John had gone off to
France during the revolution

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.680
to represent us in Europe.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.620
And she was left there
with the family in a farm.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.720
Running the farm was
not going to be easy,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.690
because most of the men
had gone off to war,

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.790
and taxes were very
high to pay for the war.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.700
But she figured out a way to
divide it up in such a way

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.550
and have tending farmers,
and she did that.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.170
But that wasn't her whole
history as a business woman.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.760
John would send her a silk
scarf, silk handkerchief.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.350
You know, whenever he knew somebody
was coming across the Atlantic,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.730
he'd say, "Hey Lafayette, would
you bring my wife a silk scarf,"

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.030
[laughter] that sort of thing.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.520 position:56%
And she, of course, made a deal
with the merchant and would sell it.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.820
These were very valuable here.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.440 position:56%
We didn't have a lot of silk scarves
running around in Massachusetts.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.620
And then she said to --
wrote to her husband --

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:23.570
literally wrote to her
husband, "John, we're in retail.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.820
We should be in wholesale."

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.610
And he said, "Wholesale; how --

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.890
you know, all of our
ships are being captured.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.840
We can't do just -- " and she said
-- and she wrote him and said,

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.630
"John, if two of the
three ships are captured,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.200
we will still make a profit."

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.720
And so he says, "Sounds like
she knows her business."

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.170
So it became retail, at
which point, of course,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.430
she now could judge the stock,
"We have too many scarves.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.830
We need some more handkerchiefs,"
or whatever it is.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.080
And she was the one -- John
never had an employer other

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.260
than the United States government
for the rest of his life.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.020
She was the one who turned the
solvency of the Adams family.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.270
Now, that's a story here that
wasn't in the book 50 years ago.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.280
And it was like that.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.720
Fifty years ago, as I said, the
book was a good story to tell,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.650
a little bit of American
history that people didn't know.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.440
When I started to rewrite the book,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.580
and the book became
40% new material,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.760
I realized that I was
telling America's history

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.370
through the family.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.260
And families, all families,
your family, my family,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.010
are fascinating, mysterious.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.220
It was a great vehicle to tell
the history of the United States,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.930
which otherwise is usually told
by who's elected, and the people

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.470
that are elected are all males.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.610
A family can't be all males.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.030
So suddenly as I reread what
I had written 50 years ago,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.000
I could see I was telling stories
about the men, and the women,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.310 position:56%
the wives, the sons, the
daughters, the in-laws and so forth.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:08.100
There was very different way
to look at the United States.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.980
Also, it became different
-- as I went through it --

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.290
these families, how they became
dynasties is pretty obvious.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.800
You know, they had
ambition, they had energy,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.290
they wanted a good job,
whatever it might be.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.490
How they left politics was
all individual and different,

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.490
and I thought became, in some
way, a more interesting story.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.510
For example, the Adams's.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.270
[ Background Sounds ]

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.810
I'll get that later.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:45.230
The Adam's had several explanations
for their political demise.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.690 position:56%
John Adams might even have contended
that it was a planned exodus

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.250
to hire forms of cultural
expression.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:59.280
While serving as militia diplomat
in France, he wrote Abigail,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.320
"I must study politics and war
that my sons may have liberty

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.130 position:56%
to study mathematics and philosophy.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.000
My sons are to study mathematics
and philosophy in order

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.600
to give their children a right
to study painting, poetry,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.720
music, and architecture."

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.120
[Laughter] This theory
of politics to poetry

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.970
and three generations turns out
to be almost exactly the history

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.550
of the Adams family,
as a matter of fact.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:33.360 position:56%
But there are about more complicated
reasons for that, in the opinion

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.710
of Brooks Adams who would
be Henry Adams' brother.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.020
"A single family can stay adjusted
through three generations,"

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.790
and then added, "It is
now four full generations

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.520
since John Adams wrote the
Constitution of Massachusetts.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.210
It is a time that we perish.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.700
The world is tired of us."

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.060
Some people may say that
about the Bush's today, right,

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.620
that the world is tired of us.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.790
The family -- and other
problems, too,

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.800
Henry and Brooks didn't
have children,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.340 position:56%
although there were children around.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.940
So it helps -- and many of these
dynasties have huge numbers

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.200
of children as well.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.100
But really, you put it altogether.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.660
First of all, in the third
generation, Charles Francis Adams,

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.590
he married the daughter of
the richest man in Boston.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.010
And now the family was rich.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.550
And you always think in
politics that's good,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.450
but it also gave the
Adams's, like Henry Adams.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.190
a chance to do other things
other than be in politics.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.650
And it really did turn
the arch of the Adams's.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.470
But really, when you
read the whole chapter

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.800
and you see these characters
-- and they were rather rude,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.580
rather unpleasant people.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:54.260
And it's clear that
Americans no longer

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:03.680 position:56%
as we became a larger electric, not
just an electric for men with means,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.320
we wanted somebody other than these
rude, odd people, the Adams's.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.520
And so we turned from the
Adams's in a funny way.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.820
So that was good.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.670
But then if you take another
family, a very famous family,

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:25.090 position:56%
the Livingstons of the Revolutionary
War period, we were full of them.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:31.090 position:56%
And the exact opposite happened with
them, in which I write at the end,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.600
"The death of the dynasty
was self-inflicted.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.980
They were not tired by the people,
they tired from the people."

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.310
And it goes on and as historian
George [inaudible] put it,

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:48.120
"They did not wish to condescend to
the demands of popular politics."

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.900
So they went back to their
estates, at high-end New York.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.200
They married each other.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.620
They stopped -- they went
out of entrepreneurial work,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.140
and they became sort of
a Shinto type of family.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.840
So when the Adams's, their people
rejected them, the Livingstons,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.550
they rejected the people --

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.520
the chapter that goes
between the Livingstons

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.440
and the Adams's is
actually the Lees.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.820
And when you think about it,
the founders of our country,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.740
the two great families that
created the revolution,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.930
were the Adams's and the Lees.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:25.480
And the Adams's were such poor
farmers; they had nothing.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.270
You read the estate that the first
Henry Adams left, you know, a farm,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.980
a bed, you know, a
shed and so forth.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.070
Then, you read the
estate of the first Lees,

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.600
13,000 acres of rich tobacco
land, and so forth and so on.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.520
And the Lees -- after a while
Robert E. Lee, who had --

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.620
the greatest general, now by the
time you get to a fifth generation,

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.680
actually to his grandson,
whose name was "Fitzhugh Lee",

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.970
and he was the commandant
of the naval war college,

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:07.140
and you start to see that all of
the Lees are now in the military;

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.800
and their daughters are all
marrying admirals and generals.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.500
And this goes on generation
after generation.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.820
The heirs of Fitzhugh Lee
formed an unusual record

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.000
of occupational consistency.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.510
His two sons became
cavalry officers.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.720
[ Background Sounds ]

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.490
His three daughters married
army officers, all generals.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:36.290
And on and on it goes to that
right up to World War II.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:42.780 position:56%
So the Lees stayed as a dynasty, but
they became a political dynasty --

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.810
I mean, excuse me, they
became a military dynasty,

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.970
another type of public service,
which was very interesting.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.430 position:56%
So as you go through it, there
really are very interesting changes.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.000
The Breckenridges were
a passionate family.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.350
God, they could fight over anything
among themselves from Kentucky.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.650
They're the most famous --

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:05.870
John C. Brackenridge was vice
president of the United States.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.490 position:56%
And what happens to them, in effect,

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:14.430 position:56%
was after the civil war there wasn't
any room for them in Kentucky.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.350
It was poor by now,
if these ambitious

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.040
and very talented people
went -- left the state.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.600
And as they left the
state, they left their base.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.830
Many of these families, you
realize, are the Tafts of Ohio,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.330
that sort of thing; the
Frelinghuysen's of New Jersey.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.840
So usually, they had base, unless
there were too many of them

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.560 position:56%
and they would sort of overwhelm the
base so that you have the Kennedys

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.570
of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, Maryland,

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.420
New York, and that sort of thing.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.540
But typically, the
Breckenridges lost their bases

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.040
as they left Kentucky.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.650
But again, such fascinating things.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.650
The part I love -- this is a
little longer than I usually read,

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.690
but it's such a great story.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:04.840
It's John C. Breckenridge, after
leaving the vice presidency

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.010
of the United States and
joining the Confederacy,

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.430
becoming a distinguished
military service,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:17.250 position:56%
and then he becomes the final
secretary of war of the Confederacy.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.180
And then in the final days, he
tries to convince Jefferson Davis,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.770
you know, "Let's just end this.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.600
It's been a magnificent
epic, but it's got to stop.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.360
No more." And a Confederate
cabinet begins the flight

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.810
from Richmond in April 2, 1965.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.650
And for the secretary of war
it begins a two-month adventure

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.030
that reads like a Viking
romance point of reality.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.770
He takes the Southern
underground, the party goes as far

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.760
through Virginia and the Carolinas.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.280
When they get to Charlotte,
they get the news

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.020
of the assassination of Lincoln.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:31:00.820
He immediately sends
his entourage home.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.610
He doesn't want any
more killed for this.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:09.720
He continues on with his aide
and a black servant as they --

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.080
and then they pick
up a couple others

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.000
so that they're a party
of about eight.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.450
And this begins the Viking romance.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.710
"As they pass through the high
saw grass of the Everglades,

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.380
it struck Breckenridge that
if a man had his arms tied

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.540
and his feet exposed, he would be
killed by insects in two nights.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.700
By the time they were living on
the eggs of huge green turtles,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.620
which they had dug out of the sand.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.060
Once they had spotted
a union steamer,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.360
but they'd bluffed their way

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.260
out by pretending they
were hunters and wreckers.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.110 position:56%
Early on in the morning of June 6th,
the hungry Confederates met a party

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.080
of Seminole Indians, and
were given some [inaudible],

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.390
which he describes
as a thick pancake.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.540
They also scrounged a few
bits of fish that were left

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.570
over from the Indians' breakfast.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.070
At the sight of Del Ray, the
Confederate secretary of war

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:10.670
and his aides turned pirate and
took over a sloop at gunpoint.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.690
On June 8th, they left
the keys for Cuba.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:18.270
The waves on the high sea were
20 feet high, and their legs

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.440 position:56%
and arms became blistered and
swollen from the heat and saltwater.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.350
Finally, on June 11th, 1865,
the former vice president

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.500
of the United States arrived
75 miles east of Atlanta."

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.940
So America is just a great
history of great stories.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.630
I love them all.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.780
So you go on -- how
am I doing, John?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.480
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] some Q&amp;A.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: We're at Q&amp;As.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.510
Enough of this odds and
ends; serious to Q&amp;As.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:55.510
[ Applause ]

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.060
[ Silence ]

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.600
Well, I'll continue reading.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.510
[Laughter] Oh, my.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.350
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.120
Oh, yes, that, okay what do you do

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.560
with the Clintons who
aren't a dynasty?

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.530
Well, you start by saying
they'll become a dynasty

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:31.180 position:56%
when their granddaughter, Charlotte,
becomes 25, the youngest she can run

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.750
from Congress for the
House of Representatives,

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:39.090
and if she's elected, that
qualifies them not only as dynasty,

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:44.860
but especially since Chelsea is
married to a man whose both father

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.250
and mother had been in Congress.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.130
So she's going to be a part of what
I call a mixed-marriage dynasty.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.220
But basically, what I do is this --

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.270
and again, it was hard to write a
chapter on the Clintons quickly,

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.820
or the Bushs when so
much has been written.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:09.220 position:56%
I reinterpret them as a partnership;
not as a dynasty, as a partnership.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.860 position:56%
And when you use that, you start
going right back to Yale Law School,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.250
and it is such a clear pattern that
runs through their lives together.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.350
Partnerships are -- could
be complicated, successful,

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.320
have their problems, and so forth.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.700
But that is generally
how I take them.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.240
Of course, ending with Chelsea,
who I found quite fascinating.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.020
I mean, Chelsea has a
bachelors degree from Stanford,

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.270 position:56%
she has a masters degree from
Columbia, she has a PhD from Oxford,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.560
she's pretty powerful
and thoughty woman.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.930
So, you know, the question
is, "What does she do

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.240
with the rest of her life?"

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.030
And she has various options,
including, of course,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.740
the Clinton Foundation, which
is quite an amazing operation

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.110
as you start to look
into what it is.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:06.430
And partly, it's what happens --
just partly the Clinton history,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:11.690
to people who aren't rich, but
are in a world of the rich.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:12.990
How do you do it?

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.310
And their foundation was
not Bill Gates' foundation.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.560
It was something in which
they found projects,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.380
and then encouraged vast
rich people to fund them.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.740
So they're really all
over the world.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.160
But it's an interesting --
and it has her name on it.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.510
Maybe she goes that way,
maybe she goes into politics.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.810
That's it.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.260 position:56%
The Bush family was hard to write
about in the same way, I should add.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:44.370
I wrote a little about the
Founding Father, the congressman

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.630
because he's not -- a senator,
he's not as well known.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.700
But mostly, it looked at
the Bush group going back

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.200
through two presidents
and another governor.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.700
What was unusual about them was

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.970
that they all lost elections
before they won elections.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.760
The persistence of them
was really quite amazing.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.640
And if you're rich, as they were,
it's easy enough to turn around

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.910
and go into something else, dig
another oil well, or what have you,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.530
but no, they kept at it
right up to, of course,

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.150
the point where I was writing.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:23.150 position:56%
And then I wrote a little -- this
sort of riddle, of the fact that all

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.810
of these families, who were the
presidential families, who had one

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.650
or two, but clearly
wanted more, lost.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:35.800
And that was -- we were going
to see how that worked out.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.820
So that's how I dealt
with those two families.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.350
There was another -- yes.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:50.310
&gt;&gt; So would you say that a de facto
nobility has emerged in the US?

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.610
&gt;&gt; John Cole: [Inaudible] repeat --

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Yes;
has a nobility risen?

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.390
If it is, it's a self-rising
nobility because, of course,

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.010
all these people who we are talking

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.260
about it could be defeated
at the next election.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:10.060 position:56%
2014 half a dozen big names from the
Senate and the House were defeated.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.280
So they live on that edge.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.290
But nevertheless, the name
is worth something, branded,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.680
clearly, and for other reasons.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.100
What I generally said when
we got to the Roosevelts,

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.070
or at least the Franklins --
the Delano Roosevelt family,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:32.740
he had two sons who
chose to continue

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.850
in politics, James and Franklin.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.360
Both of them were elected
from relatively safe seats,

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.050
one in California,
and one in New York.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:50.010
Each then chose to go for a higher
office, and each was defeated.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:55.290
So in general, my rule of thumb was
that a good name was worth one step

00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.270
up the ladder, and then
you were on your own.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:04.720
And certainly, that was true
of the Roosevelt family.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.340
So that would be my more or
less answer to your question.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.670
[ Silence ]

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.940
By the way, I'll add in one
more, a normative answer,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.780
because I've now spend a lot of
time going through a lot of names

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.280
that are connected to each other.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.450
I think by and large, they've
given us above-average service.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.910
I mean, I'm not going to make
claims for the Longs [phonetic]

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.590 position:56%
of Louisiana or something like that.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:33.510
But overall, I think we've been
well-enough served by them.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.220
[ Silence ]

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.520
Yes.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.660
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like you
didn't do a statistical survey,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:45.530
but do you have a sense of whether
the United States is trending

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.830
a direction?

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:51.120
You said -- I think you
talked about a [inaudible].

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: No;
I haven't done that.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.290
Of course, when I wrote --
started to write the second book,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.700
the big question was were
we having government legacy?

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:07.060
And clearly, we've already
figured out that we're not.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.110
And I think that's correct.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:17.090
No; there was no special
purpose for me to do it.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.390
It wasn't political [inaudible].

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:24.090
I didn't break it into
judgments, but I counted them all.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:28.990
And to me -- and you
compare them all,

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.100
they tended all to be Protestants.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.840
With the exception of the Kennedys
and one branch of the Bushes,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.950
they tended to be rich or at
least rich when they ended,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.290
if not rich when they started.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:47.920
They did move -- although as
I say, they started on the --

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.520
obviously on the East Coast.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.100
They did continue to move west.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.920
They were ambitious in that sense.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.250
The Harrisons, for instance,
were a major Virginia family

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.680
when they started, and went
to Indiana, went to Illinois,

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.450
and the last one was in Wyoming.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.980
So there was a great -- they
cover the whole country now.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:12.670
They're not particularly an
East Coast pattern anymore.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:16.130 position:56%
So I did look at things in that way.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.850
They did, as I mentioned, with the
third generation of the Adams's,

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.370 position:56%
is one of the big ways that they
got their money was they married it.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.160
They had some very
advantageous marriages.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.340
The Frelinghuysen there's one
still in Congress right now,

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:39.370
who is the great, great, great,
great, great, great grandson

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.660
of the person who first
stepped foot on the land

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.870
in New Jersey that
he now represents.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.180
And it's been -- well and
they've not been a particularly

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.610 position:56%
distinguished family in that regard,

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.000
but they serve their
constituents at least.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.910
And then you look at
who they married.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.780
Well, generation marries
a Ballantine.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.130
Who's Ballantine; well, Ballantine
ale, Ballantine brew, not bad.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:12.250
The next generation, his daughter
-- or son marries a Havemeyer.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.550
That's the sugar trust.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.950
That's much bigger than Ballantine.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.690
And the next generation marries
somebody named "Procter",

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.520
who just happens to be the
Procter of Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.390
So the money keeps coming in.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:32.540
By the way, the one -- the son now,
his name is "Rodney", his father,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.810
Peter, was in Congress when
I wrote the book initially,

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:40.400
I knew him modestly because we were
both part of a tiny group of people

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.350
who were called, you know,
"Liberal Republicans" at the time.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.440
And he never spoke to
me again after that.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.330
This was [inaudible],
people did not talk

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.430
about where the money came from.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.910
He was very upset by that.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.830
But that was another factor that
you'll look at in judging them,

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:04.270
as they say, and having a lot
of children was one as well.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.420
So that's the sort
of things I tracked,

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:16.190
rather than how many existed at
each period of American history.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.550
&gt;&gt; Did you describe the Kennedys;

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.420
and then also the Dingles
[phonetic]?

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: I don't
include the Dingles.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.050
The Dingles would now
be father, son,

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.620 position:56%
and daughter and wife, and so forth.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.960
The Kennedys I certainly
do describe.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.660
The Kennedys would have been
the one family if I had stuck

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.230
to my original scheme of just
saying, "Okay; what have you done

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.790
in the last 50 years,"
there would be a lot.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:50.340 position:56%
Since then there have been -- "them"
being, of course John Kennedy,

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.570
Robert Kennedy, Ted Kennedy.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:57.570
There had been additionally
Ted's son from Rhode Island.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:04.900
But also then, John F.
Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy,

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.300
and then John F. Kennedy,
the son of John F. Kennedy.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.910
So second and third so
that, indeed, the last --

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.590
so there are now six would
have been in Congress.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.960
And this is quite remarkable
since the first one, Jack Kennedy,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.540
only got into Congress in 1947.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.620
And again, there wouldn't be
a fifth and a sixth if Robert

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.910
and Ethel hadn't had 11 children.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.830
So it all matches that way.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:37.600
But again, part of that which is
fun if you actually get the book,

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:43.520 position:56%
is the first volume ended not with
the Clintons, but with the Kennedys.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.500
So what I did -- wherever it is --

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.990
[ Silence ]

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.510
Is I took the last page --

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.050
[ Silence ]

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.540
Of the first edition.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:01.010
And the last page of the
first edition is right there.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:08.850 position:56%
And it says things like -- it goes
on so it features Robert F. Kennedy.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:13.200
And then there's a line across, and
it says, "Robert Kennedy was killed

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.370
by sinking the democratic
presidential nomination June 6th,

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.320
1988."

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.980
The next is Ted.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.210
As I write about them,
the line comes across,

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.220
"Ted Kennedy sought the democratic
presidential nomination in 1980,

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:33.290 position:56%
and his loss is generally attributed
to the Chappaquiddick incident.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.480
He died August 25, 1959."

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.100
Now, then we move across.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.100
And as I talk about each person

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.900
as they would have
appeared 50 years ago,

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.910
the line brings them up to date.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.710
"Joseph P. Kennedy born in 1952
was a member of the US House

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.230
of Representatives 1967 to nine.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.430
He chose not to seek the
democratic gubernatorialship

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:59.880
in 1998 after a messy divorce."

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.710
The line goes across,
"Joseph 'John' F. Kennedy Jr.,

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:08.900
an inexperienced pilot died July
16, 1999 when his plane crashed

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.520
into the Atlantic near
Martha's Vineyard."

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.330
Move across, Kathleen; Kathleen.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.860 position:56%
Says, "Kathleen Kennedy Townsend was
lieutenant governor of Maryland,"

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.750
dates and then, "was defeated
when she ran for governor."

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.930
And it goes back to
Ethel Kennedy Shriver.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.460
"Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the
founder of the Special Olympics.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.510
She died August 11th, 2000 at 99."

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.240
And finally, the last has -- you
know, the end of the book has,

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:42.300
"Eunice Kennedy Shriver told the
Chicago Newspaper [inaudible] 1960,

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.860
'All we talk about is winning.'

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:49.880
Then she picked up her infant
son Tim, held him aloft,

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.820
and gently began to
indoctrinate, 'Win, win, win'."

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.530
That's the way the first book ends.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:01.430
So we bring across to
Timothy, "Timothy Shriver,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.640
chairman of the Special Olympics,
had never sought public office.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.750
He has a PhD in education, he
is the author of 'Fully Alive:

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.550
Discovering What Matters
Most', about his work

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.280
with disabled veterans, in
which he devotes a chapter

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.690
to his Aunt Rosemary,
President Kennedy's sister,

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:24.740
and how their father, Joseph P.
Kennedy, Sr. had her lobotomized."

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.330 position:56%
This thing is called "Ending in
Mid-Sentence," and the last sentence

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:36.100
of the new book is, "In the
Presidential election of 2016,

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.590
the American people elected -- ."

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.820
[Laughter] That's what
we do as historians.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.740
We can't go beyond that.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.210
So that's the way the book ends.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.510
Yes?

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.200
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] JFK's grandfather,
Fitzgerald [inaudible].

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Oh, sure.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.540
Yes, yes; they're all in
there, all of the Kennedys

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.770
from the day they got off the boat.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:07.910
I had both cases, Kennedys and --
they're a fascinating family, yes.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.790
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We have time
for a couple more questions,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.350
and then we'll have
the book signing.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.610
[ Silence ]

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Yes.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.510
&gt;&gt; What would you say [inaudible].

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Say that -- what --

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:23.450
&gt;&gt; What would you say to inspiring
young authors today to [inaudible]?

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: I'm
sorry, I guess -- say --

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.500
&gt;&gt; What would you say to
inspiring young authors today

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.800
to follow their dreams?

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: To write
a book, or any book.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:37.190 position:56%
If it's in you, it doesn't need much
inspiration, but you sure need time,

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.690
and you need some space,
and it's awfully nice

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:47.370 position:56%
if you have some mentoring, and if
you're at a place where the business

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.790
of the place is writing books,
as mine is at Brookings,

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:55.910
well they don't -- you know,
and give me the latitude

00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:01.270 position:56%
to write what I want to write about.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:06.310
But I must admit, I've never
had any problem thinking

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.720
of what my next book would be.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.410
So that's where you usually start.

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.860
And some books almost
write themselves.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.790
You're lucky if that's it.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:22.520
In some ways, the most
important book I did

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:28.470
in an academic sense was called
"Organizing the Presidency".

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:34.280
And it was a book -- after I had
been at the Nixon White House,

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:40.370
there was book in which I couldn't
figure out a way to make a Nixon

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.910
or a president a better man,
but I thought I could figure

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:47.810
out a better way for them
to organize themselves.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.730
And so that book came out,
but it was all in my head.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.270
So that was easy.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.210
Other books you start
as I described this one,

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.150
and you don't even know what
you've written, in a funny way.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.160 position:56%
At least 50 years later, I
realized I'd written something else,

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.570
something I thought much
more important than I had set

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.140
out to write when I realized

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:12.380
that it was really the family
history of the United States.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.800
Again, other books you're
told to write, if that's --

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.030
if you're in a place where that's
what they're paying you for.

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:23.940
I mean, I've written a number of
books on presidential transitions.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.640
Well, that's -- I'm at
Brookings, that's what we do.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.500
There's a transition, I've been
involved in them, I write a book.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:43.090
But I really wouldn't worry
about wanting to write a book.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.140
It's fun. I find it fun.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.200
I don't -- wrote a
book with a person

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.540
who had terrible writer's
block; it wasn't fun at all.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.710
But I've had fun at it, and I
highly recommend it to those

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.710
who had inclination to write.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:03.910
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And the final
question is what is next?

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: You know,
the next is sort of weird.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.740
The one before this was
very important to me.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:15.410
I was -- Pat Moynihan my best
friend, and when he became,

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.600
strangely, the assistant to Richard
Nixon, the liberal been chosen

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.850
by a conservative for a very
important job as special

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:26.000
as the domestic affairs advisor,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.390
and asked me to join
him, I could not resist.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.010
And in that little
period, he and I --

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.640 position:56%
while I'm sitting and then I created
the Family Assistance Program,

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.560
which was the most liberal piece of
legislation certainly ever proposed

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.700
by a Republican president.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.070
And it's that story, the
story of the relationship

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:49.280
between Eisenhower --
between Nixon and Moynihan,

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.600
and it's called "The
President and the Professor:

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.700
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and the Nixon White House".

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.490
So I got that off my chest.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:59.600
I got it while Mrs.
Moynihan is still alive.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.130
I wanted her to see
it, and that was it.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.530 position:56%
Now I'm trying something very weird.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.170
I don't know whether I
can pull it off or not.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.300
Brookings has a very
interesting podcast.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:15.100
It's called "The Brookings
Cafeteria Podcast".

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.790
And it's sort of Ted-ish.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.930
It's very elegant and long,

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.240
and the guy who designed it
decided he would interview me

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.250
and he would throw in, you know,
like two-minute Steve Hess stories.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.600
He wanted to lighten his load.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.900
And it worked pretty well.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.690
I guess he thought I
was a good storyteller.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:40.990
So together, what I'm doing
is really a conversational

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.580
political memoir.

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:50.210
And we sit down after I've laid
out all my documents and so forth,

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.790
and start telling the story.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.770
And if we're lucky,
when it's edited,

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.130
it will sound like a
conversation, rather than a book.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:06.240
At the least, we will have a Steve
Hess podcast, which we'll tell

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.970 position:56%
through Eisenhower, and Nixon, and
Ford, and all of that sort of stuff.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.830
If we're very lucky, it
will be a Brookings book

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:16.380
in which we can include
the documents.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:21.050
If I go to a White House
dinner, there's the Bill affair,

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:25.990
if you will, and the pictures, and
the duck and so forth and so on.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.830
It starts -- and the first question
he asks me is about my youth,

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:35.330
and goes into, you know, if I
have any political genes in me.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:40.590
And I tell a little story
about my great aunt,

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:44.070
whose name was Belle Maskovitz
[assumed spelling], who was --

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:48.170 position:56%
when she died in 1933, her
obituary in the New York Times said,

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.080
"The most powerful woman
politician in the United States."

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.360
And 3,000 people came
to her funeral.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.310
She was basically a brain
behind Alfred E. Smith.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.500
When he ran for president,
she was his advisor.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:06.050
So, you know, I start with that
sort of thing, and move on and on

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.880
to I'm 11 years old and
I live on 96th Street

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.850
in Broadway in New -- 98th Street.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:15.460
And I look down, and there's
Franklin Roosevelt driving

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:21.120 position:56%
down Broadway in the rain in an open
car, the first president I ever saw.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.690
and I'm 11 years old.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:27.370
And I don't know that 96th Street
turns the corner, goes into garage,

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.930
has a rubdown, takes
some Cognac [phonetic].

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.810
And this is almost a historic
moment in American history.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.840
It's the moment he was trying
to convince the American people

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.510
that he was healthy
enough to be reelected.

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:41.410
Of course, he's dead
four months later.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.710
So it takes that.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.920
Now I'm 19, and for some
reason, I'm in the midst

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:53.900
of the 1952 Eisenhower-Taft
Convention in Chicago.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.340
Again, all stories, I was a
driver, but I got the group lost.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.910
So and say they fired me and gave
me tickets to go to the convention

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.030
and I had a wonderful time.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.280
So now -- so [inaudible]
I move onto that.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.570
Now I'm 25, the story I
started to tell you I'm

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.600
in the White House,
again, by accident.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.700
So it's a little like
a zelig [phonetic].

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.100
It's a little who is this person

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.090 position:56%
who was never really a serious major
politician, always somehow seemed

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.650
to be in the right
place at the right time.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.320
Why was I with Richard Nixon when
John Kennedy is assassinated,

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.050
you know, that sort
of story happens.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:29.020
You know, or why am I dancing
with Jacqueline Kennedy?

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.860
You know, again, so [laughter]
that's -- read the next book.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.160
I'll leave it there.

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.520
So that's what really what
I'm working on right now.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.510
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Steve,
thank you so much.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:44.140
[ Applause ]

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hess: Thank you.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.560
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you; and I
think you do have a political gene,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.910
[laughter] something
that keeps you going.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.230
That was wonderful, and you'll now
have a chance to talk with him more

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:59.200
and get a book signed, and think
a little bit about where we are

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.040
in our country in terms of both
the elections and dynasties.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.940
And it's just really a
terribly interesting time.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:11.130 position:56%
And I know that you're going to
find a very interesting role somehow

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:15.910 position:56%
as our country goes ahead with both
these dynasties, and with, you know,

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:19.160
what's ahead of us in a
very exciting election year.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.620
I've left a list of other Center

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.490
for the Book talks
the rest of this year.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:28.270
You've had two this week now on
politics, and so we're moving off

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.860
to some other topics, but
you're welcome to take that,

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.780
and to come back to
other events this year.
