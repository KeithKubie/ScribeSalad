00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey guys! Welcome back, thanks for joining us today on The King Of Random.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.569
There are a lot of ways to cook things, and today we're going to try one of the least conventional ones.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.329
We're going to run a high electric current directly through our food, to see how it reacts. The general setup is pretty simple:

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
We'll have electricity attached to two different nails, and our food spiked onto the top of it, connecting the bridge.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
When we turn on the electricity we'll see what happens to the food. I do want to be doing this with food that is somewhat

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.109
conductive or nothing's gonna happen when we plug in the electricity, so the two foods

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.729
I'm gonna try this with are hot dogs and pickles, both have high water and sodium content,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
so they should conduct electricity fairly well. Alright here we go,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
I'll drive the nails through this board to hold them steady as we run the electricity through them. First

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
let's cut off a small piece. That's easier to manage.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.209
With our board cut we want to drive the two nails through, pointing straight up.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.399
Far enough apart that they have some space between them,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.329
but not so far that we can't fit a hot dog on them. I could just drive the nail in using hammer,

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.349
but it doesn't actually need to be in all that tight, since it's not holding any two pieces of wood together,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.309
so I'm just gonna pre-drill it with a drill bit that's slightly smaller than the width of the nail.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.610
With the holes drilled, now

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.119
let's press the nail all the way through the board so that the head of the nail is flush with the bottom.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.140
With the nails driven through the board, we need to add a source of electricity.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.959
I have here a cord that I cut off of an old broken fan.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.339
I'm going to split the wire in half and then strip off about the top two inches of each side of the wire.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.009
Now let's take these wires and wrap each one around the base of one of the nails.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.059
And there we have it. Now our electric cooking device is ready to be used. All we have to do is impale our food onto

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
it and then plug it in.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.008
Let's start trying to cook a hot dog.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.589
Now the outlet I'm using actually does have a switch installed, so no electricity is going to start flowing into the outlet until I turn

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.140
It on. This is a good safety measure in case something goes wrong.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.759
You can just hit the switch without having to pull the plug out from the wall. All right safety glasses on

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.009
and I'm gonna flip the switch.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.879
I can smell it. I don't know if I could smell it before,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.419
maybe and I'm just close to it or if it started cooking and doing something.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.700
Ooh,  I can hear it, it's making fizzling noises and it's sort of bubbling up down here at the bottom.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.720
I think it might be boiling. Some of the water inside the hot dog, possibly burning it as well.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.220
Mmm. That's smelling great, and I'm gonna turn it off and see what's happened so far.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Well, I've got a nice charred

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.630
Spot on one side of my hot dog, the other side doesn't seem very affected, and I thought more of it would get warm.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.029
I've been told that doing this setup

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.360
you can actually cook the hot dog all the way through and it will often get so hot that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.260
it will split open from the heat. Kind of like if you microwave it.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.860
But I'm not really getting any of that result it's not cooking,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.410
all the way through. It's not really getting hot. It's just sort of heating up the one spot

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.020
that's actually in contact with the nail and a little bit of heat is radiating out from that,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.920
But it doesn't seem to be running much current through the hot dog. Well cooking a hot dog didn't work all that well,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.080
but I do have another experiment

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.580
that I want to try and that is to see what happens if we impale a pickle on our nails and run electricity through it.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.460
I've heard there can be some interesting results so let's test it out. All right, we need a pickle that is long enough

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.100
to reach between the spikes pretty well. It'll work.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.860
All right, electricity is off, stab my pickle on to the nails.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.180
All right, our pickle is spiked. We've got wires running to it. Let's turn on the electricity and see what happens to our pickle.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.480
Oh, It's dripping pickle juice is down again.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.160
Oh!

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.620
That is, an electric arc burning its way through the pickle. Look how much that's lighting up all around that nail.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.360
Alright, you know what? I'm gonna turn the electricity off for a second.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.400
I want to try turning off the lights and seeing what that looks like with a little more darkness around here.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.220
Now we've got a new pickle,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.540
we've dimmed the lights quite a bit,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440
so we're gonna put this one on, turn on the electricity and see how much that sparking shows up.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.060
Ooh!

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960
Oh on both sides, that's exciting.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820
A glowing pickle.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.840
It's glowing! That is one electric pickle.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840
Let me try and pin the other side the other side first.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.540
And touch the other side.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.040
See if I can switch which side- Yeah. Now, that's the side, that's sparking.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.900
Just to see if it makes any difference

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.850
I'm gonna try drilling a new hole and moving one of the nails closer so that we only have about an inch and a half

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.660
in between the two to see what happens.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.220
There's a shorter pickle for this.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.160
All right, Electricity on. Three, two, one.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.860
[sparking]

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.300
We got glowing again.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.580
There is little bit of ozone smell too. That's interesting.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.700
The nail has hollowed out, just burned it's way through

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.260
the trough in the pickle. That's exciting!

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.440
Well there you have it, cooking directly with electricity. I'm gonna say that this does not actually work very well,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.440
We got some good glow out of the pickles,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.780
and I was pretty amused how much it would carve a path through the pickle, wherever it was in contact with the nail.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.060
I've got some ideas of how we could amp this project up to the next level,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.940
including hooking it up to a microwave transformer, that same setup has made metal glowing red hot, or even liquefying,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.560
very quickly. So I'm curious,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.240
what would happen if you ran that much power through a hot dog or a pickle. It might just explode,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.060
which would be pretty great. Overall if you want to try this, it's a fun experiment,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.040
you can cook little bits of a hot dog at a time,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.320
you can get the pickles glowing, it looks pretty cool, but there's not a lot of practical applications to it.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.460
This been a fun project, thanks for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.220
ARGHHH!

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.840
Overall, I would say that on the scale of how to cook hot dogs, this is probably near the bottom,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.920
I'd say. Goes cooking on a campfire,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.200
then on a BBQ, then on a skillet, on the stove and then

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.980
boiling it. And then somewhere down near the floor,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.340
would be impaling your hot dog on nails and plugging those nails into the wall, It's just a terrible way to cook a hot dog.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.660
Hey guys, if you are on Twitter come follow me on twitter at The King Of Random,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.800
It's a great place to connect with me, one on one.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.860
That's all I'm gonna say about that because if you want to you will, and if you don't, you won't. So I will see you

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.860
there. Or maybe I won't.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.120
