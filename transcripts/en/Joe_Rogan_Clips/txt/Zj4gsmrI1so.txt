Speaker 1:          00:00          You're an asshole though. Thank you. I appreciate it. You're a very nice guy. You're just conservative. That's the dirty little secret though. Yeah. We're not supposed to do what not supposed to talk about that, but this is one of the things that bothers me so much about you being so misrepresented. When I read things about you, there was a, the, the article that we were just talking about, the outright sage without the rage, they called you and you're not even remotely alt right. In fact, you were the leading target of antisemitic abuse for all of 2016 weren't you on learning to the Anti Defamation League, which is no LMI and so, yeah, I mean I'm not only am I not all right, I've spent the last four years like legitimately battling the alt right, talking about how evil, I think their ideology is, how evil I think white supremacy is.

Speaker 1:          00:38          I mean, first of all, like people at the Yarmulke is typically not the favorites of the outright. And then beyond that, I mean I think their ideology is legitimately a devastatingly awful twist on what Western civilization is supposed to be as amazing as a review of my new book and my new book has several sections and they're dedicated to how terrible the outright is. And then the interview they did with me doesn't talk about outright stuff at all, but they just assume I'm on the conservative, right? That must mean that I am outright and it's like, no, you stupid to say no problem with no labels. They're disingenuous. People are labeling people in a very simple manner to try to categorize them as the enemy and instead of just addressing these points, like I love watching your debates where you do Q and A's with college students and with people in the audience because you can see you agree with you or disagree with who you have well formulated ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:29          This isn't just some bullshit that you're spouting out. You thought these things through. I mean, I've been doing this for legitimately more than half of my life. I'm 35 and I started when I was 17 and I started writing a syndicated column at that point and when you're 17 you think a lot of dumb stuff and then sure you get older and you educate yourself and you spend a lot of time reading and a lot of time studying. Hopefully you have some cogent arguments after 20 years of doing anything and then, but it's the demonization is pretty astonishing. But we had an on Andrew Yang, he's the only Democratic candidate who has agreed to go on the Sunday special that I do. We did a full hour on ubi. It was perfectly nice. It was perfectly coherent and and, and conciliatory and yet people will suggest that everything I do is about destroying people on the other side because of all the Ben Shapiro destroys videos and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:13          There are certain groups of people where that's their shtick there. Like they're goons, right? They just go after people online for attention. Yes, this is a stick. This is not you. And this is what bothers me so much and I know that you've said some things in the past like particularly about Arabs and like when you were a younger man that you said, I shouldn't have said that. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right. Some of those things were taken out of context. Like that one particular tweet, which is a bad tweet, was a tweet that was part of a tweet threaten, which has specifically contrasting Israel and the Hamas leadership and saying that the Israeli government likes to build and the Hamas leadership would prefer that their citizens live in sewage and bomb things. But that was a bad tweet. Obviously my entire history on, on Muslim relations is one I like.

Speaker 1:          02:56          I supported the ability of Ilhan to where he job on the, on the floor. I opposed. President Trump's originally proposed Muslim ban, uh, in the last three weeks I've had on of Nawaz, I've had on a contact med I had on yesterday, a reformed Muslim. Like these are conversations that have to be had, but to take, this is one of the things that bugs me so much. I've, I've tweeted I think 140,000 times I've written millions of words. I'm sure you can find something. I don't even remember having written it is bad. I have a running list, by the way. I try to be honest about this. I, I'm one of the only people I know who has, I have a running list it's called. So here's a giant list of all the dumb stuff I've ever done. Right? And I actually go through all this. You like, you can look it up. This is not me saying this now. I mean, you can go and look up all the things that I think I've done wrong, and I'll apologize for some, and I'll say somewhere dom, and I'll say some I'm fine with, and you're just taking out of context. But I mean that, I hope that's what honest people try to do,

Speaker 2:          03:48          but does, this is the problem. You're not dealing with. Honest people would, when people try to categorize you as outright or they're, they're trying to put you into this category of Internet goon. There they in, they did quote tweet. There's taking some little tiny phrase you said seven years ago and trying to say, this is you, this is, you know, it's so that's such a disingenuous thing to do.

Speaker 1:          04:11          I hate it. And I hated across the aisle by the way, like I was a defender of James Gunn. I thought James Gunn shouldn't have been fired from guardians of the galaxy. Yeah. Over the old tweets about that. They were just dumb jokes. Right? That's exactly right. Yeah. And even if somebody tweeted something bad like 10 years ago, bringing it up now is not an attempt to actually make the public space better. And you're not actually offended by that thing. The person tweeted 10 years ago that you didn't notice what it is that you want to get rid of this person or hurt this person. So you're going to bring up something from 10 years ago and then you're going to try and club them into submission with it. Because if you actually ask them their opinion about it, they might have a more nuanced view on what they said.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Maybe they apologize and they, maybe they think, I don't even remember saying that. Right. I mean, I, I felt the same way by the way. I try to be consistent. I really do about about this stuff. I said the same thing about, for example, Ralph Northam, the governor of Virginia who is excoriated for having this terrible racist photo on his yearbook page back in medical school in 1987 and people were saying, well, this is evidence he's racist now. It's like, well no, that's evidence that he was doing a racist thing then that's not evidence that he's racist now. You sort of have to look over the broad course of his career and he ended up doing what everyone now does, which is you just don't apologize for anything. You just try to pass it off as nothing. The public space is actually getting worse because let's say that you did something bad in the past.

Speaker 1:          05:23          There are a few human responses to, I did something I don't like in the past. Human response number one is, you know what? I apologize. That was wrong these days. That gets your face step done, right? You say, I apologize, I was wrong. It means what? Why did you do it in the first place? Because you're a bad person. Apologies are not accepted. And then number two is you brazen it out. You do the Trump. You know what? I never did anything wrong, ever. I've never perfect right? And that, and then you get your defenders to come and surround you and then nothing ever gets cleansed or opportunity. Number three is you do what Barack Obama did, which is you come out preemptively and you try to remember all the bad stuff you do and then you confess it in public in dreams from my father. He says, right?

Speaker 1:          05:59          Well you know when I was back in high school did a little blow. Everyone's like, oh, okay, so you did cocaine when he was in high school. That's, that's cool. Whereas if it comes out during the campaign, right, it's stone, right? Then he's got that he's got a real problem. The problem is that right now, even if you preemptively come out and say, I did something wrong. Like, for example, Liam Neeson talking about years ago when he had a racist thought that he didn't act on when he had a racist thought, this is now we're going to try and ruin your career for something that you admit was bad that you did 30 years ago. We're going to try and run you over that. If you apologize for something that you did 30 years ago, which you would have preferred, just got forgotten because it was embarrassing and stupid, then we say you're bad. And so all you're left with is like the most shameless people in the world who are in the public space, right? The incentive structure is to be deeply shameless, to just say, yeah, man, I own that. And it was great when I said it, or I didn't say it at all. And you're just, you're just full of it. I never said that stuff. Oh, who are you gonna believe your eyes are me? And it makes, it makes for a really bad politics.

Speaker 2:          06:57          Well, it's just this, uh, the culture of, of going after people for things and finding any thing to categorize them as someone who's a viable target. And this is what I've seen. Thrust your way. It's like there's nothing wrong with being conservative. There's something wrong with wanting everyone to think the way you think though. This is the difference. Like you, why would I like that you do is you debate your points, you state your positions, you have a philosophy. And what I don't like is when people try to pretend that that philosophy is some somewhat somehow hateful or somehow regressive or some like your, that you condemn people for their thoughts. You, you just, you don't, this is what I, not what I see with you.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Well, I appreciate that and I appreciate the accuracy because I think that's true. I mean, I've come out against virtually every Twitter band, including people who have personally targeted me. I've come out against that. I've come out against virtually every yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:51          That because what do you, what are your thoughts about this idea of d platforming and you know, this is something that we were just discussing before the podcast, um, where the CEO of Youtube and it's Kara Swisher's from recode, I think Kara Swisher. They were talking about removing you from Youtube and I thought it was the CEO of Youtube. It was Eric, actually. Kara who said I would if I could.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Yeah, she tests because her son apparently listens to. That's kind of funny. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:15          If she's being funny saying it, but it was, it would, I thought it was the CEO of you

Speaker 1:          08:19          to, she was trying to get much more disturbing. I was trying to do the same thing that they do with you or with Dave Rubin or Jordan Peterson, which is that anybody who is sort of heterodox because in that group I think I'm the only registered Republican ever. Anybody who's Heterodox is now being explored, trained as a docs, meaning just thinks differently from kind of the down the line Democratic Party platform. You're not like down the line with Hillary. Like Sam Harris is a democrat. Sam Harris's Heterodox because he disagrees that Islam is by necessity a religion of peace, for example. Right? Or he thinks that we have to look at actual statistics in order to make evidentiary based about discrimination and disparity, and this makes him an enemy of people like as reclined@vox.com right. Th this sort of stuff. They then say that you are a feeder for white supremacy. Right. They, they, they can't actually get you on what you say. Yeah. So it turns into, well, you know, some members of your audience do things that, that are really bad. It's like, well dude, I have like millions of people who are members of my audience. I have 5 million Facebook followers. I have 2 million on Twitter and you're way bigger than I am. I assume that some of those people are going to be crazy.

Speaker 2:          09:23          I mean, yeah, I would assume. Yeah. The idea that your respect, well this is what youtube tried to do. You know about the comment thing where the youtube was going to try to make people responsible for the comments and their videos, which what is a normal Jamie? Like a normal video that we get. How many comments does it get? I don't know, like 10,000. That's like an average one. How the fuck am I supposed to have some dude with his itchy trigger finger standing by in front of a keyboard, just waiting for something offensive to pop up. And this was in response to something that happened with them where there was pedophiles who are watching videos of children doing things and they were commenting stuff in the, you know, like the children's gymnastics and stuff like that. They're commenting and like communicating with each other through the comments. And it was sort of, um, discovered that there was this, this connection that they were doing this and many, many videos and youtube rightly panic. They're like, Holy Shit, we have to stop this. So the response, I guess was we just have to make people responsible for their comments. Someone said, oh yeah, good idea. I didn't think through it at all. Right? Certain people that can't do that. Yes. It's

Speaker 1:          10:27          totally insane. And it's insane. And in virtually every respect. And it's, it's funny how it's only applied kind of by the media on one side of the aisle. So to take an example, the congressional baseball shooting happens a couple of years ago. Guy Happens to be a Bernie Fan, is that Bernie Sanders is fault, right? No, that is not Bernie Sanders as well, in a way. Right. Literally, people stopped talking about it and that was shooting of legislators, like elected people. One nearly died and that kind of went away. We didn't talk about, you know, Bernie's responsibility, but there's a shooting in Christ church and it's Jordan Peterson's fault. Yeah. And Jordan Peterson has no relationship with the shooter whatsoever. It's my fault. I have no relationship with the shooter ended now to everything that that piece of crap stands for.
