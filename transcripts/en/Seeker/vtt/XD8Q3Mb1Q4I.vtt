00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.339
The whole world, nay the whole universe is
made of matter.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:05.339
Everything.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.620
You, me, pizza, black holes, puppies, dark
matter.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.620
Everything.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.490
But there’s also this lil’ thing called
antimatter.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.780
Around the turn of the last century, Einstein
was working on the theory of relativity and

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.390
other physicists were trying to figure out
how the tiniest parts of our universe worked

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.030
-- this is called quantum theory.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.730
This was all done with math.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.950
Lots of math.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.890
At one point a physicist named Paul Dirac
realized…

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.079
X-squared equals 4 has two answers.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.180
Two.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.520
AND Negative two.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.250
This means, if matter is the two, there must
be some kind of opposite to fit with the negative

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.430
two.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.640
Physicists called this opposite antimatter.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.720
The reason you don’t see antimatter around,
is because if it were to pop into existence

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.850
and hit regular matter -- the twos would cancel
each other out and disappear in a burst of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.140
energy called an annihilation.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.380
You probably know that all matter is made
of protons and electrons… their antimatter

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.460
opposites are called antiprotons and positrons.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.030
A proton is a positive heavy particle -- an
antiproton is a negative heavy particle.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
Electrons are light and negative, positrons
are light and positive.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.979
Again, because of their opposite-ness, if
they touch, BOOM.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.979
Gone.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.170
But we’ll come back to that.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.710
Even though they have these opposite charges…
in theory, antimatter should be the same as

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.780
matter.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.810
After The Big Bang, the universe should have
created equal amounts of matter and antimatter.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.720
But there’s not really any antimatter around.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.390
Because, in the first second after the Big
Bang, all the matter and antimatter in the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.570
newborn universe found each other and BAM!

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.740
ANNIHILATIONS GALORE.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.170
All the antimatter disappeared in bursts of
energy, leaving behind just… matter.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.130
No one knows why the Big Bang made more matter
than antimatter.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.890
But these scientists are making antimatter
to find out more about it…

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.310
this facility creates antimatter using the
particle beams at CERN we convert protons

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.210
into antiprotons
CERN is the Center for European Nuclear Research,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.649
we went there last year, and it’s where
the Large Hadron Collider lives.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.079
This Antimatter Factory takes protons shooting
along the LHC and converts them to antihydrogen

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.260
-- the antimatter version of hydrogen.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.159
Then Dr. Bertsche and his team trap the antihydrogen
to study it.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.730
We know a lot about hydrogen, so we wanna
see how antihydrogen might be different.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.489
But remember, you can’t let antimatter touch
matter, ever.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.220
No air, no fancy containers… nothing that’s
made of matter.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.909
So, the scientists use magnetic fields to
hold the antihydrogen inside this trap.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.360
They behave like little tiny refrigerator
magnets and consequently we basically have

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.090
to arrange a magnetic field geometry that
looks kind of like a bathtub.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.590
So, the antihydrogen atoms basically sit in
a magnetic bathtub or magnetic bottle.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.779
But it's really actually physically shaped
like a bathtub.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.469
it's about the size of sort of a two liter
coke bottle.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.689
The magnetic bathtub is called a Penning-Malmberg
trap.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.790
The magnetic field keeps the antihydrogen
from hitting the walls of the trap and annihilating

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.969
-- because remember, no touch matter.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:17.760
Powerful magnets and lasers force the antihydrogen
to get stuck inside the magnetic field like

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.870
a piece of candy in a bowl.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.599
Once they’ve trapped the antimatter, the
scientists at the Factory can learn things

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.909
about this mysterious mirror of our universe’s
matter.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.249
For example, what color it is… it’s pink.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.590
We have reason to believe that there's some
difference that we don't understand yet between

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.590
matter and antimatter

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.769
If I had a glass bowl full of hydrogen gas,
I could make like a neon lamp.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.749
If you had a antihydrogen lamp it would be
a sort of pinkish purplish color.

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:39.749
Disappointingly, antimatter isn’t some kind
of miracle form of matter.

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:40.749
It doesn’t have antigravity, it doesn’t
do… well, anything different.

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.719
If you could build an antimatter table, it
would just… be a table.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.859
That is weird, right?

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.700
What if -- in those few hot moments after
the Big Bang -- the universe was completely

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.269
made of antimatter?

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.629
Would it feel exactly the same?

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.249
I mean, think about it.

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.689
If antimatter and matter are exactly the same.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.409
Then what is the difference?

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.489
If the whole universe was made of antimatter
we’d just call that matter.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.010
And what we think of as matter would be called
antimatter.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.150
All the things we call positive are just relative!

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.749
All the charges are relative to our experience
with our universe which arbitrarily is made

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.139
of matter.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.140
Physics get’s really weird when you get
right down to it.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.310
In the end, an antimatter universe -- based
on everything we know, would look and feel

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.650
exactly the same as our own.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.240
But more research is needed.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.330
Scientists trapped antimatter for the first
time in 2010.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.870
Now, just a few short years later, they’ve
learned to trap more than a dozen antiatoms

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.250
at a time over and over again!

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.500
WoooooooooooOOoOOoo
Antimatter has been held by experiments here

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.880
for many many months and indeed one of the
experiments has a collection of antiprotons

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.190
that they grabbed onto some time early last
year and they've actually still have the same

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.010
antiprotons that they've had the whole time
They want to hold onto it so they can keep

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.010
testing it.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.310
But even still, after a bit they have to let
the antimatter go.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.550
Then it annihilates and disappears.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.160
But even though annihilation sounds like a
big, violent, terrible, thing… it’s actually

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.190
kind of like a …

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.820
The scientists see some gamma radiation, and
that’s all she wrote.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.950
Practically speaking, CERN has only made 10
nanograms of antimatter.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.340
Ever.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.220
All the energy from annihilating it, could
only power one light bulb for, 4 hours.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.480
And to make that antimatter takes a billion
times more energy than what we get back from

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480
annihilating it.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.820
There’s not a lot of practical applications
for this antimatter research yet… but…

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.620
Antimatter is actually commonly used in a
lot of medical techniques such as a positron

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.300
emission tomography.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.300
//

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.360
Also called a PET scan, it’s used for cancer
diagnoses.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.500
Look, Star Trek famously traveled the universe
using engines that ran on matter-antimatter

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.010
reactions.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.940
But, based on what we know of antihydrogen,
whether we could do that is a big old shrug.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.930
At the moment, almost a century after it was
first theorized, antimatter research is still

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.080
in its infancy, but thanks to Dr. Bertsche
and dozens of grad students and scientists

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.550
around the world, maybe someday we’ll know
more.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.310
The antimatter factory make their antiprotons
using the Large Hadron Collider.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.730
But do you even know what the Large Hadron
Collider is?

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.730
We went there.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.780
Check it out here, it's going to blow your
mind.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.780
How do you guys feel about physics with no
practical application?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.720
Boring or incredible?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.100
