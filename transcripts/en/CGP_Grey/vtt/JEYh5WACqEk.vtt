00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.629
Between the first Europeans arriving
in 1492 and the Victorian age, the indigenous

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.980
population of the New World dropped by at
least 90%.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.840
The cause?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.540
Not the conquistadors and company -- they killed
lots of people but their death count is nothing

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.689
compared to what they brought with them: small
pox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.820
plague, cholera, mumps, measles and more leapt
from those first explorers to the costal tribes,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.010
then onward the microscopic invaders spread
through a hemisphere of people with no defenses

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.660
against them. Tens of millions died.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.670
These germs decided the fate of these battles
long before the fighting started.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.149
Now ask yourself: why didn't the Europeans get
sick?

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.539
If New-Worlders were vulnerable to old-world
diseases, then surely Old-Worlders would be

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.829
vulnerable to New World diseases.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.080
Yet, there was no Americapox spreading eastward
infecting Europe and cutting the population

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.409
from 90 million to 9. Had Americapox existed
it would have rather dampened European ability

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.920
for transatlantic expansion.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.250
To answer why this didn't happen: we need
first to distinguish regular diseases -- like

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.990
the common cold -- from what we'll call plagues.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.229
1. Spread quickly between people.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.540
Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes
which are faster than closeness. Plagues

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.840
use more of this than this.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.509
2. They kill you quickly or you become immune.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.540
Catch a plague and you're dead within seven
to thirty days; survive and you'll never get

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.899
it again. Your body has learned to fight it.
You might still carry it -- the plague lives

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.850
in you, you can still spread it -- but it can't
hurt you.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.119
The surface answer to this question isn't
that Europeans had better immune systems to

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.020
fight off New World plagues -- it's that the New
World didn't have plagues for them to catch.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.800
They had regular diseases but there was no
Americapox to carry.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.510
These are history's biggest killers, and they
all come from the Old World.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.560
But why?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.180
Let's dig deeper, and talk cholera: a plague
that spreads if your civilization does a bad

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.420
job of separating drinking water from pooping
water. London was terrible at this, making

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.360
it the cholera capital of the world. Cholera
can rip through dense neighborhoods, killing

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.910
swaths of the population before moving onward.
But that's the key: it has to move on.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.430
In a small, isolated group, a plague like
cholera cannot survive -- it kills all available

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.300
victims, leaving only the immune and then
theres nowhere to go -- it's a fire that burns

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.640
through its fuel.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.790
But a city -- shining city on the hill -- to
which rural migrants flock, where hundreds

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.239
of babies are born a day: this is sanctuary
for the fire of plague; fresh kindling comes

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.430
to it. The plague flares and smolders and
flares and smolders again -- impossible to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.690
extinguish.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.790
Historically, in city borders, plagues killed
faster than people could breed. Cities grew

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.340
because more people moved to them than died
inside of them. Cities only started growing

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.700
from their own population in the 1900s when
medicine finally left its leaches and bloodletting

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.080
phase and entered its soap and soup phase, giving humans some tools to slow death.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.819
But before that a city was an unintentional
playground for plagues and a grim machine to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.569
sort the immune from the rest.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.709
So the deeper answer is that the New World
didn't have plagues because the New World

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.989
didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized
deeply interconnected cities for plagues to

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:06.769
thrive.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.000
OK, but The New World wasn't completely barren
of cities, and tribes weren't completely isolated.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.269
Otherwise the newly-arrived smallpox in the
1400s couldn't have spread.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.060
Cities are only part of the puzzle: they're
required for plagues, but cities don't make

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.190
the germs that start the plagues -- those
germs come from the missing piece.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.400
Now, most germs don't want to kill you, for
the same reason you don't want to burn down

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.570
your house; germs live in you. Chronic diseases
like leprosy are terrible because they're

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.290
very good at living in you and not killing you.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.940
Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,
because the germs that cause them don't know

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.470
they're in humans; they think
they're in this.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.199
Plagues come from animals.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.400
Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu,
as well as from birds. Our friend the cow

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.130
alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis,
and smallpox.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.250
For the cow these diseases are no big deal
-- like colds for us. But when cow germs get

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.070
in humans, the things they do to make a
cow a little sick to spread make humans very sick.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.250
Deadly sick.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.970
Now, germs jumping species like this is extraordinarily
rare. That's why generations of humans can

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.440
spend time around animals just fine. Being
the patient zero of a new animal-to-human

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.960
plague is winning a terrible lottery.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.930
But a colonial-age city raises the odds: there
used to be animals everywhere; horses, herds

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.630
of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses,
meat markets pre-refrigeration, and rivers

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.590
of human and animal excrement running
through it all.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.330
A more perfect environment for diseases to
jump species could hardly be imagined.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.060
So the deeper answer is that plagues come
from animals, but so rarely that you have to raise

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:13.340
the odds with many chances for infection
and even then the new-born plague needs a fertile environment

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.500
to grow. The Old World had the necessary pieces
in abundance.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.819
But why was a city like London filled with
sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't?

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.250
This brings us to the final level, for this
video anyway.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.330
Some animals can be put to human use -- this
is what domestication means: animals you can

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.800
breed, not just hunt.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.900
Forget for a the moment the modern world: go back
to 10,000BC when tribes of humans reached

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.330
just about everywhere. If you were in one
of these tribes, what local animals could you

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.870
capture, alive, and successfully pen to breed?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.599
Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking
about catching a Buffalo: an unpredictable,

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.139
violent tank on hooves, that can outrun you
across the planes, leap over your head and

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.759
travels in herds thousands strong.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:13.190
Oh, and you have no horses to help you -- because
there are no horses on the continent. Horses

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.870
live here -- and won't be brought over until
too late.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.930
It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based
tools. American Indians didn't fail to domesticate

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.880
buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.
They failed because it's a buffalo. No one

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.560
could do it -- buffalo would have been amazing
creatures to put to human work back in BC,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.810
but it's not going to happen -- humans have
only barely domesticated buffalo with all

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.210
our modern tools.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.840
The New World didn't have good animal candidates
for domestication. Almost everything big enough

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.020
to be useful is also too dangerous,
or too agile.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.379
Meanwhile the fertile crescent to central
Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:01.830
goats: easy-peasy animals comparatively begging
to be domesticated.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.629
A wild boar is something to contend with if
you only have stone tools but it's possible

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:13.910
to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat
-- because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.210
all resistance beneath their hooves.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:22.669
In the New World the only native domestication
contestant was: llamas. They're better than

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:27.030
nothing -- which is probably why the biggest
cities existed in South America -- but they're

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:33.300
no cow. Ever try to manage a heard of llamas
in the mountains of Peru? Yeah, you can do

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.099
it, but it's not fun. Nothing but drama, these
llamas.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.159
These might seem, cherry-picked examples,
because aren't there hundreds of thousands

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:46.269
of species of animals? Yes, but when you're
stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:53.019
none of them can be domesticated. From the
dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:59.570
domesticated; maybe a baker's dozen of unique
species the world over. And even to get that

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.290
high a number you need to stretch it to include
honeybees and silkworms; nice to have, but

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.190
you can't build a civilization on a foundation
of honey alone.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:16.950
These early tribes weren't smarter, or better
at domestication. The Old World had more valuable

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.700
and easy animals. With dogs, herding sheep
and cattle is easier. Now humans have a buddy

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.610
to keep an eye on the clothing factory, and
the milk and cheeseburger machine, and the

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.940
plow-puller. Now farming is easier, which
means there's more benefit to staying put,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.830
which means more domestication, which means
more food which means more people and more

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:41.529
density and oh look where we're going. Citiesville:
population: lots; bring your animals; plagues

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:42.230
welcome.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.850
That is the full answer: The lack of New World
animals to domesticate limited not only exposure

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.720
to germs sources but also limited food production,
which limited population growth, which limited

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.240
cities, which made plagues in the New World
an almost impossibility. In the Old [World], exactly

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.329
the reverse, and thus a continent full of
plague and a continent devoid of it.

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:10.470
So when ships landed in the New World, there
was no Americapox to bring back.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:16.209
The game of civilization has nothing to do
with the players, and everything to do with

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:21.579
the map. Access to domesticated animals in
numbers and diversity is the key resource

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:28.720
to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing
-- and that complexity brings with it, unintentionally,

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.589
a passive biological weaponry devastating
to outsiders.

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:40.089
Start the game again but move the domesticable
animals across the sea and history's arrow

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:49.510
of disease and death flows in the opposite
direction.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:55.899
This still does leave one last question. Just
why are some animals domesticable and others

00:10:55.899 --> 00:11:01.779
not? Why couldn't American Indians domesticate
deer? Why can't zebras be domesticated? They

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:08.079
look just like horses. And what does it mean
to tame an animal? To answer that, click here
