awesome to do I would love to do that
however it's always a little trickier to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610
however it's always a little trickier to
 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.649
however it's always a little trickier to
prepare for these sort of things because

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659

some challenges normally what I would do

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
some challenges normally what I would do
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230
some challenges normally what I would do
if I was doing this intensive makeup is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
if I was doing this intensive makeup is
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.480
if I was doing this intensive makeup is
I would make a mold of the actors face

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
I would make a mold of the actors face
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.530
I would make a mold of the actors face
in this case Doug and have a plaster

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
in this case Doug and have a plaster
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390
in this case Doug and have a plaster
positive and then I would sculpt all the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
positive and then I would sculpt all the
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310
positive and then I would sculpt all the
features and stuff like that on that and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
features and stuff like that on that and
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760
features and stuff like that on that and
make another mold and then pour foam

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
make another mold and then pour foam
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.550
make another mold and then pour foam
latex into it and have a foam latex

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
latex into it and have a foam latex
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800

appliance that I could put on his face

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
appliance that I could put on his face
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350
appliance that I could put on his face
that was designed specifically for his

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
that was designed specifically for his
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090
that was designed specifically for his
face and it would fit perfectly and he

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
face and it would fit perfectly and he
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.550
face and it would fit perfectly and he
can remote motion and and everything

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
can remote motion and and everything
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.460
can remote motion and and everything
through the makeup and stuff however

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
through the makeup and stuff however
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310
through the makeup and stuff however
because I don't have really the time to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
because I don't have really the time to
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140
because I don't have really the time to
do that in order to do that Doug yet to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150
do that in order to do that Doug yet to
 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.420
do that in order to do that Doug yet to
come in and it's a few hours the process

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
come in and it's a few hours the process
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100
come in and it's a few hours the process
of making a mold and everything so we're

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
of making a mold and everything so we're
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.880
of making a mold and everything so we're
not gonna do that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
not gonna do that
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580
not gonna do that
also Doug in order to stay in character

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
also Doug in order to stay in character
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.199
also Doug in order to stay in character
week after week has to keep his goatee

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209
week after week has to keep his goatee
 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.920
week after week has to keep his goatee
so being that most of the appliance is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
so being that most of the appliance is
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.110
so being that most of the appliance is
going to be glued around that area it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
going to be glued around that area it
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.949
going to be glued around that area it
makes it very tricky how the appliance

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
makes it very tricky how the appliance
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.110
makes it very tricky how the appliance
is actually gonna adhere to his face how

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
is actually gonna adhere to his face how
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.990
is actually gonna adhere to his face how
it's gonna work so those are a couple of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
it's gonna work so those are a couple of
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.430
it's gonna work so those are a couple of
little challenges that we have going

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
little challenges that we have going
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.620
little challenges that we have going
into this already like every project I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630
into this already like every project I
 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.460
into this already like every project I
never know exactly how I'm gonna do it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
never know exactly how I'm gonna do it
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000
never know exactly how I'm gonna do it
how it's gonna come out in this case I'm

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
how it's gonna come out in this case I'm
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.120
how it's gonna come out in this case I'm
just gonna have to sculpt a very generic

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
just gonna have to sculpt a very generic
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.770
just gonna have to sculpt a very generic
face type and hope that it fits Doug

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
face type and hope that it fits Doug
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.920
face type and hope that it fits Doug
generally well I gotta open hopefully it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930
generally well I gotta open hopefully it
 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.640
generally well I gotta open hopefully it
fits them and I can apply it quickly and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
fits them and I can apply it quickly and
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.350
fits them and I can apply it quickly and
without too much fuss you know we're on

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360
without too much fuss you know we're on
 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750
without too much fuss you know we're on
the day filming Doug is very involved in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
the day filming Doug is very involved in
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760
the day filming Doug is very involved in
all aspects you know he's directing he's

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770
all aspects you know he's directing he's
 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.970
all aspects you know he's directing he's
you know acting up obviously and you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
you know acting up obviously and you
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.130
you know acting up obviously and you
know he's supervising the script or he's

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
know he's supervising the script or he's
 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.520
know he's supervising the script or he's
supervising the script and stuff so he

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530
supervising the script and stuff so he
 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.110
supervising the script and stuff so he
doesn't have a lot of time to sit in the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
doesn't have a lot of time to sit in the
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840
doesn't have a lot of time to sit in the
makeup chair and this is going to be one

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850
makeup chair and this is going to be one
 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.180
makeup chair and this is going to be one
of the most elaborate makeups we've ever

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190
of the most elaborate makeups we've ever
 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.360
of the most elaborate makeups we've ever
had to do so it's it's hard to say how

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370
had to do so it's it's hard to say how
 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.320
had to do so it's it's hard to say how
long it'll take

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330
long it'll take
 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.710
long it'll take
hopefully I can get it and I can build

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
hopefully I can get it and I can build
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.530
hopefully I can get it and I can build
an appliance that we can do in just like

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540
an appliance that we can do in just like
 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.510
an appliance that we can do in just like
a like an hour and a half application um

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520
a like an hour and a half application um
 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.470
a like an hour and a half application um
but we'll see yeah hey you still have no

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
but we'll see yeah hey you still have no
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.650
but we'll see yeah hey you still have no
idea how I'm gonna do this but that's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
idea how I'm gonna do this but that's
 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.520
idea how I'm gonna do this but that's
totally cool I love the challenge and so

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530
totally cool I love the challenge and so
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.310
totally cool I love the challenge and so
I think what I my plan is is to create a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320
I think what I my plan is is to create a
 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.830
I think what I my plan is is to create a
very simple face structure I probably

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
very simple face structure I probably
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.280
very simple face structure I probably
use a vacuum for mold that I have is a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290
use a vacuum for mold that I have is a
 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.060
use a vacuum for mold that I have is a
very basic face and then I'll sculpt on

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070
very basic face and then I'll sculpt on
 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.930
very basic face and then I'll sculpt on
that and make a mold out of plaster and

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940
that and make a mold out of plaster and
 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.259
that and make a mold out of plaster and
then just have a liquid latex I'm going

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269
then just have a liquid latex I'm going
 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.590
then just have a liquid latex I'm going
to use a heavy grade liquid latex for

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600
to use a heavy grade liquid latex for
 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.840
to use a heavy grade liquid latex for
the actual appliances and I'm going to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850
the actual appliances and I'm going to
 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.850
the actual appliances and I'm going to
try and keep it in as much of one

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860
try and keep it in as much of one
 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.130
try and keep it in as much of one
appliance as possible so it'll be easier

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140
appliance as possible so it'll be easier
 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.500
appliance as possible so it'll be easier
to put on I'm not exactly sure how it's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
to put on I'm not exactly sure how it's
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.240
to put on I'm not exactly sure how it's
gonna turn out but I'm going to keep

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250
gonna turn out but I'm going to keep
 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.280
gonna turn out but I'm going to keep
shooting some video and stuff of the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290
shooting some video and stuff of the
 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.800
shooting some video and stuff of the
process and so you guys would kind of

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810
process and so you guys would kind of
 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.159
process and so you guys would kind of
see how it all comes together and yeah

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169
see how it all comes together and yeah
 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.909
see how it all comes together and yeah
hopefully it comes together okay so

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919
hopefully it comes together okay so
 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.580
hopefully it comes together okay so
we're in the workshop and like I said so

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590
we're in the workshop and like I said so
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.840
we're in the workshop and like I said so
I'm gonna use a basic this is a vacuum

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850
I'm gonna use a basic this is a vacuum
 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.800
I'm gonna use a basic this is a vacuum
form of a basic face shape

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810
form of a basic face shape
 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.720
form of a basic face shape
that I'm gonna sculpt on and I have to

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730
that I'm gonna sculpt on and I have to
 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.710
that I'm gonna sculpt on and I have to
hopefully it'll come out like this it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720
hopefully it'll come out like this it
 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720
hopefully it'll come out like this it
look like Tim Roth and Planet of the

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730
look like Tim Roth and Planet of the
 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.390
look like Tim Roth and Planet of the
Apes this is my reference I'm gonna use

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400
Apes this is my reference I'm gonna use
 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.940
Apes this is my reference I'm gonna use
sculpey original to do all the sculpt

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
sculpey original to do all the sculpt
 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.409
sculpey original to do all the sculpt
all the features it's not the most ideal

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419
all the features it's not the most ideal
 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.680
all the features it's not the most ideal
as far as price wise but I have a ton of

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
as far as price wise but I have a ton of
 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.790
as far as price wise but I have a ton of
this stuff so that's why I'm actually

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800
this stuff so that's why I'm actually
 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.590
this stuff so that's why I'm actually
gonna use it at night I am very

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600
gonna use it at night I am very
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.390
gonna use it at night I am very
comfortable using sculpey it's a really

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
comfortable using sculpey it's a really
 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.490
comfortable using sculpey it's a really
it's really easy to use polymer clay and

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500
it's really easy to use polymer clay and
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.800
it's really easy to use polymer clay and
yeah I've only got like a few hours

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810
yeah I've only got like a few hours
 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.060
yeah I've only got like a few hours
really to get this done so I'm just

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
really to get this done so I'm just
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.210
really to get this done so I'm just
gonna just jump right into it and see

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220
gonna just jump right into it and see
 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.580
gonna just jump right into it and see
what happens and hopefully when it's

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590
what happens and hopefully when it's
 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.530
what happens and hopefully when it's
done it resembles this and in some

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540
done it resembles this and in some
 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:40.810
done it resembles this and in some
manner so let's see what happens

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820
 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:06:13.200
[Music]

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210
 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.870
all right so I'm not the the basic kind

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880
all right so I'm not the the basic kind
 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.550
all right so I'm not the the basic kind
of shape of the face done the trick I

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560
of shape of the face done the trick I
 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.830
of shape of the face done the trick I
think in order to make it look like not

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840
think in order to make it look like not
 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.230
think in order to make it look like not
just a generic monkey face and to look

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240
just a generic monkey face and to look
 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.150
just a generic monkey face and to look
somewhat more like the Tim Roth

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160
somewhat more like the Tim Roth
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.320
somewhat more like the Tim Roth
character is he has a very specific no

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330
character is he has a very specific no
 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.090
character is he has a very specific no
like shape of the nose so that's kind of

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100
like shape of the nose so that's kind of
 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.680
like shape of the nose so that's kind of
what I'm working on now I feel like if I

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690
what I'm working on now I feel like if I
 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.390
what I'm working on now I feel like if I
can kind of make that work and it's

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400
can kind of make that work and it's
 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.029
can kind of make that work and it's
looking like how I want it to look then

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039
looking like how I want it to look then
 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.560
looking like how I want it to look then
the rest of it'll kind of just come

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570
the rest of it'll kind of just come
 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.790
the rest of it'll kind of just come
together but yeah so far that's about

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800
together but yeah so far that's about
 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.650
together but yeah so far that's about
that's what I got and the nose kind of

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660
that's what I got and the nose kind of
 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.360
that's what I got and the nose kind of
working out now the overall structure of

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370
working out now the overall structure of
 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.320
working out now the overall structure of
the face too is very almost very

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
the face too is very almost very
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.550
the face too is very almost very
menacing it's supposed to be very

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560
menacing it's supposed to be very
 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.850
menacing it's supposed to be very
menacing he's the villain so he's got

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
menacing he's the villain so he's got
 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.580
menacing he's the villain so he's got
kind of like a heavier brow very deep

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590
kind of like a heavier brow very deep
 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.159
kind of like a heavier brow very deep
set almost like cheekbones kind of kind

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169
set almost like cheekbones kind of kind
 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.930
set almost like cheekbones kind of kind
of skeletal looking so you can kind of

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940
of skeletal looking so you can kind of
 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:08:04.740
of skeletal looking so you can kind of
make out his features much more

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.750
 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.180
this is what we're left with I think

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.190
this is what we're left with I think
 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.510
this is what we're left with I think
it'll get the job done try and get in

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520
it'll get the job done try and get in
 

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.180
it'll get the job done try and get in
close there you can kind of see some of

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.190
close there you can kind of see some of
 

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.800
close there you can kind of see some of
the detailing I don't know it's kind of

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:14.810
the detailing I don't know it's kind of
 

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.950
the detailing I don't know it's kind of
hard to tell it's all white but I did

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960
hard to tell it's all white but I did
 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.990
hard to tell it's all white but I did
put a lot of deep lines and stuff like

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000
put a lot of deep lines and stuff like
 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.210
put a lot of deep lines and stuff like
that and to kind of give it a texture

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.220
that and to kind of give it a texture
 

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.250
that and to kind of give it a texture
hopefully then when I paint it all that

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:24.260
hopefully then when I paint it all that
 

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.220
hopefully then when I paint it all that
will come out and really give it some

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.230
will come out and really give it some
 

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:33.399
will come out and really give it some
more depth and see yeah well it's kind

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:33.409
more depth and see yeah well it's kind
 

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.020
more depth and see yeah well it's kind
of hard to tell but that's the the basic

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.030
of hard to tell but that's the the basic
 

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.770
of hard to tell but that's the the basic
gist there

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:38.780
gist there
 

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.990
gist there
it looks pretty yeah that's not too bad

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000
it looks pretty yeah that's not too bad
 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.390
it looks pretty yeah that's not too bad
actually side by side yeah as I said

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.400
actually side by side yeah as I said
 

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.590
actually side by side yeah as I said
it's about what I have time for today

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600
it's about what I have time for today
 

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.680
it's about what I have time for today
and I'll make the mold for the latex and

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:55.690
and I'll make the mold for the latex and
 

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.850
and I'll make the mold for the latex and
yeah hopefully they'll all come together

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:57.860
yeah hopefully they'll all come together
 

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:06.260
yeah hopefully they'll all come together
I'm pretty excited to see it

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.270
 

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.380

there's still a lot of detail in the

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839
there's still a lot of detail in the
 

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.019
there's still a lot of detail in the
forehead on the character or whatever so

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:30.029
forehead on the character or whatever so
 

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.460
forehead on the character or whatever so
I just went ahead and added that little

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.470
I just went ahead and added that little
 

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.420
I just went ahead and added that little
piece

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.430
piece
 

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.320
piece
I'll keep it really thin with the latex

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.330
I'll keep it really thin with the latex
 

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.760
I'll keep it really thin with the latex
and then way that way you can still kind

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:37.770
and then way that way you can still kind
 

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.340
and then way that way you can still kind
of a moat and move his brows and you

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.350
of a moat and move his brows and you
 

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.110
of a moat and move his brows and you
know and stuff like that and it'll give

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120
know and stuff like that and it'll give
 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.460
know and stuff like that and it'll give
me a little bit more of a surface area

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:43.470
me a little bit more of a surface area
 

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.560
me a little bit more of a surface area
to adhere the whole prosthetic to again

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.570
to adhere the whole prosthetic to again
 

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.420
to adhere the whole prosthetic to again
I have no idea that's a good idea or a

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.430
I have no idea that's a good idea or a
 

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.300
I have no idea that's a good idea or a
bad idea but you know we'll see what

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.310
bad idea but you know we'll see what
 

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.060
bad idea but you know we'll see what
happens so anyway today we're gonna make

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.070
happens so anyway today we're gonna make
 

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.240
happens so anyway today we're gonna make
the mold I'm gonna pour plaster mold

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.250
the mold I'm gonna pour plaster mold
 

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.710
the mold I'm gonna pour plaster mold
we'll build a box around it pour the

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720
we'll build a box around it pour the
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:07.040
we'll build a box around it pour the
mold pull the clay out and then we will

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.050
mold pull the clay out and then we will
 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.190
mold pull the clay out and then we will
yeah pour the latex in and let it sit

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200
yeah pour the latex in and let it sit
 

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.829
yeah pour the latex in and let it sit
overnight and tomorrow it should be good

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839
overnight and tomorrow it should be good
 

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:22.040
overnight and tomorrow it should be good
we can do a test so

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.050
 

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.949
all right so I created a box a simple

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959
all right so I created a box a simple
 

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.940
all right so I created a box a simple
box around the sculpt and I will just

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:29.950
box around the sculpt and I will just
 

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.060
box around the sculpt and I will just
mix up some of this plaster of Paris

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.070
mix up some of this plaster of Paris
 

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.130
mix up some of this plaster of Paris
it's two parts plus your pairs per one

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.140
it's two parts plus your pairs per one
 

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.930

brush out of the first coat and then
 

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:45.030
brush out of the first coat and then
pour it in a little bit at a time and

pour it in a little bit at a time and
 

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.560
pour it in a little bit at a time and
kind of kind of banging on it tap on it

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:49.570
kind of kind of banging on it tap on it
 

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.780
kind of kind of banging on it tap on it
to kind of force the bubbles out and

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:53.790
 

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.069
yeah about an hour or so it should

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079
yeah about an hour or so it should
 

00:10:56.079 --> 00:11:00.240
yeah about an hour or so it should
probably cure up and then we can pull

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.250
probably cure up and then we can pull
 

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.240
probably cure up and then we can pull
out the clay and see what we have so

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.250
out the clay and see what we have so
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:37.120
out the clay and see what we have so
we're gonna do that right

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.130
 

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.330
all right well I pulled the pulled the

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:41.340
all right well I pulled the pulled the
 

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.560
all right well I pulled the pulled the
clay out and were left with this

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:44.570
clay out and were left with this
 

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.160
clay out and were left with this
negative here and you can kind of see it

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
negative here and you can kind of see it
 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.650
negative here and you can kind of see it
actually came out really well I was

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660
actually came out really well I was
 

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.750
actually came out really well I was
actually able to pull the clay out all

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760
actually able to pull the clay out all
 

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.880
actually able to pull the clay out all
in one go it retained almost all of the

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:58.890
in one go it retained almost all of the
 

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.770
in one go it retained almost all of the
detail and stuff with the the mask is

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:00.780
detail and stuff with the the mask is
 

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.300
detail and stuff with the the mask is
actually still there it's still pretty

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.310
actually still there it's still pretty
 

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.160
actually still there it's still pretty
much intact I mean there's a little bit

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.170
much intact I mean there's a little bit
 

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.920
much intact I mean there's a little bit
of smudging and damage and stuff that

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:06.930
of smudging and damage and stuff that
 

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.730
of smudging and damage and stuff that
could be easily cleaned up but usually I

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740
could be easily cleaned up but usually I
 

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.850
could be easily cleaned up but usually I
have to scrape out some of the residual

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860
have to scrape out some of the residual
 

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.440
have to scrape out some of the residual
clay and stuff like that that's in there

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:15.450
clay and stuff like that that's in there
 

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.500
clay and stuff like that that's in there
especially when it's there's that much

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:17.510
especially when it's there's that much
 

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.890
especially when it's there's that much
tooling and stuff like that involved but

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:20.900
tooling and stuff like that involved but
 

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.060
tooling and stuff like that involved but
yeah I'm actually really happy with the

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.070
yeah I'm actually really happy with the
 

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.820
yeah I'm actually really happy with the
way it came out it pulled beautifully I

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:25.830
way it came out it pulled beautifully I
 

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.100
way it came out it pulled beautifully I
think would get a really nice clean mask

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.110
think would get a really nice clean mask
 

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.600
think would get a really nice clean mask
out of this and yeah that's gonna be the

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:32.610
out of this and yeah that's gonna be the
 

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.330
out of this and yeah that's gonna be the
next step so I'm gonna pour liquid latex

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:35.340
next step so I'm gonna pour liquid latex
 

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.620
next step so I'm gonna pour liquid latex
in brush it in real good I'm gonna use a

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:38.630
in brush it in real good I'm gonna use a
 

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.590
in brush it in real good I'm gonna use a
professional grade latex that's used for

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
professional grade latex that's used for
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.930
professional grade latex that's used for
we're making Halloween masks and stuff

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:44.940
we're making Halloween masks and stuff
 

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.430
we're making Halloween masks and stuff
like that and I would get a really good

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440
like that and I would get a really good
 

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.130
like that and I would get a really good
test from that I would think tomorrow we

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:52.140
test from that I would think tomorrow we
 

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.350
test from that I would think tomorrow we
should have a really cool prosthetic

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360
should have a really cool prosthetic
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:33.020
should have a really cool prosthetic
that we can test out

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.030
 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:39.530
all right so here's the here's the mask

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540
all right so here's the here's the mask
 

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.580
all right so here's the here's the mask
the latex appliance

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:42.590
the latex appliance
 

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.940
the latex appliance
came up pretty good actually it might

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:46.950
came up pretty good actually it might
 

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.440
came up pretty good actually it might
about a little bit of shrinkage I'm not

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:48.450
about a little bit of shrinkage I'm not
 

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.350
about a little bit of shrinkage I'm not
sure but I think it'll be a pretty good

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360
sure but I think it'll be a pretty good
 

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.830
sure but I think it'll be a pretty good
fit and then it's got the chin piece

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:54.840
fit and then it's got the chin piece
 

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.710
fit and then it's got the chin piece
here and of course I have to add all the

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720
here and of course I have to add all the
 

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.530
here and of course I have to add all the
hair and stuff like that but I think I'm

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540
hair and stuff like that but I think I'm
 

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.480
hair and stuff like that but I think I'm
gonna try I'm gonna do a quick test on

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:02.490
gonna try I'm gonna do a quick test on
 

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.400
gonna try I'm gonna do a quick test on
myself and see how good I can kind of

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:07.410
myself and see how good I can kind of
 

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.550
myself and see how good I can kind of
apply it and make it look I don't think

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560
apply it and make it look I don't think
 

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.490
apply it and make it look I don't think
I have hair and stuff like that to add

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500
I have hair and stuff like that to add
 

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.800
I have hair and stuff like that to add
to it today but can maybe do a quick

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:15.810
to it today but can maybe do a quick
 

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.360
to it today but can maybe do a quick
makeout jab and see how all comes

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.370
makeout jab and see how all comes
 

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.440
makeout jab and see how all comes
together I know

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:21.450
together I know
 

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.390
together I know
but oh well I'm pretty happy with the

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:23.400
but oh well I'm pretty happy with the
 

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.400
but oh well I'm pretty happy with the
the appliance itself I think it came out

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:25.410
the appliance itself I think it came out
 

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.470
the appliance itself I think it came out
pretty well this is actually a really

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480
pretty well this is actually a really
 

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.030
pretty well this is actually a really
nice a really good latex that's I think

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040
nice a really good latex that's I think
 

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.040
nice a really good latex that's I think
I might have mentioned it's designed for

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.050
I might have mentioned it's designed for
 

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.770
I might have mentioned it's designed for
making latex masks like Halloween masks

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:36.780
making latex masks like Halloween masks
 

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.470
making latex masks like Halloween masks
and stuff like that so so yeah it's

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480
and stuff like that so so yeah it's
 

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.530
and stuff like that so so yeah it's
pretty good it's really solid

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540
pretty good it's really solid
 

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.040
pretty good it's really solid
flexible it's still gonna be I think

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.050
flexible it's still gonna be I think
 

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.030
flexible it's still gonna be I think
pliable and lightweight enough to wear

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040
pliable and lightweight enough to wear
 

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.510
pliable and lightweight enough to wear
yeah

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:50.520
