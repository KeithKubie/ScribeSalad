00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Which numeric axis shows 47 plus 22? 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.308
 On the first line we start 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.184
 with 47, then we add 20 to get to 67. 

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:14.350
 Finally, add 2 to get to 69. 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.193
 If you add 20 and then another 2, 

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:17.706
 you actually add 22. 

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.477
 So that's the right answer. 

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.260
 Let's now see why these options are not true. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.442
 Here we add 2 to get to 49, 

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:26.950
 and then add 2 more and get to 51. 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.560
 However, we do not add 22. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.389
 So we add 2 plus 2, ie we add 4. 

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:34.287
 To add 22, we need to add 20 and then 2 more. 

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:36.342
 And with this opportunity here 

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.163
 add 20 and then 2, 

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:43.169
 but we do not start from 47, but from 74. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.303
 That is, the image is 74 plus 22. So I definitely choose 

00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:48.806
 this opportunity here. 

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:52.470
 Let's take a few more examples. 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
 Which numeric axis shows 93 minus 76? 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.876
 With all these possibilities we start from 93. 

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.296
 At the first opportunity we take out 7 and then 6. 

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.696
 But to get 76, we have to get 70 

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.576
 and then 6, not just 7. 

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:11.803
 So I do not like this opportunity. 

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.253
 Here we get 60 and then 7. 

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:19.730
 But we get a total of 67, not 76. 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.279
 We have to draw seven tenths. 

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:23.664
 7 tens and then 6 units. 

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:27.110
 Here we bring out seven tenths, that is, we take out 70. 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.794
 And then we get 6 units. 

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:33.493
 This is definitely the right answer. 

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.580
 Let's look at another example, 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.539
 just for fun. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.600
 Which numeric axis shows 12 plus 87? 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.824
 They all start at 12. 

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.297
 We'll add 80 and then 7. 

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.570
 8 decades and 7 units. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.797
 This right is added to 80, 

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.604
 and then 7, therefore ... 

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:56.770
 Yes, I choose this opportunity here.
