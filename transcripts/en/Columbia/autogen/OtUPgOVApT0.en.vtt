our core or primitive beliefs and if we
change something in the primitive belief

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220
change something in the primitive belief

meaning but at the same time telling a

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720
meaning but at the same time telling a
 

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.569
meaning but at the same time telling a
story as an act of creation and it's an

00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:36.579
story as an act of creation and it's an
 

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:39.569
story as an act of creation and it's an
active selection and we're also creating

00:45:39.569 --> 00:45:39.579
active selection and we're also creating
 

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:41.789

the story at the same time that we're
 

00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:43.589
the story at the same time that we're
listening to it were also creating it

00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599
listening to it were also creating it
 

00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:45.450
listening to it were also creating it
and every time we tell a story that

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:45.460
and every time we tell a story that
 

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.739
and every time we tell a story that
story is being told differently what's

00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:49.749
story is being told differently what's
 

00:45:49.749 --> 00:45:52.319

very very important is what voices are

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:52.329
very very important is what voices are
 

00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:55.739
very very important is what voices are
not heard and interestingly enough in

00:45:55.739 --> 00:45:55.749
not heard and interestingly enough in
 

00:45:55.749 --> 00:45:57.870
not heard and interestingly enough in
the film of Gloria she never mentions

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880
the film of Gloria she never mentions
 

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.339
the film of Gloria she never mentions
her son and I think in some ways it was

00:46:02.339 --> 00:46:02.349
her son and I think in some ways it was
 

00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:05.400
her son and I think in some ways it was
partly because it was probably too raw

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:05.410
partly because it was probably too raw
 

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.330
partly because it was probably too raw
and she didn't

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:06.340
and she didn't
 

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.550
and she didn't
want to end up crying on the camera but

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560
want to end up crying on the camera but
 

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.400
want to end up crying on the camera but
it's interesting that she talks joyously

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:11.410
it's interesting that she talks joyously
 

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.080
it's interesting that she talks joyously
about her whole family which she never

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:13.090
about her whole family which she never
 

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.660
about her whole family which she never
mentions him yet if you know her story

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:15.670
mentions him yet if you know her story
 

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.570
mentions him yet if you know her story
his story is one of us his voice is one

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:18.580
his story is one of us his voice is one
 

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.950
his story is one of us his voice is one
of the voices that is not heard and it's

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960
of the voices that is not heard and it's
 

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.970
of the voices that is not heard and it's
important when you're listening to

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:23.980
important when you're listening to
 

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.160
important when you're listening to
somebody talk and tell their story to

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.170
somebody talk and tell their story to
 

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.410
somebody talk and tell their story to
really also think to yourself what

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:28.420
really also think to yourself what
 

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:33.090
really also think to yourself what
voices are not being heard in order to

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:33.100
voices are not being heard in order to
 

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.580
voices are not being heard in order to
really understand the meaning of the

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:35.590
really understand the meaning of the
 

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.090
really understand the meaning of the
story there are certain things that we

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:39.100
story there are certain things that we
 

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.460
story there are certain things that we
should focus on first of all is there a

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:41.470
should focus on first of all is there a
 

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.730
should focus on first of all is there a
theme song and by a theme song I mean

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:44.740
theme song and by a theme song I mean
 

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.700
theme song and by a theme song I mean
not only repeated images but something

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:47.710
not only repeated images but something
 

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.650
not only repeated images but something
that is meaningful for example in

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:49.660
that is meaningful for example in
 

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.630
that is meaningful for example in
Gloria's case I think the theme song

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640
Gloria's case I think the theme song
 

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.760
Gloria's case I think the theme song
really had to do with keeping up

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:53.770
really had to do with keeping up
 

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:57.150
really had to do with keeping up
appearances and understanding that theme

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160
appearances and understanding that theme
 

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.490
appearances and understanding that theme
song again in the historical context so

00:46:59.490 --> 00:46:59.500
song again in the historical context so
 

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.350
song again in the historical context so
if you if you each took a moment to

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:01.360
if you if you each took a moment to
 

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.150
if you if you each took a moment to
think about your theme song today

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.160
think about your theme song today
 

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.040
think about your theme song today
because the theme song changes all the

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.050
because the theme song changes all the
 

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.320
because the theme song changes all the

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.600
it turned out to be a wonderful point of
connection but it could be a disaster I

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:38.610

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:40.650
mean you know when she found out who it
 

01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:42.980

was she said I loved her she says she

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:42.990

suddenly it gave me a sort of a

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:51.310
 

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:53.070
getting me kind of impressed with her

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080
getting me kind of impressed with her
 

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.780
getting me kind of impressed with her
but I think on some level I may have

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:54.790
but I think on some level I may have
 

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.570
but I think on some level I may have
been doing it because I felt and I was

01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:57.580
been doing it because I felt and I was
 

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.160
been doing it because I felt and I was
you know sort of new at this at that

01:12:59.160 --> 01:12:59.170
you know sort of new at this at that
 

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:01.860
you know sort of new at this at that
point but I felt somehow that there's

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:01.870
point but I felt somehow that there's
 

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:04.050
point but I felt somehow that there's
this disconnect between us and how was I

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:04.060
this disconnect between us and how was I
 

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.030
this disconnect between us and how was I
supposed to connect with this woman and

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040
supposed to connect with this woman and
 

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.820
supposed to connect with this woman and
it worked but it was risky and I think

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:08.830
it worked but it was risky and I think
 

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.440
it worked but it was risky and I think
had I not had these years and years of

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:10.450
had I not had these years and years of
 

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:12.570
had I not had these years and years of
experience as a therapist I might not

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:12.580
experience as a therapist I might not
 

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.240
experience as a therapist I might not
suggest doing something like that but

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:15.250
suggest doing something like that but
 

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.680
suggest doing something like that but
