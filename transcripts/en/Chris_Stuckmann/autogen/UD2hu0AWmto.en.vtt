so just I'm not getting my point across
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.730 align:start position:0%
so just I'm not getting my point across
the<00:04:39.539><c> second</c><00:04:39.930><c> cut</c><00:04:40.050><c> was</c><00:04:40.199><c> a</c><00:04:40.229><c> little</c><00:04:40.469><c> better</c><00:04:40.620><c> and</c>

then I got to the third and I was like
 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
then I got to the third and I was like
