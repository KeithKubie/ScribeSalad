[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: James,
it's a real pleasure

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.410
to have you on the show.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.160
Thanks for coming.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.200
JAMES MCLURKIN: It's
wonderful to be here.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.575
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now a lot of us

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:13.890
know you as the maker guy,
right, with the AIY Project.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.000
But can you just tell
us about yourself?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.890
What is it that you
do here at Google?

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.280
JAMES MCLURKIN:
So my primary job

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.800
is hardware engineer on AIY.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.330
But that's not my
top secret mission.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.580
So my top secret
mission really is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.230
to build things that
build engineers.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.159
I'm trying to get the coolest
of Google technology, which

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.440
is artificial
intelligence-- get that out

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.040
so that makers and
students and everybody can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.540
use that in their own projects.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
one of your first things

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.270
you've done with it
is this thing, right?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.590
JAMES MCLURKIN: Yes.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.298
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
this is the before,

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:45.370
and this is the after.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.630
JAMES MCLURKIN: Right.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.713
LAURENCE MORONEY: So can
you show us how it works?

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:49.170
JAMES MCLURKIN: Sure.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.520
How tall is the Space Needle?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.500
Oh, that's so trite.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.860
AI: The Space Needle
is 605 feet tall.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.800
JAMES MCLURKIN: Let's
try some other ones.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.345
What is Union Pacific 844?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.810
AI: According to Wikipedia,
Union Pacific 844

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.480
is a 484 Northern
type steam locomotive

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.900
built by the American Locomotive
Company in December, 1944,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.372
for the Union Pacific Railroad.

00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:15.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.765
So I know you like
trains, right?

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:17.640
JAMES MCLURKIN: I do.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wasn't
there a little thing

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.330
as you were designing this that
you designed it for trains?

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.310
JAMES MCLURKIN: So we
got our prototypes back,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.384
and as we were getting
to our production,

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:28.800
we never had quite enough time
to get enough prototypes to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.505
built. So we were having a
demo, and I cleared the week,

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:32.880
and I was like,
I've got to build

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.074
some stuff with this thing.

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:35.490
We can't have
people dogfooding it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.031
without me testing it myself.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.530
So I went throughout
my house trying

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.360
to figure out what to control,
and I saw my trains there.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.571
Well, let's go drive the trains.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.320
And I went to go connect
the trains to it,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.236
and I had to cut the
circuit board up in order

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:49.140
to drive the trains.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.640
And I thought,
this will never do.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.020
This will never do.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810
So I stopped literally
at that instant,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.707
went back and
changed the design,

00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:57.540
changed the circuit
board design so it would

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.800
be easier to control trains.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.700
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right, so a ship

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.241
stopper on the
original design was it

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:03.090
didn't work with your
train set, so you got

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.630
it to work with your train set.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.980
I think we have a video of that.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.919
Should we take a look?

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:08.085
JAMES MCLURKIN: Train, fast.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.374
Motors, or lights, or
servos, or anything

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:17.540
else that you can control
with no electrical signal.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.130
It literally is
just that simple.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.590
If you can plug wires
into a circuit board,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.690
then you can connect a
motor to the voice kit.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.700
Train, stop.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.950
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now that looks cool.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.260
Do you have a lot of trains?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.135
JAMES MCLURKIN: I do.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:39.560
So the one you saw in the
video, the gray diesel engine,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.460
that's an old SP model, ST9.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.760
And then my pride and joy,
which is that UP844 model which

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.820
showed up at the end.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.070
And there's a bunch of others.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.530
I live in Seattle, and
there's a famous train

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.840
that goes from Seattle to
Chicago, the Empire Builder.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.700
And the scale that I
model in is N scale.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.370
So that's one to 160.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.470
And that train, I
have it on my wall.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.340
It is 6 and 1/2 feet long.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.090
So I had to go build a
special wall display unit

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.760
just to put this
train on the wall.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.543
And then you get to control
the trains [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:14.210
this project, which
is pretty cool.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.110
Now I know we released
a bunch of these,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.110
and they kind of sold out
really quickly, right?

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.151
JAMES MCLURKIN: They did.

00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.276
LAURENCE MORONEY: And you
had a magazine in the UK,

00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:21.984
I think that was.

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:23.600
JAMES MCLURKIN: So
our launch partner

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.030
was Raspberry Pi Foundation.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.287
And they have a
magazine called MagPi,

00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:30.370
which is all about their
Raspberry Pi single board

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.280
computer.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.040
So the Raspberry Pi, it's
a computer about this big.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.814
And the real breakthrough
isn't the size.

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:37.230
We're used to small
computers now.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.920
It's the cost.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.641
It's a $35 computer.

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.390
You plug in your
keyboard and your monitor

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.170
and you're ready to go.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.500
So it has really
revolutionized the low end

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.580
and the educational
market for computing.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.240
So it was an obvious
partner for us.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.281
It had enough compute to
do what we wanted to do.

00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:56.100
It is the most popular
single board computer.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.939
Easy, easy thing.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
They're super cool.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.771
JAMES MCLURKIN: Yeah, they are.

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.271
And we got along famously.

00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.020
The cultures of Raspberry
Pi, what they're

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.561
trying to do with
education outreach,

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:06.740
what we're trying to do
with machine intelligence,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.980
basically to democratize
it, to commodify it,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.480
to make it as simple as putting
a Lego brick, or a servo,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.930
or a motor, you just take your
machine intelligence block

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.550
and you put it
onto your project,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.637
and you're ready to go.

00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:22.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now when
you first told me about this,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.730
I said, I want to put this to
the test as an education thing.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.040
So I knew some high school
kids, and some of these

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.690
were part of a robotics club.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.610
So we gave them
a bunch of these,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.290
and we gave them
some Raspberry Pis.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.550
And we gave them five days to
see what they would do with it.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.180
Should we take a look?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.596
JAMES MCLURKIN:
Let's take a look.

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:38.410
Cool.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.380
SPEAKER 2: We can
[INAUDIBLE] to turn left.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.227
Turn left.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.097
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.506
SPEAKER 2: Stop.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.890
SPEAKER 3: Pawn to D5.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.931
AI: [INAUDIBLE] takes D5.

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.182
Your move.

00:04:57.182 --> 00:04:58.640
SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
and it just takes.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.807
And then you go on.

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:02.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Shop for
a New York Mets jersey.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.186
SPEAKER 4: Candies.

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:11.644
SPEAKER 1: Giving
you two candies.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.761
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
we get plural as well.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:14.260
Nice.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.919
And red is my favorite, so I'm
glad I got a couple of reds.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:19.960
Pretty cool stuff, right?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.470
JAMES MCLURKIN:
That was awesome.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: Did any
of them jump out at you?

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.848
JAMES MCLURKIN: Well, so the
three favorites, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:26.332
are the walking robot.

00:05:26.332 --> 00:05:27.790
LAURENCE MORONEY:
[INAUDIBLE] cool.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.873
JAMES MCLURKIN: I used to
be a robotics professor,

00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:31.390
so anything that
gets up and moves

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.080
around is near and
dear to my heart.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.460
I also really liked
the shopping example,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.399
because that was a
pure software make.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.190
And I don't want people
to think that makes

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.480
have to be blocks and screws
and soldering and stuff.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.470
Making with software
is just as important.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.190
And connecting things
together with software

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.410
is critical, because that's
how the whole world works.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.580
But obviously, if you put
Lego and candy together,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.050
what could be better than that?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.822
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Exactly, life is good.

00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:08.530
JAMES MCLURKIN: And
the other thing there

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.630
is that there is sophistication
and subtlety there.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.720
But it has the look that,
well, anyone can do this.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.720
The robot's got all these
wires and crazy stuff.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.920
The software, all
the magic is hidden,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.980
and you can't see all
the delicacy there.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.680
But the Lego stuff, yeah.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.650
Maybe I could do that.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.050
Now of course it's
never that simple,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.750
and that's what you'll
learn when you go to build.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.970
But then when you get
working, the feeling

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.714
of accomplishment
and joy-- look,

00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:36.880
I built a little Lego thing.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.679
And you take it.

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:38.470
Put it on yourself.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.734
Any time you want some
candy, give me candy.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.400
LAURENCE MORONEY:
When she first told me

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.900
she was going to build
a candy dispenser,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.274
I thought she was buying an
off-the-shelf candy dispenser

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:48.490
and just pinning it and
then controlling that.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.240
And I thought, OK.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.900
It's kind of cool.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.650
It's kind of good.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.030
High school kids do that.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.405
And then she shows up with
the one that she made herself.

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.232
It was like jaw on the
floor kind of thing.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:56.610
JAMES MCLURKIN: So much better.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.235
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And it's just amazing

00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:00.630
what a bunch of kids, when
we gave them five days,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.500
were able to do.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.155
And it was like when we first
gave them this, it was like--

00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:04.780
you were there.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.280
We probably have
some footage of it.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.090
They were so quiet.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.710
They were a little intimidated.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.460
And then they just
went away and they just

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.130
started building
these amazing things.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.080
JAMES MCLURKIN: That's
the magic right there,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.900
to have this machine
intelligence.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.820
In these projects,
it was kind of

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.350
like a connector
between some input

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.600
that they've got in the
physical world and some output

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.460
that they've got in
the physical world.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.340
And to put that
machine intelligence

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.270
right in the middle is
exactly what we want to do,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.950
because right now,
machine intelligence,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.230
it really is everywhere, but
it's a very enterprise-y,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.920
big server, back end thing.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.722
And that's just not
how it needs to be.

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:42.680
And I don't even think
that's how it should be.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.500
I think that the
world would be better

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.290
when more people are building
more things that are smarter.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.060
And it was something
that you said right

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.768
at the beginning of
when we were talking.

00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:52.270
It was like, you
build engineers.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.620
JAMES MCLURKIN: Well,
so I used to actually

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.720
be directly in the
engineer creation business.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.730
I used to be a professor.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.250
And I didn't get to play
with any of the cool toys

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.920
as a professor.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.700
So my job was to live
in a lab with cool toys,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.760
and have my students build
stuff, do science, write

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.510
papers.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.310
But the engineering
supported the science.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.220
But what I always
kept coming back to

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.630
was that what I really
am enjoying doing

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.670
is building engineers.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.010
And I got distracted by
outreach programs, and things

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.900
in museums, and other
stuff that wasn't along

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.100
the straight and narrow
path of academia.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.360
And eventually I decided that
if I'm going to want to do this,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.411
I need better toys, basically.

00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:29.410
I need a bigger toy box.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: We
all need better toys.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.450
JAMES MCLURKIN: So
the path to Google

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.110
and then the serendipitous
path of this project

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.235
was just fantastic.

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:41.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
think with the experience

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.276
that we're just talking
about, just getting this box

00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:48.040
and open it up, and we see
it's a bunch of cardboard

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.264
components, and circuit
boards, and a button.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.680
Everybody loves
the button, right?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.960
JAMES MCLURKIN: Yeah,
the button's great.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.043
LAURENCE MORONEY: I like to just
take it out and play with it.

00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:57.590
JAMES MCLURKIN: We had to
fight so hard for that button.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.910
So we couldn't find it.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.250
The vendor wasn't there.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.010
It was late.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.170
We couldn't figure
out how to pay them.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.290
It was just so much
problem to get that button.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.464
But it's such a wonderful--

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.130
I'm shamelessly biased
about the button.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I think
everybody likes the button.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.820
As soon as you put it on the
desk, the first thing is people

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.153
reach over and press the button.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:17.290
JAMES MCLURKIN: So we have a
partnership with ITP at NYU.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.950
And that's a design studio.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.119
Their slogan is, I do believe,
the art of the newly possible.

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:24.910
So what's at the cutting
edge of technology

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.530
that they can get
their hands on,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.360
and then what does that mean
from a design point of view,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.860
and a user experience
point of view,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.989
and a human interaction
point of view.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.280
So we showed up to talk to
them about, here's our kits.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.400
Do you want to use them
in your summer class?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.700
Yes, we love it.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.540
And the first thing they said
was, look at this button.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.790
And they started
pushing on the button.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.047
Well this button has meaning.

00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:45.130
And they used a bunch of--

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.635
I'm an engineer.

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:50.860
So they're using a bunch of
very serious, UI, artsy words

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.500
that describe that
immediacy of it,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.750
the human interaction, and
things I didn't understand.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.650
But there is theory
about you see this

00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.650
and you want to push it.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.801
So that desire to
do it, now you can

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.550
use that to get the
thing to do something.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.547
And it pulls the
thing into the world.

00:10:06.547 --> 00:10:08.130
Basically, they like
the buttons, too.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:08.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:09.530
I just love it.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.970
I push it and say
candy, and I got candy.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.810
JAMES MCLURKIN: You see?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.685
LAURENCE MORONEY: It
was really, really cool.

00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:15.750
So back on the theme
of building engineers.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.150
So our experience was that
it worked really, really

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.190
well with that experiment.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.440
But what if people want
to do this for themselves?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.310
Where would they get started?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.410
How can they get going
in building one of these

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.500
by themselves?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.249
JAMES MCLURKIN: So
we're working on making

00:10:28.249 --> 00:10:30.000
it just as easy as possible.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.790
We are working to move these
things into retail chains.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.180
So the first batch, we
freely admit we totally

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.160
underestimated the popularity.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: They even
ended up on EBay right?

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.043
JAMES MCLURKIN: They
ended up on EBay.

00:10:41.043 --> 00:10:44.430
The kit in the States, I
want to say it was $14.95.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.930
It's an imported magazine.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.630
In the UK, I think
it was seven pounds.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.420
On eBay, $120 for this thing.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:58.230
So Adam Smith has spoken, and
the solution there is just

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.480
to crank up the factories.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.170
And we're during a second run.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.230
So soon, hopefully by
the time you see this,

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.320
there will be enough
to have everyone.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we
have a website where people

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.460
can go to find it,
and open source code,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.120
and all that kind of goodness.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.410
JAMES MCLURKIN: The website, the
documentation, the maker guide,

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.870
that sign-up sheet
for the waiting list,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.340
it's all available
on the website.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
AIY Projects with Google.com?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.160
JAMES MCLURKIN: There you go.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank
you so much, James.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.810
That was awesome.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.920
JAMES MCLURKIN: It's
been great being here.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.310
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And if you want

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.105
to learn more about
the AIY Project, please

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:23.230
take a look at the website.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.840
We've linked it in
the description below.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.310
If you've any questions
for me or if you've

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.195
any questions for James,
just please also leave them

00:11:28.195 --> 00:11:29.380
in the comments below.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.510
Thank you so much, James.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.950
JAMES MCLURKIN: Oh, it's
been a great time being here.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: And go
build something great, right?

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.261
JAMES MCLURKIN: Build
something awesome.
