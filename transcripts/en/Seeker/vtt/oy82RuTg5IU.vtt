00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.280
Girls are way nicer than guys.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.490
At least, that’s what the headlines say.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.160
The headlines actually say a lot of extreme
things when it comes to stories about science.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.180
Whether they’re writing about mass extinctions
or just how unhealthy it is to eat french

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.100
fries, there can be a lot of noise.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.100
So we made this show, Science or Fiction,
to take a look behind the headlines and find the facts.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.440
Can science show that women are nicer than
men?

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.109
Sure, there are nursery rhymes and anecdotes
about women being the kinder, gentler sex,

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.620
but the news makes it seem like there’s
actual data to back up that belief.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.780
So is it true?

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.180
Scientists have actually been studying the
behavioral differences between men and women

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.420
for a long time, like some sort of bad 1980s stand-up comedian.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.540
Comedians, they’re the worst, right?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.940
Specifically, there’s been a good bit of
research about whether women exhibit more

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.520
prosocial behavior than men.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
And guys, hate to say it, the data doesn’t
look good for us.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.200
Studies going back to the 1980s have found
that women are more kind, considerate, comforting,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.520
helpful and are more likely to share than
men.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.760
And this new study attempts to back all that
up by examining the way the pleasure centers

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.020
in our brain respond to behaving in an altruistic manner.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700
Now, the researchers ran their study a couple
of different ways.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.340
First, they used drugs.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.020
Not those kind of drugs.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.400
They used a dopamine inhibitor and a placebo.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.920
Participants were first given the placebo,
and then presented with a hypothetical situation

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.850
where they had to decide between keeping a
large sum of money for themselves or splitting

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.060
it with another person.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.380
Women went with splitting the money way more
than men did, 51% to 40%.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.840
They then repeated that task while taking
a dopamine inhibitor, basically cutting off

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.560
the chemical reward your brain would be giving
you for doing something nice.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.250
In that case, things were more evenly split
with 45% of women going for the prosocial

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.580
money-splitting option as opposed to 44% for men.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.280
Then the researchers did something really
cool.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
They used brain scans to analyze activity
in the brain’s striatum, which is where

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.890
our reward system plays out.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.100
And, as expected, women showed more activity
in the striatum when they decided to split

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.540
the cash, whereas men had more activity when
they kept all of it for themselves.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.940
Or, in other words, when women did the nice thing, their brains were rewarded by

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.560
upping their dopamine levels, where guys got the same reward for doing the more selfish thing.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.700
Guys, not looking good here.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.200
Now, there are some critics of the study.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.900
They point out that in the placebo trial,
only 51% of the women choosing the selfless

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.040
act doesn’t exactly make them all overwhelmingly
prosocial.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.860
And as for the brain scan part of the study?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.690
The data was pooled from two different groups that did not use the same type of brain scanner

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.200
and were asked to perform slightly different
tasks.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.120
Which isn’t really ideal for compiling data to come up with one conclusion.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.760
And there’s one criticism of the study that
even its authors agree with.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.020
Researchers point out that it is hard to say
just how much of an impact society and gender

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.650
roles play on women being kinder than men.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.060
This actually comes up in those older studies,
too.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.290
If we actively raise women to be kinder and
more compassionate than men, it makes sense

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.690
that this would affect the outcome of a study
like this.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.710
Of course, other researchers have tried to
account for these factors by comparing studies

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.840
on kindness from countries with less gender equality to those with a more egalitarian society.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.900
And the results, pretty surprising.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.040
A study in 2009 found that women in societies
that had more equal gender roles were even

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.440
more likely to be kinder and  more selfless than
men.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.800
Guys, I know that’s just one study but,
man, it’s not looking good for us.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.120
So these headlines might be a bit simplistic,
but they’re actually pretty consistent with

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.820
the data we’ve got on the situation, gender
roles aside.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820
Guys are meaner, but who gets sicker?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.200
Find out in this video here.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.959
And guys, I know what you’re thinking.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.959
We’re not all jerks!

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:30.959
We can be nice!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.180
Well, here’s your chance to prove it, tell us about something nice you did in the comments.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.520
And women, the guys may need help, so please leave some of your stories in there, too.
