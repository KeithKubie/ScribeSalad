00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.372
- What?

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.441
- I think he said,
on a scale of one to ten,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.177
how happy are you with
your service over at Doner?

I work there.

God damn it.

ten blood capsules on you.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.820
I keep on swallowing them.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.188
- Don't waste people's time,
sir.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.191
- You should be
ashamed of yourself.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.859
- Don't just eat
the blood capsules.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:00.827
Are you just swallowing them?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.828
- Yeah.
