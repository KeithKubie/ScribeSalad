GILBERT STRANG: I would like
you to see the big picture

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.060
of linear algebra.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.440
We're not doing, in
this set of videos,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.630
a full course on linear algebra.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.660
That's already on
OpenCourseWare 1806.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.230
And now I'm concentrating
on differential equations,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.550
but you got to see
linear algebra this way.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.670
And this way means subspaces.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.850
And there are four of
them in the big picture.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.470
And we-- previous video
described the column space

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.030
and the null space.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.730
Now, we've got two
more, making four.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.830
And let me look at this
matrix-- it's for subspaces--

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.720
and put them into
the big picture.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.570
So the first space I'll
look at is the row space.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.120
Now, the row space
has these rows--

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.150
has the vector 1,
2, 3 and the vector

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.600
4, 5, 6, two vectors there,
and all their combinations.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.730
That's the key idea in linear
algebra, linear combinations.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.760
So 1, 2, 3 is a vector in
three dimensional space.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.110
4, 5, 6 is another one.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260
Now, if I take all
their combinations,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.240
do you visualize that if I have
two vectors, and I add them,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.060
and I get another vector
that's in the same plane?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.500
Or if I subtract them,
I'm still in that plane.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.630
Or if I take five of one
and three of another,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.490
I'm still in that plane.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.590
And I fill the plane when I
take all the combinations.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.780
So the row space-- can I
try to draw a picture here?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.610
It's a plane.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.120
This is the row space.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.020
I'll just put row.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.750
And in that plane are
the vectors 1, 2, 3

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.540
and the vectors 4,
5, 6, those two rows.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.140
And the plane fills
our combinations.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.139
Well, I can't draw am infinite
plane on this MIT blackboard.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.200
But you get the idea.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.330
It's a plane.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.450
And we're sitting
in three dimensions.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.370
Now, the other--
so there's more.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.540
We've only got one-- a
plane here, a flat part,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.880
like a tabletop,
extending to infinity,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.710
but not filling 3D because
we've got another direction.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.390
And in that other direction
is the null space.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.870
That's the nice thing.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.680
So I would like to know the
null space of that matrix.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.980
I'd like to solve so the
null space, N of A-- I'm

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.200
solving Av equals all 0s.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.130
So some combination
of those three columns

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.720
will give me the 0 column.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.830
Let me write it
in as a 0 column.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.920
What could v be?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.380
What combination of that column,
that column, and that column

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.040
give 0, 0?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.320
Now, I know there are some
interesting combinations

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.750
because I-- only amounts to two
equations with three unknowns,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.620
v1, v2, v3.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.860
I want to multiply that by
v1, that by v2, that by v3.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.200
So I have three unknowns,
but I've only two 0s

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.390
to get, only two equations.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.470
And if I have three
unknowns and two equations,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.700
there will be lots of solutions.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.330
And I can see one.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.710
Do you see that if I add
that and that, I get 4, 10

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.090
And that's the same-- 4, 10
is the same as 2 times 2, 5.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.520
In other words, I
believe v equal--

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.280
if I took 1 of the first
and 1 of the third,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.000
and if I subtracted 2
of the second column--

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.380
so Av will give me 1
of the first column, 1

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.710
of the third column,
and subtracting

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.650
2 of the second column
will give me 0, 0.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.840
So here's my null space.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.230
My null space heads
off in this direction,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.000
in the direction
of 1, minus 2, 1.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.940
But, of course, I
get more solutions

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.300
by multiplying v by any number.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.200
10 times that vector would
still give me 0s and still

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.790
be in the null space.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.070
So I really have--
the null space

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.720
is a whole line of vectors.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.660
It's that vector and any
multiple of that vector.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.240
So it's a whole infinite line,
which is a one dimensional

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.560
subspace, the null space.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.180
So the null space
in my picture--

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.680
here is the null space.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.590
Well, it is not very thick is
it because it's just a line.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.140
So I'll call this
N of A, this line.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.400
Well, you see I'm trying to
draw a three dimensional space.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.720
That line goes both ways.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.560
But it's perpendicular
to the plane.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.570
That's the fabulous part.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.070
That's wonderful.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.640
This line, the null space, is
perpendicular to this plane,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.140
the row space.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.150
You want to know why?

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.840
You want to just see it?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.460
Because if I take A
times v, that would be 1,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.570
2, 3 times v. 1, 2, 3 is
perpendicular to that.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.560
How do I check perpendicular
for two vectors?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.750
1, 2, 3 dot product.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.760
1, minus 2, 1, the dot product
is 1 times 1, minus 2 times

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.910
2-- that's 4-- plus
3 times 1, that's 3.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.970
1 minus 4 plus 3 is 0.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.120
And, similarly, 4
minus 10 plus 6 is 0.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.760
So this is a right angle here.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.320
It's a right angle, 90 degrees
between those two subspaces.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.090
And again, in this
example, one space

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.740
is two dimensional, a plane.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.770
The other space is one
dimensional, a perpendicular

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.350
line.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.320
I can show with my
hands, but I can't

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.240
draw on this flat blackboard.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.800
I have the plane
going infinitely far,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.240
and I have the line
going perpendicular to it

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.290
and meeting, of course,
at 0-- at the 0 vector.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.630
That solves Av equals
0, and it also-- it's

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.690
a combination, a 0
combination of the rows.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.210
That's half of the big
picture, the row space

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.160
and the null space.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.330
Now, I'm ready for
the other half, which

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.010
is a second side of the
other-- the right-hand side

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.570
of the big picture contains
the column space first of all.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.440
So what's the column
space of that matrix?

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.460
So the column space
of a matrix, we

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.790
take all combinations
of those three columns.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.880
And that will fill out a space.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.958
Now, I have-- so I
take the vector 1, 4.

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:20.740
And I take the vector
2, 5, maybe there.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.980
And then I'm going to
also take the vector 3, 6.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.360
Well, I've got three columns.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.780
So I'm counting out 3, up 6.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.280
Good.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.410
Take those combinations of those
vectors, and what do you get?

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.590
This is a picture in
two dimensional space

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:45.620
because these columns are in
two dimensions, 1,4; 2, 5; 3, 6.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.860
When I take the combinations
of 1, 4 and 2, 5,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.050
those are in
different directions.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.700
The combinations already give
me all of two dimensional space,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.550
so the column space is the
whole space, including 0,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.120
0 because I could take 0 of
1 plus 0 of the other vector.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.570
And that third column can't
contribute anything new.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.260
It's sitting in
the column space.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.410
It's a combination of those two.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.030
But the first two
are independent.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.580
Their combinations
give the whole plane.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.290
So the column space
is the whole plane.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.180
Column space.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.070
There's not much room
for our fourth subspace.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.110
But the fourth subspace, in
this example, is quite small.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.929
Let me tell you about the
fourth subspaces then.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.179
So we know the
null space, N of A.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:50.020
And we know the column space,
C of A. The null space was

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.410
in this picture.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.840
The column space
was in that picture.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.810
Now, what about-- what's
the name for the row space?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.280
Well, if I transpose the
matrix, the row space

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.300
turns into the column space.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:12.680
Transpose rows into columns
of the matrix A transpose.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.970
So by transposing a matrix,
it turns these two rows

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.845
into two columns.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.080
And that's what I have here.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.600
The row space is the--
this is the column

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.890
space of the transpose matrix.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.510
I like it.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.840
I don't want to introduce a
new letter for the row space.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.440
I like having just column
space and null space.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.000
So I-- and I'm OK to
go to A transpose.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.770
Now, what's that fourth guy?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.080
Oh, just by beautifulness,
general principles of elegance

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.710
here.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.950
If I have columns space
and null space of A,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.440
and if I have column
space of A transpose,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.940
the fourth guy has to be the
null space of A transpose.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.510
Sorry, I wrote that
so small, so small.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.550
But I did write this
a little larger.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.400
The null space of A
transpose, all the w's

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.620
that solve that equation.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.490
A transpose w equals 0.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.130
The null space of A
transpose is all the w's that

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.370
solve that equation.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.610
What does that
equation looks like?

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.160
Ha!

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.850
Well, that equation--
A transpose

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.850
will have two columns.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.450
So A transpose-- this will
be w1 of the first column.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.450
1, 2, 3, when I transpose.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:50.560
And w2 of the second column,
4, 5, 6 equaling 0, 0, 0.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.180
Well, now I've got, for this
null space-- because my matrix

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:05.140
here is 2 by 3, for
this fourth subspace,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.700
I have three equations and
only two unknowns, w1 and w2.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.620
And, in fact, the
only solutions are

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.080
w1 equals 0, w2 equals
0, because that's

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.810
the only way I can get
combination-- that's

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.300
the only combination
of that vector

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.300
and that vector that gives
me 0 is to take 0 of that

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.926
and zero of that.

00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:36.780
Do you see that the-- in
this example, the null space

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.930
of A transpose is just--
null space of A transpose--

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.710
is just what I call
the 0 subspace.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.920
The subspace that has
only one puny vector

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.680
in it, the 0 vector.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.730
But that's OK.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.370
It follows the
rule for subspaces.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.640
And it completes the
picture of four subspaces.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:10.560
In other examples, we could
have all four subspaces nonzero.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:17.360
But we would have two over
here that, together, complete

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.880
the full N dimensional space.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.760
And over here, we have two that
together complete the full M

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.220
dimensional space.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.960
And here, for this matrix, M was
2, so that this is completed.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:38.910
The column space was
all of R2 in this case.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.990
All of two dimensional
space was the column space,

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.340
and that didn't leave any
room for the left null space,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.350
the null space of A transpose.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.370
So do you see that picture?

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:54.380
Let we may be just sketch it
once more with a clean board.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.360
So I have the row space.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.560
Let me draw it maybe going
this way, the row space.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.820
And perpendicular to
that is the null space.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.450
That's in-- we're
here in N dimensions,

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.000
and they are perpendicular,
those spaces.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.220
And then, over here, I
have the column space.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:36.450
And perpendicular to that
is the left null space.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.370
And we're here in M dimensions.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.200
Those are our four subspaces.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.220
And they have-- they sit in N
dimensional space, two of them,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.980
two of them in M dimensional
space, perpendicular.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.250
And I could tell you something
about their dimensions.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.260
So this row space, in that
example, was two dimensional.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.440
It was a plane.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.310
In general, the
dimension equals--

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:15.480
let's say R. That's an important
number, the rank of A. Oh,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.280
that's a key number.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.880
Maybe, I better speak separately
about the rank of a matrix.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.290
But I'll complete the idea here.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.560
So the dimension
of the row space

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.230
is the number of
independent rows.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.440
And I call that number
R. And the beauty

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.410
is that this has
the same dimension.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.410
Dimension Is also
the rank R. Can

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.660
I say that wonderful
fact in a sentence?

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:53.150
The column space and the row
space have the same dimension.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.490
The number of independent
rows equals the number

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.200
of independent columns.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:06.740
That's like a miracle for a
giant matrix, say 57 by 212,

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.290
there might be 40
independent rows.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.880
Then, there would be
40 independent columns.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.950
And then the null space
and the left null space

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.940
have the remaining dimension.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:26.600
So the null space has dimension
N minus R because, altogether--

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.730
together they have dimension N.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:35.540
And this has dimension M minus
R because, together, they

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:41.560
have dimension M. That's the
picture with the dimensions put

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.220
in.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:49.540
And let me say a little more
about the idea of dimension

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.290
in a separate video.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.040
Thank you.
