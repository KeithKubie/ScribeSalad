00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:04.504
Opposers, it is awards season,

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.707
and I'm not talking about that
elitist tux rental pyramid scam,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.544
the Emmy Awards, who've ignored
this show for years

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:15.381
just because
"it wasn't on television."

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:19.252
FYI, we've been airing
our radio show, Mouth Justice,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.587
on the dark web for decades,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.991
and their awards
are more more prestigious.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.860
Also, they're stuffed
with opioids and tiger horn.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:31.330
I'm also not talking about
Saturday night's D.C. wank fest,

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.999
the White House
Correspondents' Dinner,

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.601
where comedian Michelle Wolf
violated traditions

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:39.739
and norms by telling jokes.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.709
(laughter,
cheers and applause)

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:46.379
I...

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.481
I don't even know
what she was thinking.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.350
You don't speak truth to power.
That's bullying.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.021
You tell power how good
it looks, and then you move on.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:58.524
No, I'm talking about the only
award season that matters:

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.893
Nobel Peace Prize season.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.329
It must be time to give it out,
because everyone's talking

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.065
about the clear favorite:
Donald "Diplomacy" Trump.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:07.333
(laughter)

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.502
South Korea's president says

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.505
that President Trump should win
the Nobel Peace Prize

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.041
for his efforts
to end the standoff.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.443
President Trump,
if he can lead us

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:20.046
to ending the Korean War
after 70 years,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.747
deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.786
That's very nice.
Thank you.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.988
-(applause and cheering)
-That's very nice.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.324
-Nobel. (chuckles)
-KLEPPER: Nobel.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.692
Nobel.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.595
Listen to that crowd!
Give him a Nobel!

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:39.665
That's actually how the winner
is chosen, via applause-o-meter.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.601
(laughter)

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.002
It's little known fact--
Henry Kissinger

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:46.172
won his when a crowd went
ape-shit at a Pistons game.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.640
(laughter)

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.709
Now the Nobel committee needs
to act now.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.577
They should have already
given Trump the Nobel

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.979
for his response
to Charlottesville,

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.815
when he had the vision to see
good people on both sides.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.583
(audience sighing, groaning)

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.585
I mean,
that's peace through tolerance,

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.255
and Trump can tolerate shit
you wouldn't believe.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.956
(laughter)

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.125
Now if you've been living
in a cave for the last year,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:10.363
which I recommend you do
to avoid their oxygen,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:15.001
you might be wondering how Trump
earned this latest peace prize.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.970
Watch him bring an olive branch
to the North Korean crisis.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.605
WOMAN:
 "Kim Jung-Un of North Korea,

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.041
 who is obviously a madman."

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:26.012
Rocket man is on
a suicide mission for himself.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.247
MAN: "North Korea has just
launched another missile.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.816
Does this guy have anything
better to do with his life?"

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.319
MAN 2: "Why would Kim Jung-un
insult me by calling me "old,"

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.188
when I would never call him
"short and fat"?

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.056
Ooh!

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.660
Now that's a tactic the Kennedy
School of Government would call,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.528
"Choke on this tweet, biatch."

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.096
(laughter)

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.398
Yeah.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.967
(applause and cheering)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.136
Look it up.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.539
It's called "insult diplomacy,"
and it has always worked.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.541
Like when Reagan told Gorbachev,

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:57.577
"Your mama's so fat,
tear down this wall!"

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.312
(laughter)

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.646
And look, it's working again.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.148
Look at these two love birds.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.617
North Korea and South Korea,
coming together again.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.185
And who made it happen?

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.554
King of the clap back--
Andrew Dice Trump.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.590
(laughter)

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.426
And no one is modest...

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.095
(laughter)

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:17.697
...like the Dice Man.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.599
They were saying,

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.534
"What do you think, uh,

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.703
President Trump had
to do with it?"

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.972
I'll tell you what.
Like, how about everything?

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.240
PEOPLE:
Yeah!

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.108
-Yeah.
-Yeah! -(groaning, laughter)

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.445
Trump has everything
to do with everything!

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.548
Korean peace talks,
*NSYNC's Hollywood star,

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:38.551
America's victory in Vietnam,
everything.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:42.521
Bottom line-- this is how
you change the world.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.124
Insults, burns, mockery.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.393
Those are
in the diplomat's toolbox.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:50.830
And whoever masters that gets
that big, fat Swedish nickel.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.100
Oh, my God.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.035
I just realized it.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:59.805
Someone is coming
for Donald's peace prize.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:03.876
Mike Pence is what happens
when Anderson Cooper isn't gay.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.046
Fox News is here, so you know
what that means, ladies.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.247
Cover your drinks.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.815
(slow, distorted speech):
Trump is so broke,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.351
he grabs pussies
'cause the thinks

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.354
there might be loose change
in them.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.223
I'd say to Michelle Wolf,
"Hallelujah, girl.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.425
You should be the one
getting the Nobel Peace Prize."

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.294
(slow, distorted speech):
You should be the one

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:25.064
-getting the Nobel Peace Prize.
-KLEPPER (yelling): No!

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:28.200
No! No!

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.202
(applause and cheering)

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.338
No, Michelle. No.

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.308
Stop acting like a president!

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.343
You want to steal the Donald's
peace prize?

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.512
This is war!
The fight continues.
