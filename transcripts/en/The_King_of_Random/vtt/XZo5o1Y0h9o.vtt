00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.600
What's up guys welcome back, thanks for joining us today on the king of random in the past

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
We've shown you how to make your very own backyard foundry using a metal bucket and this stuff called kaowool

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.699
Well this has worked out great. We've used it for a whole bunch of different projects and today

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
We're going to try and upgrade and build ourselves a larger foundry using this bigger

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.149
31 gallon trash can. The basic principle is that we have our metal trash can which will contain the heat nicely,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
but it's very conductive and would easily let the heat escape out into the air, so we have this stuff called kaowool,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.520
which is a very good insulator holds the heat in extremely well in fact you can put a blowtorch on one side of this and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.529
your hand on the other side won't even feel it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.220
I don't think it's even warm after that...

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.200
So that's the plan. We'll line the whole can with the kaowool that way, we'll have the metal container

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.800
Which contains everything and the kaowool will hold in the heat.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.060
Now that we know we're gonna do,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.975
let's get started.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.500
A quick note about the kaowool

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.629
It's a fiber substance a lot like fiberglass

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.629
So it's very irritating if it gets on your skin

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.529
Or especially if you breathe it in, so I'm going to be wearing a dust mask and that's why I have this long-sleeve shirt,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.599
So it doesn't make my arms all itchy there we go

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.110
Hopefully that'll keep me from breathing in too many fibers as a first step

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.299
I want to add a lining at the bottom of our trash

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.579
can I'm going to set the trashcan on top of the kaowool and then trace around that I'll cut that circle out and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.710
That will go in the bottom of our can

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.669
All right, we've got our circle cut out now. We're just gonna push that down into the bottom of our trash can

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.330
Now the kaowool is at the bottom of our trash can and that will insulate really well

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.869
But it's not very stable surface if we want to rest up on it here

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.679
We've got some compressed ceramic fiber board that will work as a stable base

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.259
It's a type of board that insulates really well and since it's rigid

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.288
It should be better for standing things on than just the kaowool

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.849
Now I probably want to cut this just a little bit inside of wearing mark because the very bottom of the trash can is just

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.699
The tiniest bit wider than the inside bottom of the trash

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.490
I suspect so we'll have a little bit of play?

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.779
Maybe if I cut it too small, but that'll still be better than having to be too big and not fitting

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.430
Alright, there's a circle that looks pretty good. Let's see if that fits in the bottom of our can ah

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.310
It's beautiful!

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.310
There we go a nice flat surface

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.540
That'll be much nicer and trying to balance stuff on unstable kaowool alright now

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.970
I'll try and take our kaowool and line the entire inside of it to figure out how much of this kaowool

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.620
I'm going to need them just gonna put the whole roll down in the can and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.630
Then I'll unroll it onto the sides as much as I can and then mark where I want to cut it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.140
Sort of start with it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.450
inside there

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.760
get a nice and pressed up against the sides

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.970
of course the trash can is not a perfect cylinder, so it is a little bit wider at the top and the bottom

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.820
I'm gonna try and account for that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.690
Alright, I'm gonna take my marker and mark

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.779
I'm gonna give myself some extra that I can later trim off as I do fine-tuning without all the weight of the extra kaowool

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Getting in my way

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.460
Nothing's the trashcan is like I said very slightly tapered

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.139
Ideally our kaowool will would have a slight arc to it to fit perfectly around the edge

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.159
We're just going to fake it a little bit by cutting one sided a bit of an angle

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And I think we'll get a pretty good fit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
So I did the rough cut before

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Now I'm going to see I

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.220
Can get that a little bit more refined you can see that the edges are overlapping by quite a bit at this point

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.859
This is where one side is so I'm going to mark that right there, and the other one is right here

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.770
and once again

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.990
I am going to give myself a little bit extra because it's better for it to overlap some than for there to be gaps

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.399
Right see how we did it is overlapping just a little bit

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.680
Which like I said, it's not a problem. Just take some squishing and persuasion there. We go that looking pretty good right there

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.299
The main body of the can is lined so now let's quickly cut out a piece the right size and shape for our lid

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.359
Wonder if a knife would be easier than scissors, so I'm just gonna try that and see if I like it any better

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.470
As you can see I am leaving an inch wide gap

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.989
That's the same thing that we did with our smaller foundry

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.310
This way when we push it into the lid it will have a little bit of pressure on it and help hold it in place

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960
There we go

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.099
Hmm, I don't think it's gonna compress enough with that extra border I left on it

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.439
This lid has an interesting shape to it. There's a lip that extends off of the edge

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.099
I think by adding an additional inch to what was already added by the lip my kaowool is now too wide to fit inside

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.919
the inner area of this circle

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.939
So I'm gonna cut it down just to where I measured it with the marker and see if it fits any better

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.709
All right now we've got our slightly smaller circle. Let's see if that fits into our lid any better. Oh, yeah

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.790
That's exactly what you want

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.870
Being pushed in a little bit. It's not so tight that it won't fit

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.560
But it's big enough that it's still got some pressure holding it in

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.079
Hey, that's what we're hoping for and let's give it a try throwing it on our hand

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.110
Beautiful that should be one

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.629
Insulated trashcan at this point now

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.249
We've got the walls and the lid covered in our insulating kaowool and for now it's holding himself on really well

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.180
But with our mini foundry

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.389
Overtime as it got heated up and cooled down and heat it up and cooled down time after time the kaowool

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.530
Lost some of its rigidity and began to slump a little bit, so I've got some hardware

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.079
And I'm gonna use that to attach the kaowool to both the lid and the sides of the trashcan a little bit so that down

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080
The road we don't run into that problem

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.419
The machine screw that I'm using here is a little longer than I need so I might end up replacing it later

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.250
That should hold it up pretty nicely now. I'm going to do the same thing at three points on the lid

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.909
Now no matter how much structural integrity this kaowool it should hold itself on pretty well, it's attached

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.170
Now we've got a very well insulated trashcan, but no way to add heat

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.240
So let's drill some holes into the sides and the lid so we have a place for the propane heat to go in and for

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.260
Some ventilation to go out

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.659
I'm gonna try and make the holes in our large foundry at the same height off the ground as the holes under mini foundry that

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.439
Way the wooden blocks that we use to support the burners will work at the same height

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.089
Plus if we have anything that's just on the bottom of our foundry. We'll know that it's getting the heat that it needs

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.760
Well that's smooth

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.950
Turns out a hole saw is not the very best tool for cutting through very thin steel

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.640
But it's what I've got so let's try it on the other side

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
That actually almost won smooth

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.169
All right just as an experiment to see if you try and use a hole saw on Kol what happens

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:36.028
Still not perfectly but much better

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.339
With those holes added I think our full size backyard foundry is ready to test with heat now

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:49.979
I do have a concern that the spacing of the hose with these was designed with the mini foundry in mind

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.860
And I'm not

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.639
Positive they'll stretch out far enough to really angle the way we want them to on the large trash can we'll see what we can

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:58.639
do

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560
You might be alright

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:06.649
Alright, I did get both of them in and slightly angled

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:08.958
But as you can see the hose is being pulled really tight

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:11.359
And I don't think it's gonna cause any problems for our test

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.339
But we'll probably want to add a little bit extra hose before we use this foundry for any extended amount of burning

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.890
Whoo

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.890
That gets toasty quick

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.650
You can see that the burners aren't angled quite as much as it should be that's partly because our hose isn't long enough

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.250
So while it is heating it up pretty? Well. It's not really

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.189
Circling around quite as much as we like it to let's so the lid on and let this thing get really warm

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.240
Turned off I'm just gonna see oh

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:16.700
Ah that is toasty in there like the fire is not going but it still just really really warm

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.190
Inside there there you go that is how to make a large-scale backyard foundry. There are a few different things

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.350
We're thinking of trying with this foundry. It's obviously much larger than our normal backyard foundry which is gonna

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.850
Let us do a few more things with it

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.319
We'll be able to fit a large crucible, and we also might try firing some ceramics in this Forge

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.340
I also took some of our leftover cable, and I realign the mini furnace

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.069
And I was impressed at how easy it is to do that it only took me a couple minutes to completely replace the lining this

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.760
Is a great little furnace you can build and use and if the kale will get so old that's falling apart

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.549
It's very easier place in just a few minutes

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.020
I'm really looking forward to trying out some experiments with our large foundry to see what it can really do

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.109
Thanks for joining us for this project and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.140
Seems like a Captain America shield and this one's like a Captain cotton shield

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.440
not a very good shield

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.390
Hey guys. I hope you're having a great day. You are awesome

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.169
You are appreciated, and I know everyone over here on my team is really grateful for you

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.830
Thanks so much for choosing to watch and support our videos. We'll see you in the next one
