[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:04.800
BRETT KUPREL: I'm Brett Kuprel.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
I'd like to tell you
about some of the work

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.899
we're doing at Stanford on skin
cancer image classification.

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.440
This project has
been a collaboration

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.150
between the Artificial
Intelligence

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.720
Lab and the medical school.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.560
So, let me warm
up with some facts

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.830
to motivate the
threat of skin cancer.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.900
It's the most common cancer
in the United States.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.480
One in five Americans
will develop skin cancer

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.940
at some point in their lifetime.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.610
And in 2017, it's
estimated that there

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
will be 87,000 new
cases of melanoma, which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.680
is the deadliest
form of skin cancer,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
and almost 10,000
deaths from it.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.400
Fortunately, there is
good news, there's hope.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.650
The survival rate
for melanoma is 98%

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.440
if you can detect it early on.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.870
Also, by 2020, it's
estimated that there

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.820
will be $6.1 billion smart
phones in circulation globally.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.330
So, this collaboration
began a couple of years

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.340
ago when a dermatologist
at Stanford

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.012
saw the recent breakthroughs
in computer vision.

00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:07.470
And he e-mailed the director
of the Artificial Intelligence

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.190
Lab.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.850
And he said, if your program can
differentiate between hundreds

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.240
of dog breeds, I believe it
can make a great contribution

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.300
to dermatology.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.210
So, the first step to
making a contribution

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
is acquiring a data set.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.020
So, we have acquired a data set
of almost 130,000 images spread

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.176
out over 2000 diseases.

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:35.550
We worked with
the medical school

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.570
to clean it up and put it into
this nice taxonomy, a subset

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.020
of which is shown here.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.810
So, in this taxonomy, you can
see green nodes and red nodes.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.242
Green is safe, red is
dangerous, black is deadly.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.700
And there's also
some orange nodes,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.140
which could go either way.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.259
It's not clearly a binary task.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.800
So, on the next
couple of slides I'll

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.150
show some benign and
malignant lesions.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.880
So here's some
malignant lesions.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.160
Here's some benign lesions.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
So, you can kind of see
flipping, back and forth,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.140
a visual distinction.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.610
But there's also
some lesions that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.670
are very similar between the
two, which I highlighted green,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.080
for instance.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.910
OK, so now we have a data
set, next up is to train it.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.760
We find that training
on finer classes

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.407
results in better performance.

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:31.990
So, if you consider
the figures shown,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.180
if we train on the green nodes,
we actually train on more--

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.220
like 700 of them--
but just, imagine

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.109
we trained on the green ones.

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.150
At inference time, we
would sum the probabilities

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.710
up the tree to the red nodes,
the classes of interest.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.260
And then further, if we're
interested in a binary task

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.700
of distinguishing malignant
melanoma from its binary

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.475
look alike--

00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:57.200
from its benign look alike,
melanistic benign lesions,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.530
we would renormalize the
probability sum to 1.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.900
And this is consistent
with Bayes' rule condition

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.390
on the information,
that the disease

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.230
is one of two things, not one
of all the nine red nodes.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.410
So, we found that we got the
best performance by fine-tuning

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.646
an [INAUDIBLE] pretrain model.

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.270
We tried a few
different architectures.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.260
We train with AlexNet, VGG
Inception, versions one

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.040
and three.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.740
We found Inception version
three worked the best.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.800
We also tried feeding with a
spatial transformer network,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.430
because many of our images have
lesions taken from far away.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.560
We didn't find
improved performance,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.570
and using Occam's Razor,
we just didn't use it.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.330
So, the next step is evaluation.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.420
We used two metrics to
compare with dermatologists--

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.090
sensitivity, which is known
as the true positive rate,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.180
and specificity, known as
the true negative rate.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.470
So, we show the doctors--

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.180
dermatologists-- a bunch of
images of benign and malignant

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.170
lesions.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.090
We can then calculate
their sensitivity

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.370
as the percent of
malignant lesions

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.710
they were shown that they
ordered a biopsy for.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.950
Similarly, the specificity is
the percent of benign lesions

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.410
they were shown that they
did not order a biopsy for.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.420
And if they ordered
a biopsy, it goes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.010
to a pathologist, which results
in a near-perfect diagnosis.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.100
And for a network, we
actually, for a classifier,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.760
we output a malignant
probability.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.220
So, imagine we fed the
same images through,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.720
and we got the
probabilities as shown.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.810
Then the sensitivity
would be the percent

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.480
of malignant lesions that falls
to the right of some chosen

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.620
threshold.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.690
Similarly, the specificity would
be the percent benign lesions

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.910
that lie to the left
of the threshold.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.360
And in this
particular threshold,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.310
it would be a
sensitive classifier,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.480
because almost all
malignant lesions lie

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.030
to the right of the threshold.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.800
And we can vary this
threshold to get

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.000
a whole range of sensitivity
and specificity pairs.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.360
So, doing that, we
get these results

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.830
on three different tasks.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.230
So, the first task is the most
prevalent type of skin cancer.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.180
Second task is the
most dangerous type

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.060
of skin cancer versus
its look alike.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.930
And the third task is the
same as the second task,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.790
except it's using
dermoscopy images, which

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.440
are taken with a dermoscope.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.740
It's a special device that
shines polarized light

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.680
at the lesion to expose
underlying layers of tissue.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.720
And you might think that
dermoscopy is harder,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.950
but, no, it's just a completely
different set of lesions.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.500
And we also see that
the dermatologists don't

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.820
do as well in that data set.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.390
So, let's see how the
dermatologists do.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.910
So, this is the most
important slide.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.860
We can see, for one, the line is
more jaggedy than the previous,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.530
and that's because this is
a subset of our test set.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.990
Dermatologists have
important things to do.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.299
They can't just classify
thousands of images.

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:57.340
We can do it really fast.

00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:01.520
Another thing you
notice is dermatologists

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.100
are actually widely varied
in their performance.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.690
Anyway, from these
plots, we conclude

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.160
that we have achieved
dermatologist level performance

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.420
at skin lesion image
classification of skin cancer.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.390
So, here's some confusion
matrices on a nine way

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.740
classification task.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.190
It's interesting to look at
these to see the similarity.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.050
One thing you might
notice is that we often

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.520
mispredict inflammatory.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.130
It's such a broad category.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.440
Another thing you can notice
is that dermatologists

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.060
will err on the side of guessing
a benign lesion is malignant

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.230
than the malignant
lesion is benign.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.640
Because that would
be a deadly mistake.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.280
And you can see
that from this box.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:59.110
OK, so I brought a demo
of this classifier.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.740
So this one-- I can't
actually read the text, but--

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.490
Yeah, you can see it's
malignant pigmented.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.730
Let's do a couple of these.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.620
This one's epidermal malignant.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.910
There, that's probably good.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.470
Don't want to embarrass myself.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.510
So, I just want to say I'm
honored at how well received

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.220
our work has been.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.280
It's remarkable that Andre
and I didn't know anything

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.200
about dermatology
going into this,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.520
and I think that's kind of
the spirit of deep learning.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.250
You can just get a
large enough data set

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.380
and feed it through Google's
latest image classifier.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.510
Fine tune it, let them do all
the hard work, take the credit.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.790
And it's just a really amazing
time to be an AI researcher,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.530
as evidenced by three
covers of "Nature" dedicated

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.490
to breakthroughs in artificial
intelligence, two of them

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.740
here at Google.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.580
I just wanted to comment a
little bit on the future of AI

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.170
applied to dermatology.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.840
And I think this could also
apply to other skin diseases.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.360
But there will be increased
access, because a lot of people

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.151
might have access to
a smartphone who don't

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:11.460
have access to a dermatologist.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.410
Also, it will be more convenient
to classify your lesion,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.300
and because it's
more convenient,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.460
it will hopefully lead
to earlier detection.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.400
And the survival
rate is much better

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.457
when you detect it early.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.520
Thank you.
