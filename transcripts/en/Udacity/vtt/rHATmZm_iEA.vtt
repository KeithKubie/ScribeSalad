00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.330
Okay.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.230
What do you think is the right
answer to this one, David?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.980
&gt;&gt; So what I said is that it looks like
there's a 180 degree rotation going on.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.460
So this frame is rotated 180
degrees to get this one.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.400
So I'm going to take C,
rotate it 180 degrees to get number six.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.140
&gt;&gt; That's a fair answer, David.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.180
Well done.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.940
But notice there is another
possible answer here.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.230
Two is also a possible answer.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.260
Why is two a possible answer?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.740
Because one can imagine that
B is really a reflection of

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.730
A across a vertical axis, and
that way if we think of a vertical

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.640
axis on C, then two will be the
deflection/ of C on the vertical axis.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.500
So both two and
six are good answers here.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.400
And one question will then become,
which one do humans pick,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.670
do they pick six or do they pick two?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.268
And second which one
should an AI program pick?

00:00:57.268 --> 00:01:00.160
Six or two, and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.000
how would you make sure that the AI
program picks two or six, and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.500
if you are thinking I am going to give
you the answer, sorry to disappoint you.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm going to leave this as a puzzle for
you.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.060
Your AI program will
address this problem
