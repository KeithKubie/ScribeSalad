00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
not workable and I think some pieces of

not workable and I think some pieces of
that<00:00:58.769><c> may</c><00:00:59.070><c> very</c><00:00:59.100><c> well</c><00:00:59.519><c> not</c><00:00:59.729><c> be</c><00:00:59.790><c> workable</c><00:01:00.299><c> and</c>

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
that may very well not be workable and
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.729 align:start position:0%
that may very well not be workable and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
some pieces of that I think are showing
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.940 align:start position:0%
some pieces of that I think are showing
what<00:01:05.309><c> what</c><00:01:06.090><c> the</c><00:01:06.240><c> next</c><00:01:06.420><c> phase</c><00:01:07.200><c> of</c><00:01:07.320><c> our</c><00:01:07.440><c> economy</c>

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
and so we have to be careful that we
don't<00:01:29.969><c> you</c><00:01:30.600><c> know</c><00:01:30.719><c> kill</c><00:01:31.049><c> the</c><00:01:31.170><c> patient</c><00:01:31.609><c> by</c>

don't you know kill the patient by
 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.910 align:start position:0%
don't you know kill the patient by

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
curing you know one one piece of this
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
curing you know one one piece of this
this<00:01:35.399><c> problem</c><00:01:35.960><c> so</c><00:01:36.960><c> I</c><00:01:36.990><c> think</c><00:01:37.380><c> it</c><00:01:37.770><c> is</c><00:01:37.829><c> a</c><00:01:38.009><c> good</c>

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 align:start position:0%
this problem so I think it is a good
 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.380 align:start position:0%
this problem so I think it is a good
thing<00:01:38.429><c> that</c><00:01:38.490><c> the</c><00:01:40.249><c> Obama</c><00:01:41.249><c> administration</c><00:01:42.119><c> is</c>

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 align:start position:0%
thing that the Obama administration is
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 align:start position:0%
thing that the Obama administration is
recognizing<00:01:43.380><c> that</c><00:01:43.469><c> this</c><00:01:43.590><c> is</c><00:01:43.799><c> really</c><00:01:44.219><c> nuanced</c>

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is really nuanced
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is really nuanced
this<00:01:45.090><c> isn't</c><00:01:45.390><c> just</c><00:01:45.539><c> about</c><00:01:45.689><c> fixing</c><00:01:46.380><c> the</c><00:01:46.710><c> auto</c>

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about fixing the auto
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about fixing the auto
industry<00:01:47.429><c> per</c><00:01:47.609><c> se</c><00:01:47.850><c> but</c><00:01:48.210><c> that</c><00:01:48.390><c> it's</c><00:01:48.539><c> a</c><00:01:48.659><c> whole</c>

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
industry per se but that it's a whole
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
industry per se but that it's a whole
ecosystem<00:01:49.380><c> and</c><00:01:50.130><c> system</c><00:01:50.520><c> together</c>
