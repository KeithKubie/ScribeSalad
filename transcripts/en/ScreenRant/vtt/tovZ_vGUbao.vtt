00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Listen, we all love Disney and Pixar, they've probably made more classic films than any other studio.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.600
We grew up loving the work the did, like virtually everyone alive.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.420
But that doesn't mean they get everything perfect. Every once in a while they make a film with a plot hole

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.460
so big, it could ruin your enjoyment of the movie, if the movie wasn't so darn good otherwise.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.700
Nevertheless, we're going to point out a few of the mistakes to see if you recognise them.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.840
Here are ten Disney plot holes that everyone ignores.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.800

And before we start, can you guess this movie from these emojis? Stay tuned for the answer at the end of our video.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.860
scary feet scary feet scary feet oh the kid's awake

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.560
Monsters University

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.200
Monsters University takes the characters we know and love from Monsters Inc. and reveals how they first met

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.300
At the Oozma Kappa fraternity of Monsters University, at least thats what this prequel would have you believe

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.949
the original film Mike Wazowski tells

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.570
Sully you've been jealous of my good

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.920
luck since the fourth grade panel

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.229
apparently Pixar tried to workshop a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.850
version of the script in which these two

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.010
characters met in fourth grade and then

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.840
reconnected in college but it just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.460
didn't work so you're just gonna have to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.100
put up with the inconsistency sorry

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.560
hey ham! look i'm Picasso! eh I don't get it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.540
Toy Story

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.090
part of the plot of toy story is that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.920
all of the toys know that they're toys

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.720
which is why they all freeze in their

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.850
place when humans come around them.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.409
This rule is complicated when Buzz Lightyear

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.450
arrives fresh from the toy store and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.009
doesn't seem to realize that he's not

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.380
actually a Space Ranger as his packaging

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.570
would suggest and yet when Andy or his

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.759
mother enters the room was still freezes

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.220
in place what do you think should Buzz still

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.750
be flying around in the presence of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.180
humans? How do toys actually learn that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.740
they're toys in the first place?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.340
The Little Mermaid

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.440
In the little mermaid Ariel

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.450
makes a deal with the evil sea witch

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.729
Ursula to go gain human legs and try to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.070
win the kiss of her true love Prince Eric

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.049
the catch is that she must trade her

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.939
beautiful voice for her new set of legs

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.979
so when she arrives on land she's unable

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.229
to tell Eric who she is but we already

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.690
saw Ariel read and sign the contract

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.890
laid out for her by Ursula

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.960
she lost the use of her voice not

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.850
her hand so why can't she just write

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.260
down her feelings for Eric?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.080
We will be sending a real dragon to retrieve Mulan

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.080
What... What?! I'm a real dragon!

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.960
Mulan

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.180
At the beginning of this Disney classic Mulan

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.230
disguises herself as a man and joins

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.420
the army to save her elderly father from

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.310
being drafted but it doesn't seem all

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.830
that simple Mulan is almost sent home

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.330
after failing to meet the physical

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.370
requirements of her captain Lee Shang

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.739
but she persevered and gets to go to war

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.050
with the boys. The only problem is if the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.940
young Mulan almost failed to meet the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.380
physical requirements of these soldiers

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.780
than her feeble elderly father almost

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.700
certainly wouldn't have made it so why did

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000
she even bother to sign up ?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.200
Genie of the lamp

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.100
Aladdin

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.500
In Aladdin the villain

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.510
Jafar wants to get a hold of the genie

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.850
in order to become the Sultan himself he

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.739
claims that the genie's magic is much

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.630
more powerful than his and that's why it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.220
would be necessary to wish his way to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.470
the top. But Jafar's magic already

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.959
seems pretty powerful to us he even uses

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.600
his weird serpent-y staff to transform Aladdin

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.220
Back into a peasant after the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.440
genie turns into a prince it seems to us

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640
like it wouldn't have taken much more

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.530
magic than that to work his way to the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.510
top would the genie really have made

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.560
things that much better for him?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.560
So this is love

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.180
Cinderella

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.260
We all know how Cinderella

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.760
ends after midnight Cinderella and her

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.770
magic pumpkin carriage are transformed

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.660
back to their original states after she

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.400
flees from the ball in terror of being

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.620
found out for who she really is but the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.840
prince upon finding a lost glass slipper

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.700
at the ball searches the land for the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.920
woman whose foot will fit inside but why

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.930
didn't the slipper also disappear at

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.150
midnight what do you think is there a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.650
better explanation for how this

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.460
fairytale ends? sorry boys I don't tangle

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.820
Sorry boys I don't sing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.180
Tangled

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.760
for most of Tangled our long haired

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.840
heroine Rapunzel is as blond as can be Though the hair turns brown whenever it's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.760
cut off from her head presumably this

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.080
has something to do with the hairs

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.360
magical healing properties however at

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.430
the end of the film Eugene slices off

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.110
all of her hair in order to prevent her

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.150
from being kidnapped by the evil Gothel

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.370
this time all of her hair turns brown

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.989
including the hair that's still attached

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.240
to her head how did this happen she got

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.080
a haircut not a dye job

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.680
What is dinner without a little music?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.520
Music?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.800
Beauty and the Beast

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.920
According to the lore of Beauty

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.900
and the Beast the prince was cursed at

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.950
the age of 11 when he was still a boy

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.990
yet when Belle is exploring the house

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.790
she discovers a portrait of the Prince

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.920
as a handsome human man torn to shreds

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.630
by the bitter peace but how did this

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.610
portrait get made if he was transformed

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.410
into a beast at the age of 11 it is

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.300
possible that it's a Dorian Gray type

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.130
painting showing the Beast how he would

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.480
look if you weren't trapped in the body

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.950
of the beast but that should have been

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.320
explained that there were the case.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.440
Please just stay away from me stay away

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.460
Frozen

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.460
When Elsa's powers are revealed

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.680
in Frozen the whole town is horrified

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.610
thinking that their queen is some kind

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.919
of monster this causes Elsa to flee to

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.600
her ice castle in the mountains where

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.700
Anna must come to find it but after the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.800
sisters defeat the evil Hans the town

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.320
cheers for her. Why? She's done nothing to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.480
change their minds about her powers they

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.400
didn't even know that Hans was plotting

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.480
against Anna and Elsa

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.580
from the beginning what do you think did

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.380
the town's folk have ample reason to

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.380
rally around their queen in the end?

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.800
The Incredibles

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.720
the villain in

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.960
The Incredibles, Syndrome, has video cameras

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.150
installed all over his island. He also

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.620
has a bunch of henchmen who have been

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.360
fighting with the Incredibles and so they

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.710
should have been familiar with their

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.510
powers they should have known for

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.950
example that Violet would have been able

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.780
to use her force field to interfere with

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.760
the electronic devices used to hold down

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.170
the Incredibles while they were imprisoned

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.270
on his island and yeah well that's

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.400
exactly what she does

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.130
That's all for
