00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.150
There are actually several ways in which
Objective C can be characterized as more

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.950
dynamic than Swift.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.470
The second has to do with how objects
are bound to the methods they invoke.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.380
In Swift, method binding or method
resolution happens at compile time.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.760
In Objective C,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.270
methods in the objects invoking
them are not bound until runtime.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.290
Let's imagine another array
holding objects of multiple types.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.820
This time we have objects belonging to
the classes Puppy, Drum and Dealer.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.970
Now let's imagine that we choose
an item from this array and

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.310
invoke the method, play.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.050
Now, these three items actually
implement the method play in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.550
three different ways,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.640
which play the code is referring
to isn't known at compile time.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.710
Coupling of method and
object doesn't happen until runtime.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.250
And if we look in
the console we see Frolick.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.490
Okay, that was Spot, the Puppy.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.440
And if we run it again we see,
Here's a card.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.390
Okay, that was the Dealer.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.070
And if we run it again,
we see ba-doom-cha, that was the Drum.
