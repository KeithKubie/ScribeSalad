00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.850
Where we left off in the last
video, we saw that things were

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.540
already starting to get ugly.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.180
As early as October of 1789 we
saw the Women's March where

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.710
there were these suspicions
that the royals were

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.690
hoarding the grain.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.310
So they marched to Versailles
and they essentially stormed

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.530
Versailles and forced the
royals, forced Louis XVI and

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.460
Marie-Antoinette to move
back to Paris.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.710
Then things continued
to be tense.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.030
There were uprisings.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.260
The king didn't know
what to do.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.270
He obviously didn't like
the situation.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.020
People became more and more
suspicious of the king.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.640
Nobles were leaving the country,
they were emigrating

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.410
out of France.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.720
The king and queen themselves
started to get paranoid that,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.860
gee, you know, maybe people have
even more radical notions

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.660
than this constitutional
monarchy.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.200
Maybe we ourselves
should escape.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.220
So then we saw in 1791-- and let
me write this all down in

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.900
a timeline.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.950
We're now in 1791.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.000
And this is review of
the last video.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.135
June, we saw the royals
try to escape.

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:09.070
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.280
But they're captured in Varennes
and they're sent back

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.470
to Paris to essentially
to be in house

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.170
arrest in the Tuileries.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.375
This is the building
right here, it

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.400
doesn't exist anymore.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.380
But if you go to Paris and if
you visit the Louvre, you'll

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.660
see the Louvre opens across
the street into

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.520
the Tuileries Garden.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.410
And this is where that
building used to be.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.070
So the royals end up in house
arrest at the Tuileries.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.220
This was in June.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.230
Then, in July in 1791, once
again, all review from the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.340
last video.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.740
People said, hey they tried to
escape, that's equivalent to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.060
abdication of the throne.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880
They don't even want to be our
king and queen and we don't

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.840
need kings and queens
to begin with.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.780
So the most radical elements,
the most radical leftist

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.140
elements, in particular the
Jacobins, they started getting

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.115
petitions in the Champ-de-Mars
to essentially get people to

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:12.760
say, we don't need a
royalty anymore.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.860
We just need a republic.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.550
We need a state without
kings and queens.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.610
But then, the National Assembly
sent in some troops.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.490
Things got ugly.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.630
Rocks were thrown, shots were
fired, 50 people died.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.495
And you have the Champ-de-Mars
Massacre.

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:37.260
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.840
So things are really,
really heating up.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
And then we saw at the end of
1791, to make things even

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.070
worse, we're not even
at the end.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:58.530
In August, we had the
Declaration of Pillnitz, which

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.740
we saw was the rulers of Austria
and Prussia saying

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.570
that they don't like
what's happening to

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.250
the royals in France.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.330
And for obvious reasons.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.020
Well one, Leopold II was the
brother of Marie-Antoinette.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000
But even more profound, they
didn't like this notion of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.150
people rising up against
royalty.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.010
That might give people in their
own empires, or in their

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.460
own countries ideas about
what to do with them.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.220
So even though this might have
not been taken seriously, this

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.920
was just a declaration
by these guys.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.440
This made people in France
even more paranoid.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.580
Now, while all of this was
happening, you might have

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.990
remembered the Tennis Court
Oath that occurred

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.800
several years ago.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.320
Where they said we promise
to create a constitution.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.660
And so a constitution
does get created.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.880
So in 1791, the National
Assembly, or the constituent

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:01.010
assembly, actually does create
a constitution of 1791, which

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.820
establishes France as a
constitutional monarchy.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.480
So they're saying, yeah, we'll
still have a king.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.870
But it'll be more of
a figure head.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.910
Not necessarily someone
who can create laws.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.050
The National Assembly will
be responsible for that.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.410
The king will get a few
abilities to veto legislation

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.920
and whatnot.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.795
But most of their powers
are removed.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.810
So this was a constitutional
monarchy.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:35.990
 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.400
And it's really along the lines
of what was already

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.360
going on in Great Britain.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.610
But this, on some levels, it's
a major achievement.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.610
They had that oath to create
a constitution.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.300
But on a whole other level,
things are getting so ugly in

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.800
France, and in particular,
in Paris.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.330
The Revolution was really
focused on what was going on

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970
in Paris and Versailles.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.370
Things were getting so ugly that
this is the starting to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.190
become a sideshow.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
And to some degree, the
revolutionaries have gone

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.690
beyond wanting just a
constitutional monarchy.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.930
They're starting to think about
wanting a republic.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.530
We saw that during the
Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.470
People started signing
signatures to

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.240
actually have a republic.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.820
And then were fired on, which
probably makes them want to

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.020
have a republic even more.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.660
Now the other thing you might
remember from the very first

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.620
video, is the thing that really
precipitated this whole

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.460
Revolution.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.750
Or at least in my mind, one
of the main things that

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.180
precipitated this whole
Revolution is

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.345
that France was broke.

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:37.730
And people are going hungry.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.950
This is happening the whole
time while all these

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.800
politicians and revolutionaries
and royalties

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.240
are moving around and
trying to kind of

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.040
strategize their position.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.110
No one has solved
either of these

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.020
problems the entire time.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.460
There is no money in France.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.740
There is a famine, people
are going hungry.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.010
And so pretty much everyone,
whether you look at Louis XVI,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.660
let me look at him again, it's
always nice to remember what

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.420
he looked like.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.340
Whether you're talking about
Louis XVI, who's now in house

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.480
arrest. Or whether you're
talking about many of the

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.040
revolutionaries, everyone starts
to say, gee, how can we

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.890
solve this problem?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.500
People are going to throw us
out if we don't solve this

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.470
problem of hunger
and being broke.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.500
So as you'll see in history many
times, the best solution

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.240
for that, or the perceived
best solution,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.620
is to start a war.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.790
So they declare war
on Austria.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.380
And if you think about it from
Louis XVI's point of view, he

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.660
thought of it as kind of
a win-win situation.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.530
If the war is successful, and he
kind of threw his weight

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.450
behind the war.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.480
And this happened-- let me
write down the dates.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.640
That always helps me frame
where it happens.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.110
So this was kind of ending 1791,
and then war is declared

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.860
in April, this is now 1792.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.670
And then this, right
here, is in April.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.700
And if you think about it,
this was a win-win, or at

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.120
least from Louis XVI's point
of view, it was a win-win.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.630
If they did will well in the
war, it might make him more

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.380
popular, might make
him stronger.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.890
They might be able to plunder
the wealth of other countries

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.000
to help to build France's
coffer.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.260
If the war goes badly and France
loses, then what's

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.860
going to happen?

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.110
Then you're going to have
Austria and probably the other

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.940
people you're at war with.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.840
We'll see very quickly, France
is going to be at war with

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.580
most of the powers of Europe.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.890
But if you lose the war, these
powers, which are controlled

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.160
by monarchs, they're going to
essentially get rid of the

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.640
revolutionaries and probably put
Louis XVI back in power.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.220
So from Louis XVI's point of
view, it was a good idea.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.380
And for a lot of the
revolutionaries, they wanted

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.570
to solve these two problems. So
they said, hey yeah, that

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.630
would be good if we could
plunder other countries.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.710
If we could steal grain from
other countries to make at

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.310
least the French less hungry.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.390
And maybe we can spread
the Revolution.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.510
We can topple all of
these other kings.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.225
This won't just be a French
Revolution, this will be an

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:05.210
all of Europe Revolution.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.120
So they declared
war on Austria.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.150
Very quickly, they tried
to attack the Austrian

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.140
Netherlands, which was
kind of disjoint

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.410
from the rest of Austria.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.240
So they attacked right there
into the Austrian Netherlands.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.230
Although they got kind
of bogged down there.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.200
It wasn't as successful as
they thought it would be.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.310
And Prussia, which as you might
remember, participated

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.470
in the Declaration of Pillnitz,
decided to enter the

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.830
war on the side of Austria.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.289
So Prussia attacks and at first,
it's pretty, pretty

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:38.850
successful.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.679
It's able to make some
headway into France.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.650
And then the general in charge
of the Prussian army, the Duke

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:54.110
of Brunswick, he makes the
Brunswick Manifesto.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.360
Let me write that down.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:03.110
 

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.020
Which is essentially just like
the Declaration of Pillnitz,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.500
but it has a lot more
teeth behind it now.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.960
Because this dude, the Duke of
Brunswick, he's actually, he's

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.820
got an army invading France.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.320
And he declares, his manifesto
is saying, I intend to

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.810
overthrow this whole
revolutionary government.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.710
And I intend to install
the king again.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.680
 

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.020
All of this happened
in April of 1792.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.440
Declare war on Austria seemed
like a win-win for the king.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.760
The revolutionaries wanted to
spread the Revolution and

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.250
plunder other countries.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.640
And then immediately, Prussia
jumps in, starts attacking

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.790
France, and says we're going
to install the king.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.640
So you could imagine, this is
making the revolutionaries

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.970
even more paranoid about
what the king is up to.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.920
They think that the king has
some type of secret deal with

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.100
the Prussians, or with the other
enemies that they're

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.240
going up against. So in August
of 1792, it's only a few

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.090
months later, four or
five months later.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.980
In August of 1792, you
essentially had

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.420
the Commune of Paris.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.790
And when I say the Commune
of Paris, it's really the

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.590
government of Paris
at this time.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.140
And it's been taken over by
even more revolutionary

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.650
people, mainly Jacobins.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.190
And they storm where the royal
family is staying, at the

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:31.550
Tuileries, which is that
building right here.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.950
And this painting right here
is a depiction of the

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.930
revolutionaries, mainly
Jacobins, who are actually

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.200
storming the Tuileries.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.600
And they imprison Louis XVI
and Marie-Antoinette.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.790
Because they're like, hey the
Prussians have an army, and

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.630
they've already declared the
intention to install the king.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.090
We're going to imprison the
king because we don't know

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.740
what he's up do.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:11:04.742
So they imprison-- my spelling--
imprison Louis XIV

00:11:04.742 --> 00:11:07.480
and Marie-Antoinette.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.380
And they're also able to do some
machinations within the

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.000
actual National Assembly.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.970
And there's actually a rump
session of the National

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.800
Assembly, which means
that a lot of the

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.170
opponents weren't there.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.720
So it was a session where it was
mainly the leftists, the

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.100
radicals, the Jacobins
were there.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:31.200
And so in August at that rump
session, the assembly declares

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.450
a republic.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.540
 

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.630
Which is equivalent to
saying that Louis XVI

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.930
is no longer king.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.530
And this nation we have, or this
country we now have, will

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.510
never have a king.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.590
It is now a republic.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.990
It as a government
without a king.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.450
And while all of this was
happening, you have these

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.640
gangs kind of going around
the region around Paris.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.240
And they're just trying and
killing people that just seem

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.820
to be suspicious, seem to be
allied in some way with the

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.650
nobility or with the king, or
in someway a royalist. They

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.340
want eventually for the
monarchy to come back.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.400
And in those riots, in those
arbitrary executions and

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.020
killings, they actually ended up
killing over 1,400 people.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.910
1,400 executed at this time.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.880
So you can see, things
are getting uglier

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.945
and uglier and uglier.

00:12:22.945 --> 00:12:24.220
The king is imprisoned.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.430
And you're going to see that
he's not going to be

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.140
imprisoned long.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.910
But it's not going to
end well for him.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.030
And essentially, the
revolutionaries have said

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.590
France is now a republic.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.110
All while they're at war with
two major powers, with the

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.920
Austrians and the Prussians.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:45.950
Now they are eventually able
to hold off, and when I say

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.740
they, I'm talking about
armies of France.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.890
They are eventually able
to hold off the

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.590
invading Prussian army.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.230
They call it the Stalemate of
Valmy, not clear who won.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.960
The Prussians weren't that
eager to go into France.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.190
So they didn't push too hard or
send too many more troops.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.480
So for at least temporarily,
the external threat was

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.130
diffused, if you want
to call it that way.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.270
And so the National Assembly
went forth and said-- they got

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.430
rid of-- I mean, they had
already declared a republic.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.100
But they went even further.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:24.890
So this is now, we're in
September of 1792.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.480
You had the Stalemate
at Valmy.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:34.970
 

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.700
And then the National Assembly,
or the National

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.010
Convention said, hey, we're
going to create a new

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.780
constitution.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.440
So that constitution of 1791
did not last too long.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.900
It lasted about a year.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.840
So a new constitution.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.740
The intent is to create
a new constitution.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:00.480
Now, while all that's said,
this bloodshed that we saw

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.740
after they imprisoned Louis XVI,
these kind of riots in

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.320
Paris and these arbitrary
killings, this is just a

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.550
foreshadowing of much worse
that's going to come in the

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.410
very next year.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:16.940
By 1793-- let me write this
down in a bloody color.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.990
So 1793 we're in now.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.760
So the National Assembly, the
first thing that they do, or

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.650
maybe I should say even
more particular.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:35.480
In January of 1793, remember
they've already deposed the

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.080
king, they have him imprisoned,
they're at war

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.410
with these other countries that
have stated the intention

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.460
to put the king back
into power.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:51.210
So the first thing they do is
they execute Louis XVI.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.950
And this is a picture
of the execution.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.820
He was guillotined.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.810
And this right here is
Doctor Guillotine.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.160
And it was actually invented,
this right here is the

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:08.430
guillotine, and it was actually
invented as a more

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.690
humane way to kill people.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.310
At the time they said, when we
kill people, it's not for them

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.750
to feel pain, it's more
to just kill them.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.270
So we'll use this very humane
instrument called the

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:20.800
guillotine.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.710
Where you use a blade
to very quickly chop

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.720
off someone's head.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.010
And it was invented by this
physician right here.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.430
But, the one of the first
important people they got to

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.560
try it out was Louis XVI,
guillotined in January.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.970
And then in February, remember
people are still going hungry,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.920
they're still eager to spread
the Revolution, they still

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.400
want to plunder other
countries.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.840
So in February, the National
Assembly, or the National

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.650
Council, the revolutionary
government, declares war on

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.905
Britain and the Dutch
Republic.

00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:06.530
 

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.570
You don't know who this
is, I'm going to

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.200
tell you in a second.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.145
And Dutch Republic.

00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:15.730
Now you're probably saying, gee,
how does France, this one

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.930
country right here, how is it
able to have war against

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.460
Austria, Prussia?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.740
Now declaring war against the
Dutch and Great Britain.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.150
And actually the month before,
Spain and Portugal had

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.770
declared war, had kind of
jumped in on the side of

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.540
Austria and Prussia.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.930
So how does this one country,
France, how does this one

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.500
revolutionary government fend
itself off against the armies

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.380
of so many nations?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.250
And the answer to that is that
the revolutionary government

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.360
declared in February what they
called the Levee en Masse.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.965
And I'm not French, so I'm
saying it wrong, I'm sure.

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:54.070
 

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.160
Which was essentially the first
version of what we now

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.450
call the draft.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.620
And they were able to actually,
they actually said

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.190
every able-bodied young man in
France who was unmarried will

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.710
now be in the army.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.160
And so they were able to
immediately raise several

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.400
hundreds of thousands
of soldiers.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.869
And actually within a couple
of years, there's several

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.410
accounts of it, but it might
have been over one million

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.550
plus soldiers.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.220
Which is very different from
how many of these other

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.730
kingdoms would raise
their armies.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.819
They would pay salaries to
professional soldiers.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.410
So these at the time were
smaller armies than what

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.490
France was able to muster up
through the revolutionary

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.680
government saying look, this is
a government for the people

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.560
by the people.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.180
So now you're not fighting
for a king, you're

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.860
fighting for yourself.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.200
You're fighting for your own
representation so you don't

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.100
get so subjected by
foreign kings.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.050
So everyone jumped in
the war effort.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.220
So they essentially had the
largest army in Europe.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.510
But I keep repeating, all of
this was in the context of

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.440
unrest throughout France.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.640
There were royalists out there
wanting to be counter

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.500
revolutionaries.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.780
People were going hungry.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.990
So to kind of, I guess, clamp
down on things, in April of

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:16.580
1792, the National Assembly
created the Committee of

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.020
Public Safety, which sounds like
a very nice committee.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:26.020
 

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.920
And they essentially become the
default government, or we

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.100
can say the de facto
government.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.640
And it was put in control of
this nice looking gentleman

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.610
right here, Maximilien
Robespierre.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.390
Seems like a very civilized
fellow.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:50.840
 

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.530
But really what the Committee
of Public Safety was good at

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.510
was being hugely political,
hugely paranoid.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.010
And under especially Maximilien
Robespierre's

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.460
control, who was especially
paranoid, anyone-- if they

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.290
just caught a whiff of someone
being not radical enough, or

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.360
maybe too radical, or someone I
just didn't like, or someone

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.760
who might help depose me--
they just started

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.190
guillotining people.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.695
So this is really the start
of the Reign of Terror.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:27.110
 

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:33.910
So roughly over the next year,
on the order of, give or take,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.960
16,000 people are guillotined.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.350
They go to Doctor Guillotine's
humane invention.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.520
And they are only estimates
of this.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.750
There wasn't good accounting
of this.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.100
But it's believed that as many
as 40,000 people were

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.330
summarily executed.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.550
Which essentially means you're
guilty of this, I know you're

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.260
guilty, hey, you over there with
a gun, please shoot this

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.230
person for me.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.190
So this was an extremely
bloody time.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.150
And just so you imagine, most
of this was occurring in and

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.060
around Paris.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.950
So all of a sudden, in one
little city, it was a major

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.940
city, but you have tens of
thousands of people being

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.480
massacred, just if this guy, or
the people who are plotting

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.640
with this guy, or the people who
are plotting against this

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.650
guy, thought or caught a whiff
of you being not completely

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.950
loyal to the Revolution.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.220
Now eventually, people
eventually got suspicious of

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.540
Maximilien Robespierre.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.950
They're saying, hey, all your
paranoia is hurting the

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.340
Revolution more than
helping it.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.720
So then in the Thermidorian
Reaction-- it sounds like it's

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.580
some type of a refrigerator
or heater.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:44.510
 

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:54.330
Now this right here, this
is in July of 1794.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.900
And it's called the Thermidorian
Reaction, and I

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.830
might do a whole video
on this, because the

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.830
revolutionary government,
they actually

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.220
created a new calendar.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.140
Where they renamed the month
Thermidor, which was

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.490
essentially July, it was
shifted a little bit.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.660
And actually, it changed the
number of hours in the day.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.040
They would have 10 hours a day,
100 minutes an hour, 100

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.010
seconds a minute.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.800
They would have three 10-day
weeks per month.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.980
So they had this
whole calendar.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.100
But Thermidor was the
month of July.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.430
So it was really the July
Reaction, where people got

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.420
sick of Maximilien
Robespierre.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:31.190
So in 1794, July 1794, he too.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.120
So what goes around
comes around.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.630
So this right here, this
is 1794, July.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.720
This right here is this
nice-looking gentleman, and

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.330
he, too, gets guillotined.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.010
Now, there's two other things
that I want to point out.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.160
I'll take a few steps
back into 1793.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.290
Just as a maybe a bit
of a footnote.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:59.170
We saw that in January Louis XVI
was executed for, I guess,

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.530
depending on your opinion
whether it was a

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.730
good or a bad thing.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:08.640
In October Marie-Antoinette
also executed.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.330
 

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.800
So this is in 1793,
also executed.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.670
So nine months after her
husband, executed.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.520
And then as one kind of small
footnote at this point, as you

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.890
can imagine, all of France was
in unrest at the time.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.930
And then in 1793, there
was a revolt.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.730
This was in July of 1793.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.450
So it's a year before the end of
the Reign of Terror, really

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.460
during the Reign of Terror.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.170
In the port of Toulon, there
was a revolt against the

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.560
revolutionary government.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.160
And it was put down, mainly with
the help of an aspiring

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.070
artillery captain.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.710
An artillery captain is someone
who's essentially in

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.220
charge of the cannons.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.670
And that artillery captain, who
was able to help put down

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.970
that revolt, and get a lot of,
I guess, cred with the

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.640
revolutionary government, his
name was-- I need to write it

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.750
someplace nice and new, and this
is for foreshadowing of

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:15.550
the next video-- so in July
of 1793, in Toulon, a new

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.740
artillery captain started to
look like he really knows what

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.640
he's doing.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:25.400
And his name is Napoleon
Bonaparte.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.670
And he's going to have a lot
to do with the next video.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.170
