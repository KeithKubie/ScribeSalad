00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.215
I remember one morning
when I was in the third grade,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.870
my mom sent me to school
with a Ghanaian staple dish called "fufu."

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:22.451
(Laughter)

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:26.690
Fufu is this white ball of starch
made of cassava,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:31.079
and it's served with light soup,
which is a dark orange color,

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:33.337
and contains chicken and/or beef.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.908
It's a savory, flavorful dish

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:39.155
that my mom thought
would keep me warm on a cold day.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.219
When I got to lunch
and I opened my thermos,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:45.320
releasing these new smells into the air,

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.763
my friends did not react favorably.

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:49.236
(Laughter)

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.585
"What's that?" one of them asked.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.392
"It's fufu," I responded.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:55.431
(Laughter)

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.791
"Ew, that smells funny.
What's a fufu?" they asked.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.953
Their reaction made me lose my appetite.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.556
I begged my mother to never
send me to school with fufu again.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.086
I asked her to make me sandwiches
or chicken noodle soup

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.868
or any of the other foods
that my friends were eating.

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:14.606
And this is one of the first times

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.073
I began to notice the distinction
between what was unique to my family

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:21.960
and what was common for everyone else,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.560
what was Ghanaian and what was African

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:27.879
and what was American.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:30.760
I'm a first-generation American.

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:32.520
Both of my parents are immigrants.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:36.798
In fact, my father, Gabriel,
came to the US almost 50 years ago.

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:38.985
He arrived in New York

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.579
from a city called Kumasi
in a northern region of Ghana,

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:43.787
in West Africa.

00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:47.713
He came for school, earning
his bachelor's degree in accounting

00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:49.641
and eventually became an accountant.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:53.738
My mother, Georgina,
joined him years later.

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:55.821
She had a love of fashion

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:58.872
and worked in a sewing factory
in lower Manhattan,

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:02.600
until she saved up enough to open
her own women's clothing store.

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.457
I consider myself an American

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.846
and an African

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.024
and a Ghanaian.

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:11.946
And there's millions of people
around the world

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.804
who are juggling
these different classifications.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:22.122
They might be Jamaican-Canadians
or Korean-Americans or Nigerian-Brits.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.188
But what makes our stories
and experiences different

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:30.485
is that we were born and raised
in a country different than our parents,

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.658
and this can cause us to be misunderstood

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:36.731
when being viewed through a narrow lens.

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:41.548
I grew up in New York, which is home
to the largest number of immigrants

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:43.061
anywhere in the United States.

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.624
And you would think growing up
in a place like New York,

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:50.233
it would be easy for a first-generation
person to find their place.

00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:53.129
But all throughout my childhood,

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:56.583
there were these moments
that formed my understanding

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:58.578
of the different worlds I belonged to.

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:02.341
When I was in the fifth grade,
a student asked me

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.719
if my family was refugees.

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.180
I didn't know what that word meant.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.942
He explained to me
that his parents told him

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.986
that refugees are people from Africa
who come to the US

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.656
to escape death, starvation and disease.

00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:20.868
So I asked my parents,
and they laughed a bit,

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:24.358
not because it was funny
but because it was a generalization.

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:27.299
And they assured me that they had
enough to eat in Ghana

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:29.763
and came to the US willingly.

00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:31.316
(Laughter)

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.695
These questions became
more complex as I got older.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.546
Junior high school was the first time

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.943
I went to school with a large number
of black American students,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:44.549
and many of them couldn't understand
why I sounded differently than they did

00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:47.606
or why my parents seemed
different than theirs.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.788
"Are you even black?" a student asked.

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:53.274
I mean, I thought I was black.

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:54.948
(Laughter)

00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:57.474
I thought my skin complexion settled that.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:58.705
(Laughter)

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.845
I asked my father about it,
and he shared his own confusion

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.473
over the significance of that
when he first came to the US.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:10.003
He explained to me that,
when he was in Ghana, everyone was black,

00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:11.840
so he never thought about it.

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:14.452
But in the US, it's a thing.

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:16.618
(Laughter)

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:19.705
But he would say, "But you're African.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.062
Remember that."

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:22.598
And he would emphasize this,

00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:27.217
even though many Africans in the continent
would only consider me to be

00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:28.511
just an American.

00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:32.945
These misconceptions
and complex cultural issues

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.117
are not just the inquiries of children.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.143
Adults don't know who immigrants are.

00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:40.120
If we look at current trends,

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:42.787
if I asked you: What's the fastest-growing

00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:45.391
immigrant demographic
in the United States,

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:46.803
who would you think it was?

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.637
Nine out of 10 people
tell me it's Latinos,

00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.740
but it's actually African immigrants.

00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:53.891
How about in academics?

00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:57.214
What's the most educated
immigrant demographic?

00:04:57.754 --> 00:05:01.993
A lot of people presume it to be Asians,
but it's actually African immigrants.

00:05:02.017 --> 00:05:03.673
Even in matters of policy,

00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:06.596
did you know that three
out of the eight countries

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.019
in the so-called "travel ban"

00:05:08.043 --> 00:05:09.296
are African countries?

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:14.050
A lot of people assume those targeted
Muslims only live in the Middle East,

00:05:14.074 --> 00:05:16.669
but a lot of those
banned people are Africans.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:22.116
So on these issues of education
and policy and religion,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.595
a lot of things we presume
about immigrants are incorrect.

00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:31.764
Even if we look at something
like workplace diversity and inclusion,

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:34.822
if I asked you what
gender-ethnicity combination

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:38.854
is least likely to be promoted
to senior managerial positions,

00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:40.308
who would you think it was?

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.626
The answer is not Africans this time.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.776
(Laughter)

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.076
And it's not black women or men,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.516
and it's not Latin women or men.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.719
It's Asian women who are
least likely to be promoted.

00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:56.248
Capturing these stories and issues
is part of my work

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.105
as a digital storyteller

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.399
that uses tech to make it easier
for people to find these stories.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:07.836
This year, I launched an online gallery
of portraits and firsthand accounts

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.717
for a project called Enodi.

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:16.253
The goal of Enodi is to highlight
first-generation immigrants just like me

00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:20.240
who carry this kinship
for the countries we grew up in,

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.430
for the countries of origin

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:26.374
and for this concept called "blackness."

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:32.461
I created this space to be a cyberhome
for many of us who are misunderstood

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:34.817
in our different home countries.

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.338
There are millions of Enodis

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.081
who use hyphens to connect
their countries of origin

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:43.266
with their various homes in the US

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.620
or Canada or Britain or Germany.

00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:50.098
In fact, many people
you might know are Enodi.

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:53.586
Actors Issa Rae and Idris Elba are Enodi.

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:55.314
Colin Powell,

00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:57.917
former Attorney General Eric Holder,

00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:00.437
former President of the United
States, Barack Obama,

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.393
are all the children of African
or Caribbean immigrants.

00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:05.724
But how much do you know about us?

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.413
This complicated navigation

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:14.701
is not just the experience
of first-generation folks.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.699
We're so intertwined

00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:22.676
in the lives and culture of people
in North America and Europe,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.410
that you might be surprised
how critical we are

00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:27.425
to your histories and future.

00:07:28.153 --> 00:07:30.431
So, engage us in conversation;

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:33.128
discover who immigrants actually are,

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:36.298
and see us apart from characterizations

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.204
or limited media narratives

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:40.589
or even who we might appear to be.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.371
We're walking melting pots of culture,

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:47.645
and if something in that pot
smells new or different to you --

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.764
(Laughter)

00:07:49.788 --> 00:07:51.378
don't turn up your nose.

00:07:52.043 --> 00:07:53.267
Ask us to share.

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:55.058
Thank you.

00:07:55.082 --> 00:08:00.123
(Applause)
