00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:02.159
- So let's get a little bit more comfort

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.525
in our understanding of what

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.904
a differential equation even is.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.518
So here we have a differential equation.

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:11.126
We haven't started exploring how we find

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:13.611
the solutions for a
differential equations yet.

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.132
But let's just say you saw this,

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:16.958
and someone just walked
up to you on the street

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.964
and says, "Hey, I will give you a clue,

00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:21.764
"that there's a solution to
this differential equation

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.733
"that is essentially a linear function,

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.801
"where y is equal to mx plus b,

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:28.420
"and you just need to figure out

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:31.300
"the m's and the b's,
or maybe the m and the b

00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:35.054
"that makes this linear function

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.592
"satisfy this differential equation."

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.098
What I now encourage you to do,

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:43.007
is pause the video and
see if you can do it.

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:44.084
So I'm assuming you have paused it,

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.181
and had a go at it.

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:47.640
So let's think this through together.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.247
If we know that this kind of a solution

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:51.526
can be described in this way,

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:52.597
we need to figure out
some m's and b's here.

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:54.792
This is telling us that if we were to take

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.986
the derivative of this with respect to x,

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:59.048
if we take the derivative of
mx plus b with respect to x,

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.639
that that should be equal
to negative 2 times x

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.367
plus 3 times y.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:06.614
well, we know y is this thing, minus 5.

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.846
And that should be true for all x's,

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.843
in order for this to be a solution

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:12.230
to this differential equation.

00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:13.318
Remember, the solution to
a differential equation

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.359
is not a value or a set of values.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.202
It is a function or a set of functions.

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:22.747
So in order for this to satisfy
this differential equation,

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:25.463
it needs to be true for
all of these x's here.

00:01:25.463 --> 00:01:26.679
So let's work through it.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.126
Let's figure out first what our dy dx is.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:31.839
So dy dx.

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:34.533
We'll just take the derivative
here with respect to x

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.676
dy dx is derivative of
mx with respect to x,

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:39.448
is just going to be m.

00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:41.561
And of course derivative
of b with respect to x,

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.694
just a constant,

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:43.757
so it's just going to be zero.

00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:46.951
So dy dx is m.

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.243
So we could write m is
equal to negative 2x,

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.339
is equal to negative 2x,

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:57.378
plus 3 times, and instead
of putting y there

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.798
I could write mx plus b.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.112
Remember y is equal to mx plus b.

00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:03.723
And just as a repeated reminder,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.735
this has to be true for all x's.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:10.842
mx plus b, and then of
course we have the minus 5.

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.546
So if you weren't able to
solve it the first time,

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.608
I encourage you to start from here,

00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:20.791
and now figure out what
m and b needs to be

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.842
in order for this
equation right over here,

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:27.501
in order for this to be true for all x's.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.974
In order for this to be true for all x's.

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:32.262
So assuming you have paused again

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:33.899
and had a go at it, let's just keep

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.338
algebraically manipulating this.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.601
I'll just switch to one color here.

00:02:37.787 --> 00:02:39.643
So we have m.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.437
m is equal to negative 2x plus,

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:45.704
if we distribute this
3 we're going to have

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:50.704
3mx plus 3b, and then of course
we're going to have minus 5.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:53.630
And now we can group the x terms.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.808
So if we were to group,
if we were to group ...

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:59.111
Let me find a new color
here, maybe this blue.

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:02.456
So if we were to take these
two and add them together

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:05.955
that's going to be
negative 2 plus 3m times x,

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:10.955
or we could write this
as 3m minus 2 times x,

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.675
and then you have your constant terms,

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:15.161
so you have these terms right over here,

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.733
so plus 3b minus 5,

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:20.985
and of course that's all
going to be equal to m.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:23.709
That's going to be equal to m.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.716
Now remember, this needs to be true,

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:29.258
this needs to be true for all x's.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:31.592
So notice, over here I have

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:35.110
some coefficient times x
on the right-hand side.

00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:38.024
But on the left-hand side I have no x's.

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:40.759
So somehow, this thing must disappear.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.982
This is a constant, so
it's completely reasonable.

00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:46.005
It's completely reasonable
that this constant

00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:48.695
could be equal to m.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.609
But the only way that I
get these x's to disappear

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.005
so all I'm left with is an m,

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.507
is if this thing is equal to zero.

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.584
Let me say that again,

00:03:57.584 --> 00:03:59.213
because I think it may be a little bit

00:03:59.213 --> 00:04:01.474
counter-intuitive what I'm about to do.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:04.306
We're saying that m, some constant value,

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.485
is equal to some coefficient times x,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:08.822
plus some other constant value.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.898
Well, in order for a constant value

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:13.146
to be equal to a coefficient times x

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:14.550
plus some other constant value

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.803
the coefficient on X
must be equal to zero.

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:20.302
Another way to think about it is,

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.885
this should be,

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:23.684
you could rewrite the left-hand side here

00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:26.385
as zero x plus m.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.263
So you see, you kind of
match the coefficients.

00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:32.346
So zero must be equal to 3m minus 2,

00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:37.087
and m is equal to 3b, m
is equal to 3b minus 5.

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:39.741
m is equal to 3b minus 5.

00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.795
So let's use that
knowledge, that information,

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.346
to solve for m and b.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.320
So we could use this first one.

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:50.058
So 3m minus 2 must be equal to zero.

00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:51.325
So let's write that.

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:54.331
3m minus 2 is equal to zero,

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:56.701
or 3m is equal to 2,

00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:59.459
or m is equal to 2/3.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.454
So we figured out what m is.

00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:04.832
Then we could use that information,

00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:06.444
because we know that,

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:10.651
we know that m is equal to,

00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.652
is equal to 3b minus 5.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:19.168
m is 2/3, so we get 2/3
is equal to 3b minus 5.

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:21.653
We could add 5 to both sides,

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:25.529
which is the same thing as
adding 15/3 to both sides.

00:05:26.308 --> 00:05:27.323
Is that, did I do that right?

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:28.917
Yeah, adding 5 to both sides

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:31.203
is the same thing as
adding 15/3 to both sides.

00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:32.196
So let's do that.

00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:37.196
15/3 plus 15/3, these cancel out.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.184
That's just 5 right over there.

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:41.501
On the left-hand side we have

00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:46.262
17/3 is equal to 3b,

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.538
or if you divide both sides by 3

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:52.370
you get b is equal to 17,

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:58.305
b is equal to 17/9, and we're done.

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:03.061
We just found a particular solution

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:05.086
for this differential equation.

00:06:05.343 --> 00:06:10.343
The solution is y is
equal to 2/3x plus 17/9.

00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:16.949
And I encourage you,
after watching this video,

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.236
to verify that this particular solution

00:06:19.236 --> 00:06:22.680
indeed does satisfy this
differential equation

00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:24.423
for all x's.

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:27.979
For all x's.
