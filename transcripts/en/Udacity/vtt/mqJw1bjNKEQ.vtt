00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a look at now the web/mobile funnel.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, what's really interesting is in the web/mobile funnel--the getting customers part of the funnel

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is actually quite simple, at least on first glance.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We still have earned and paid media driving customers into the funnel.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If you remember, we understood who the customer archetype was with running

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
search engine marketing or search engine optimization, but in the web,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we just really have to do two things--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
First one is we got to acquire customers and then we activate them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well, what's acquire mean--acquire on the web is how we want to get them to my site

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or to my mobile app or to my cloud app.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
How do I do that--as we said, earned and paid media will drive customers

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
somehow to be looking at a place that you're at, but the next step is much harder.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
After I acquire them, I want them to do something--I just don't them to look and go away.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I want them to either pay for the product or sign up for something and become a user.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What is the word activate means.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I want you to engage with my website or my app and do something I have planned for you to do.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now in a simple world is what I would plan for you to do is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
open your wallet and give me all your money.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In a non-perfect world, you might just be a user and I'm going to monetize you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
by getting pairs to pay for the fact that I have lots of users, but acquisition--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that is acquire, and activation is a 2-parts strategy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In theory, understanding acquisition and activation seems pretty simple.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I get it, I understand who my customers are, and then I figure out what earned and paid media

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I want to use and on the web, I might be paying Google forever.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm going to acquire them and then activate them. How hard could this be.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, hopefully it gets kind of fun because the real metric--the way we kind of measure things,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the language we use on the web is customer acquisition cost.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And what we want to do is figure out how much is it really going to cost us to get

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
an activated customer out here on the right hand of the get funnel.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Let's do an exercise and see what it feels like and how does it work

00:02:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to get an activated customer and how much it cost.
