1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,100
Starting on page three 12.
Here is the little detail.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,203
Yeah.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,510
This is, uh, the kid after he
has left the glance and gang.

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:19,040
They've been routed by the
Humas and now he is on his own.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,393
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,660
He traveled about,

7
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:26,360
this is the middle of the page he
traveled about from place to place.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,820
He did not avoid the company of other men.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,100
He was treated with a certain deference
as one who had got on to terms with life

10
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,890
beyond what his years
could account for by now.

11
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:40,190
He'd come by a horse and a revolver,
the rudiments of an outfit.

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,260
He worked at different trades.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,940
He had a bible that he'd found at the
mining camps and he carried this book with

14
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:47,450
him,

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,980
no word of which he could read
in his dark and frugal close.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,120
Some took him for a sort of preacher,
but he was no witness to them.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,650
Neither of things at hand, nor
things to come. He least of any man.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,090
It's that detail of the Bible that
interests me here. He had a bible.

19
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:08,060
He'd found the mining camps,
carried this book with him,

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,100
no word of which he could read.

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,460
Why does the kid carry a Bible when he's
illiterate and why does it appear at

22
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:20,150
this moment in the narrative? These are
the questions I want to try and answer.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,590
I want to account for this little detail
through an argument that will pick up

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,110
the points I made about allusion on
Monday and and integrate those into a

25
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:31,340
different kind of argument.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,250
What does this Bible
signify at this moment?

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,080
The kid,

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I would guess to most of you seemed like
at this point he had become somewhat

29
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,940
different.
Is that right?

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,870
Did you feel that by this point
when he leaves the glance and gang,

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,030
he's matured in some way?
Did you feel that? Yes. No.

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,490
Yes. Maybe if you didn't,

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,230
you swam against Mccarthy's own pros.

34
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:09,980
Remember that at a certain point,
late in the novel,

35
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,980
he is no longer called the kid.
He is called the man.

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,290
I'm sure most of you caught that.

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,220
What this says to us is that McCarthy
has built the structure of the narrative

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,730
along the familiar line of the buildings
from on the novel of a boy growing into

39
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,624
a man.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,010
It's hard to miss this when that's the
characters only name and it changes in

41
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,504
the middle.

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,140
This is a fairly obvious gesture
towards that very well known narrative

43
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,074
structure.

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,670
There are other indicators though that
suggest a transformation of the kid or

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,390
some sort of complexity to the
kid that might be belied by the,

46
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,000
the narrative is conducted.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Remember that difference I pointed out
on Monday between Melville and McCarthy,

48
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:11,320
between the interiority,
you get through Ishmael as a narrator,

49
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,640
the complexity of him as a character
and the flatness of the kit.

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,570
You don't have an Ishmael character
whose mind you can see into.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,070
We don't see into the minds
of these people very often.

52
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,643
Okay.

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,170
If the Bible signifies as it seems to do
to the people who see him and take him

54
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,350
to be some kind of preacher
to have some kind of wisdom,

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,280
if it's suggested development,
what kind of development is it?

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,320
The judge is the person who gives us
something to go on in this respect and if

57
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,090
you look on page two 99

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,790
we can see what that is.

59
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,330
The judge and the kid are at odds in
the desert after the route of the gang

60
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,970
and the kid is hiding with a loaded
gun and the judges hunting him

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,760
and he keeps calling out to the kid.

62
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,060
The priest has led you to this boy.

63
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,510
I know you would not hide.

64
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,080
I know too that you've not the
heart of a common assassin.

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,700
I've passed before your gun sights twice
this hour and we'll pass a third time.

66
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,910
Why not show yourself no assassin
called the judge and no partisan either.

67
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,790
There is a flawed place in
the fabric of your heart.

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,130
Do you think I could not know you
alone were mutinous you alone,

69
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:45,630
reserved in your soul.
Some corner of clemency for the heathen.

70
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,100
The judge sets the kid apart
from himself and from the game.

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,710
In this moment especially,

72
00:04:55,711 --> 00:05:00,330
we feel that the kid has some
kind of moral superiority,

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,420
some kind of resistance to the violence
that has been dominating the novel up

74
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:08,190
until this time.

75
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,983
Okay.

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,840
You can see it also in a
late example of the judge.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,670
He's,
he says that

78
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,220
on three Oh seven when he
meets up with the kid, uh,

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,000
much later when the kid is in prison.
This is a three oh seven,

80
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,160
um,
about two thirds of the way down.

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,360
Okay.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,280
Only each was called upon to empty out
his heart into the common and one did not.

83
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,090
Can you tell me who that was?
It was, you whispered the kid.

84
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:52,960
You were the one and then I'm
going to skip down a little bit.

85
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,250
Our animosities were formed and waiting
before we two met yet even so you could

86
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,430
have changed at all.

87
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,970
The judge here again,

88
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:12,971
singles out the kid as having somehow
betrayed the gang and he suggests that

89
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,910
this is on the prior page. Uh,
he has lied to the authorities,

90
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,030
but he suggests that the kid had actually
conspired with the Humas to make it

91
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,450
possible for the Glanton
gang to be decimated.

92
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,970
That he had given them information
and allowed them to ambush the group.

93
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,590
He suggests that the kid was actively
working against the gang in this scene.

94
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,800
Is this true?
Is The kid somehow special?

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,590
Does he stand apart from the gang?

96
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,120
This is a question I want you to ponder.
Now.

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,480
One very distinguished reader of this
novel Harold Bloom has called the kid a

98
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,254
hero.

99
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,500
There's a preface to the modern library
edition of this novel where bloom argues

100
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:14,261
that the kid is the hero against
the heroic evil of the judge.

101
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,020
And remember in my discussion of Milton's
role as a source of an illusion in

102
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,974
this novel,

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,160
what Milton's Satan brings with him into
this novel is that sense of heroic evil

104
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,070
bloom sees the kid as
the heroic, good, flawed,

105
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:36,410
maybe maybe a little bit modest,

106
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:41,030
but yet still the heroic
good and bloom actually, uh,

107
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,080
make some mistake that I think is
quite indicative of a mistaken reading.

108
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,360
That's he capitalizes the kid,

109
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,770
he makes kid like a proper name,
capital k Kit.

110
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,990
You never see it that way.
In the novel

111
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,890
is the kid hero is
their moral development.

112
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,180
I want now to see whether there's any
case to be made for this and to do that,

113
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,560
I'm going to track the kid
through the middle of the novel.

114
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,040
There are about 75 pages in the exact
center of the novel where the kid does not

115
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:22,160
appear very often. This is also, um,

116
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,250
a structure that pertains in,
in Moby Dick. So this is again,

117
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,100
something that he has partly
borrowed from Melville.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,590
When the kid does appear.

119
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,230
Let's see what he does. This
is during the time, by the way,

120
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,970
when they're just massacring anyone
who is breathing on the desert plain,

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,990
any peaceful tribe, they
come across, they will skin.

122
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:51,890
Anyone who's hair looks like
it could be an Indian scalp.

123
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,700
Let's look first at one 57.

124
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:01,430
This is the first place where
the kid is noted to appear. Uh,

125
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,660
in this,
in the section,

126
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,430
this is McGill emerging
from the burned encampment.

127
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,300
Miguel came out of the crackling fires
and stood staring blankly at the scene

128
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:23,560
about he had been skewered through with
a lance and he held the stock of it

129
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:28,180
before him. It was fashioned from a
subtle stock and the point of an old cow,

130
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,800
a cavalry sword bound to the Haft,
curved out from the small of his back.

131
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,760
The kid waited out of the
water and approached him.

132
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,290
And the Mexican sat down carefully
in the sand, get away from him,

133
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,560
said Glanton Miguel turned to
look at Glanton and as he did so,

134
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,770
Glanton leveled his pistol
and shot him through the head.

135
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,180
It looks like the kid is approaching
him as a kind of active mercy.

136
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,360
Here's a man skewered through with uh,

137
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,880
a brutal weapon and
the kid approaches him.

138
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,880
Glanton his response
is simply to kill him,

139
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,810
seeing him as more of a burden
to the gang than anything else.

140
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,850
But the kid approaches.

141
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,460
Here you do see a difference
between the kid and glancing,

142
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,470
at least in their
approach to McGill one 62,

143
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,570
a somewhat similar case.

144
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,220
When Davy Brown has an
Arrow through his leg,

145
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,390
brown has asked someone to help him push
it through so he can then extract the

146
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:39,140
arrow and everybody has refused.

147
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:43,240
As on one 61 boys said,
brown eye doctor Phi it myself,

148
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:46,900
but it can't get no straight grip.
The judge looked up at him and smiled,

149
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,580
will you do are Holden? No, Davey, I
won't, but I tell you what I will do.

150
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,473
What's that?

151
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,010
I'll write a policy on your life
against every mishap saved the news.

152
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,150
Damn you then.

153
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,230
So they're just kind of playing with
him and laughing with him at him as he

154
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,064
suffers.

155
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,070
Okay.

156
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,390
Then finally the kid rose, I'll
try her. He said, good lad,

157
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:11,230
said Brown.

158
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,690
And they go through the process of
pushing the Arrow through and the priest

159
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,950
chides him after this is all done.
When the kid returned to his own blanket,

160
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:25,090
the ex priest lean to him in his
stead, his year fool. He said,

161
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,990
God will not love you forever.
The kid turned to look at him.

162
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,180
Don't you know he'd
have took you with him?

163
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,270
He'd have took you boy like
a variety to the altar.

164
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,180
I think what he means there is that
David Brown would have killed him,

165
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,340
would have killed the kid if he
had had the chance somehow, uh,

166
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,880
in his moment of pain.

167
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,650
So the kid does look again,

168
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,250
he looks quite merciful in this passage.

169
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,450
We see him on one 69 at dinner

170
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,460
with the governor of
Chiapas and Gel Tree Os.

171
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,250
This is on one 69. Um, this
is a very brief mention.

172
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,893
Okay.

173
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,570
The kid in the first starched collar he'd
ever owned and the first corvette sat

174
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,330
mute as a tailor's dummy at that board.

175
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'm the ex priest has sort of indicated
with his eyes to note that the judge and

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,670
triage are conversing and
some unknown language,

177
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,460
a language that none of them know.
Um,

178
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,580
and it's as if to say
that look as if to say,

179
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,830
see there he has a kind of
mystical evil about him.

180
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,630
He speaks even in these other languages,
uh, that no one can understand.

181
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:52,130
He's an other worldly figure. The x priest
seems to be saying just with his eyes,

182
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,280
the kid is just like a,
a dummy.

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,620
Here he is just a blank

184
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,670
on one 73. This is the, um,

185
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,420
the passage I noted on Monday where
Toadvine and the kid are grumbling against

186
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:15,481
the judge and Glanton because of their
pension for massacring peaceful Indians

187
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,780
and Toadvine puts the
pistol to the judge's head.

188
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,050
There's a parallel moment in the desert
after the route of the gang when the kid

189
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
does not kill the judge.

190
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,290
The kid has his chance and he
also does not kill the judge.

191
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,920
So this is another appearance of the kid.
They're talking together,

192
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,120
and I won't read it, but you
can look at it if you like. Um,

193
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,600
that's on one 73,
one 78,

194
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,960
the kid instigates a bar fight.

195
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,410
This is, uh, towards
the middle of the page.

196
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,070
They're all assembled in a bar.

197
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,490
The kid address the table in his
wretched Spanish and demanded,

198
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,570
which among those solid inebriates
had spoken an insult, uh,

199
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,680
before any could own it.

200
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:10,270
The first of the funeral rockets exploded
in the street as told in the entire

201
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,860
company of Americans made for the door.

202
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,010
And this begins the chaos
that will eventuate in piles
of bodies in this Cantina

203
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,730
as the Americans leave.

204
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,340
Okay.

205
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,110
And then on two oh four,

206
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,480
this is about the time that the kid,
uh,

207
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:35,930
returns to the narrative.

208
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,300
This is with Shelby.
Remember,

209
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,140
uh, they've drawn lots
to see who will, uh,

210
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,300
conduct the mercy killing

211
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,380
yeah.

212
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,130
Of the wounded two or Delaware's

213
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,851
in one a Mexican.

214
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,720
The fourth was Dick Shelby and he
alone sat watching the preparations for

215
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:00,920
departure. And then the
kid, um, draws the Arrow,

216
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,470
but he does not kill Shelby.

217
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,200
He loves Shelby die in the desert.
Yeah.

218
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,340
These moments look like a kind of mercy,

219
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but I'm going to argue that they are not
in fact instances of mercy that in the

220
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:24,511
end they are not accountable for by any
kind of moral calculus that they resist

221
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,890
that kind of evaluation.
Why?

222
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,000
Because every time the kid shows mercy,

223
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,480
he shows mercy to one of his own gang
and we know what the gang goes on to do,

224
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,910
right?
They simply go on killing more people.

225
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,410
So the allegiance that he
seems to show with suffering,

226
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,550
the mercy is so selective that it can't
be called such and it's a kind of trick

227
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,760
of McCarthy's narrative to allow us to
see the suffering of these men in this

228
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,830
kind of detail.

229
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,900
While the suffering of all the people
they kill goes by pretty quickly.

230
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,930
You do see infants being bashed together.

231
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,340
You see people run through with Lance's,
you see people's heads hacked off,

232
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,860
you see many scalping.

233
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,140
But there's never a moment when that's
really focused on that we really see it

234
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,930
and are asked to feel for
that suffering person.

235
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,800
It's spectacular violence in that literal
way that we know that word spectacle.

236
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,023
Okay.

237
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,380
There is no moral development.

238
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,650
Why do we think that there should be?

239
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,080
I've pointed out two reasons.

240
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,920
One is that the judge points out or
argues that or advances the rhetoric that

241
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,080
the kid is different from all the others.
That's one reason we think that.

242
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,380
The other reason is that he
transformed from kid to man.

243
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,470
And that old narrative of buildings,

244
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Romano suggests the acquisition of
wisdom and we associate wisdom with moral

245
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:22,230
complexity, moral
sophistication, moral depth.

246
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,520
These are things we bring to the novel
out of our immersion in a cultural

247
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:34,590
tradition of such stories.
There are other reasons though,

248
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,350
and I'm going to go to page one 43 now.

249
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,560
This is the parable of the traveler.
Um,

250
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,670
you'll recall that this is a story that
the judge tells as a of instructive

251
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,620
story to the men as
they're sitting around.

252
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,240
And the story is that there's a
traveler passing through a wild, uh,

253
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,380
part of the mountains and he is a
accosted by a man who lives there.

254
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,003
Um,

255
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,460
the harness maker who lives there,
um,

256
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,220
invites the stranger in and
then tries to get money off him.

257
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,830
And then finally,
uh,

258
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:27,360
the traveler gives him
a lecture on morality.

259
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,663
Hmm.

260
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,980
In the end,
as the traveler leaves the harness maker,

261
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,780
uh, a cost Tim again and kills
him and buries his bones.

262
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,960
The wife discovers this and cares
for the bones of the traveler.

263
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,580
The son of the harness maker
becomes himself a killer of men.

264
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,150
So it's a little story that we get here.

265
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,620
The story seems to be about a contention
between good and evil between the

266
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:12,421
harness maker who is a
wild and chaotic force.

267
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,350
He lives in the woods.

268
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:19,351
He dresses up as an Indian to perpetuate
his crimes and he takes advantage of

269
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,350
innocent victims.

270
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,570
The traveler is possessed
of moral knowledge.

271
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,020
He can give a coherent moral speech
and he is not unwilling to exhort the

272
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,940
harness maker towards a better life.

273
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,210
Okay.

274
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,940
It seems to be all about moral contention.

275
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,660
And the point of the story from the
judge's point of view is to show that evil

276
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,530
is an inheritance.

277
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,330
So the son of a harness maker
becomes a killer of men too,

278
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,390
but that the lack of a father,

279
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
the traveler we find out had fathered
a child who was as yet unborn.

280
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,170
And so that child when born
is as the judge says, um,

281
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,820
euchred of his patrimony,
this is on the bottom of one 45.

282
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,011
All his life,

283
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:27,510
he carries before him the idol of a
perfection to which he can never attain.

284
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,190
The absent father takes on
this perfect a perfect model,

285
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,260
a quality of being, a perfect model
that the sun can never attain.

286
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,240
He never learns that this man was
a human being, and therefore, uh,

287
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,620
that he could never be the kind
of ideal he can be as a dead man.

288
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,840
So his point is that that child's life is,

289
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,760
as he says, broken before frozen
God, and he will never find his way.

290
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,560
What this ending of the story doesn't
tell us is that the descendants of the

291
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:11,350
traveler of the innocent victim
actually also become killers of men.

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,740
And we discovered this at
the very end of the novel

293
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,370
when the man makes his last kill.
And this is on three 23.

294
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:26,371
Remember the scene the
man is camped out outside,

295
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,640
uh,
outside the village and

296
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,060
this group of,
uh,

297
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,770
bone pickers or sort of migrants in
the desert come up to him and they're

298
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,980
curious about the
scapular of ears he wears.

299
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,130
I said on Monday that this belonged
to Toadvine. I was mistaken.

300
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,660
It belongs to Davie Brown. It
belonged to David Brown. I'm so,

301
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:54,661
he's wearing browns scapular of ears and
the travelers are curious about this.

302
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,550
And one boy in particular won't believe
him about their origin and taunts him

303
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:04,900
and sort of calls him a liar.

304
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,190
The group backs away that night.

305
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,720
That young man comes back with his gun

306
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,840
and he says on three 22,
I n I know you'd be hit out.

307
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:24,760
The boy called he the,
now the man pushed back,

308
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,100
the blanket, rolled onto his
stomach and cock the pistol.

309
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:30,970
And leveled it at the sky where the
clustered stars were burning for eternity.

310
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,170
He centered the foresight in the middle
groove of the frame strap and holding

311
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:35,561
the piece.

312
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:39,100
So he swung it through the dark of the
trees with both hands to the darker shape

313
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,100
of the visitor. I'm right here. He said,

314
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,570
the boys swung with the rifle and fired.
You wouldn't have lived.

315
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,060
Anyway, the man says, said, and they,

316
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,300
they come up the boy's family,
uh,

317
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,250
or his companions in the dawn
to get his body and they say,

318
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,720
top of three 23,
I know that we'd bury him on this prairie.

319
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,550
They come out here from Kentucky,
Mr This tyke and his brother,

320
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,770
his mama and daddy both dead.

321
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,950
His granddaddy was killed by a lunatic
and buried in the woods like a dog.

322
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,550
So this,

323
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,880
that little sentence tells us this is
a descendant of the traveler from the

324
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,150
judge's story.

325
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,550
That's who was killed by a lunatic
and buried in the woods like a dog.

326
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,010
The brother who's been killed by the kid.
Now the man

327
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,250
tried to kill the kid.

328
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,020
So we know that he has become a killer
of men with that same taste for mindless

329
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:48,320
violence that broods in the kid
at the very start of the novel.

330
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,070
And his younger brother about
12 inherits the dead boys gun.

331
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,200
So we see that a inheritance
yet of violence continuing.

332
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,200
So what appears to be a
parable, what's told to, uh,

333
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,380
the group of men by the judge in the form
of a parable invoking the parables of

334
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,580
the Bible,
which have spiritual,

335
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:18,581
moral lessons to them or can have
spiritual moral lessons to them.

336
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,663
Um,

337
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,150
that discourse is not in the end discourse
that will divide killers of men from

338
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,100
people who are not the killers of men.

339
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,570
It does not help us to divide up
the world between evil and good.

340
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,810
It does not track along those lines
that the judge's story about the kid,

341
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,780
that the kid is his nemesis,

342
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,250
that the kid is the
counter force to his evil.

343
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,030
It does not track along those lines.

344
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,590
And in fact,
it ran it.

345
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,710
The whole novel renders the
idea of a moral machinery moot.

346
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,120
And you can see that a little
bit too in the epigraphs.

347
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,610
I won't stop on those right now.
Um,

348
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,880
the epigraphs to the novel suggest
also the futility of a moral discourse.

349
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,950
I argued on Monday that there were two
threads of tradition or inheritance or

350
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:30,181
influence that McCarthy is drawing
on one historical and I know that Sam

351
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,920
Chamberlain's source
material from his, his, uh,

352
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,970
account of his life with the Glanton Gang,

353
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,590
and then that whole train of literary
allusions that I unearthed for you,

354
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,670
the historical is made moot in this
wonderful little passage from the judge if

355
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,840
the moral is made moot in all
these ways that I'm discussing,

356
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:56,200
the historical is dismissed quite quickly.

357
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,780
Three 30,

358
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,500
he says, men's memories is
very last line of the page.

359
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,530
Men's memories are uncertain and the past
that was differs little from the past

360
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,400
that was not think about that claim
in the context of a historical novel.

361
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,570
The past that was differs little
from the past that was not,

362
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,560
you can read the past that
was not as the fictive past.

363
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,180
The imagined past.

364
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,870
This claim is that the true past has no
significant distinction from the fictive

365
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:42,910
past, that men's memories
are no source of truths.

366
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,220
The past
in this little line,

367
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Mccarthy says to us that historical
record that I was quite careful to invoke

368
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,410
that I was quite careful to follow in
some places from which I got lots of

369
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:04,020
detail that I used in my novel.
Forget about that.

370
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,490
My novel stands on an
equal plane of authority.

371
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,660
It gives me a platform to make equally
valid claims of truth about history and

372
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:22,920
about the world. This is a kind of, uh,

373
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,280
grandiloquent argument for
fiction as opposed to history

374
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,210
on three Oh nine.

375
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,140
Yeah.

376
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,370
We have another

377
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,150
interesting look back to the material
that I was talking about on Monday.

378
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,220
This is when the kid is
dreaming about the judge.

379
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,650
Um, while he's undergoing surgery
for the aero wound in his leg

380
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,280
in that sleep and in sleeps to follow,

381
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,210
the judge did visit who would come other,
uh,

382
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:10,750
great shambling Mutant,
silent and serene,

383
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,360
whatever his antecedents,
he was something holy other than their,

384
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:20,361
some nor was there system by which to VA
to divide him back into his origins for

385
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:26,530
he would not go.
What does that mean?

386
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,750
There was no system by which to divide
him back into his origins for he would

387
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,584
not go.

388
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,610
What I did on Monday was excavate some
of the origins of the judge as a figure

389
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,710
in Ahab, in Milton, Satan.

390
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,270
This tells us in the voice of the narrator
this time that you can't reduce his

391
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,570
character to those origins,

392
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,330
that to excavate the illusions
or to note the tuition,

393
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,490
the literary tradition out of which such
characters arise does nothing to reduce

394
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,980
the singularity of
McCarthy's artistic creation.

395
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,570
Even finding that eerily similar
description of judge Holden in Sam

396
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,370
Chamberlain's account,
McCarthy seems to be saying to us,

397
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,640
doesn't reduce him to some
understandable character

398
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,020
that claim for the judges.

399
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:37,021
Preeminence as a character is brought
home to us at the very end when the novel

400
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,530
switches to the present tense and
these remarkable claims for the judge,

401
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,050
and this is when they are dancing after
the kid has been killed in some horrific

402
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:52,360
manner of which were not told.

403
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,980
And here's the judge dancing

404
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,040
and you get the refrain that,
that he never sleeps. He says,

405
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:07,000
he says he'll never die, he never
sleeps. He says, he says he'll never die.

406
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,590
He bows to the fiddlers and sachets
backwards and throws back his head and

407
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:14,980
laughs, deepen his throat and
he's a great favor at the judge.

408
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:20,170
He walked his hat and the lunar dome of
his skull passes Paly under the lamps

409
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,730
and he swings about and takes possession
of one of the fiddles and d pirouettes

410
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:28,660
and makes a pass.
Two passes dancing and fiddling at once.

411
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,760
His feet are light and nimble. He never
sleeps. He says that he will never die.

412
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,980
He dances in light and in shadow and he
is a great favorite. He never sleeps.

413
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:43,780
The judge, he is dancing, dancing.
He says that he will never die.

414
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,020
The judge himself is a
figure for, uh, the artist.

415
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:52,770
He's a music maker.
He's a performer,

416
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,420
a dancer in this passage.

417
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,780
But the assertion is that
he will last forever.

418
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,760
And the only way I think to understand
that is to see him as a literary

419
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:08,170
character, very self consciously in
this moment that like Milton, Satan,

420
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,520
he's a character that will live in the
tradition that will never die out in the

421
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,260
imagination of readers.

422
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,830
It's a remarkably ambitious claim
to make for your own character.

423
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,330
But when you read it with that passage,

424
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:29,800
I just read about the impossibility
of dividing him back into his origins,

425
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,100
you begin to see McCarthy's
literary ambition.

426
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,990
And that is to add to the
tradition in a significant way.

427
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,350
Mccarthy's says about, um,
writing novels that it,

428
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,390
it's not worth doing.

429
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:48,391
You cannot write a good book
unless it's about life and death.

430
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,310
He dismisses,
for example,

431
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:56,311
Proust and Henry James as important
writers on this ground because they're not

432
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,510
writing novels about life and death.

433
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,740
I would argue that McCarthy needs his
novel to be about life and death because

434
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:13,141
he is looking for the sound and
the feel of literary authority

435
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,930
in these passages.

436
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:21,931
I'm suggesting that it's a literary
authority coming out of a miltonic

437
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,130
tradition,
um,

438
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,930
perhaps out of the tradition of American
great American novels like Moby Dick.

439
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,300
But it goes much deeper than that.

440
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:36,301
And this is where I get back to my
original little detail of the Bible,

441
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,650
the illiterate kid holding the Bible.

442
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,410
Two 48 we get a discussion

443
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,670
among the men of the Bible

444
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,170
in the context of a discussion of war.

445
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,640
This is what is said about it.

446
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,793
Yeah,

447
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,290
this is Irving,

448
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,820
or actually the first,
uh, Black Jackson Irving.

449
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,680
The good book says that he, that lives
by the sword shall perish by the sword,

450
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:20,770
said the black. The judge smiled
his face shining with Greece.

451
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,470
What right man would have
it any other way. He said,

452
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,180
the good book does indeed count.
Warren evils said Irving. Yet.

453
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:31,390
There's many a bloody
tale of war inside it.

454
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I would argue that this is a
description of McCarthy's own book,

455
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,790
except there's one thing that's different.

456
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,100
The good book does indeed count.

457
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:50,101
Warren Evil Mccarthy's novel does not
fail in making us see more as evil because

458
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:59,590
we're confronted over and over again with
these scenes of violence over and over

459
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:03,850
again with it's gratuitous nature.
We feel the waist.

460
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,250
When that last young boy
is killed by the man,

461
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,200
we feel the waist of his life.
We see,

462
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,240
feel the tragedy in discovering that the
sons of the harness maker and the sons

463
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:23,140
of the traveler both come to the
same end and become killers of men.

464
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,990
We see that evil
and like the Bible.

465
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,010
There is many a bloody a tale within it.

466
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,820
It Does Not Count Warren Evil because
it has not allowed a moral machinery to

467
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:45,140
have a place in this universe
or in the logic of the novel.

468
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,820
Why did holds out instead
is the feeling of morality,

469
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,640
the feeling that you could have a rhetoric
that would divide the kid from the

470
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,720
judge in a meaningful way that would
divide killers of men from not killers of

471
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:07,430
men
that would divide the good from the evil,

472
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,210
that would divide the
peaceful from the war.

473
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:16,211
Like even that would divide
history from fiction.

474
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,250
If there's something moral
about the truth of history,

475
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,480
why does McCarthy used the pattern and
the sound of Biblical language throughout

476
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:35,230
the novel?
I think this is why Robert Alter,

477
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,420
who if you've, if studied, um,

478
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,920
the Bible in any college course,

479
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,920
you've probably a at least
come to know his work.

480
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,870
He is a great translator
of the Old Testament. Um,

481
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,900
and he came out recently with a version,
I think it was in 2004 called, um,

482
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,280
which he titles the five books of Moses.

483
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:01,310
It's the pentitude and it's
retranslated in a very startling style.

484
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,060
It's trying to,
um,

485
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,990
honor the syntax of the Hebrew,
which is paratactic,

486
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:14,991
which means that it's strung together
with ANZ rather than subordinated.

487
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,720
The way that latinate
languages are subordinated.

488
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
So the King James Bible has in the
English tradition been the prestigious

489
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:31,011
literary translation of the Bible
Alter in 2004 tries to make the modern

490
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,270
equivalent of the King James Bible. And
in the introduction to that translation,

491
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:44,130
he says that what he's trying to do is
to take the innovations of writers like

492
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:49,020
Stein, Faulkner and the only
one from the late 20th century.

493
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:54,021
He mentions McCarthy to make a Bible
that is true to the Hebrew syntex.

494
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,810
This citation from alter is foremost
scholar on the Bible and Biblical

495
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:08,331
translation suggest just how successful
McCarthy has been in persuading the ear

496
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,940
that he is writing something like
scripture. He has persuaded alters ear

497
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,333
that

498
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,760
this book is the
equivalent of Hebrew pros.

499
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,193
Okay.

500
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,430
He's so successful in doing that that
he can make these gigantic claims and I

501
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:35,440
would point you back to
the beginning of the novel.

502
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,683
Yeah.

503
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,530
This citation of his father,
the only line we get a really about,

504
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,790
um, the kid's father, his
father has been a school master.

505
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,410
He lies and drink.

506
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,880
He quotes from poets
whose names are now lost.

507
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Its as if McCarthy is telling us I'm
erasing all that past that I'm invoking

508
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,890
from the Bible on up from the
Bible to the Iliad to Milton,

509
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,460
to Wordsworth to Melville.
I'm invoking it all.

510
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,420
But forget all those names.
Remember just one

511
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,783
the judge

512
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,250
or better yet McCarthy.

513
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,130
That's the one that you can remember.

514
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,000
So McCarthy gives us the feel of scripture

515
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,220
and yet he erases all that could
be the content of scripture.

516
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,180
That's why I'm interested in the Bible,

517
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,400
in the hand of an illiterate kid.

518
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,850
What is the Bible in the
hand of an illiterate kid?

519
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,040
But the symbol of that kind of narrative,

520
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,180
the symbol that there can be
an authoritative narrative
about the nature of the

521
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:09,300
world, about all of history, about
its meaning, about its structure,

522
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,860
a book that can compel its readers that
can speak to life and death in the most

523
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,054
ultimate way.

524
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,140
Okay.

525
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,000
But because it's in the hand of an
illiterate person, it cannot be read.

526
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,900
So what McCarthy is saying to us in
that tiny detail is that the Bible is

527
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:35,500
important as an artifact,
as a literary artifact.

528
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,440
Proof that such narratives can exist.

529
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,560
And McCarthy sets out to produce one.

530
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,250
Yeah.

531
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,400
And in keeping with the
illiterate newness of the kid,

532
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,670
one that has no moral content at all has
only made claims about the material of

533
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:59,030
the universe and not be spiritual
quality of the universe.

534
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:04,270
And that persuades entirely by the sound
of rhetoric and the structures that are

535
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:10,370
familiar to us from the
narratives of our tradition.

536
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,010
That's the ambition of the novel.
Um,

537
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm actually right on time,
so I will stop there.
