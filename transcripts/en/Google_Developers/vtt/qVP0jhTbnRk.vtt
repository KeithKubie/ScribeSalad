[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.200
TORI BURMEISTER: I'm Tori.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.820
SUNIL VEMURI: And I'm Sunil.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.519
I'm a product manager
on Actions on Google.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.560
TORI BURMEISTER: I'm a
partner technology manager

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.270
working on Actions on Google.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.330
SUNIL VEMURI: When we
first billed this session,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.350
we said it was 10 tips for
building better actions.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.950
Well, when we
previewed this talk,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.280
the feedback we universally
got was more tips.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.750
So we're adding two more tips.

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:44.630
TORI BURMEISTER: I'm really
excited to be working

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.940
on actions in
Google, because I see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.660
this as a next step in
the evolution of computer

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.560
interactions.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.950
I remember the first time
I typed in a web search

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.710
and received the
list of blue links.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.530
It opened up a whole new
world of exploration.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.640
I also remember when I
became fully dependent

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.970
on my mobile phone, checking
directions, the weather,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.090
finding friends in a crowd.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.010
It really changed
the way I lived.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.790
And now, with the assistant
and Actions on Google,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.270
I'm really excited to see how
conversational dialogues really

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.970
change the way we
interact with computers.

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.360
SUNIL VEMURI: And to
the techs in the back,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.780
we lost the monitors up here.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.230
So if you can fix that please.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.140
So we want to take us to this
next evolution in computing.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
We are offering the
Actions on Google Platform.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.140
And we're here to
show you not only how

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.789
to be part of the next
evolution but to excel at it.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.100
Actions on Google is
the developer platform

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.840
for the Google Assistant.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.600
With it, you can provide
your products and services

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.810
via the Assistant.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.440
With over 500 million devices
running the Assistant,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.240
there's a great
opportunity for you.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.670
We're not here how
to tell you how

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.010
to build an Action for an
Assistant from scratch.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.110
There are other sessions
at I/O covering that.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.750
We're here to give you the
top 12 tips that all of you

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.660
can use to build great actions.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.280
And when you build
great actions,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.200
not only do you
delight your users,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.870
but it opens the doors to
get your actions noticed.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.270
Throughout this talk, we're
going to mentioning two tools--

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.110
first, the Actions on
Google Console, or sometimes

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.510
affectionately known
as the Console.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.080
This is where you create
and administer your actions.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
Second, Dialogflow--
this is where

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.046
you build your
conversational actions

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:09.920
and it includes a lot
of the natural language

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.730
capabilities that are essential
for making great actions.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.450
Let's dive in.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.050
We've bucketed the tips
into three categories.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.700
First, design-- this is
how you make a great action

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.380
and avoid some of
the common mistakes.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.010
Second, enhance--
this is how you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.070
can make your action stand out.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.650
And third, grow--
this is how you can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.465
get your action to more users.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:45.950
TORI BURMEISTER: Having a good
design is what delights users.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.110
Let's start with four common
mistakes and solutions

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.190
to make a great design.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.510
Tip 1, make your conversation
as simple as possible,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.510
but no simpler.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.210
Do you know someone
who talks too much?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.000
Well, an action can too.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.390
When users interact,
keep it simple.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.210
Users don't need
every option up front.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.640
Guide them to the
most used portion,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.180
and then make options
available if they asked.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.480
Now, we're going to
act out a conversation.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
Sunil will be playing the
exciting role of an action,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.090
and I'll be the user.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.620
SUNIL VEMURI: Welcome
to sounds of relaxation.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.430
Are you trying to sleep,
meditate, cool down, think,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.950
or reflect?

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.070
TORI BURMEISTER: Reflect.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.250
SUNIL VEMURI: Great.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.860
We have something for that.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.460
Would you like to also include
ocean waves, crackling fire,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.236
wind blowing, or birds
chirping with that?

00:04:52.236 --> 00:04:55.456
TORI BURMEISTER: Sure, birds.

00:04:55.456 --> 00:04:58.340
SUNIL VEMURI: Do you want this
for 5 minutes, 30 minutes,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.365
or an hour?

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:03.410
TORI BURMEISTER: 30 minutes.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.510
SUNIL VEMURI: Find a nice
place to sit or lie down.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.020
Are you ready?

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.668
TORI BURMEISTER: Yes.

00:05:10.668 --> 00:05:13.950
SUNIL VEMURI: OK, here's your
30-minute relaxation sounds

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.056
with birds chirping.

00:05:16.056 --> 00:05:17.610
TORI BURMEISTER: Wow.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.050
That was tedious.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.130
I'm definitely not in a relaxed
state of mind after that.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.190
We recommend you keep
the conversation simple

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.100
and get the users
quickly to the delight.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.960
Let's take a look at
another example that

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.550
keeps the conversation simple.

00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:36.029
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.877
- Hey Google, talk to Headspace.

00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:39.631
[BLEEP]

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.870
- Great to hear from you again.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.690
Which session would
you like today?

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.410
Wake up, take a
moment, or unwind?

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.184
- Unwind.

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:54.260
- So it's the end of the
day and time to wind down.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.377
So just finding a
comfortable place--

00:05:57.377 --> 00:05:57.960
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.955
TORY: Much better.

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:01.580
Let me go back.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.440
And don't auto play it again.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.386
Thanks.

00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:10.290
[CHUCKLE]

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.180
They get the user quickly
to where they want to go.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.560
In a conversational
dialogue, we know

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.000
users drop off each time
another question is asked.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.090
So the fewer steps to
complete a task, the better.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.685
Keep your users engaged by
avoiding needless banter.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.480
Tip 2, add a persona.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.660
We want simple
conversations, but users also

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.100
want to feel connected and
engaged with your action.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.340
Developing a persona
or a personality

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.530
and incorporating
it into your action

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.060
really brings it to life.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
Take, for example,
a pizza restaurant.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.030
There are many types
of pizza restaurants.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.100
There is that upscale brick
oven pizzeria, or that New York

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.980
walk-up where you can
grab a quick slice,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.730
and the local
beach-side local spot.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.210
Each one is going to
communicate in a different way.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.540
And your action
can exemplify this.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.880
By defining a
thorough persona, you

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.940
can draw users into your action.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.830
We'll do some acting again.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.530
Sunil will play the pizza
action, and I'll be the user.

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:38.688
SUNIL VEMURI: Hello, what
would you like today?

00:07:38.688 --> 00:07:40.761
TORI BURMEISTER: Pizza.

00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:44.490
SUNIL VEMURI: OK, what
toppings would you like to add?

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.590
TORI BURMEISTER:
Pretty bland, right?

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.400
It's fine.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.120
But I'm not sure we expressed
anything about our brand

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.549
or who we are.

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:53.340
Let's try it again.

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.690
SUNIL VEMURI: Cowabunga, dude.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.811
What can I getcha?

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:02.890
TORI BURMEISTER: Pizza!

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:03.780
SUNIL VEMURI: Great!

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.286
What flavor do you crave?

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.860
TORI BURMEISTER: Maybe we've
taken this one a little far,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.870
but you get the idea.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.810
Our persona is a local surfer.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.940
Personality can't be avoided.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.480
It's human nature to attach
personality to things.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.700
And we're hardwired
to look for meaning

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.830
in the things around us.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.710
People will attribute a
personality with your action

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.830
regardless of whether you
think about it or not.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.309
It's better to control the
perception and define it.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.909
Well-defined personas
also increase

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.190
the emotional connection.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.260
This leads to increased usage,
retention, and brand loyalty.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.950
Things to think about when
you're defining your persona

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.740
is what state is the
user going to be in?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.580
Are they looking to relaxed?

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.750
Are they excited?

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.104
And based off of that, what
role should your agent play?

00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:02.520
Looking at these
attributes, these

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.510
are a couple of
different options.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.310
The first might be
a teacher, someone

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.720
who is patient and
helpful and encouraging.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.270
And then a friend might be
playful, casual, and silly.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.040
Whereas a helper,
you're going to want

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.030
to be attentive and
proactive and succinct.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.390
We recommend you define the
persona at the design phase

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.020
and then shape your
conversation around it.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.111
It can make a big difference.

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:38.360
SUNIL VEMURI: Tip number 3,
users can be unpredictable.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.730
They can use products in ways
that we don't always expect.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.340
In the case of
conversational actions,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.138
they might say something
that you didn't anticipate.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.390
Let's try this dialogue.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.130
This time I'll be the user
and Tori will be the action.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.705
I'd like an ice cream cone.

00:09:58.705 --> 00:09:59.830
TORI BURMEISTER: Yummy.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.285
What size do you want?

00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:02.575
SUNIL VEMURI: A double.

00:10:02.575 --> 00:10:05.170
TORI BURMEISTER: Sorry,
what size do you want?

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.040
Small, medium, or large?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.400
SUNIL VEMURI: OK, the
grammar was not robust.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.050
The action didn't understand
a common variation of medium,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.177
in this case, I said double.

00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:21.760
Now, I don't know about you, but
I've been to ice cream shops.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.890
And you can ask for different
sizes in different ways.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.250
So you want your grammars
to be able to handle

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.150
all of these different common
variations that might come up.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.960
Let me show you how
you can approach this.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.920
Using Dialogflow, there's
a simple way to do this.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.620
First, training
phrases-- this is

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.380
where you can include some
of the common different ways

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.570
somebody might say
the same phrase.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.110
So for example, can
I have a medium?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.110
I'll have two scoops.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.400
A double, please.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.590
You can include all of
these different phrases

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.200
in the training phrase
section so that the system

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.030
will understand
that users might ask

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.560
for things in different ways.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.580
The second is synonyms.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.470
Let's take another
example, rain boots.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.640
So there are many different ways
somebody might say rain boots.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.840
It could be gumboots,
galoshes, wellies.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.330
You can include all of these
different kinds of synonyms

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.630
and variations as part of
the interface and Dialogflow

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.420
so that users will be able
to give their responses

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.970
with these kind of variations.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.510
But there's another part.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.770
The more examples you
give, the better Dialogflow

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.440
can learn from those
examples because it does

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.150
have learning capabilities.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.210
And then it can learn new
ways that the user has

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.970
expressed these same concepts.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.650
So more examples, the better.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.940
Let's take a look
at an action called

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.400
Timeout that illustrates this.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.790
Timeout tells you about
events in the United Kingdom.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.950
On this first screen,
Timeout is asking

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.500
for a day you like to go out.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.350
The user responds
with, I don't know.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.320
Instead of asking
the user again,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.300
Timeout recognizes the
phrase "I don't know"

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.560
and gives a helpful response.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.350
In the second
screen, Timeout again

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.110
asks if I want to go out
today, tomorrow, or Saturday.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.970
Excuse me, today,
tomorrow, or Sunday.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.640
The user responded
with Saturday.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.380
And again, Timeout handled it--

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.170
common variations
and things outside

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.320
of what the prompt asked for.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.100
And on the right, the user was
being a little clever here,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.290
and they asked for
something funny.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.070
Timeout responded with humor,
so kind of like an Easter egg.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.910
So these are some of the ways to
make your actions more robust.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:55.060
But there's more to
conversational excellence.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.670
Users can still say
unexpected things.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.580
And when people
talk to each other,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.610
if the listener doesn't
understand the speaker,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.010
they work cooperatively
to figure it out.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.610
They ask for corrections
or rewordings

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.320
or try to give
some hints to help

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.919
move the conversation forward.

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:15.460
Let's take a look
at an example here.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.065
TORI BURMEISTER:
When is the event?

00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:27.990
SUNIL VEMURI: Tomorrow.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.900
TORI BURMEISTER: I
don't understand.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.454
When is the event?

00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:34.970
SUNIL VEMURI: Uh, Wednesday.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.790
TORI BURMEISTER: I
don't understand.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.460
When is the event?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.965
SUNIL VEMURI: Wednesday!

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.850
TORI BURMEISTER: I
don't understand.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.840
When is the event?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.050
SUNIL VEMURI: Argh!

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:46.850
Frustrating!

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.730
But I'm sure you've
heard something

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.740
like this before when
you've talk to a computer.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.530
This is hopefully not
something unfamiliar.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.230
The action is repetitive
and unhelpful.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.130
It gives the same response.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.730
It's not noticing that
the user is earnestly

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.010
trying to move the
conversation forward.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.680
So here's what we recommend.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.920
For the initial prompt,
you can give that.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.600
Now, there's two types of errors
that we recommend you handle.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.060
The first is called no match.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.710
This is when the
user says something,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.690
and the action didn't handle it.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.970
When this happens you want to
get the user back on track.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.740
We recommend the first
reprompt to be what

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.632
is called a rapid reprompt.

00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:32.590
You give essentially the
same response or maybe

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.380
a slight variation but don't
go too much further than that.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.040
And if the user still
doesn't give something

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.290
that you can't
handle, here's where

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.270
we call escalating detail.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.770
Make it a little
bit more elaborate,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.140
perhaps even an
example of what's

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.540
something they can say to help
move the conversation forward.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.830
And after that,
stop reprompting.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.870
Don't pester the user.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.210
We find the sequence
works very well.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.800
Now, there's another type of
error that's called no input.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.260
This means the user
didn't say anything,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
or maybe the system didn't
hear what the user said.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.050
Perhaps they were thinking
about what they wanted to say,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.980
or they got confused
by the prompt,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.220
weren't sure how to respond.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.180
Like no match, we recommend
this three stage reprompting

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.150
to help the user along.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.140
And with these six
reprompts, you're

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.960
well on your way to build a
helpful conversation experience

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.360
that keeps the user on track.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.520
Let's see how to code this.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.140
In Dialogflow you create what's
called a fallback intent.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.020
Then, in your web code,
you simply create an array

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.310
with the three reprompts,
add a counter and some logic,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.707
so you return the right prompt.

00:15:49.707 --> 00:15:50.290
And that's it.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.200
Great design delights users
and keeps them coming back.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.760
Remember, keep your dialogue
short, include a persona,

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.080
make robust grammars that handle
common variations and synonyms,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.550
handle errors like no
match and no input.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.900
TORI BURMEISTER: So now
you have the design basics.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.370
Let's make it more
fun and personalized.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.230
Tip 5, evolve with your user.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.450
When you have a follow up
conversation with someone

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.850
you know, do you
introduce yourself again?

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.200
If you know their address,
do you ask it again?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.570
Same goes for actions.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.650
Be there with help and
options when the user needs it

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.640
but default to the simplest and
most personalized conversation

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.540
for your user.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.720
So here's a horoscope
action, Tauro Horoscopo.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.030
It's in Portuguese.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.040
And if you don't
speak Portuguese,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.920
and you don't happen to
have Google Translate handy,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.170
let me tell you
what's happening.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.900
The first time the user
launches the action,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.089
it asks for the horoscope sign.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.630
On subsequent launches, it
doesn't and simply reuses

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.310
the previous answer.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.839
This is great.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.430
Something as simple
as that could

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.859
create a much better
experience for your user.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.069
Another iteration
on this could be

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.530
when the user
invokes the action,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.560
you just give them their
horoscope right away.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.820
There are plenty examples
of good personalization.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.050
If you're a food action, you can
remember that I'm a vegetarian

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.240
and focus on those choices.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.660
If you're a fitness action,
you can remember workouts,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.690
sounds, durations
that the user likes

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.940
and use those as the defaults.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.290
Now we'll take a
look at the code.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.370
With a user info API, you
can get the user's name,

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.190
anonymize user ID, and more.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.110
You could use this
to know if it's

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.860
the same user on
subsequent invocations.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.100
There are also more robust
solutions using OAuth

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.650
for logged in experiences.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.440
So here in the code you
can see we're checking

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.330
if we've seen the user before.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.970
If we haven't, we
do the introduction.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.510
If we have, we attempt to
retrieve the horoscope sign

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.080
and then continue on
with the conversation.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.440
What we want you to
remember from evolving

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.700
with the users is, one,
get rid of the intro

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.670
if the user is familiar
with it, and two,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.405
become more personalized
as you learn about them.

00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:39.530
Don't keep asking for things
that you already know.

00:18:43.715 --> 00:18:45.980
SUNIL VEMURI: We've all
heard computer generated text

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.395
to speech.

00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:49.520
It's the technology that
takes text and converts it

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.330
into speech.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.530
And Google offers some
really nice text to speech.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.190
But do you know
what's even better?

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.480
Media.

First, the media response API--

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.280
this let's you include
media clips in your action.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.600
Suppose I'm building an action
that plays famous speeches.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.800
I can call this API to include
the actual audio, some images,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.480
and with some controls.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.414
Let's give it a listen.

A great way to
include a little bit

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.320
of media inside of your action.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.360
Using the API is
straightforward.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.380
Just give the URL to an audio
file, titles, some images,

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.492
and then hand it to Actions
on Google to play the rest.

00:19:44.492 --> 00:19:46.950
It's a great way to bring your
audio content to your users.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.900
The second way is through SSML.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.630
Let's say I'm trying to
create a spooky atmosphere

SUNIL VEMURI: All
right, what we did

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.520
here is use two features
of SSML, par and prosody.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.950
Prosody lets you fine
tune how the computer

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.810
speaks by changing the pitch,
speaking rate, and volume.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.630
Par is something unique
to Actions on Google.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.840
It lets you play multiple
sound layers, including

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.500
sound effects, background audio,
and mix that with your text

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.700
to speech.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.830
With that, you can
make great sounds

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.270
in an atmosphere
for your action.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.000
To further help you make
a great audio environment

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.030
for your sound, we have a sound
library with over 1,000 sounds,

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.550
including ambient sounds,
sports, voices, Foley,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.900
and many more.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.030
We encourage you to include
sounds in your actions.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.620
Tip number 7, adjust
to your device.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.790
Earlier at I/O, we mentioned
that the Assistant is

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.120
on over 500 million devices--

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.210
smart speakers, phones, watches,
headphones, Chromebooks, cars,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.550
TVs.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.520
And with the Assistant
SDK, device makers

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.100
are embedding the system in
more devices all the time.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.670
When designing for
multiple devices,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.740
there's a spectrum of
capabilities to consider.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.840
Sometimes its voice
only, like a Google Home.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.410
And with new smart
screens, there's

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.840
a mix of visual and touch.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.050
Sometimes the same device
falls on different parts

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.930
of the spectrum, depending
upon the user's context,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.834
like they're driving
or the volume is muted.

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:24.500
So these are the things you need
to take into consideration when

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.100
designing for these.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.340
Let's take an example
of a surf report.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.800
On a smart speaker
like a Google Home,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.720
the report needs to be
presented with just speech.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.230
So in this example,
the whole interaction

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.710
is verbal and through audio.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.190
Now, that same one on the
right is with a screen.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.480
Here, the audio or the verbal
presentation is abridged,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.310
but then now there's
a visual presentation

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.850
that goes along with it.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.170
And we encourage you to use
these rich visual presentations

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.270
on devices with screens.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.140
And even on the bottom,
on the bottom right,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.490
you can see that the choices are
presented as suggestion chips.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.230
So the user can
tap on them instead

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.240
of having to speak on a
device with the screen.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.750
And implementing such
logic is straightforward

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.260
using surface capabilities APIs
and some conditional logic.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.110
Now, there is so much
more about this topic.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.870
Fortunately, there is a
whole talk about it Wednesday

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.560
at 11:30 called Design Actions
for the Google Assistant,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.930
Beyond Smart Speakers to
Phones and Smart Displays.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.090
A great way to see if
your actions are working

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.230
are putting them in
the hands of users.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.540
But you might want to try things
out with a smaller audience

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.120
before you launch to
a bigger audience.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.460
Now, we just released
a new tool that

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.770
lets you test with
smaller audiences,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.490
and there's two options with it.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.220
You can do an alpha release.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.600
Your action goes through
a limited review.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.020
And this is great to get
early feedback on your action.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.280
Give it out to a
small test group.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.690
And one of the other
advantages of alpha releases

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:13.520
is that the review process is
much shorter, within hours.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.820
So that way you can just make
a fix, test it with some users,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:21.080
and iterate very, very quickly
and get that feedback you need.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.380
So that when you're releasing
to a larger audience,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.960
you've gotten through all the
bugs and all the design issues.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.620
The second option is
doing a beta release.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.140
This is intended when you're
near feature complete,

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.410
and you have a stable version
or a near stable version.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.170
Test this with a wider audience.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.280
Now, beta goes through the full
typical approval for actions,

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.010
but there's an additional
advantage with this.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.120
You can control when you take
an action from beta to public.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.790
So that way, if you're
trying to time or release

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.220
based on your marketing
considerations,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.270
you can keep it in beta.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.360
And then when you are ready for
it to go live, flip the switch

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.090
and make it go
live to the public.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.700
Now, after you've
built your action

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.380
and test it and launch it, it's
great to see what happened.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.334
How many users are coming back?

00:26:15.334 --> 00:26:16.500
Or how many users are there?

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.720
How many are coming back?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.260
What problems, if any,
are they encountering?

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.030
For traditional metrics, like
traffic, errors and retention,

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.300
there are existing analytics
you can use to see these.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.340
You can find the two on
the left on the Actions

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.200
on Google Console.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.600
Retention, like a
cohort analysis,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.510
is available through another
tool called Chatbase.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.810
Chatbase is a tool that you
can integrate with your action

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.732
where you can get deeper
conversational analytics.

00:26:45.732 --> 00:26:47.190
And speaking about
some things that

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.070
are conversational
and analytic, let's

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.650
take a look at something that's
particular to conversational

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.510
analytics.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.980
And this is called
a session flow.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.150
Here, you can see the pathways
a user takes most often.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.690
The green paths are the ones
that your action handled.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.370
The red paths are not handled.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.700
So in this example,
book a hotel,

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.190
when a user says book a
hotel, that was handled.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.340
But when a user says
feedback, it wasn't handled.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.520
Now, when we talked
about no match errors

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.430
before in the
robust grammars tip,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.600
here is where you can see how
often these no matches happen

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.260
and where you can figure out how
to prioritize addressing these.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.240
Both Dialogflow and Chatbase
include a session flow view.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.150
And if you need
to drill down, you

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.500
can see transcripts,
including the individual steps

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.570
the user went.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.259
So you can see what led
up to a potential problem.

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.550
So you can try to address that.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.660
To recap, enhance your actions
to take them to the next level

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.890
and increase engagement,
personalize it to the user,

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.280
add sounds, account
for actions running

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.140
on different types of devices--

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.080
for example, some with
screen, some not--

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.910
test it with smaller audiences.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.820
And then when you launch,
use the analytics tools here

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.170
to see what the users are doing.

00:28:13.409 --> 00:28:16.340
TORI BURMEISTER: So now
you built your awesome app.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.300
You want to engage your
users and reach many more.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.310
Tip 10, re-engage your users.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.890
During normal interactions
with your action,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.220
you can ask users to opt
in to receive updates

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.750
using two subscription models.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.120
The first is daily
updates where Google

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.080
pulls an update at a time
specified by the user.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.940
The second is push notifications
where the action can

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.460
push updates when appropriate.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.620
These notifications
work on the phone

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.400
even if you don't have
an Android app installed.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.950
And now, with cross
surface notifications

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.750
coming to the Google
Assistant, you'll

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.870
be able to reach your users
on speakers, smart displays,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.370
and other Google devices.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.470
Here's an example
of tube status.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.170
This can keep you up to date
on your commute conditions.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.387
Here is an example of the user
configuring the daily update.

00:29:19.387 --> 00:29:20.970
Here's what it looks
like when they're

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:26.190
getting the update, as
well as a notification when

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.230
there are severe delays.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.340
Great way to re-engage.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.990
If you want the user
to get daily updates,

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.920
you can actually set this up
using the Actions Console.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.940
The second way is in your
web hook in your code.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.770
Here, you create a new
register update object.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.020
You can put in arguments--

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.310
here, horoscope sign,
and then the frequency.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.060
Other examples of
daily updates are a tip

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.130
of the day or a surf report.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.250
Now, notifications and
updates can be a great way

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.030
to re-engage with your
users, but they can also

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.740
be really annoying.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.710
You have to be careful
to make it relevant.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:21.660
So use personalization-- results
for the user's favorite club

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.970
instead of the whole league.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.310
Be descriptive--
users will receive

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.250
the title and the
notification, so describe

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.920
the content they are
receiving and don't just

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.140
list the name of the action.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.680
And third, don't
spam your users--

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.270
make sure the information
is relevant to them

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.080
or don't do it.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:50.930
Tip 11, make your
action easy to discover.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.960
We're working hard to make
sure all great actions are

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.400
discoverable.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.520
And there are three main
ways to get discovered--

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.330
the first is the Assistant
Explore Directory.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.200
The second is when the user
is talking to the Assistant,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.960
make sure you come
up as an option.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.600
And the third is
action links, which

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.700
are hyperlinks to
your action which

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.960
you can add to any surface.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.820
The best way to ensure
you're discovered?

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.130
Make it good.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.700
We check each action, and the
higher the quality, the return

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.700
rate, health, and
ratings, the more likely

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.760
we'll highlight your action.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.430
Follow the design principles
in the Developer docs

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.140
to help guide you.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.270
We have some great
stuff out there.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.330
There are also several
talks at I/O that will help.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.640
Here's the Assistant
Explore Directory.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.410
It's available on the web at
assistant.Google.com/explore

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.700
and in an app in
both Android and iOS.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.280
The directory is very
important because we

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.424
see that 30% of our
third party actions

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:07.840
are getting
discovered through it.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.830
So when a user is
browsing, you want

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.020
to make sure you get discovered.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.930
The first browsing option
are contextual suggestions.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.340
These relevant suggestions are
based on the user's contexts,

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.190
such as the time
of day or location.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.080
The second is
dynamic categories.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.350
These are things like
what's new, what's trending,

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.670
what's popular.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.900
And now we have editorial picks.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.680
This is a new feature
highlighting high quality

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.660
actions through
visual campaigns.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.710
You now know that
high quality is

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.130
the key to being featured
in the Assistant Directory.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.520
To trigger more naturally
in conversation,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.410
use built-in intents.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.630
This is currently in preview.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.560
It allows actions to trigger
for relevant queries that

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.750
are more general.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:11.040
These built-in intents provided
common taxonomy for actions

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.130
across all Google surfaces.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.010
Google Assistant
parses the user query

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:21.690
and passes it as structured data
so developers don't have to.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:26.250
Using these general intents is
much more natural for users.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.270
In this way, users don't
have to use your action name.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.720
A couple examples of built-in
intents are tell a joke

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.580
or start a calming activity.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.850
In Dialogflow, you can
select the built-in intent

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.360
you'd like to be associated with
and then add in parameters that

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.850
can be passed into your action.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.610
Today, we're making the
first set of these intents

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.670
available so you can give
the Assistant a deeper

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.310
understanding of what
your action can do.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.870
And we'll be rolling
out hundreds more

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.745
in the coming months.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:08.530
So the third way to get
discovered is action links.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.020
They're hyperlinks that point
directly into your action.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.060
They make your
actions discoverable

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.670
from any platform
or surface, and they

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.000
allow users to engage
directly with your action

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.909
irrespective of how
they found your link.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.880
The links can be
added anywhere--

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.889
websites, social
campaigns, and more.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.020
It's really simple to
set up action links.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.130
You need to go into the Actions
console, publish a URL link,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.810
and give it a title,
and then share away.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:49.690
A final tip, be helpful
everywhere your users are.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:57.970
We're launched in more than
25 locales in 16 languages.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.300
We recommend engaging
with this global audience

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.140
as soon as possible.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.620
Flicks Bus is a bus
company, and it's

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.770
available in multiple
countries and languages.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.380
Here, you can see
identical action screens

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.820
in multiple languages--

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.190
English, French, and German.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.610
And here, we're
going to show you

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.120
how to efficiently localize
your action using a third party

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.220
localization library.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.510
The first thing to do is
create a locales directory

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.520
and a resource file
or a translation

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.290
file for each locale.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.955
In this example, it's en-us.

00:35:38.955 --> 00:35:41.380
JSON.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.090
That stands for
English, United States.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.790
Then, within the file,
you create a constant

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:53.790
for each string in your
action along with the string.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.090
Then, for each
additional language,

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.690
you create a new JSON file
and use the same constants

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.090
but have translated strings.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.820
There are many
translation services

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820
that can help with this.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:15.440
And then in your web hook, you
use the i18 and node library

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.840
to do the hard work.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.280
Here, you're going to
configure the i18n object.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.890
You're going to set the
locales you want to support,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.520
where the translation
files are located,

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520
and your default locale.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.160
Then, when the
conversation starts,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.220
you're going to set
that specific user's

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.435
locale in the i18n object.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.180
And finally, throughout
the conversation,

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.350
you use these constants instead
of conditional statements.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.630
This greatly simplifies
the complexity

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.160
of supporting
multiple languages.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.000
We want to ensure
that the work that you

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.310
have put into designing and
enhancing your action pays off.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.560
These tips will help
ensure you acquire

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.010
as many users as possible and
keep them coming back for more.

00:37:12.602 --> 00:37:15.620
SUNIL VEMURI: There are so
many more resources here at I/O

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.860
to help you build great
actions and learn more

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.630
about these tips.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.900
Look for sessions marked
for Assistant on the agenda.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.500
But let me highlight
a few for you.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.510
We have sessions
that talk about how

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:34.420
to design for smart
displays, Android, and games.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.370
You can learn to
enhance your action

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:41.636
with transactional capabilities,
a persona, and to personalize.

00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:43.450
And there's sessions
on how to set up

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.430
the alpha and beta releases
that we talked about,

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.970
and then build and
grow your user base.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.240
Finally, we have office hours
and a sandbox where you can

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.635
talk to members of the team.

00:37:55.635 --> 00:37:57.790
TORI BURMEISTER: My
team works with hundreds

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.210
of partners globally, helping
them create better assistive

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.680
experiences.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.320
We've seen a lot of
these challenges.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.150
And this list is created
from what we've learned.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.470
We hope that by
sharing these 12 tips,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.200
we have given you a head start
in creating great actions.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.620
I look forward to seeing how
you innovate in the space

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.390
and create cool
assistive actions.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.747
