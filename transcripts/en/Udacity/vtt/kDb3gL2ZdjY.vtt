00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
On the next flyer, there'll be a list of threats, and we're asking you to order these

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by the seriousness of the threat.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For the question, assume Alice is communicating with Bob

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
using TOR and wants to keep this a secret.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Alice uses the TOR protocol to set up a circuit between onion router 1, 2 and 3,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and uses onion router 3 as the exit node to reach Bob.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Answer by listing the letters in order from the most severe threat to the least severe--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for example--dacbe, which is not the correct answer. We'll give you that one for free.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Do note that some of these are subjective and multiple

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
orderings may be considered correct.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And here are the six threats--the first one,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
An attacker in the middle intercepts the Relay Extend request between onion router 2 and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
onion router 3 and attempts to set up a different Diffie-Hellman key.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The second threat, a malicious attacker controls the directory server from which Alice learns

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the identity keys of onion router 1, onion router 2, and onion router 3.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the third threat, Alice's Onion Proxy is compromised.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the fourth threat, an eavesdropping attacker can observe all network traffic.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the fifth threat, onion router 1 and onion router 3 are both controlled by the same

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
malicious attacker who has no other access to the network.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And the final threat, onion router 1 and onion router 2 are both controlled by the same

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
malicious attacker who has no other access to the network.

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Order these threats from the most severe to the least severe.
