00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:04.283
- [Voiceover] We have the
graph of y is equal to g of x

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:07.393
right over here, and what
I wanna do is I wanna check

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:10.769
which of these statements
are actually true

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.158
and then check them off.

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:14.592
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:17.438
and see if you can work
through this on your own.

00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:20.169
So let's look at this first statement.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.045
So this first statement says
both the limit of g of x

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:26.437
as x approaches six
from the right-hand side

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.946
and the limit as x approaches
six from the left-hand side

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.529
of g of x exist.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.729
All right, so let's first
think about the limit

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:39.339
of g of x as x approaches
six from the right-hand side,

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.701
as we approach six from
values greater than six.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.093
So if we look over
here, we could say okay,

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:48.374
when x is equal to nine, and
g of nine is right over there,

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:50.592
g of eight is right over here,

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.464
g of seven is right over here,

00:00:53.464 --> 00:00:56.240
looks like it's between negative
three and negative four,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.407
g of 6.5 looks like it's a little bit,

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:04.432
it's still between negative
three and negative four

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:06.126
but it's closer to negative three.

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:09.626
G of 6.1 is even closer to negative three.

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:14.671
G of 6.01 is even closer
to negative three,

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:18.885
so it looks like the limit

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.332
from the right-hand side does exist.

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.817
So it looks like this one exists.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.035
Now let's see, and I'm just
looking at it graphically.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:27.741
That's all they can expect you to do

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.080
in an exercise like this.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.441
Now let's think about the
limit as x approaches six

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.192
from the left-hand side.

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.037
So I could start anywhere,
but let's say when x is equal

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:41.524
to three, g of three is
a little more than one.

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:45.703
G of four looks like there's
a little bit less than two.

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:48.207
G of five looks like it's close to three.

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:52.040
G of 5.5 looks like it's
between five and six.

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:57.275
G of 5.75 looks like
it's approaching nine.

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:00.888
And as we get closer and closer,

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.567
as x gets closer and
closer to six from below,

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.649
from values to the left of six,

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.220
it looks like we're unbounded,
we're approaching infinity.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.432
And so technically, we would
say this limit does not exist.

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.204
So this one does not exist.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:16.918
So I won't check this one off.

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:18.827
Some people say the limit
is approaching infinity,

00:02:18.827 --> 00:02:20.827
but that technically is,

00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:25.638
infinity is not a value that you can say

00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:28.481
it is approaching in the
classical formal definition

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.482
of a limit.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.700
So for these purposes, we would just say

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.162
this does not exist.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:36.564
Now let's see, they say the
limit as x approaches six

00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:38.085
of g of x exists.

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:40.387
Well, the only way that the limit exists

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:44.113
is if both the left, if
both the left, the left,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:48.510
and the right limits exist and
they approach the same thing.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.467
We'll, our limit as x approaches
six from the negative side

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.533
or from the left-hand
side, I guess I could say,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:56.781
does not even exist.

00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:58.256
So this cannot be true.

00:02:58.256 --> 00:02:59.773
So that's not gonna be true.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.247
The first one's not gonna be true.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.184
G is defined as x equals six.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.775
So at x equals six, it doesn't
look like g is defined.

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:09.352
Looking at this graph, I can't tell you

00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:10.544
what g of six should be.

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:12.775
We have an open circle
over here, so g of six

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.763
does not equal to negative three,

00:03:14.763 --> 00:03:16.242
and this goes up to infinity,

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:18.483
and we have a vertical
asymptote actually drawn

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:20.436
right over here at x equals six.

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.691
So g is not defined at x equals six.

00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:24.329
So I'll rule that one out.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.207
G is continuous at x equals six.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.650
Well, you can see that
it goes up to infinity

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.587
then it jumps down, back
down here, then it continues.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.296
So when you just think about
it in commonsense language,

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:37.498
it looks very discontinuous.

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:39.186
And if you wanna think
about it more formally,

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:41.576
in order for something to be continuous,

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:44.934
the limit needs to exist at that value.

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:48.109
The function needs to be
defined at that value,

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.513
and the value of the
function needs to be equal

00:03:50.513 --> 00:03:52.079
to the value of the limit

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.165
and neither of these, the
first two conditions are true

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:58.220
and so these can't even equal
each other because neither

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.967
of these exist.

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.480
So this is not continuous at x equals six

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.020
and so the only think I can
check here is none of the above.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.975
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:13.158
So the first statement,
both the right-hand

00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:16.630
and the left-hand limit
exists as x approaches three.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.850
So let's think about it.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.998
So x equals three is
where we have this little

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:24.144
discontinuity here,
this jump discontinuity.

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:26.918
So let's approach, let's
go from the positive,

00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:28.469
from values larger than three.

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:33.056
So when x is equal to five,
g of five is a little bit

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:34.950
more negative than negative three.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.337
G of four is between negative
two and negative three.

00:04:38.337 --> 00:04:42.420
G of 3.5 is getting a bit
closer to negative two.

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:46.406
G of 3.1, it's getting even closer,

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:50.220
closer to negative two.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.637
G of 3.01 is even closer to negative two.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.259
So it looks like this
limit right over here,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.864
well, I'm circling the wrong one,

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.866
it looks like this limit exists.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:04.914
In fact, it looks like it
is approaching negative two.

00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:07.894
So this right over here
is equal to negative two.

00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:10.302
The limit of g of x as x approaches three

00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:12.887
from the right-hand side,

00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:16.252
and I'll just think about
it from the left-hand side.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:17.919
So I can start here.

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:22.901
G of one, looks like it's a little bit

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:25.605
greater than negative one.

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:28.022
G of two, it's less than one.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.839
G of 2.5 is between one and two.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.378
G of 2.9 looks like it's a
little bit less than two.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:41.408
G of 2.99 is getting even closer to two.

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:44.477
G of 2.99999 would be even closer to two

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.352
so it looks like this
thing right over here

00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:47.538
is approaching two.

00:05:47.538 --> 00:05:50.074
So both of these limits,
the limit from the right

00:05:50.074 --> 00:05:52.907
and the limit from the left exist.

00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:58.160
The limit of g of x as x
approaches three exists.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.250
So these are the one-sided limit.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.120
This is the actual limit.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.126
Now in order for this
to exist, both the right

00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:07.937
and left-handed limits need to exist

00:06:07.937 --> 00:06:10.090
and they need to approach the same value.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.094
Well, this first statement,

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:15.126
we saw that both of these exist
but they aren't approaching

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:16.129
the same value.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.118
From the left, we are, or sorry,

00:06:19.118 --> 00:06:21.370
from the right, we are approaching,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.401
we are approaching negative two.

00:06:23.401 --> 00:06:26.178
And from the left, we are approaching two.

00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:28.748
So this limit does not exist.

00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:32.451
So I will not check that out
or I will not check that box.

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:35.653
G is defined at x equals three.

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:38.500
Well, when x equals
three, we see a solid dot

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.744
right over there.

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:41.797
And so it is indeed defined.

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:44.506
It is indeed defined there.

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:47.040
G is continuous at x equals three.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.468
Well, in order for g to be
continuous at x equals three,

00:06:50.468 --> 00:06:53.158
the limit must exist there.

00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:54.994
It must be defined there,

00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:57.210
and the value of the function there

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.595
needs to be equal to
the value of the limit.

00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:02.192
Well, the function is defined there,

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:03.800
but the limit doesn't exist there

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.397
so it cannot be continuous.

00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:07.766
It cannot be continuous there.

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:09.308
So I would cross that out.

00:07:09.308 --> 00:07:13.272
And I can't click, I wouldn't
click none of the above

00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:15.231
because I've already checked something,

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:17.854
or I've actually checked
two things already.
