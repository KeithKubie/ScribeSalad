00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.340
Ever heard of the MBTI test? It's shorthand for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.500
First published in 1943, it still holds significance today and is used in many circumstances.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.670
ranging from marital counseling and relationship compatibility, to career selection and personal development.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.319
As lovers of psychology and personality types, we thought it would be fun to do a series on all sixteen types. Today we'll be talking about

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.199
INFJs otherwise known as 'The Advocate'.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.349
Here are seven fun secrets revealed about INFJs

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.069
One: They're magical unicorns!

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.320
Okay, not in a literal sense,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.610
But INFJs statistically have been reported as the rarest personality type. To be exact only one to two percent

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.360
of the world's population

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.069
identify as INFJs, with slightly more females than males. No wonder you're such mysterious creatures!

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.389
Two: They put the book in bookworm! As introverts, INFJs love to pass time with the good old reading hour.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.549
They enjoy learning new things and have a broad range of interests, whether it's history,

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:14.099
Hogwarts or psychology. If you find that your INFJ hasn't gotten back to your text, they might just be visiting platform nine and three-quarters

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.548
Three: They know how to climb the social ladder.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.970
Consider INFJs as the goats in society-

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.659
they know how to climb a mountain when they see one. Ambitious, knowledge- seeking and always open to self-improvement,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.430
This type does what it takes to reach their goals. If they aren't careful, however, they may push themselves too hard!

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.479
Four: They see things and understand them. Think of Charlie from The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a classic

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.350
INFJ, or Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye. The minute they walk into a room they can absorb everyone's moods.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.990
Five: They love a good puzzle!

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.299
INFJs might seem timid when you first meet them, but don't be fooled by their quiet demeanor.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.219
They never shy away from a good challenge. Deep thinkers with rich inner lives,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.879
INFJs enjoy problem-solving and reflecting on ethics.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.128
Six: They're classy AF! This type likes the finer things in life

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.129
whether it means enjoying a good glass of wine or wearing a snazzy pair of Oxford's they strive for

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.230
sophistication. It's important for them to look and feel good. You'll catch them owning one or two quality items instead of five cheap ones.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.319
Seven: They make routine on boring.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.459
INFJs are masters at

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.988
organizing. From filing papers at work and color coding bookshelves, to planning the week ahead with those nifty bullet journals.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.549
Meticulous about their details and regimens, you can always count on an INFJ to be prepared, punctual and persistent.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:52.049
