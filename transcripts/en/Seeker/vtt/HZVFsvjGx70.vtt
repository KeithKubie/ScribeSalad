00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.110
One of the most mysterious and unexplored
areas left on this planet is the ocean floor.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.890
We know next to nothing about it.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.730
We don’t know what’s down there, what
creatures lurk in its depths or even what

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.790
it looks like.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.990
But gravity might be able to lend us a hand.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.980
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.380
Scientists recently used what’s called “gravity
mapping” to map the ocean floor.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.770
And just like that sounds, it’s when satellites
measure gravity to tell the topography of

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.770
a place.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.150
In a study published in the journal Science
researchers merged data from two satellites

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.530
to reveal the underwater map.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.739
The satellites, CryoSat-2 and Jason-1, measured
the distance from their location in space

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.460
to the surface of the land or water on Earth.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.490
After filtering out the noise from waves and
other temporary changes in the ocean surface,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.539
the satellites found certain areas in the
ocean with more gravity than others.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.879
That’s because the mass of a mountain under
the ocean has more gravitational pull than

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.300
the water around it.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.879
So the water kind of piles up on top of the
mountain and creates different heights on

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.079
the surface of the water.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.869
A lower area has less gravity than a higher
area, because there is less mass.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.649
Using these changes in gravity, scientists
could measure the seafloor by measuring the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.229
surface of the ocean.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.840
The results confirmed some previous data on
the bottom of the ocean and found some new

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.360
discoveries too.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.979
In a study published in the journal Earth
and Planetary Science Letters, researchers

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.740
announced the discovery of a tiny new tectonic
plate called Mammerickx Microplate’.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.179
While most tectonic plates are huge, like
thousands of kilometers across.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.329
This little guy is just 150 km across, about
half the size of England.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.049
While tiny, it broke off a much bigger plate
when the Indian plate and Eurasian plate crashed

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.439
into each other about 47 million years ago.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.659
This map reveals how little we know about
the world around us.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.950
We've only mapped 0.05 percent of the ocean
floor to our highest level of resolution with

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.950
sonar.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.029
Most recently, we're using gravity mapping,
but 2,000 years ago guys were just throwing

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:00.700
measured ropes into the ocean with weights
on the ends.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.679
There's still a lot we don't know.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.249
We do know gravity isn’t equally distributed
around our planet.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.509
How much gravity you experience at a specific
point on the surface can change.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.370
Because Earth is more oblong than spherical,
it’s not equally dense, and the distance

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.500
from the center of the Earth to where you
stand can vary gravity's pull on you.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.640
Knowing all this, gravitational mapping has
helped reveal new information about our planet.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.159
Like a study published in the journal Geophysical
Research Letters found that the lowest acceleration

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.530
due to gravity is on Mount Nevado WASS CAR
ANNE Huascarán in Peru while the highest

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.090
is in the Arctic Ocean.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.060
As New Scientist puts it, “if you fell from
a height of 100 metres, you would hit the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.640
surface in Peru about 16 milliseconds later
than in the Arctic”.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Weird, right?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.099
So why do we care?

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.310
Besides the whole weighing less on a mountain
in Peru thing?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.640
Well it’s helpful for building things, engineers
need to know the local gravity layout when

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.659
designing buildings and infrastructure and
OF COURSE MEASURING GRAVITY IS AWESOME JUST

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.970
FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOTTOM OF
THE OCEAN.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.349
Maybe we’ll finally know exactly what our
home planet looks like.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.290
The oceans take up over 70% of this planet’s
surface, yet we know so little about them.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.510
Trace fills you in on all the bottomless details
we know over on testtube plus.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:26.780
Question So map nerds out there, what's your
favorite image or map of our pale blue dot?

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.219
