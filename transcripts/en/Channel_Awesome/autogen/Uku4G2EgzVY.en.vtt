00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
which seems kind of odd because first of
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.140
which seems kind of odd because first of
all it's getting fast-tracked like they

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150
all it's getting fast-tracked like they
 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.090
all it's getting fast-tracked like they
want this thing made and they want it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
want this thing made and they want it
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.180

made like yesterday it's starting to
 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.760
made like yesterday it's starting to
film in the fall so they don't have much

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770
film in the fall so they don't have much
 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.410
film in the fall so they don't have much
time to pull everything together

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420
time to pull everything together
 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.510
time to pull everything together
um so speculation is that they might be

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520
um so speculation is that they might be
 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.870
um so speculation is that they might be
doing this because this year is the 30th

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880
doing this because this year is the 30th
 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.660
doing this because this year is the 30th
anniversary of the franchise so maybe

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
anniversary of the franchise so maybe
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.740
anniversary of the franchise so maybe
they're trying to pull something

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750
they're trying to pull something
 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.450

interesting thing with a new

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340
interesting thing with a new
 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.110
interesting thing with a new
technologically advanced doll there's a

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
technologically advanced doll there's a
 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.479
technologically advanced doll there's a
tiny doll running at you with a knife it

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489
tiny doll running at you with a knife it
 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.100

creepier if it's not technologically

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440
creepier if it's not technologically
 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.289
creepier if it's not technologically
advanced it is if it's it's kind of

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299
advanced it is if it's it's kind of
 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.690
advanced it is if it's it's kind of
creepy or if it's an older toy right

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
