00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.640
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Thanks Alex.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
Hi everybody.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.020
[audience murmurs response] Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.640
I got word this afternoon that it is assessment
time at Google, so hopefully I can calm any

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080
nerves that might be happening during assessment
time and help you raise your own personal

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.890
assessments today.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.950
[giggles] But thank you for coming out.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.550
Thank you for showing up.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.640
I am out here on my book tour for this new
book, Spirit Junkie, which is my second book.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.920
My first book came out in 2010 and it's called
Add More -ing to Your Life -- A hip guide

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.010
to happiness.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.960
Ing, i-n-g, stands for inner guidance, not
the other ING, [chuckles] but it's inner guidance,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.030
not the bank.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.229
And I've been practicing and teaching principles
for transforming your perceptions and creating

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.900
positive changes in your life and I've been
teaching this work for the past six years.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.580
And I came to write this second book as a
result of many of my readers, my first book

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.620
came out and many of the -ing readers came
to me and said, we love this book, it's so

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.990
prescriptive, it's really helping us, I love
taking all this action in my life, but I wanna

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.330
know more about how you became the happiest
person you know.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.990
How did you change your perceptions?

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.760
How did you overcome your fears?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.070
How did you get over addiction?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.619
How did you get over work addiction, love
addiction, drug addiction, all the different

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.250
things that each of us in some corner of our
life deals with in some way?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.830
And so, I, I had to listen to that call of
my readers and I was inspired and guided to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.680
write this new book, Spirit Junkie, and really
put my story on paper and be very authentic

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.539
about who I am and what my experiences have
been so that I could not only be a genuine

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.540
messenger, but also be a guide for those who
were inspired by my story.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.170
So throughout each chapter in every book there
is my own personal anecdotes of how I've experienced

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.900
my fear-based illusions and how I've transformed
them and within every chapter there's also

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
beautiful guidance, there's tips, which I'm
gonna give you many of them today.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.019
And so it's not, it's not just a memoir, it's
a memoir-style-guide book is what I've written,

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.290
so it gives you this opportunity to soak up
someone else's experience, be inspired by

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.939
somebody else's story, but in the same moment,
take on your own experience of creating whether

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.809
it be a spiritual relationship or you could
call it a relationship with your own internal

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:56.520
guidance system, or activating your inspiration,
or creating more life flow.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.870
A big, a big thing that happens when people
come to my lectures or come to my groups or

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.150
read my books, is that a common through line
with most of the people that come to me is

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.569
that they're feeling as though at least one
corner of their life is not flowing naturally.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.889
They're feeling like, ok, I think things could
be dialed up a little bit more in my career

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.920
area, or I have a great relationship to my
finances, but I'm a complete mess in my romantic

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.939
relationships.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.640
Or there's some corner that feels as though
it could be more amplified, it could be more

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.959
inspired, it could flow more naturally.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.659
Or maybe it's every corner.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.219
Many people come to me and they say, across
the board things are tough, I'm in fear.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.120
And so all of my work is to help my readers
and my listeners and my audiences learn to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.260
shift their perceptions and create change
in their life.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.650
And so what I'll do today is I'll give you
a little bit of a background about how I became

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.150
the happiest person I know, how I became a
spirit junkie and then within that story,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.230
I'm gonna give you some guidelines for you
to start to do the same.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.079
And the purpose of this book and my, my goal
for this book was not to say, ok, here is

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.430
my story, here is how I did it, here is how
you have to do it.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.979
But rather just to create a platform for you
to crack open, to have the willingness to

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:15.419
make your own change and to help you create
a relationship, a spiritual relationship or

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:21.320
a, an inspired relationship to your own inner
guidance system of your own understanding.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.780
So this isn't about you just saying, ok, I'm
gonna take her work and do it my way, it's

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.410
about you opening up and creating your own
path through the guidance I'll give you.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.030
So throughout my experience of writing this
book, I really tell this story of how throughout

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.320
my life, from adolescence to the present,
I have been hearing this knock on the door,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.610
this inspiration, this inner dialogue, this
voice within me that has said, be great, be

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.820
wonderful, love yourself, have an incredible
life, you can do this, you can have what you

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.100
desire, you can achieve a life beyond your
wildest dreams.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.400
And each of us has that loving voice within
us.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.520
Each of us has that intuition, I call it your
ing, your inner guide, that loving presence

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.410
within you that is like, yes, you rock, you
can do this.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.200
But at some point in time, most of us at a
very young age, we pick up this negative belief

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.290
system.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.500
We pick up the beliefs of the world, we pick
up the fears of our parents, we pick up the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.370
fears of our, of the news, of the people on
the playground, of our teachers.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.940
At some point in time we pick up this one
negative mad idea, it becomes like a virus

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.470
in our mind.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.580
And these different limiting beliefs come
to each of us in different ways.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.440
For some people it might be just something
as simple as maybe your parents didn't pay

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440
attention to you.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.110
So you feel 'I'm not good enough because when
I was six my parents didn't pay attention

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.150
to me'.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.170
And this, it could be as simple as this.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.050
Or it could be something much more traumatic
that you know, all of us have different pain

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.720
experiences throughout our lives.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.420
But at some point in time, that negative belief
system is imprinted within our emotional being

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.030
and we recreate that belief system.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.810
We replay that negative thought pattern.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.280
We take that negative thought pattern and
bring it into our present moment and we project

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.330
it on to the future.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.550
And it becomes like this spiral and we become
stuck.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.640
We stay cornered in these negative patterns.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.690
I'm sure most everyone in this room in some
area in your life feels as though you keep

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.970
replaying the same crazy crap over and over
and over again.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.690
And just get honest with yourself right now.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.690
You don't have to get honest in front of all
of your coworkers, but get honest with yourself

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.950
right now and just be really clear with yourself
of what are the areas where I'm replaying

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.950
all that stuff?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.200
Where am I saying to myself, I'm not good
enough?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.920
In what ways am I replaying that belief system
that I picked up as a kid?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.680
It's something as simple as 'I'm not feeling
like I can have that career' or growing up

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.590
with the experience of lack in your home and
then believing in lack and never feeling as

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.280
though you can make more money.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.610
Or seeing your divorced family and seeing
that you know 'I can't have a powerful, loving

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.310
relationship because this is what I grew up
around'.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.170
And so for me this was the case in many different
corners of my life.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.920
I was this adolescent girl having an existential
crisis and I felt as though I was really confused

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.630
when most of my contemporaries were worried
about the prom and you know what they're having

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.450
for lunch, I cared more about why I was here.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.090
I always had this deep desire to know what
is the purpose?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.800
What is my purpose?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.970
Why am I here at this time?

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.780
And there was this, this 16-year old girl
and this, this crazy mindset of what's going

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.210
on?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.270
And as many young people, I experienced a
lot of depression.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.630
I felt as though I was just stuck.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.270
I felt as though I was misunderstood.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.139
And so for me, I grew up in the suburbs with
this Yogi mom and a hippie dad and I turned

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.930
to my mom for guidance.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.770
I said to my mom, listen, I see you walk into
your meditation shrine every day.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.770
I hear that mantra coming through the door.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.300
I smell the incense pouring out through underneath
the door.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.390
What goes on in that room?

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.460
I see you go in crazy and I see you walk out
calm.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.669
What goes on in that room?

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:01.160
I want some of that.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.500
And so I said if I want what she has, I gotta
do what she does.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.669
And so as a 16-year old girl I turned to my
mother and I said, show me what you got.

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:09.070
Give me that meditation practice.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.020
Teach me what you're doing.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.460
And so my mom sat my ass down on a meditation
pillow [laughs] and she taught me how to meditate.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.040
And so at 16 years old I was desperate.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.270
I was willing.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.270
I had this deep desire to change.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.320
I needed a solution.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.630
And so I allowed my mom's words to come through
me, I allowed the mantra to come through me

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.200
and I began, at the time, what began my meditation
practice.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.279
And so I felt this amazing connection from
the beginning stages of my practice.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.449
I started to feel that within five minutes
of sitting in stillness and deep breathing

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:46.920
and practicing the mantra that I could actually
feel more calm.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.760
I witnessed my extremities begin to tingle.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.800
I felt like I was connecting to a much greater
energy than the energy that I was just dealing

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.459
with on my day to day life.

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:58.490
I felt inspired ideas come forward.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.670
I felt, most importantly, peace.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:07.410
I felt a sense of peace, a sense of oneness,
a sense of being good enough, a sense of being

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.750
understood even though nobody else was around.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.350
And so this was a really neat time for me.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.230
It was this beautiful seed that my mom had
planted that would then become the catalyst

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.269
for many changes in the future.

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:26.089
But, like most smart-ass adolescent girls,
I thought that there was a better way.

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:30.350
I said, ok, that's cool, I got that now, but
there's gotta be a way better way than this.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.529
So I did what most kids do, which is, you
know, I rolled the joint and drank a 40.

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:36.220
And I said ok this is, this is the other way.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220
Right?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.330
It's something out there is gonna make me
happy.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.910
Something beyond me is gonna be my source
of peace.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:50.410
And so for several years, from 16 to about
the age of 25, I was on a big search for that

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.449
outside source of happiness.

00:09:52.449 --> 00:09:54.649
I was looking for it in my credentials.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.529
I was looking for it in my relationships.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.910
I was looking for it in a pair of shoes.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.139
I was living in New York City when I graduated
college and at 21 years old I started a public

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:06.970
relations business representing night clubs.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.220
And so I was out there feeling like, ok, now
I have arrived.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.089
I had this credential and it says president
on my business card and I'm 21-years old and

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:15.199
I am hot shit.

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.199
Sorry.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.199
Can I curse at Google?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:18.199
I'm not sure.

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:20.050
[laughing] I guess so, it's comfortable here.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.800
Should've asked that first, right Alex?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.519
So meanwhile I'm sitting here thinking that
I'm this great, this great thing because I've

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:32.240
got these outside credentials, I've got this
fast-paced New York City lifestyle.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.490
I have it made.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.930
This is working for me.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.839
Meanwhile, that search became this addiction.

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.220
Looking for more happiness.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.519
Once I would get that client, I needed more.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.290
When I had that relationship, I needed a different
relationship.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:50.069
And I constantly felt like I was this hamster
in a wheel, searching and searching and searching

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:54.519
for happiness and inspiration outside of myself.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.950
One day at a time I kept looking further and
further and further.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:04.560
By the time I turned 25, I had a really hardcore
revelation that that was not where I was gonna

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560
find it.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.759
By this point in my outward search I was emotionally,
spiritually and physically bankrupt.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:16.439
I had, I had no real friends.

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:18.820
No strong inspiration.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.680
I had found myself really addicted to the
New York City party scene and feeling like

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.949
that became my home and my lifestyle and that
reflected in some really nasty habits.

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:32.579
I also would see myself just up at night doing
God knows what.

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:37.019
But in the midst of all this there was still
that inspired voice within me.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:42.300
There was that loving voice, that power voice
within me that said, there's something coming.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.749
There's something greater.

00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:48.680
I'd be up at 3 a.m. at after-hours parties
in New York City saying to God knows who,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.939
"I'm gonna be a motivational speaker and a
self-help book author."

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:54.529
[chuckles] And somehow I believed me, I really
believed this.

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:57.740
I intuitively, psychically, knew that there
was this thing coming even though it did not

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.209
reflect in any form the life that I was living
at that time.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:06.129
And so by the time I turned 25 I thought to
myself, ok, this is not working.

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:07.689
Life is not flowing.

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:13.800
And that divine moment when I said to myself,
there has to be a better way.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.820
I had that moment of surrender.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.929
And so this is the first lesson I'm gonna
give you today which is that all you need

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:26.670
to make any change to your life is the deep
surrender and the willingness to change.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.670
And so I had that.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.470
It was October 2, 2005, at 3:00 in the morning.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.119
And I was sitting at home and I was coming
down from God knows what.

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:40.019
I was you know late nights whatever it was
all of the crazy crap that I had been putting

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:44.019
into my body, all of the terrible ways that
I had been living and I was writing in my

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:49.999
journal and I wrote, "God, universe, whoever
is out there, I need a miracle."

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:52.699
There has to be a better way.

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:55.300
This was the moment that I fully surrendered.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.829
This was the moment that I said, "Show me
what you got."

00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:03.950
I woke up that morning and I heard a really
loud internal dialog.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.949
A really strong intuition.

00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:13.670
It said, "Get your life clean and you will
live beyond your wildest dreams."

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.860
This loud voice was very authoritative and
very clear and I had no other choice but to

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.800
listen to that guidance.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.329
And so from that day, October 2, 2005, I have
been listening to that voice.

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:32.370
And one day at a time I have been opening
up that willingness to be guided to the teachers,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.569
the lessons, and all of the universal guidance
that we receive once we become willing to

00:13:37.569 --> 00:13:38.569
change.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:42.720
And opening my heart one day at a time to
make these shifts within my own life.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.470
And so it's that beautiful line when the student
is ready, the teacher will appear.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.929
And this is the case for me and I'm sure it
will be for many of you in your life.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:54.140
When once you make that willingness to change,
the book falls off the shelf.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.870
Or the teacher shows up in a form that you
could have never imagined.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:04.709
Or you hear something on the radio, or you
meet a cab driver or some enlightened conversation

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:08.639
comes into your realm that all of a sudden
is that shift that you needed to make that

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:13.430
change and create that catalyst that becomes
your greatest accomplishment, your greatest

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.430
shift.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.300
And so that's all we need at first, is that
slight willingness.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.519
That willingness that I had, that desire to
change, that moment to shift was all I needed

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:27.529
to become the woman I am today.

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:31.129
To live that life beyond my wildest dreams.

00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:36.019
And so when I became ready, I opened up and
I said, "Ok, I'm ready for change."

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:39.769
But what's beautiful and what is the main
purpose of what I teach is that once you make

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:43.779
that decision to change, you do not have to
do it by yourself.

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:47.149
You cannot be expected to make these changes
on your own.

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:50.730
All you need is that slight willingness.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.949
With that willingness you open up and like
I said your teacher will be guided to you

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:56.899
like a magnet way faster than you can imagine.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:00.209
And that teacher, I know that Thich Nhat Hanh
was here last week, did you, have many of

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:04.040
you, I hope every one of you followed that
man wherever he was on this campus because

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.769
that was one of my greatest teachers at that
time.

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:08.470
When I opened up I read Peace is in Every
Step.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.959
I would sit there in a subway station.

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:12.199
I would sit on the grass.

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:15.529
I would sit wherever I was and I would just
read Peace is in Every Step.

00:15:15.529 --> 00:15:20.160
That was one of my greatest teachers and so
Thich Nhat Hanh became my teacher in the form

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.749
of a book.

00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:26.319
Marianne Williamson, a great spiritual teacher,
became a beautiful guide for me.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:30.120
I would listen to her audio albums like a
top-40 hit.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.970
And Marianne teaches a metaphysical text called
A Course in Miracles.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.389
And it became very clear to me that the way
that she was teaching the course was really

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:40.480
something that would resonate with me deeply.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.860
And that many spiritual teachers come to a
path that is their guided path to teach.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:51.519
And it became very, very obvious that I was
to be a teacher of these messages.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:55.029
And so I came to her about a year into my
practice of studying the course through her

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:56.699
interpretation.

00:15:56.699 --> 00:16:00.149
And the Course in Miracles is a, is channeled
material, it's metaphysics.

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:04.009
It's not, it's totally non-denominational,
but it is the purpose and the message behind

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:09.369
A Course in Miracles is that we need to shift
our perceptions to create miraculous change

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:10.369
in our life.

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:16.230
So we need to take our fear-based projections
and turn them into a more loving, more positive

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.910
perspective, so that we can change our thoughts
and change our energy and therefore change

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.899
our life's experience.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.009
And so this is quite simple.

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:26.420
Our, our thoughts affect our energy.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.889
And our energy affects everything outside
of us.

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:35.590
And so what I learned as a student of A Course
in Miracles is that the outside world is a

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.769
reflection of my internal state.

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:41.790
And A Course in Miracles teaches that projection
is perception.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.170
So whatever you are projecting on your internal
movie screen, right, I'm not good enough,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.720
I'm not good enough, I can't get that raise,
I can't get that raise, I can't get a girlfriend,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.459
I can't get a girlfriend, like you know I
suck, I suck, I suck, I suck.

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:54.459
Whatever it is.

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:59.019
Whatever you're walking around with, you are
projecting onto your life.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.999
That internal projection makes perception.

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:06.570
Your internal movie screen is what you are
perceiving to be your reality.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:12.160
And so I, I became extremely conscious of
what my internal movie screen was saying.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.300
I became extremely aware.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.960
That's the second step I'm gonna give you.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.350
I will recap all of this for you, but it's
very, very important to recognize that one

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.730
of the most powerful tools we have is to become
the witness to our thoughts.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.930
And so as a student of this messaging, I came
to my teacher, Marianne Williamson, I went

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.740
to visit her at a lecture that she was hosting
in New York and I raised my hand in the audience

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.570
and I said, "Ok, Marianne, how would you suggest
I carry this message to my generation?"

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.090
And she looked at me and she psychically knew,
she said, "Ok, this is a, this is a job for

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.090
you, I get this.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.600
This is what you're gonna do."

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.320
And she said, the book A Course in Miracles
is written in three sections, and she said,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.480
"Read the text."

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.980
And the text is really where you begin to
embark on that reconditioning.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:03.080
Where you learn all the principles throughout
the messages of how we choose our fear-based

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.570
projections.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.280
How we project those fears onto others.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.440
How we're unwilling to forgive.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.510
All of the different ways that fear gets us
in a headlock.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.070
That's what the text guides us to understand.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.110
And then she said, "Do the workbook."

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:22.670
This is 365 days of daily meditations, where
you begin to go through a daily practice of

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.350
reconditioning your thoughts.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.230
From fear back to a positive perspective.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.750
And then she said, "Read the teacher's manual.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:35.080
And then ask the universe God, whatever you
talk to, ask God how you, how he plans for

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.360
you to carry this message to your generation."

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.690
And so I did just that.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.300
I became a student of A Course in Miracles
and I've been asking ever since, how can I

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.220
carry these messages?

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.980
And most importantly the main message I got
was just be the student, be the student, be

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980
the student.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.250
As a teacher, my primary purpose is to be
a student every day.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:03.040
And what I've learned in the past six years
as a teacher of spirituality, as a teacher

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:10.260
of A Course in Miracles, is that the world
is my classroom and people are my assignments.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:17.540
So every single moment offers me this divine
opportunity to go deeper into fear or to strengthen

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.050
my faith in love and positivity and a higher
level way of being.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:29.520
And so I'm gonna give you some of the tools
that I've been practicing as a spirit junkie

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520
in the past six years.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.510
I can give you a greater understanding of
how you can take these tools into your personal

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.880
experiences immediately.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.400
The neat thing that happens when you have
that awakening and that moment of 'yes, I'm

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.350
ready for change' and that teacher shows up
and you've been given these tools is that

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.330
you can create quantum shifts in your life
immediately.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:51.370
The moment that you choose to shift your perception
a miracle occurs.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.250
And the miracle is that you feel better.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:00.750
The miracle is that you raise your energetic
thought and therefore raise your energy and

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.380
then the world around you starts to vibrate
at a different frequency.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.110
So think about it for a second, those of you
who have coworkers who walk in, this place

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.440
is pretty happy, people.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.630
I'm not really too concerned about what's
going on here.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.150
You guys are well taken care of, you're well
fed.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.560
It's sunny outside.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.410
But you have those days when you come into
the office and you come in with a really bad

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.410
attitude, right?

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.700
Let's just say you got in late or something's
happening at home and you come in and you've

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.360
got a bad attitude.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.980
When you come in with that bad attitude, I'm
assuming that you lower the energy of those

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.990
around you.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.170
People start to get a little bit negative
back to you.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.970
Maybe those e-mails are not coming in as quickly
as you want.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.830
Maybe you're not figuring out the things that
you need.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.350
You're not given the energetic support that
you need to show up for this big job which

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.450
you all have at your highest capacity.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.140
So your low-level thoughts are affecting your
low-level energy and therefore affecting your

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:57.230
experience in the job, or your experience
on a date, or your experience in the gym.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.910
Whatever it is, however you are functioning
with low-level thoughts, you are affecting

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.330
low-level energy and therefore affecting your
life's experience.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.170
So all of the things that I'm gonna begin
to teach you are about how you can raise your

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.140
thoughts, have more faith in a higher-level
way of thinking and therefore have, more important,

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:19.920
a higher-level way of being, a more enlightened
experience, a more inspired experience.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.220
Another part of what this work does is that
when we start to shift our perceptions, when

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.750
we start to see things with a better perspective,
when we start to see our experiences as obstacles

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:37.240
turning into opportunities, or a resentment
as a divine assignment to forgive more or

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.240
a moment of lack as an opportunity to focus
on what we're grateful for rather than focus

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.570
on what we don't have.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.750
When we start to make these shifts within
our life, what begins to happen is that we

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.230
begin to have more faith in that way of being.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.020
And so the neat thing that occurs, and this
has been my experience the past six years

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:02.800
of practicing the life of a spirit junkie,
is that now my choices, my moment to moment

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.230
choices, are choosing more of a positive perspective.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:12.230
When there's traffic my first thought is,
ok, I welcome the traffic to go, I start to

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.410
think about the way, or if I'm supposed to
be late, maybe I'm meant to be there late.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.010
Maybe there's something greater coming.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.400
Or if something doesn't happen the exact way
that I believe it should happen, I know and

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.600
my first thought is, there's something way
greater coming.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.600
So this is just the types of miracles that
occur and the ways that your mind begins to

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.580
shift when you start to practice these principles
in your every corner of your life.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.790
And so one of the really neat things that
happened for me is that I started to find

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.260
really divine guidance throughout my life's
experience.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.700
And I'll give you one example of how that
guidance starts to come in.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.790
When you invite spirit and inspiration into
your life and you start to crack open and

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.941
start to perceive your ways in a little bit
of a more positive perspective, you start

00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:56.690
to see a lot of synchronicity show up.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.730
And so what happens is is that synchronicity
is always available to us at all times.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.860
But our fear-based thoughts block that synchronicity.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.580
We cut off communication with our internal
GPS.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.300
That loving voice is always there, it's always
working, it's always saying, go to that room,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.210
forgive your boss, they didn't mean to be
that way, or choose to see this differently,

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.960
or yes, you can have that job.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.790
Your loving voice is always ready to bring
you that loving perspective.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:30.050
But the negative voice within us, that chatter
of all of that fear-based beliefs, cuts that

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.080
communication off.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.830
It just cuts it off at the knees.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.930
And that communication, when it's cut off,
[claps hands lightly] blocks the synchronistic

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.540
flow that we are all allowed and ready to
receive at all times.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.850
So that synchronicity of wanting that new
job and that perfect employer being sitting

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.150
next to you on the bus, if you're in a low-level
thought, your energy is lowered, you won't

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.490
be smiling and that employer can't talk to
you.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.930
So you're cutting off the communication.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.220
You're cutting off the guidance.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.000
So once I opened up to that guidance, I started
to see the synchronicity show up in every

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
form.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.460
And often that that synchronicity, particularly
early on, will come in the form of your teachers

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.930
and your guides.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.270
And so for me I started to witness how I opened
up to make these changes in my life and I

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.510
was really ready to at this point in my life
I had been sober for awhile, I put down all

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.870
of the substances.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.890
I had started to recover from my work addiction.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.400
And I was recovering from my issues with food
stuff.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.920
But I was still hung up in my romantic relationships.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.940
It was a really trippy corner of my life.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:31.090
And so I, I turned to my inner guidance system
and I started to surrender again, much like

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.730
I did on October 2.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:37.190
I said I am willing to see things differently,
I am ready to change.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.170
I need another miracle.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.680
And so I started to pray for this miracle
and affirmed my desire to change.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.990
And so I started to get this guidance from
the universe.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.970
And one of my neighbors suggested that I meet
this woman named Rha Goddess.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.770
He said there's this really groovy woman,
she's out there, she's doing great work with

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.580
women, much like what you're doing, you should
totally meet her.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.710
So I said, ok that sounds cool.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:04.860
A week later my friend and I are having lunch
and she says, "You need to meet my friend

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.860
Rha Goddess."

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.680
I said, "Oh, this is the second time I've
heard this, I guess I should meet this lady."

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.030
I e-mailed this Rha Goddess, I'm like, 'hey
Rha Goddess, I guess we're supposed to meet

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.700
and I, I put it out there and she's like,
listen, I'd love to meet.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.830
I'm out of the country for most of March,
maybe we can meet when I get back'.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.040
I said to her, well, I'm actually leaving
the country in March, too, I'm going to visit

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.260
this medium in Brazil for a spiritual quest.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.230
She said, "Oh, I'm gonna be visiting this
same medium in Brazil the same week that you're

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.020
there."

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.730
I said, "Ok, maybe I'll see you in Brazil,
ok."

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.810
So I go off to Brazil, I don't meet Rha.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.520
A week, that, that, on my flight back from
Brazil I'm sitting next to a woman who had

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.610
been there as well and she says to me, "Oh,
you live in New York.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.930
It sounds like you're doing neat work.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.120
You should totally meet this woman.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.120
Take this card."

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.830
Rha Goddess.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.140
A week later I'm in New Orleans for Eve Ensler's
V-Day.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:58.120
And I'm looking at the lineup of different
speakers and I see 12 noon Rosario Dawson,

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.910
and we've got Jane Fonda and then at 2:00
p.m., Rha Goddess.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:09.290
So it became very clear to me that this woman
was going to be some kind of powerful influence

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.600
in my life in some form.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.530
And so I took the universal memo and I finally
found my friend and I said 'ok Rha, let's

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.250
meet, let's take some time just to get together.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.540
Clearly we are being pushed into each other's
lives, the synchronicity is way too wild.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.540
Show me what you got.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.540
Let's hang out.'

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.510
So we meet up and as I mentioned I was going
through a lot of my own personal traumas at

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.510
this time.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.560
I was, I was coaching, I was teaching, but
I was teaching young women how to release

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.340
fear in their romantic relationships, but
meanwhile I felt like a fraud because I was

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.440
feeling completely fearful in that way.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.280
And my willingness to change guided me.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.330
So I go and I meet with Rha and I say, listen
you know I would love to talk about business

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.660
to business, what are you doing?

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.470
And she begins to tell me instead of talking
about business, she starts telling me about

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.380
how she called in her romantic partner and
her husband and she started to beam about

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.740
how she got over all of her fear-based illusions
and came to a place where she was a much more

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.540
loving perspective and had this amazing relationship
with her husband and was so proud of the work

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.510
she had done around her romance.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.250
And so I said to her, "Awesome, I want that,
that's what I want."

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.490
And I knew that she had coached people, so
I said, "Do you still coach people?"

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.310
And she said I only coach a handful of people
a year and they're people that I want to take

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.510
to the next level.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.160
I coach people just like you.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.630
And I said, "Tell me where to sign the check.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.630
Where do I sign up?"

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.080
And she then became my guide, became my teacher.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.170
That slight willingness opened that door for
me to be led to the woman who would be the

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.690
change maker, who would be the container for
me to do all the transformational work that

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.830
I needed to do to kick this one fear that
had been holding me back, had me in a headlock

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:48.630
for 28 years, and through the work I did with
Rha, I was able to release those chains and

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.220
now today live in a very free-flowing, incredible
way.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.660
But this is just a beautiful example of how
when you do become willing, when you invite

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.590
that spiritual intervention, when you invite
that guidance around you, when you open up

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.020
the dialog for that communication, then you
can allow that synchronicity to pour into

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.740
your life and guide you to the right people,
guide you to the right book, guide you to

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.770
the right lecture, guide you to the right
bookstore, wherever you need to be to be led

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.840
to your greatest teacher who will be the catalyst
for your change.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.400
And so my hope for you today, my goal for
you today, was to open up your mind to start

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.590
to see the corners of your life where things
aren't flowing naturally.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.240
To take a little magnifying glass and say,
"Things could be more clear here.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.310
I could be happier in this area of my life.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.080
I could have more flow over here.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.930
I'd like to see things differently here."

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.850
And start to open up and become willing to
make that change.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.950
And so much like myself I want to be very
clear this, this shift does not require a

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.760
lot of work out there.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.400
It requires a commitment in here.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.410
It requires a daily intention.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:06.950
The world around us gives us plenty of opportunities
to think and feel crazy fear.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.950
Right?

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.980
All we have to do is just turn on the news.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.750
All we have to do is sometimes show up to
the office and then that fear just comes down

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.750
upon us.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.400
Not here at Google, but in other offices.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.390
It's not so fearful here, it's pretty groovy.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.060
People are riding bikes and you know, doing
whatever.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.480
But, but in general we have a lot of chaos
that we need to, we wake up in the morning

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.080
and it's like we got to put on our armor because
walking out the door is gonna give us another

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.370
opportunity to have fear in front of us.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:36.760
And so we have a lot of work to do to overcome
these fear-based projections.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.350
And so the first step for each of you is just
to become willing to see things differently.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:46.330
And so much like myself, I hope for all of
you to become conscious and aware of the ways

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:52.700
in which your limiting beliefs, your fear-based
projections, your negative thoughts are holding

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.990
you back.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.350
How are they keeping you small?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.030
How are they keeping you stuck?

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.970
How are they lowering your energy?

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.570
How is your negative energy affecting your
life's experience?

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.570
Right?

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:10.110
How are you when you show up on that date
and you're like, "I hate going on dates.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.110
I suck at dates."

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.110
Right?

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.110
Is that really attractive?

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.110
Not really, right?

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.110
[giggles] I don't think that's very attractive.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.520
Or, you know, you show up and you're trying
to get your review and you're going in for

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.920
your review and you're like, oh my God, oh
my God, I suck, I suck.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.640
You're not supporting your employer wanting
to raise you up, right?

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.490
You need to raise yourself up if you want
the world to reflect that back to you.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.390
Remembering that the outside world is a reflection
of our internal state and if we want to have

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.710
the world support us, we have to support ourselves.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.120
And so we have to support ourselves with our
thoughts first and foremost.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.531
So I hope for each of you to take a little
brief moment of this story of my experience

00:30:48.531 --> 00:30:55.510
of how I chose that other way, I lived in
that way of fear and projection and then I

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.100
chose to see things differently.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.130
Now one of the greatest tools I've been using
throughout my practice is the practice of

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.890
meditation and prayer.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.690
Now prayer can be for you something as simple
as setting an intention.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.809
It could be your little alarm clock on your
Android that comes up in the morning and says,

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:12.530
I choose to have a good day today.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.490
I choose to see things in a positive perspective.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.260
Whatever it may be, just setting a positive
intention daily is a massive part of this

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.600
practice.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.950
Meditation.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.040
How many of you practiced meditation with
Thich Nhat Hanh?

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.110
Did you guys get a chance to do that?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.530
I'm so happy, I'm so jealous.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.420
So hopefully you learned something from him.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.190
Maybe you can take something from him.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.559
But throughout my book every chapter has a
guided meditation.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:38.500
I created a meditation album to accompany
this book.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.350
So having a guided meditation practice often
when you're, if you're a meditation newbie

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:48.360
and you've never meditated before, find a
guide, whether it be me, go on to iTunes and

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.950
just Google guided meditation.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.070
I'll come up, other teachers will come up,
Thich Nhat Hanh will come up, Jack Kornfield

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.590
will come up, Sharon Salzburg, all these beautiful
teachers.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.330
Let these teachers just lead you.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:04.270
Allow that guidance to open up your right
brain, which is your creative capacity.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.000
The part of each of you that's gonna have
the inspired ideas that will keep the interweb

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
moving, right?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.650
We need you people to be inspired.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.470
And to have that loving voice just present
in your life.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:19.140
And that when we sit in stillness for five
minutes a day, I'm gonna prescribe to each

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.890
of you five minutes a day for the next thirty
days.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.600
Just give yourself five minutes of stillness.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.190
You live in a beautiful environment.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:32.440
You can probably go to your backyard, sit
outside somewhere, sit on campus somewhere

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.870
here for five minutes, sit in the sun, listen
to your favorite song, listen to a guided

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:41.809
meditation, listen to Thich Nhat Hanh, listen
to the voice of a teacher that guides you

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:47.370
and just allow yourself to tune in to your
power energy.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.600
Activate that loving presence within you.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.380
And all it needs, all that this requires,
is five minutes of stillness.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.309
And so give yourself that.

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.320
Give yourself that moment of 'I choose to
see things differently'.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.920
Maybe you do set your alarm in the morning
that says I choose to see things differently.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.750
And just allow yourself to awake into another
perspective.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.970
And then also just most importantly, start
to focus on the good stuff as many people

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.490
like to say in this business.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.309
Focus on what is enlightening to you.

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:19.270
Focus on what you do have.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.390
Focus on all of the resources in front of
you.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.510
Whenever you get into a mindset of lack, say
I have the most awesome job on the planet,

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.250
which you all have a great job, right?

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.190
I have beautiful employees, I have great lunch,
whatever it is.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.530
Just focus on the amazing things.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:36.950
And what happens when gratitude is our attitude
is that we raise the energy again and that

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.000
energy raises our life's experience.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.750
So start to pay attention and focus on the
good stuff.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:48.110
And be conscious in every moment of your day
when those limiting beliefs come in, when

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.720
those negative thoughts show up and be very
aware to not judge your fear-based thoughts

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.640
with more fear.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.470
Be very gentle with yourself when you begin
this process of paying attention to your thoughts,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.830
because at first you might be like, oh, my
God, I only think fear all the time.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.830
This is a mess.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.830
I can't get over this.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.309
I'll never ever get over this, right?

00:34:06.309 --> 00:34:10.810
But rather than doing that, just start to
pay attention of, just witness, as Eckhart

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.100
Tolle says, he says, "Be the witness to the
thinker."

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.560
So just witness the thoughts very gently.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.510
Be kind and forgiving to yourself.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.920
I like to say practice the f-word, the forgiveness.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.790
And really allow yourself to be really present
with that forgiveness practice of really being

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.730
kind to yourself, being gentle with your thoughts,
saying, well, of course I had that negative

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:32.730
thought.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.440
I've been thinking that thought for 30 years,
but you know today I'm gonna choose to see

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440
things differently.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.619
And be very very kind when you embark on this
process.

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:43.760
And then a major tool that I want to leave
you with is that you can begin to practice

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.960
the f-word in all of your affairs and start
practicing forgiveness as often as you can.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.540
When we carry a resentment towards someone
it's like drinking poison.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.070
We are the one who carries around that negative
belief system.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.080
We are the one who just keeps harboring that
negativity.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.920
And we take that negative fear-based experience
and we bring it into the present moment and

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.850
we project it onto all the, all the other
relationships that we have.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.930
That employer who fired us at some point we
bring that into the new job.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.860
We create the opportunity to be fired again.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.070
That relationship that was negative, we bring
that into the new romantic relationship and

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.680
we create more chaos in every corner there.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.900
So be conscious of how your resentments are
holding you back and become clear and ready

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.130
and willing to let them go.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.840
And so the practice of forgiveness can be
very scary for people and so there's three

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.550
simple steps I'll leave you with.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:39.420
And one of them is to become willing to forgive,
witnessing who you need to forgive and be

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.320
willing to forgive.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.440
The second step is to become conscious of
your side of the street.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.120
How have you been participating in your negative
resentment?

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.690
Maybe you're participation is that you've
been unwilling to forgive.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.080
Maybe your participation is that you had some
negative stuff that you did, too.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.260
But be very conscious to clean up your side
of the street.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.940
Forgive yourself for whatever you did, but
be aware of your part.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:12.210
And then the third step is to surrender and
be willing to forgive daily.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:17.690
All you have to do in this third part is just
to say to yourself every morning, every night,

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.440
'I choose to release you, I choose to forgive
you'.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.410
Whether it be yourself, whether it be another
person, whether it be an institution, whoever

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.350
you or whatever you are willing to let go
of.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.270
Say 'I choose to forgive you, I choose to
release you'.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.640
And practice that mantra.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.780
Whenever that fear-based projection comes
up, just set that intention one more time.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.020
'I choose to forgive you, I choose to release
you'.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.100
And that moment when you make that decision,
the moment that you affirm your desire to

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.350
forgive, you awaken that inner guidance system.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:55.000
You reconnect with that voice and you can
be guided once again to the teachers, the

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.780
assignments and all the things that you need
to allow that forgiveness process to occur.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.119
And you don't have to figure it out anymore,
you just have to be willing and surrender

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:08.150
it and allow the universe to show you what
she's got, ok?

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.880
So that's, that, these are just some different
tips throughout the book that I've given you

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.850
now, just to give you a broad overview of
the different ways that I have been practicing

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.420
the life of a spirit junkie in changing my
own perceptions.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.210
And so today I do live a life beyond my wildest
dreams.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:32.750
Today my job is to come and hang out at Google
on an afternoon on Friday and be with people

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.480
like yourself and carry these messages.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.760
Today I live an inspired life.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.850
Today I feel intuitive guidance all the time.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.780
All of my hang ups have melted away.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.550
All of the things that I feel I need I know
they're coming or greater.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:56.740
And I allow this work to just grow and expand
naturally because I live inspired.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:02.170
And so I hope for each of you to find a way
throughout your life's experience to awaken

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.840
your -ing, your inner guidance system, and
start to practice the spirit junkie way.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:12.880
And start to welcome your own perceptual shifts
one moment at a time.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.140
So before we take some questions, I'm just
gonna wrap up with, I like to, at the end

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.680
of all my book lectures, just read the last
page and a half of the book, to just give

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.580
you sort of an insight as what happens once
you start to live as spirit junkie.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.980
So here we go.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.860
[pause] "Constant contact with spirit got
me here.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.590
When it came time to conclude this book, I
found myself putting it off.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:44.470
I wanted to savor the last chapter, take my
time, and allow the words to pour through

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.470
me.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.950
And I did just that.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.950
I waited.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.690
I revisited all the chapters leading up to
this point.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:55.400
Reflecting on the pages of this book I was
astounded to find that I didn't even realize

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400
what I had created.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.040
There were stories and sentences that seemed
as though they'd come from a higher source.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.410
I kept thinking, 'I don't remember writing
this.'

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.310
This experience was a sure sign that I had
done good.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.770
I'd truly allowed spirit to enter into the
process and guide me.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.550
Clearly I hadn't over thought the contents
of the book, but rather allowed the work to

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.690
flow creatively from my inside out.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.520
This book is an extension of my spirit and
all the inner guidance that I choose to work

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.520
with.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.530
By listening to this guidance I've enjoyed
every second of the writing process.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.730
I've healed more, learned more and loved more.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.710
I've deepened my relationship with spirit
throughout the collaborative effort to create

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.710
this book for you.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:41.560
Throughout my process of creating this work,
I felt a presence by my side.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.100
Often a rush of energy would pour through
my hands.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.030
Inspired ideas would come to me in the middle
of the night.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:53.660
Human guidance was always present and new
assignments led to authentic content.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:57.869
Each moment of the process has been guided
and I hope you felt the presence of a power

00:39:57.869 --> 00:40:00.840
greater than me pour off each page.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.120
Each word, thought and sentence is infused
with spirit's love.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.390
Together let's say thank you.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.890
We thank the infinite loving universe and
the beautiful spirit that flows through each

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.010
of us.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.580
We thank spirit for your guidance, your inspiration,
your lessons and your support.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.710
We thank you for reminding us to have faith
in love.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.040
With endless love and gratitude, I send you
off with the spiritual connection of your

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.840
own understanding.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:33.190
A connection that will be yours to grow and
share with the world, an everlasting companion

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.390
on your miraculous journey in word.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:43.140
May you release your fear, have faith in spirit,
expect miracles and always listen to your

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.710
inner guide."

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.950
So I will leave you with that.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:51.310
I will take any questions if anyone has them
related to anything.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.130
I wonder, any questions?

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.130
Looking at you.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.119
Do you have a question?

00:40:58.119 --> 00:40:59.119
[laughter]

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:04.170
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Somebody's gotta have
some kind of question.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.510
I know you're in your office.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.510
Yes?

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.200
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.560
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: What was that?

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.930
&gt;&gt;male #1: How much we have achieved [inaudible]

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.290
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Through meditation,
yes.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.310
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.940
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: I love this question.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.450
Thank you for this question.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:33.340
So, yes, there is a dramatic shift that occurs
when you have a meditation practice.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.130
I one day at a time began to expand that practice.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.640
And it's much like going to the gym.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.530
So it's like when you first start working
out, you feel, you're sore and it's uncomfortable

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:47.260
and you kind of hate going, but the more you
go the more it becomes second nature, the

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.280
more you enjoy the practice, the more it becomes
part of who you are.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.210
And so that was my experience with meditation.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:59.970
And so one day at a time, I grew this practice
which was 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:04.540
Eventually I would get to a place where I
could sit for an hour and just be in stillness

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.280
and what would happen for me was that I would
lose track of time.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.420
Time became irrelevant and I would open up
that right brain and I could create images

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.420
in my mind.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.580
I could start to have inspired ideas come
forward, sort of psychic projections in many

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:24.830
cases, knowing, seeing things like if I was
working on a project I would hear a strong

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:30.170
intuition that would say, role model, or say
word or something would come through in my

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.170
writing.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:36.610
And these conscious moments of divine inspiration
became my greatest, my next right action in

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.810
my career or became a relationship I needed
to be guided into.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:46.100
So what happened was I opened up this creative
capacity to experience that guidance and most

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.580
importantly, I began to experience tremendous
flow within my life.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.970
I started to feel at ease.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.530
So today because of my practice I wake up
with a tremendous amount of ease.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.870
I wake up and I feel good.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:06.780
And in those moments when I feel out of center
and off kilter, I know how to tune back in.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:11.940
So for five minutes I can just go sit in stillness
and breathe, set some positive intentions

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.440
and be back in that centered state.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.750
So it's really what happens when you have
a meditation practice is that you learn how

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:23.721
to recalibrate your energy in any moment and
knowing that this is your greatest tool, your

00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:29.060
body, your being, your energy, your spirit
is your greatest asset and through meditation

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.470
you can begin to learn how to tune, that dial
that up, like tune into the frequency of a

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.770
loving presence on a moment to moment basis.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.470
So the best gift that any of you could give
yourselves in this world is the practice of

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:40.630
meditation.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:44.220
May you find it, I hope you do.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.280
Anybody else?

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.190
I knew, I had a feeling that you guys might
be a little quiet and introspective, but that's

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.190
ok.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.151
So, so listen, if there are any more questions,
I would love to take them.

00:43:55.151 --> 00:43:56.151
Yes, Christine.

00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:57.151
&gt;&gt;Christine: [inaudible] So I actually know
Gabby, we're friends, but I have to ask this

00:43:57.151 --> 00:43:58.480
question because I know that you were like
the book launch and you were traveling around

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:12.160
and you have a lot of stress in your life
right now and I'm [inaudible] would be a lot

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.530
of stress trying to juggle lots of things,
so I'm just curious like what you're doing

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.080
right now to keep your energy level up and
you know be able to do all the things that

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.520
you're doing, [inaudible] all the things that
your doing besides just meditation that any

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.980
one of us could, you know, bring into our
lives.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.980
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Great question.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980
Yeah.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.870
So what am I doing to manage my stress levels
right now?

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:32.390
You know in general in any area of your life
but especially being on a book tour and traveling

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.430
a lot or whatever.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:39.650
And for each of you having high-powered jobs,
all the things you have to deal with, manage.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.460
For me there's, there's several different
way that I stay in tune, like I mentioned,

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.830
where I stay calibrated into a loving frequency.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.710
The first way obviously is through my meditation
practice.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:54.450
The second way is through that conscious contact
with my inner guidance system.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.210
So it's consciously speaking, maybe it's an
internal dialog, maybe sometimes it's saying

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.140
it out loud, maybe sometimes setting an intention
by writing it in, in a notebook.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:08.620
But consciously setting the moment to moment
intention to stay centered.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.640
To be in the moment.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.210
To be ok with whatever is right in front of
me.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:17.070
If I start thinking about all of the cities
that I have to visit in the next ten days

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.210
or in the next three weeks, I will go nuts.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:24.520
But focusing on what it is, what's my next
right action today?

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.580
What is right in front of me?

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.980
I'm really focusing into the present moment.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.390
And being in that present moment allows me
to just be cool.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:32.390
I'm here at Google.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.390
I mean this is awesome.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:38.700
I can't be here with you guys worrying about
where I'm gonna be next weekend.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.880
Then I cannot be present with you.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.470
Then that stress level does get raised.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:47.710
Then I am not my authentic truth, I am not
my highest service and I'm not being me.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.830
So focusing on the moment to moment situations.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:54.170
And then most importantly practicing forgiveness
in all of the areas of my life.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:58.400
Because if I start getting resentful at others
then I lower my energy, I get sick, I cannot

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.980
support what I need to do.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.560
So when I get pissed off because the airplane
isn't on time or I get mad because I'm not

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.720
getting the feedback that I need to from my
publicist or whatever it is, I practice the

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.720
f-word.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.820
So I will say you know that gentle moment
of I choose to forgive you, I choose to release

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:19.460
you and let go of whatever it is that I need
to just let go of because I cannot focus on

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:26.050
that negative stuff if I want to live and
be this beautiful container to do this work.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:31.690
And each of you have massive, massive jobs
and you must keep your channel, your instrument

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:37.470
clear so that you can hold that work, feel
good, be balanced and have a vibrant life

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.880
at the same time.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.510
So those are some of the tools I use.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.510
&gt;&gt;Christine: And stop, drop and meditate.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.510
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Yes, yes, yes, that's
a good one.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.510
So, so I have this moment where I stop, drop
and meditate.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.660
If I have these moments where I'm feeling
like I'm all over the place and my message

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.430
to myself is stop, drop and meditate.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.830
And it's you know just go wherever you are,
sometimes I'll go into a bathroom and I'll

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:59.130
just shut the stall and I'll say, "I choose
to release this" and I'll breathe for five

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.470
minutes or five breaths, five deep breaths.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:07.470
A powerful meditation is just breathing into
your feelings.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.280
Just identifying wherever you might be holding
on to any discomfort.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.660
Join me in that right now.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.450
Everybody shut your eyes for a minute.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.940
Shut your eyes.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.900
You wanted to meditate, let's meditate, ready?

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.869
Ok, so shut your eyes and sit up straight.

00:47:22.869 --> 00:47:24.230
Uncross your legs.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.350
Put your palms facing upward.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:34.570
And just take a deep breath in your nose and
breathe out your mouth.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.630
And just identify any area in your body where
you might be holding on to any discomfort

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:44.160
or anxiety and gently breathe into that space.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.890
Allow yourself to be present with whatever
is coming up for you.

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:52.400
And on the exhale, release.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.980
Continue this cycle of breath, of breathing
deeply in to that space in your body where

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.560
you might be holding on to any discomfort,
expand your feelings.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.080
Allow yourself to be present with that emotion
and on the exhale have a beautiful sigh of

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.080
relief.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.080
Just let it go.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:15.690
Take a deeper breath in, just expanding, feeling
and allowing yourself to be present in that

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:16.849
experience.

00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:21.000
And on the exhale, release it even deeper.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.690
Take another deep, deep, deep breath in, just
honor, allow, accept whatever you are experiencing

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:38.020
in this moment and take one last deep breath
and then release and when you're ready, open

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:43.660
your eyes to the room.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.960
You feel a little bit better anybody?

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.109
A little lighter?

00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:48.560
Yeah, I'm getting yeses, yes.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.010
That was 60 seconds.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.010
Right?

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.020
Sixty seconds.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.369
I just tuned a lot of you up, right?

00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:58.070
You guided yourself.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:02.590
And so that power of just feeling your feelings,
just being present with whatever is coming

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:03.590
through you.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:08.400
Just allowing yourself to open up that way
of being, to open up your heart and just be

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.580
present with whatever you're feeling.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.060
A really, a really important message of being
a spirit junkie is that, is not that we have

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.290
to be happy all the time.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:23.560
Part of being really happy is being ok with
our unhappiness, being ok with our difficult

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.200
feelings, being accepting and comfortable
being uncomfortable sometimes.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.210
And that's part of being a happy person is
just allowing your emotions to be this beautiful

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:38.520
rainbow of emotions, allow them to come in,
allow them to shift and constantly work to

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.320
recalibrate back to that place of happiness.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.050
And this is a practice that takes time and
it takes commitment.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:48.530
And so I hope for you all, I hope for you
all to just really awaken.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.280
Yes, one more question, good.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.980
&gt;&gt;male #2: I realize [inaudible] ask a writer
this question,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.980
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Cool.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.930
&gt;&gt;male #2: but in your, you know, journey
here as far as what part do you find actually

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.900
write pen to paper plays and is it mandatory
you know for meditation and [inaudible]

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.900
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Yep.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:12.190
&gt;&gt;male #2: being present but will we find
it's required work to put pen to paper?

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.980
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Yeah, yeah, so great
question.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.950
So is it required to put pen to paper as having
a spiritual practice?

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:19.950
Yes.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:23.750
So in my first book, Add More -ing to Your
Life, I had three steps in thirty days for

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:24.790
every chapter.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:31.480
So the ing equation is rethinking, moving
and receiving times 30 days equals changing.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.480
Ok?

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.920
So the rethinking was the positive thoughts
and the moving was physical activity, so combining

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.460
those two, followed by meditation.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.640
Every meditation I followed with what I called
an -ing write, an inspired writing exercise,

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.130
it's just free writing.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.230
Just stream of conscious writing.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:50.340
One of the most powerful tools you can do
when you begin to awaken this presence of

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.790
your inner guidance system is to just stream
of conscious writing exercises.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:55.240
Just get a notebook.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.670
A clean beautiful notebook, and allow your
pen to flow.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.150
Allow that inspired voice to come forward.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:07.200
Sometimes you hear it, but the best way to
connect often can be to just write it out.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.610
So yes, if you do start your meditation practice,
I would strongly suggest that you have a notebook

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:15.460
by your side and when you come out of that
meditation, just give yourself five to ten

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.859
minutes of stream of conscious writing exercises
and so much will come forward.

00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:24.530
Thoughts that you may not have ever let come
through.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.070
Don't just jump out of your meditation and
pick up your Android, ok?

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:32.200
Come out of your meditation and write for
ten minutes and just let it marinate and let

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.420
that inspired movement come through you naturally
and put it on the page and know that that

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.470
is beautiful direction.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.310
So that's a great, great point.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.640
Thank you for bringing that up.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.640
Yeah?

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.420
Cool, yes.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:53.090
&gt;&gt;male #3: Earlier you mentioned about using
meditation to recondition your thought.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.090
Can you give an example for that?

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.090
How to do it?

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.090
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: Sure, sure.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.090
So how do we use meditation to recondition
our thoughts?

00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:02.280
So what happens when we meditate is that we,
we tune in to that creative part of our brain,

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.870
we tune in to that and a more relaxed state
occurs, right?

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:13.300
So interestingly enough what happens is is
that we start to raise that feeling vibration,

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:18.410
but even if that negative thought continues
to come in, the best thing to do when you

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:22.410
sit with that thought is to not try to push
it away.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:24.750
Just allow it to be present in your meditation.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.780
Allow it to come in.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.460
Allow it to leave.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.780
Allow it to come back.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.500
Allow it to leave.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.230
We start to get into this place of like trying
to push the negative thought away and change

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.800
the thought proactively, we create more negativity
around it.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.950
It's kind of like, you know, fighting with
a barking dog.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:43.740
It's like you gotta just let the dog freak
out, right?

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.140
So the, the, the process of sitting in stillness,
that chatter of voice in your mind will show

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.140
up.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.640
It will be so loud, it will be so present,
it will be, it will want to come in.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.619
You'll feel a little good then it'll come
really, really loud.

00:52:55.619 --> 00:53:00.000
And so the main thing I suggest for you is
just to let it be with you.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.580
Just let that voice be part of the experience.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.660
The same way you might be listening to the
sounds in the room, you can listen to the

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:09.340
sound of that negative voice and just allowing
it to be with you the same way you allow that

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.890
uncomfortable feeling to be with you allows
it to come in and allows it to go.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:19.070
But when you try to push against it, it's
like pushing against the stream.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.619
You can't, you'll get bulldozed over, ok?

00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:22.310
So just allow it to be with you.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:26.000
And what you'll start to recognize is when
you start to deepen that connection and that

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.300
communication to your loving voice, you will
have less faith in that fearful voice.

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.359
And that is how the transformation occurs.

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:35.600
So you'll have less faith in that voice.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.310
Now in my guided meditation albums, I also
guide you to new perceptions.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:45.330
So I'll say, ok, imagine yourself in a loving
place.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:49.070
I'll take you on a journey through your mind
so that you have that guidance.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:52.590
And that's a lovely way too, because sometimes
your inner guide is not strong enough yet

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:58.410
to lead the way, so you can have a loving
guide lead you down a beautiful path and help

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.930
you create this inspired vision that will
help you transform those thoughts.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:02.930
Yes.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.410
Any other questions?

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.150
[pause] Ok.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:10.540
So I'm gonna hang out at Google.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.200
I'm gonna stick around.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.160
If anyone has questions for me, feel free
to come up and we can chat.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.790
And if anybody buys a book, I'm happy to sign
it for you.

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:20.160
Alex, anything else?

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160
Do you wanna ask anything?

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160
You good?

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160
&gt;&gt;Alex: Ok.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.020
&gt;&gt;Gabrielle Bernstein: It was a real pleasure
to be with you guys, thank you so very much.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.170
Thanks for showing up for yourselves today.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:32.760
Thanks for showing up for your spirit junkie
mentality and I hope you all take even, if

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.490
you take one thing I mentioned today.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:43.140
If you take one exercise, one message, I can
guarantee miraculous shifts.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:48.190
If you apply one shift, one thought, expect
miracles.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.190
Thank you very much.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.191
[applause]
