00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.100
They are extremely sweet, of course, and, on a good day, very rewarding.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.840
But let's be clear about some other things that our child-centered societies never dare to mention, but should,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.880
because the silence stops us from understanding what the business of having children is really all about.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.560
There's not very much honest intergenerational transfer of information here...

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.260
for the same reason there isn't around the great, dark truths of love.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.040
We're simply too ashamed of our own difficulties.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.160
We shouldn't be.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.700
The job of culture is to reveal what friends never tell you,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.040
that everyone, privately, ends up thinking.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.780
So here... a sum of the big secrets.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.860
Having children destroys your relationship as a romantic, sexual concern.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.340
People say you get closer over the kids, but this isn't the emotional, let alone, sexual intimacy we'd want.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.680
It's more like the team spirit you'd get between colleagues in a busy kindergarten.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.340
It's almost a biological law: kids will kill the relationship that produced them.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.540
We've bought into the idea that all the problems people might have from their childhoods

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.840
come down to the fact that their parents were mean or neglectful.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.980
Be nice to your kids - psychologists tell us - and all will be well.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.080
But that's turned out to be pretty misleading.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.260
As a parent, you will allways have to put an end to a lot of the fun.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.080
It starts with computers and gets worse from there,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.960
for the sake of protecting your kids, and you will be hated profoundly as a result.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.220
Indeed, the more you love them, the more you can act in their long-term interests and the more hated you'll be at points.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.560
Unlike all those fun loving parents, whose lack of care buys them short-term votes.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.740
The more you love your child and make them feel safe, the more they'll use you as a punchbag when things go wrong in their lives.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.680
All those assurances - I'll always be on your side - will pay off beautifully.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320
They will encourage your child to direct their every frustration and disappointment

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.320
onto the loving adult who signaled that they can, and will, take it.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.280
The dream is that you'll be able to pass some insights to your children,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.000
- let's say around money, or career, or love -

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.660
insights that you accumulated through painful experience, and thereby you'll save them time.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.180
But sadly the human race is very commited to reexploring every dumb error in every new generation.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.560
You can't spare people time.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.360
Modern parents want to make things so nice for their kids.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.220
But we know from our own experience that we have a key moments grown-up

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000
only through things that have a painful side to them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.500
We desperately want our children to grow mature, but without going through awful things.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.940
They can't.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.180
Kids will need to separate themselves from you; it's a biological imperative.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.920
You can't live at home forever.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.520
But unfortunately, that urge for separation has a habit of expressing itself very meanly

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.960
in the period we call 'adolescence'.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.980
It means finding parents repeatedly ridicolous and silly and trashing your life's goals and values.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.840
Despite all the hard work your kids will end up mediocre.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.140
You might have thought that all the early lessons and care and love...

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.840
will turn them into a version of Mozart or Tolstoj. It won't.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.400
They'll be very average people who'll have demanded way, way, above average levels of commitment from you to get them to adulthood.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.540
Many people who learn they can't have children are deeply unhappy.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.460
Dont' worry.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.040
Have children and you will, at times, definitely regret it.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.800
Don't have children and you will, at times, also definitely regret it

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.180
Both sides are just interestingly, and differently, miserable.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.240
But neither side has very much to envy from the other.
