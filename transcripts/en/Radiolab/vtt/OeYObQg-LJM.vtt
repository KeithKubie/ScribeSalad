1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay, this is Andy Row. So what I've got here,

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.740
you get rack links, it's falling apart.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.190
He's a TV producer in London and in his office where we reached him,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.680
he's got these very special metal balls.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.750
This is the original prototype of the golden ball is lovely and shiny.

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.584
It's very light.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
Each one's the size of maybe an orange or a tangerine or a tennis ball,

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.040
painted gold and it makes it very satisfying.

9
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.000
Clunk when it closes and that clung,

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.080
that is the sound of betrayal

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.990
because Andy has used these balls to bring out the worst in people to show how

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.000
ugly and conniving we can be,

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
but also how wonderful and if you think you know about all that,

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.230
then you could win big on golden balls.

15
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.570
Okay, so we're talking about a game show called of course golden bulls.

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
Andy was one of the executive producers did pretty well. We were really,

17
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.870
really proud of golden balls. Ran for three years in the UK,

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.890
maybe 300 episodes in quite short space. The title of the show, yes.

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.760
It was such fun.

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.590
And it is fun because in many ways it is just a normal game shot.

21
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:14.140
But I would argue there is more going on here. In fact,

22
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:18.340
I'm about to argue that because there is a moment in one of those 300 episodes,

23
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:21.220
one moment did I just cannot shake.

24
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.250
Cause you remember the first time I showed you this, this clip, I was totally,

25
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.430
totally, totally thrown by it because what's about to happen?

26
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:35.431
Is it two guys with totally different moral philosophies are about to go yes

27
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.540
with some fascinating results in this story. In fact inspired the whole show.

28
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.930
It did look today, three different smack downs,

29
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.180
all that somehow smack down.

30
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.750
Not In the way that you would expect different people, different dreams,

31
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:51.820
different worldviews, all going,

32
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.900
we're calling the show what's left when you're right,

33
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.580
which is genius. You'll find that out later.

34
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.630
It will ultimately make sense. Perfect sense, I think. Yeah. Later for now.

35
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.350
Can we get the golden balls happening? Yeah. Um,

36
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.390
all I can remember was that, um, all right.

37
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:20.630
So before we get to the moment that I want to talk about,

38
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:24.080
we kind of have to walk a few paces to sort of lay the foundation,

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.490
which is that we have to explain the rules of this game, which are uh,

40
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.220
you can all describe golden balls in a sentence to anybody.

41
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790
It makes no sense whatsoever. But I will try and simplify.

42
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.930
So basically there are all these early rounds where people are mining money,

43
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.980
losing money, cheating each other, lying, uh, strategizing,

44
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.180
voting one another off the show.

45
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:48.080
I'm going to skip all that because it is in the last five minutes that all hell

46
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:48.914
breaks loose.

47
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.290
It's that classic shout at the Tele Moment where you're sitting at home going,

48
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.770
[inaudible] can't believe you just did that because basically the whole game

49
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.160
culminates with a face off, you know, face a very straightforward choice.

50
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.730
Two players sit on opposite sides of a table with this host. Between them. Yeah.

51
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
Jasper, Charisse,

52
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.710
his name man whose head is as shiny and smooth as a golden ball itself.

53
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.410
I know I just edited in someone laughing at my own joke that just happened.

54
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.101
In any case,

55
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.400
when you get to this moment at the end of the game where there's two people

56
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.060
facing each other in the spotlight, it's all gone quiet. Okay?

57
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.590
In that moment,

58
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.070
their hearts are racing because they've got to make this key choice,

59
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:37.070
which is not just about money, although there is money on the line. Of course,

60
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.140
it is a choice that will reveal who they really are,

61
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.400
not who we all are. Okay. What humanity. So we'll be laid bare.

62
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.370
This may be true, but why don't we just just lay out the rules themselves?

63
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.240
Sorry, got a little carried away. No, no. All right. So in the final round,

64
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.380
each of the contestants get two golden balls and they are the most important

65
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.780
golden balls of the game. One ball says split.

66
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.280
You each have a golden ball with the word split written inside.

67
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.450
The other ball says steal. You're both have a ball with the word steal.

68
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.450
Written inside split. Like say you and I are playing, right? Yup.

69
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.080
If I choose to split ball, what I'm really saying is that this Jackpot,

70
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:22.340
whatever it is, say it's 3,200 pounds. Sterling. Okay. Yeah.

71
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.850
I'm saying I want to split it with you. Let's just split it in half,

72
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:28.250
50 50 even Steven, I'm a good guy.

73
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.110
Now if you also choose split, then we split it.

74
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.070
You get half, I get half. Everybody's happy.

75
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:45.071
The feeling of kind of joy that everybody had when it was a split was fantastic.

76
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.180
You know, both going home with 1,600 pounds.

77
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.360
Okay, so that's one outcomes. One of four outcomes I believe.

78
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.840
Cause obviously there are other ways this could go cause one or both of the

79
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:03.070
contestants can choose steel. And what steel basically says is,

80
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.280
forget sharing. I want to take the whole thing for myself.

81
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.120
And if we both decide that if you both choose the steal ball,

82
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.190
we both screw each other and it cancels out.

83
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240
You leave today's game with what you came with.

84
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.740
Nothing. Nobody gets anything. That's the thing. I like what he says. Nothing.

85
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.070
Nothing with a little bit of contempt, deservedly. Yes.

86
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.310
Two greedy people deserve nothing here. Nothing except each other.

87
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.810
Exactly nothing. Right? So if we both decide to split, it is mutually good.

88
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.840
If we both decide to steal it is mutually bad. Yeah.

89
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.320
No where things get thorny is it, say you got a mismatch,

90
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.990
like one person chooses split, the other person chooses steal.

91
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.380
Now in that scenario, the person who chose Split,

92
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.070
the nice guy or gal gets nothing.

93
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.640
Whereas the person who chose steal the conniving duplicitous bastard everything.

94
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.510
So you you if you steal and the other person is kind,

95
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.410
then you walk away with the money. Yeah. I mean by the way,

96
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:08.990
this is the classic prisoner's dilemma from Game Theory,

97
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.280
which some people may recognize,

98
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.060
but the basic idea is that there is an incentive to share. Cause if you split,

99
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.560
you split, each person takes half.

100
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.780
But there is also an incentive to lie because if I can convince you to share the

101
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.800
money and I turn around and shaft you, well then I get more money that way.

102
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.630
And the best part about this game for our purposes is that before the

103
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.280
contestants make a choice,

104
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.300
jasper the host gets them to talk to each other about what they're going to do.

105
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.520
<v 2>Okay. Before I asked you to choose.</v>

106
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.970
I think you have some talking to do to each other. Alright, so watch this one.

107
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.740
You got a young blonde girl facing off with uh,

108
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.990
a larger gentleman with a mustache older. Yep. Yeah.

109
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.610
And the Jackpot is a hundred thousand pounds. Stephen.

110
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.460
I just taught my word puppy dog tears and they were real fears.

111
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.490
And you are genuinely going to split that. I, I'm going to split this

112
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.110
50,000. Um, I'm just on. It's unbelievable. 50,000.

113
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.620
She's crying at this point. She's kind of adorable. I like her.

114
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.730
She's like an innocent.

115
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.000
If I stole off you every single pestle that would run over and Lynch me,

116
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.840
there was no way I could. I mean, everyone who knew me would just be disgusted.

117
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.260
If I stop. See how he's gripping his legs, he's up to something.

118
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.950
[inaudible] I can look you straight in the eye and tell you I am going split.

119
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.120
I swear, don't you? I'm going to split. Okay.

120
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.460
This is serious money, Sarah. Steve,

121
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.730
choose either the split or the steal ball. Now

122
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.520
hold it up. We'll go on with 50 grand each. I promise you that

123
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.710
moment it's your

124
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.320
[inaudible]

125
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.050
<v 0>chose split. She chose steal the, the nice girl was a thief,</v>

126
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.050
a nice girl with bad. Every time I see this,

127
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.840
it totally breaks my heart cause a guy just falls under the desk.

128
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.730
<v 2>He's got his head in his hands. He's just destroyed. David, I'm so sorry.</v>

129
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.760
Commiserations

130
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.110
<v 0>look, look at her. She's looking away. She can't look at him.</v>

131
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.250
He's falling into a slump on the table. It's just awful. It's evil, isn't it?

132
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.640
It's such a good little game. And here's the thing.

133
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.030
If you analyze all the outcomes, which social scientists have done,

134
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.250
what you see is that a majority of the time,

135
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.660
something like what I just showed you happens competition.

136
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.500
People get up there and they're like,

137
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.890
I swear I will never say I am a good person.

138
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.910
Over and over they say, I am not the kind of person that's gonna Cheat you.

139
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.740
And then they do it.

140
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.190
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

141
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.640
<v 0>stab him in the back and he's her grandma's policemen. And here's my theory.</v>

142
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.500
It's not that they're mean people,

143
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:55.501
it's that they don't want to be that guy slumped on the table.

144
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.210
They don't want to be the sucker.

145
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.240
The fear of being the sucker far overwhelms the desire to do good to their

146
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:05.580
fellow contestants. There's something wrong with this program.

147
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.450
The obvious thing to do is to share.

148
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.480
You managed to wheedle your way into the approximate possession of a fortune and

149
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.530
all you have to do is agree to split it.

150
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.840
But what if you don't trust the person across the table from you?

151
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.080
Would you still share it? That's, that's interesting. Yeah.

152
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:23.370
Let's suppose I happened to be,

153
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:28.371
I'm introduced to a person named snidely whiplash and he has an enormous oiled

154
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:34.200
mustache and he's wearing a cape and he has this habit of rubbing his hands

155
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.110
malevolently and his eyes are twitching and his eyes are twitching.

156
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.770
So I'm sitting out here and I'm waiting to share with this guy. See,

157
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:45.150
it's in a situation like that. That's when it's a real test that's in this game.

158
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.540
So what do you do if you don't want to be a sucker and you're not sure you can

159
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:49.800
trust the person across the table.

160
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.880
There's no good answer to that.

161
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.930
<v 3>But then hi. Hi. Is this nick? It is. This brings us to the moment of question.</v>

162
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.830
We ran into this guy, my name's Nick Corrigan. I work for Media Academy,

163
00:10:05.831 --> 00:10:07.540
Cardiff based in Wales.

164
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.490
<v 0>So, uh, nick runs a not for profit in Wales and um,</v>

165
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.490
right away when you talk to him, you notice two things. He loves whales.

166
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.020
<v 3>It's the most beautiful country in the world. And He loves game shows. Yes.</v>

167
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.270
What was your first one? When I was about 17,

168
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.310
he was on a quiz show and I won a book.

169
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.990
<v 0>Nick has since been on by his count, 44 game shows. Whoa.</v>

170
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.880
It's one 43 of them. He says, uh, he's,

171
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.540
when I'm boat two on a house full of stuff, trips to various places.

172
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.170
This is like what he does. And when he first encountered golden balls,

173
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.350
he noticed the same miserable pattern that we all noticed,

174
00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:42.380
which is like the nice people get up there. They say, let's share,

175
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.120
<v 3>let's do it. We can be in this together.</v>

176
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.600
And then every time I'm there we're just shafted.

177
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.780
But then nick got an idea. How did you get that idea?

178
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.300
I think I was probably um,

179
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.493
swimming.

180
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.180
I get all my greatest ideas and assuming it was only when I went back and had a

181
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:02.014
cup of tea,

182
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.880
as everybody in Wales obviously drinks tea with your lump of coal right next to

183
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.780
you, you pack, you're a little pet. Coal.

184
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:13.110
Coal is very important to Wales of when I got back I thought actually it can't

185
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:14.734
fail.

186
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.050
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

187
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.840
<v 0>so nick makes it onto the show, mix it to the last round,</v>

188
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.070
welcome back to golden bowls and he finds himself sitting across the table from

189
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:30.540
a man named Ibrahim who, two of them or a study in contrast.

190
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.230
Nick is tall, he's got really intense eyes, feathered hair.

191
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.830
Ibrahim is short and bald and looks kind of like a mini telly.

192
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.520
Savalas Ibrahima Nick, you now face a very straightforward choice. But yes,

193
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:43.430
for the host lays out the scenario. They are there,

194
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.750
they're competing for 14,000 pounds.

195
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.150
They have to decide to split or steal and now we get to the good part. Now,

196
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:55.300
keep in mind as you listen to this, that almost a hundred percent of the time,

197
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.360
what happens in this moment is one person looks at the other and says,

198
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:02.590
I promise you I will choose the split ball. We'll share it. Share it together.

199
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.760
Yeah. That's what they say. Nick takes a very different approach.

200
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.880
<v 2>Abraham,</v>

201
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.800
I want you to trust me 100% I'm going to pick the steal ball.

202
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.430
Sorry. You're going to, I'm going to choose the steal ball. You're gonna take.

203
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.390
I want you to do split and I promise you that I will split the money with you.

204
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.370
We'll offer you took a steal. Yeah, you can take steel. Yeah,

205
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.790
I'm going to take split. Yeah,

206
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.760
so you take the money and I was supposed to with you after the show. Yeah.

207
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.100
<v 0>There was, there was out to panic in the studio. Kisses whole idea was like,</v>

209
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:38.470
I'm not even going to pretend I'm not going to steal it and then I'll meet you

210
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.320
on a corner after the television show you the half of it.

211
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.620
[inaudible] that's ridiculous. Older researchers started running around going,

212
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.530
what's he doing? Can this be done? There was panic.

213
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.740
<v 2>I promise you I'll do that. If, if you do steal, we both walk away with nothing.</v>

214
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:56.470
I'm telling you 100% I'm going to do it. I appreciate that. Right?

215
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.580
I'll give you another alternative.

216
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.680
Why don't we just both pick split? I'm not gonna pick split.

217
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.380
I'm going to steal Abraham. Honestly, 100 that I'm gonna Steal.

218
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.780
It's in your nature to steal. No, are you?

219
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.440
I'm honest and I'm gonna tell you I am. That's one thing I'm going to steal.

220
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.640
If you do split, then I will split the money. Can't see myself today, man. Okay,

221
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.440
well I'm going to steal so we're going to leave with nothing.

222
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.600
Where's your brains coming from

223
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.200
<v 1>thought work at?</v>

224
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.320
<v 2>I know that I'm a decent guy and I will spend the money with you. Well,</v>

225
00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:30.630
we should just buy them. No, I'm going to do steal

226
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.730
<v 0>this argument went on and on. [inaudible] Riley, he actual argument,</v>

227
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:40.200
not the edited version. Online went for 45 minutes. There was a name calling.

228
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:43.710
There were threats and over those 45 minutes there was an interesting shift.

229
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.050
Nick says that the audience began to turn on him.

230
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.940
The audience behind were booing me, which I get because as I was watching it,

231
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:53.670
I mean initially it seems like a really cool, clever strategy,

232
00:13:53.671 --> 00:13:57.990
but then you realize as it goes down that he's being kind of at the ass.

233
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.090
Like he's not giving the other guy a choice.

234
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:03.630
He's actually kind of bullying him no matter what he said.

235
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.100
I was not budging for the fact and it may intransigence just if you're rage at

236
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:08.934
him.

237
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.590
<v 4>Did you ever actually like hate him or actually yes, I did hate him.</v>

238
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.290
Yes. Oh yes. Yes I did.

239
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.260
This is Ebrahim April Him who signed? I'm a market trader.

240
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.090
I'll work on flea markets. He sells textiles in London.

241
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.890
It took us forever to track him down. Months. You found me at last,

242
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.040
but at the hight hemophilia because he couldn't be, he couldn't,

243
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:38.670
you couldn't negotiate with him. There was no negotiation.

244
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.080
I was saying to him like if I give you my word that I'm going to split,

245
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.310
<v 2>if I gave you my word, now let me, let me tell you what my word means. Okay.</v>

246
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.110
My father once said to me, a man who doesn't keep his word, he's not a man.

247
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.040
He's not worth nothing. Not Worth it. Not worth a dollar. I agree,

248
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.640
Abraham, I'm going to steal it so you've got the choice.

249
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.490
<v 0>That was the point where I was like, nick, give the guy a chance at least. Okay,</v>

250
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.690
<v 2>well we lost the lost.</v>

251
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.270
Then they walked away with no money because you're an idiot. No

252
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.443
<v 1>need it.</v>

253
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.200
<v 2>Wait, wait.</v>

254
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.110
This can go on all night and these people have got to get up for breakfast.

255
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.430
Nick choose split or steal

256
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.910
<v 0>and right before they have to make their decision, it seems that Ibrahim Caves,</v>

257
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.580
maybe nick warmed down and he's like, fine,

258
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.750
you choose steal to split. Hopefully you'll share the money.

259
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.540
<v 2>Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to cover with you. Okay, I'm done.</v>

260
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.573
I promise you,

261
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.510
you cannot change your balls. Now

262
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.530
split or steal.

263
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.930
<v 0>They both turn over their balls. Ibrahim, as we suspected, chose split. Oh,</v>

264
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.500
I felt I had no alternative. And Nick also chose Split.

265
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.050
<v 1>Yeah. Congratulations. You're both split an ACC</v>

266
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.430
[inaudible]

267
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.030
<v 0>the whole game. He swore he was gonna Steal. But then he ends up splitting.</v>

268
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:26.210
Do you think that he was lying the whole time and always intended to share?

269
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.010
We could've changed his mind at the last, second, whatever the case.

270
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.620
Here's why his strategy was so brilliant. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh,

271
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.670
taken aback when we asked Ebrahimi like if nick hadn't been deployed that crazy

272
00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:41.340
strategy, would you have still split?

273
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.420
Because that's what you were saying to him the whole time that you're gonna

274
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.320
split it. You're gonna share the money. Would you have still done it?

275
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.260
<v 4>No, not at all. Not at all. Oh, I was always going to steal.</v>

276
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.820
I was never gonna Split. Never really? Never really.

277
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.540
I was never gonna Split. Why? Why, why?

278
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:03.890
The reason being if I split and the other guy stills, okay, nothing.

279
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.830
[inaudible] both of us walk away with nothing than someone. Um, what's the word?

280
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800
Embarrass me to a certain extent. Didn't want to be the sucker.

281
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.120
<v 0>And then I asked him like, what about that speech with your dad? You know,</v>

282
00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:17.260
that's the one that Kinda got me.

283
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.260
<v 2>My father once said to me, a man who doesn't keep his work, he's not mine.</v>

284
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.620
<v 4>It cannot. No. Can I just jump in the bat that yeah.</v>

285
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:31.330
[inaudible] I never met him. I, I,

286
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.820
my mother brought me up.

287
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.080
Me and my brother and my sister and I'll never ever met my father

288
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.050
<v 0>that you made that up. Yeah,</v>

289
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.490
I'm afraid so you made that up?

290
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.100
<v 4>Yeah. Yeah. I'll feel sorry you on a film once</v>

291
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.790
and it always stuck with me. I'll be able to use that one day.

292
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.770
I've never been a good boy.

293
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.420
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

294
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.980
<v 4>I think that is the real victory here.</v>

295
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.880
Like nick got a guy who's never intending to share the money,

296
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.170
whose whole philosophy was like, don't trust anybody. Don't cross no one.

297
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.430
He got that guy to be good against his will and that guy,

298
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.830
thanks him for it. He did call me to certain extent,

299
00:18:20.831 --> 00:18:23.640
but he calmed me into 7,000 pounds

300
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.910
and nick for his part is also grateful to have the money so he can give it to

301
00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:33.040
charity, run a children's charity.

302
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.230
I do all the health and safety and all the fundraising.

303
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.820
Is that connected in any way to your multiple appearances on game shows? Yes,

304
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.450
it is. Yes. Directly. Yes.

305
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.690
It's silly surprise. I do cause it's a very [inaudible].

306
00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:50.980
Nick is doing his good works. We will take a brief break and be right back.

307
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.890
