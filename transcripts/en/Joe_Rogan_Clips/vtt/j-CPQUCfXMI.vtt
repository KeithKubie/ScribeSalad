1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Did you get ups?
I mean when,
when you went over and got into a fight with Leon,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.270
you were being interviewed,

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
he was yelling some shit at you while you're being interviewed and you walked

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.200
over.
And one of the,

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.030
one of the things that I like what you said is that you walked over your hands

6
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:16.920
behind your back.
You're like,
look what talk,

7
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.240
say what the fuck you want to say to me.

8
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.610
But then when he was standing in front of you,
like you wanted to punch you,

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.410
you're like,
okay,
well you know for stuff.

10
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:27.560
Was he saying to you were initially,
um,

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.810
I was doing my interview and he's crossing by and he's with his corner man.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
And I dunno if this guy consumes a lot of drugs or what,

13
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.620
that he thought that that would intimidating muse.

14
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320
He was walking like this looking at me and like pacing back and forth and I'm

15
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
trying to do my interview,
you know,
and he asked me something about something,

16
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.560
a date and I say maybe,
maybe not.
And then he tells me to shut up,

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.390
you know.
Well,
everybody watching this back home from Miami was like,

18
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.580
you should've punched him as soon as he asked you a question while you're

19
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.710
interviewing,
because that's my natural inks thing.
You know,

20
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.720
if you're getting interviewed and some fucking idiot comes here and cut your any

21
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.390
rear off,
well you should get punched or slapped upside your head.
You know,

22
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.790
that'll teach you respect none to do it then nobody else again,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.940
I should immediately done it,
but I didn't.
I answered this question,

24
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.900
but lightning,
maybe,
maybe not.
He goes on to say,
shut up after that.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.050
I can't take that.
My daughter might be watching this interview.

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.530
I've been telling her,
stand up to bullies your whole life.

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.170
Don't go running to somebody and tell them,
oh,
so and so's picking on me.

28
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.060
Handle it yourself.
That's what's wrong with this country.

29
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.760
I think with this whole,
somebody picks on you.
Go tell somebody else.

30
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.640
I'm not going to tell authorities this hooligans picking on me.

31
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.220
I'm going to handle it myself,
you know,
cause I'm going to see him again.

32
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.280
He's going to think he could pick on me.
I've got to handle it myself.
You know,

33
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.750
I'm in my interview,
man.
You're gonna steal my moment.
I just worked out here.

34
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.900
Just kicked some butt out here.

35
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.110
You barely want to split decision in your own country.

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.620
I knocked this dude out and you're trying to steal my shine like this.

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.710
That's what I'm saying.
Like,
and then he got famous off that which I hate.

38
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.410
So only thing I could take back about that night,

39
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.890
that it wasn't filmed that and filmed it,
it'd be even better.
You know,

40
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.680
he was just gone off in silence.
You know,
neon got his ass.

41
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.220
That helped you to know did it help me out?
But it helped him more than anything.

42
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.600
Yeah.
No,
it helps.
Yes.
People know who the school knows.

43
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
Mossville doesn't take any shit that people known that since before rainbows had

44
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.430
color.
They already knew that man.
They didn't,

45
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.300
they didn't need to see you whooping 10 I know that.
They like to see it.

46
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.130
They'd like to get remembered,
Huh?
Yeah.

47
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.390
They like to see people have consequences for shit.

48
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.990
Talking in this weird era of constant shit talking,
you know,

49
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.130
I think people enjoy it.
They like it.
And if you guys ever fight,

50
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.040
it makes it a bigger fight for sure.
I guess,
let me guess,

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.430
but does that like I beat number three,

52
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.160
I've been in this sport for a while and beating up guys,

53
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.940
would that validate them to fight when he has some beat in the top 10 guy yet

54
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.360
still yet to be the top 10 guy you know like,

55
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.810
but he could get that fight off that.
That's the new age and era that we're in.

56
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.200
I know,
right?
That's a concern.
That's a concern.

57
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.190
I'll fight when when his,
when he's beating in the top Tim got,

58
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.910
I'm going to be the first guy to expose him to break his face.

59
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.770
But until that moment comes you're,

60
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.260
you're talking about the business side cause you already saw on the personal

61
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.040
side any day of the week I will address you but on the business side,

62
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.720
get to my level buddy,
put in the fucking world.
Go beat a top 10 guy,

63
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.370
knock him the fuck out.

64
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.430
Did you talk at all about getting in trouble for punching somebody in another

65
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.030
country?
I was scared out of my fucking life.
That's what I'm thinking.

66
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.700
I was scared.
I thought this guy was going to kill me,
man.

67
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.750
I might've not looked at,
but I was scared out of my life.
Yeah,
I get it.

68
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.620
I'm very cold blooded.
You know I get that from,
from genetics,

69
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.940
from my pops in them.
But I was scared at that moment.

70
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.720
I thought this guy was going to take everything I had,
you know,
had to do that.

71
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.700
I had to defend my Saturday.
I understand,

72
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.720
but did you worry at all about them arresting you or any weird shit like that

73
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.140
over there?
I mean,
you're in another corner to press charges.
Ah,
I,

74
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.080
that's how scared I was.
But I'm not going to press charges because I understand.

75
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.440
I'm a man.
But that's how I felt.
I've seen you were in danger.

76
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.900
I was fucking hell of in danger.
Do not see.
It was not just one say it.

77
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:07.810
And he that him and his crew of hooligans,
hooligans,

78
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.090
lawless people.
I had to defend myself.

79
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.870
I did everything in my right to defend myself.

80
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.840
It was one against like three or four dudes and they know it.
Yeah.

81
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.930
It's something video that,
okay,
I understand.
I understand.
And so the,

82
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.900
with the police say to that,
oh,
they ain't telling me nothing man.

83
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.170
They didn't tell you shit.
I didn't speak to know polices.
That's amazing.
No,

84
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.040
no police for me not talkative anyway.

85
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.570
I've been the Spanglish immediately.

86
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.590
We go on mute and I enough to get English gay,

87
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.750
pick English.
I mean,
how many times he fought in England before the war.

88
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.090
First Time.
So like if you go the rest of your career,
you can't go to England.
Oh,

89
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:48.190
well no,
that was,
I really liked England.
Did you?

90
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.760
Fans are so knowledgeable and they were just cool.
Even the ones who were like,

91
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.730
till fans would say like a funny joke to me or something cool.

92
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.630
But it wasn't like that weird bad energy,
you know,
even if there were till fans,

93
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.180
but just get out,
my boy tils are going to get you,
you know,

94
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:03.920
but it'd be like funny and how they say cheeky,
you know,
was,

95
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:06.700
it was a great experience.
Everywhere I went.
The people were super,

96
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.620
super duper cool.
Yeah.
Um,
Brazil's rough.
If someone's fighting a Brazilian,

97
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:13.010
yeah,
they,
they don't.

98
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.360
I've heard the story that I've yet to find a solution for nationalists that can

99
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:17.710
proud,
very proud.

100
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.040
So they're not into people coming over there and fight Brazilians.

101
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.500
They're not going to be friendly to you,
but ain't guns different about,

102
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.310
they're very polite.
