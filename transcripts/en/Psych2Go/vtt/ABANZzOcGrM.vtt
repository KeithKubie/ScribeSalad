Six reasons why Smart people can't find happiness

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.489
Happiness and intelligent people is the rarest thing I know ernest, Hemmingway

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.869
Happiness is the feeling of contentment and satisfaction that is craved by many, but only achieved by some

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
Happiness is relative and subjective

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.890
But for many successful individuals the presence of a great family life in a flourishing career is often not enough

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.229
On some occasions [seeds] do not prevent a smart individual from feeling a sense of loneliness

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.049
often sadness and Melancholy

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.259
Here are strict psychological reasons. Why smart [people] have a harder time finding happiness?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.010
intelligent people overanalyze

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.459
many individuals with high levels of intelligence

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.260
Often overthink and analyze everything that occurs in their life and surroundings

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.459
While their ability to analyze things is a great asset the constant analysis of everything can often lead [to] frustration

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.000
especially when coming up with an undesired conclusion

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.519
Being able to see through people's intentions is a burden that most people don't get to carry

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.319
Oftentimes knowing how ugly the real world is [like] is disappointing and frustrating

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.509
Not to mention the timeless dilemmas [of] global and philosophical issues that seem to have no solution is a constant mental [plague] in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.259
This case the same ignorant bliss is true

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.999
two intelligent people have high standards

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.879
Smart individuals often hold everything with high standards [the] failure to reach these standards often leads to frustration and disappointment

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.000
Regardless, if it is their career relationships or anything else that they hold [importance] in their life?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.839
The idealistic view of the world and poor practical intelligence of people with Brilliant theoretical minds

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.109
Often have trouble coping with the raw reality of life

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.309
When faced with issues that contradict their expectations this inevitably leads to feelings of great disappointment

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.949
Three intelligent people are extremely self-critical

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.229
unhappiness for highly intelligent people also stems from the deep thinking nature

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.479
Not limited to their success and failures these individuals rigorously

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.759
Analyze and compare themselves to higher standards that they unintentionally seek reasons to blame themselves

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.990
intelligent people often experience flashbacks of events that [happen] months sometimes years ago of

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.009
Situations which they believe they behaved poorly or inappropriately

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.040
Negative emotions such as guilt and discontent fills their minds and disturbs their mood

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.100
Dowsing out any form of happiness of the person

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.170
For intelligent people are overly ambitious

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.570
People with high intelligence cannot be satisfied with what they already have

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.269
Their complex mind gives them the ability [to] see something bigger and better [a] purpose

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.050
these people fail to enjoy mundane things in everyday life because their minds crave something stimulating and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.649
Fantastically idealistic that cannot be found in the real world

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.380
this is often manifested by inability to accept the time and space they belong to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.830
Do you feel that they are living in the wrong place at the wrong time?

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.859
That everything could be better, but it just isn't

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.019

The comfort of having meaningful conversations with a like-minded person one who shares the same ideas

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.830
Worldviews and Philosophies is priceless

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.600
Most intelligent people hardly ever find someone who can connect with them

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.640
This makes them feel alone and misunderstood that no one is capable of seeing and appreciating the deep brilliance of their minds

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.939
While it is scientifically proven that people with high levels of intelligence [don't] need to socialize as much as average intelligence people to be happy

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.640
The Human need to interact is still there

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.239
people with high intelligence simply prefer to talk
