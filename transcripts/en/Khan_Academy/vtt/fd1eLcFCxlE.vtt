00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:01.502
- [Voiceover] On Wednesday,

00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:06.502
Heather ran three miles in 30 minutes.

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:11.702
If she ran for 45 minutes
at this rate on Thursday,

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.242
how for did Heather run on Thursday?

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:16.402
Well, let's just think
about what that rate is.

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:20.446
So, the rate is going to
be equal to the distance,

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:24.362
the distance she traveled per time,

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.580
and this is going to
be equal to, let's see,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.822
she traveled three miles,

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:33.822
she traveled three miles in
30 minutes, in 30 minutes.

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:39.978
You could simplify, three
over 30 is the same thing,

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:44.978
this is the same thing
as 1/10, 1/10 of a mile,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:50.482
of a mile per minute, per
minute, that's her rate.

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:51.847
Now that's not what they are asking for,

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:55.502
they're saying, if she went
at this rate for 45 minutes,

00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:57.482
how far would she run?

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:02.482
Well, let's just multiply
them, so 45 minutes times,

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.942
times, 1/10 of a mile per minute.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.182
I can just copy and paste
that right over there,

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:15.182
so times that, copy and paste,
what are we going to get?

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:18.442
Well it's going to be 45 times 1/10,

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:21.522
or it's the same thing
as 45 divided by 10,

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:25.514
that's going to be equal to
four point five, four point five

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:28.161
and then the minutes cancel
out, minutes of the numerator,

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.581
minutes of the denominator,
four point five,

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.247
four point five miles.

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:34.474
Another way to think about it,

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:37.338
and this might even be an
easier way to think about it is,

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:39.438
well she's going to get the
same rate, if you're going

00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:43.078
from 30 minutes on one day,
to 45 minutes on the next day,

00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:47.079
you're increasing, you're
increasing your minutes by 50%.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.353
Thirty, plus half of 30, 30 plus 15 is 45,

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:53.925
so the distance you travel is
going to be increasing by 50%.

00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:58.925
So 50% increase on three,
would get you to, 50% of three

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:01.918
is one point five, you add that to three,

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:04.049
it gets you to four point five.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.783
So, either way you want to tackle it.
