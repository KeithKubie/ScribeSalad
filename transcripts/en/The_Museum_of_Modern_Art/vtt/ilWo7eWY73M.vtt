00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.846
Voiceover: When Richard
Serra first became interested

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:13.041
in bending plates of
steel over 25 years ago

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.570
he felt he'd had little
experience with large scale

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390
curved surfaces.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.075
Richard: I realized that there
wasn't a large vocabulary

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.240
of building with curvilinear forms

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.295
particularly in a city that's
made up of right angles.

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.527
The only curvature building I can think of

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.265
of any node in the city at that time was

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.794
Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum.

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:33.503
I wanted to build something

00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:35.849
that would inform my experience.

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:38.302
If you walk around the curve

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:40.972
you don't know how it's going to round.

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:43.104
It seems continuous and never ending.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:47.691
The concave side, like
a cave, reveals itself

00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.579
in its entirety.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.894
You know what the form is.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.608
Voiceover: You'll see that
difference immediately

00:00:54.608 --> 00:00:58.122
when you reach the opening and
step into Torqued Ellipse IV.

00:00:58.122 --> 00:00:59.338
Richard: As you step inside,

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.750
the piece seems to have a great elasticity

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.087
as it moves around

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:04.727
and it either leans over your head

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:07.859
or leans away from you
depending on where you are.

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.461
You can see that the ellipse on the floor

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.406
is exactly the same as
the ellipse in the sky.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.308
As the piece gets higher

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:19.967
it rotates in relation to itself,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.134
but it's the same all the way up.

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:26.499
Initially, the way this
piece was conceived

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.623
was through a kind of misinterpretation.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:32.613
I happened to be in Rome
and walked into a church

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.953
that was built in the 15th century

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.798
and I looked at the floor
and I looked at the ceiling

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.914
and I thought that the
simple ellipse on the floor

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:46.333
was turned in relationship
to the one overhead.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.245
When I walked to the center of the floor

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.973
I realized that it was
just a regular ellipse

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:54.323
that rose like an elliptical
cylinder straight up.

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:58.437
What interested me was
my misinterpretation.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:01:59.818
Voiceover: Serra became determined

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.951
to create the form he had imagined.

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.175
He went to an arrow space engineer

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:05.487
and asked him if it was possible

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:08.753
to make such a twisted or a torqued form.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.188
Richard: He said he didn't think so.

00:02:12.188 --> 00:02:15.327
The solution to that problem
doesn't occur in nature

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.460
and it doesn't occur in architecture.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.405
It's a formal invention.

00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:22.634
The first model took 3 years to be built

00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:26.808
because we couldn't
find a computer program

00:02:26.808 --> 00:02:28.857
or a steel mill that knew
how to build these things.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:32.305
The first one we tried to
build we broke a 40 foot plate,

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.027
2 inches thick right in half.

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:36.552
It sounded like lightning and
I thought I'd bought the farm.

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:38.654
I turned completely white.

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:42.602
The technology has been
developed to allow one

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:44.779
to bend metal under heavy compression

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.021
and we used very large machines,

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.689
first used to build battleships
in the 2nd World War.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:52.661
People really hadn't really
explored the potential

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.191
for what steel could be in terms of

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.570
it's variabilities and elasticity.

00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:02.829
It's only recently been
explored by a few people.
