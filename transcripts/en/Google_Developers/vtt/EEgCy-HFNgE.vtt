MATTEO VALLONE: For
whoever doesn't know me,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.990
my name is Matteo Vallone.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.245
I see many familiar faces.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.290
I work with European
developers, and today I'm

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.690
going to focus on
engaging users.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200
First to start, can
you raise your hand

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.180
if you think that in
the last six months

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.400
you used every single app
that is on your phone?

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:18.630
All right.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.910
Last month?

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.500
Last week?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.499
All right.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.897
I thought that.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.355
These are very
important questions.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.490
How many apps you
have on your phone

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.660
and how many you
actually use regularly

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.772
is the key question
for engagement.

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:34.230
And as a developer,
what you should

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380
ask yourself is how many
people have installed

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.570
your app versus how many
have actually used it?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.510
Installing an app
doesn't do anything

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.140
if the users actually
don't use it.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.220
And you don't want to be
just a book on a bookshelf,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.150
but you want to be the one
that users actually read.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.420
So engagement is
critical, and regardless

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.500
of how you monetize
your app-- through ads

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.560
or through in-app
purchases-- you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.050
want to focus a lot on this
key step of the user funnel.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.250
We talked about
user acquisition.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.570
We're going to talk about
conversion for developers that

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.080
actually monetize
through in-app payments.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.639
But in any case, engagement
is going to be critical.

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.930
And it's sometimes overlooked
as a step in your product

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.429
development.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.190
You have a big
challenge, which is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.180
that users have many
apps on their phones

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.370
and on their devices
and not that much time

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.610
to use all of them.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.484
And there are not very
clear lists of levers

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.900
that you can pull like you
have for user acquisition where

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.865
you have store discoverability,
cross-promotion, marketing, PR.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.240
On the conversion
side you can do

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.080
discount, promo
codes, free trials.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.760
On the engagement
side when it comes

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.539
to organic and free
solutions, it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.080
all about how you
build your product.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.964
And you optimize it
for the key metrics

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.130
that actually matter to you.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.270
It might be time spent.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.060
It might be articles read.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.170
Whatever matters
to you should drive

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.010
how you build your
product and optimize it.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.130
And if there was
only one key message

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130
that you could take away
from this presentation,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.389
I wish it was this.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.290
You should move being from
the model of just being

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.670
a dumb destination to
being a smart companion.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.475
Installing the app on the device
shouldn't be just bookmarking

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:20.710
it on the home page.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.050
That's a website.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.300
An app is smart.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.110
It's powerful, and it should
be always available to the user

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.887
when it matters.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:28.470
It should be integrated
with a device.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.860
That's installing.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.100
And that means that
you're not building

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.050
just an homogeneous experience
that everyone lands to it,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.030
but you're personalizing it.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.430
And you're aware of what
is the context of the user

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.050
so that you can
anticipate their needs

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.650
and not just reacting to them.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.450
And I'm going to talk
about few things you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.870
can do to make sure you
really optimize your product

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.680
to be a smart companion.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.310
So these are the key focus area
that I'm going to talk about.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.090
They're all very relevant
and work together.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.270
Integration through intents.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.085
If you don't know what intents
are, I'll explain it soon.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.850
But that's a way to integrate
your app in the operating

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.180
system within the
Android open platform.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.790
Capturing identity and
context of your user,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.730
very important to then
personalize and anticipate

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.800
their needs.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.384
And using rich
notifications as a way

00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:28.050
not just to communicate
with your user--

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.060
to reach out to your
users-- but actually

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.690
as an extension of your
UI into the device.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.050
Into other devices as well.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.520
And I'm also going to talk a
little bit of how this empowers

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.410
you to actually build the best
possible cross-platform user

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.470
experience while you
focus on the use case

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.300
and then build a UI for it,
instead of doing the opposite.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.910
And being enabled by having all
these three pieces in place.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.110
So I'll start by
talking about intents.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.984
And first of all, if you
have an Android phone,

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:02.400
you already know
what intents are.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.450
Basically, whenever you click
on a link or on an action,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.610
sometimes you're presented
with a few options

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.830
of apps that can
perform that action.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.130
And that's an intent.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.700
That's basically leveraging the
power of intents on the phone.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.690
And an intent is basically
a combination of an action

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.870
and a piece of data,
like scanning a barcode

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.920
or sharing "I love pizza."

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.310
The powerful thing is
that on Android, your app

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.440
can take care of an intent.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.150
Like if you're building a
scanner app, then scanning

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.300
a barcode is what your app does.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.210
But also you can
outsource tasks that

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.700
are not really relevant to
your app, to other apps.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.484
So you're building, for
example, an e-commerce app.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:47.400
And you don't want to
build a barcode scanner,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.790
but you need a barcode to
be scanned at some points.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.090
And you can call the
operating system at that point

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.930
and say, what is the app
that can do that for me?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.489
And whatever app
is installed and is

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:58.030
declared in the
operating system that

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.390
can perform that task will
be presented to the user.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.370
So that's why we call
intents basically the glue

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.810
between application components.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.214
And it's what makes the Android
operating system so open

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.250
and enables apps to
talk to each other.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.320
But that means
also, that you can

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.870
take ownership of an
action on the device

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.250
across the experience
of the users.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.820
So you can offer your
service to other apps.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.940
In the previous example, if
you're just barcode scanner

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.930
app, you're offering
every other app

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.640
that needs the service
of doing that for them.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.630
In another example, if
the user is on a news app

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.390
and wants to share
an article, if you're

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.057
building a social and
communication app,

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:42.681
you can declare in
the operating system

00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:44.870
that you can handle that
action, the sharing action.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.240
And your app will be
automatically presented

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.780
to the user here.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.450
These are not just Google Apps.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.340
Any app can do it.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.490
Again, that's why Android
is such an open platform.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.964
So another example and another
very powerful one is with URLs.

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:02.380
You can tell the
operating system,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.470
I can handle the intent of
opening that and showing

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.030
that URL.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.950
Here is what Maps does.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.500
No matter if I'm looking for
our office address on Search

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.620
or if Shannon sent me a link.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.960
Whenever I tap on that, I will
be presented with all the apps

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.870
that can perform that task.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.650
And in this case,
Maps can do it for me.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.310
So I can skip the browser.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.210
So even more than that,
if you think about it,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.500
app indexing-- for who doesn't
know what app indexing is,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.810
it's basically a way
to set up your app

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.660
to show the option to the
user within the search result

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.130
to open a link from the
search results within the app.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.275
So it's basically the
organic, non-paid solution

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.850
of what Bruce described.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.370
And that's enabled by intents.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.705
Without intents, without setting
yourself up for this task,

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:03.390
you couldn't be able to leverage
the power of app indexing.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.110
So if you are
interested in this,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.820
you can look for more
details on this website.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.060
OK.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.840
So that's intents,
and that's how

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.550
you intercept user needs
as they present themself.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.610
But you also want to
know more about your user

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.310
so you can anticipate
their needs.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.940
And the set of information
you should think about

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.570
is not only the user
preferences and the user history

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.805
but also what comes from
the device they're using.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.690
Not only the screen
of the device,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.370
which might inform what type of
experience they are looking for

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.400
but also what time
of the day it is.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.620
Where they are.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.190
If they're moving
fast, sitting down.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.230
Whatever is relevant
to inform the way you

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.840
can tailor the best
possible experience.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.240
But in order to
do that, you need

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.790
them to sign in at some point.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.630
And the key thing here
is that on mobile, it

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.075
is even more painful
than on laptops

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:03.950
to sign in because you
don't have a keyboard.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.340
And a mobile device is
supposed to be more immediate.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.390
It's supposed to be about
the content, soon and fast.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.446
So one very important
thing to make sure

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:14.070
that your user actually
sign in and you

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.360
can get all information you need
is to make it easy for them.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.750
And here Guardian
is a great example

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:26.540
of integrating all the important
third-party signing services

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.840
and how this makes it
more easy for users.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.370
And by way, 41% of users sign
in through the Google Sign

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.820
In method, and that's a very
common thing on Android.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.600
We see that a lot,
Google being one,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.730
if not the most,
popular sign in method.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.640
That's because every
Android user is already

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.490
signed in with a Google
account on the device,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.530
on the Play Store.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.850
So they don't need to input
any username, password.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.025
It just works-- seamless.

00:08:57.026 --> 00:08:58.400
That's one thing,
making it easy.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.170
But you shouldn't
take it for granted.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.780
You should probably treat
signing in as a transaction

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.950
and identity as a currency.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.880
Like you pay a lot of attention
in converting users from free

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.400
to paid users, you shouldn't
take signing in for granted.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.110
They're basically
trusting you to use

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.450
their personal information the
right way and protect them.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.810
So you want to make sure that
the onboarding experience is

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.410
the best possible and
that you're leading them

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.000
to the point where they're
comfortable signing in,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.470
and they understand the value.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.470
Again, The Guardian is
a great example of that.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.000
You can browse all the
contents and read articles.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.220
But when you want to start
personalizing the experience

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.260
by liking, bookmarking
or sharing an article,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.700
then you need to sign in.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.180
And then you
understand that that's

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.890
the step you have
to take to do that.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.460
And in that context,
they also tell

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.449
you more about why and the
full value of signing in.

00:09:59.449 --> 00:10:00.990
You can be more
aggressive than that.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.790
You can limit experience
to few contents,

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.620
few articles, few features.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.370
But you want to make sure
that the user can enjoy

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.090
your app before asking
them to sign in.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.340
This is very, very
important-- especially

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.800
as mobile becomes a user
acquisition tool and not

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.980
just an extension of whatever
you offer on the web.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.460
OK.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.970
Third point is
rich notifications.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.760
Ellie already talked about this.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.150
And it's very clear
that notifications

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.810
are very, very powerful
tool on Android.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.170
Here you see an example of why.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.530
You have very rich content
you can show to users already

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.940
in the notification framework--
text, picture, actions.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.650
Very important.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.600
You can ask users to take
actions outside the app.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.330
They can open your app
without opening it.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.540
It's an extension of your UI
into the operating system,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.870
into the device.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.400
And even more, you can
customize that experience.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.940
Here is an example of the
Play app-- Play Music app

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.750
where it allows you
to control a song that

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.000
is playing in the background
through the notification.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.160
So very powerful.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.040
And with the introduction of
Wear, it's even more powerful.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.800
Again, this concept of extending
your UI into the operating

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.730
system is even
more powerful when

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.530
there are more devices
and, like Wear,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.700
where it's all about using a
notification in a smart way.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.660
Here are good examples of what
Facebook, Lift, and Runtastic

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.160
did.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.500
You can add also actions that
are only relevant to Wear,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.980
but any notification will come
for free on the Wear device.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.260
You can then optimize it,
and make it more relevant.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.780
But with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.960
You don't want to overdo.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.830
You won't want to scare
users, to become spammy.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.620
That will mean that probably
the user will turn notifications

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.780
off or, even worse,
uninstall the app.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.743
So here are some
guidelines on how-- first

00:12:00.743 --> 00:12:02.770
of all, when to
show notifications--

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.150
and how to show them.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.060
The main thing is-- again,
back to identity and context.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.120
You want to capture
information that

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.370
are relevant to build the
best possible experience

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.070
for your users.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.960
And this is very important,
personal, time sensitive,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.825
relevant to context.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.670
But also how you present them.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.930
I just want to
highlight the last one,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.470
stack your notification.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.590
Key.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.270
Six emails here in
one notification,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.590
very nicely presented.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.580
If you have six notifications
from the same app here,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.390
it very quickly becomes scary.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.690
And a scared user would
probably not be very engaged.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.150
So very important
to pay attention

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.680
to how you do it because
it's very powerful.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.990
And here I wanted to
show you another example.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.200
Here is Any.do
using notification

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.820
as an extension of their UI.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.780
They also do widgets, so
the combination of both

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.230
made them achieve a
very important goal

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.720
so that 40% of their
users don't actually

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.190
open the app through the
icon on the homescreen

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.960
but through these extensions.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.610
So, if you, please.

00:13:10.204 --> 00:13:11.370
OMAR PERCHIK: Hey, I'm Omar.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.035
I'm the founder
and CEO of Any.do.

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:15.690
Any.do is the world's leading
task management application

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.060
for mobile devices.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.960
Our mission is to turn
every day into a good day

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.186
through creation of day-to-day
simple, beautiful, and fun life

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:25.185
management applications.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.400
Creating an app
is not just having

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.660
an icon on the
user's homescreen.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.800
It's about creating engagement
and getting the user

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.770
to use your app from
different parts of the OS.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.466
That's why we integrated
our app deeply into the OS

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:41.090
and created different
ways for the user

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.840
to interact with our app.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.440
In most cases, people think
about opening an app just

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.970
through the icon.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.890
But in Any.do's case, we've
deeply integrated into the OS

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.400
in several ways.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.530
The first way was to
integrate with widgets.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.863
In the widgets, you can
actually see all of your tasks

00:13:56.863 --> 00:13:59.270
that you have planned for
today, tomorrow, upcoming,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.340
and someday.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.060
But you can even mark
them as complete.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.530
So just by clicking on one
of the tasks, you can choose

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.420
and you can mark
them as complete.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.110
The second type of integration
that we did in the active part

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.265
was to actually, in the
notification center,

00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:14.390
show all the tasks that
you have planned for today.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.390
And you can easily
scroll between everything

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.770
you have planned
or add a new task.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.410
We've seen that over
40% of our users

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.970
open the app not
through the icon.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.330
Which means that the integration
with the OS on the deepest

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.400
level provides a lot more
engagement than anything else.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.980
So to sum up, the
Android platform

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.646
allows us to do a lot
of things in order

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:38.135
to increase users' engagement.

00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:40.510
We've managed to create an
experience in which the app is

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.680
so deeply integrated to
the device, where you'll

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.630
feel as if it's part of the OS.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.870
This allows us to
create a great user

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.440
interface, a great
experience, and a better usage

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.589
from our users.

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:53.380
Thank you, Android.

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:58.720
MATTEO VALLONE:
They were basically

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.511
repeating exactly what
I said, but better--

00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:02.540
in two minutes
instead of 30 minutes.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.510
Using notifications
to extend their UI

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.300
and driving engagement.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.770
Again, very important impact.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.640
Now 40% of their users
actually open the app

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.540
not through the icon
on the home page

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.010
but through this other means.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.690
They have a notification where
you can look at your tasks

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.180
and check them or
add stuff-- again,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.800
in the notification framework.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.182
So very powerful.

00:15:26.182 --> 00:15:28.640
To wrap up, I just wanted to
talk about the cross--platform

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.140
experience.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.550
That is very
important, and Ellie

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.110
has talked about this a lot.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.470
How does things
come into place when

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.770
you think about your
cross-platform experience?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.240
First of all, the
important thing

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.047
is that you shouldn't build
your UI first and then

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:44.005
adapt it to the device.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.220
We're building in
an ecosystem that

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.130
is so rich that it will
allow you to think of the use

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.840
cases that are relevant
to you and then understand

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.740
what devices support
them and what

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.270
are relevant to each use case.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.460
If you have that approach, then
you're in the best position

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.740
possible to build the right
UI for the right devices.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.170
But to do that, you have
to understand your users

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.440
and integrate with each
one of these devices.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.530
So it's very relevant.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.310
And a good example of
this is musiXmatch.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.360
For who doesn't know,
musiXmatch is a great app.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.300
It's a lyrics app.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.430
It lets you play songs
that are on your device

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.570
through their player, and
it shows you synced lyrics.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.520
It also allow you to recognize
a song with the microphone,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.020
and when the song is recognized,
it will show you synced lyrics.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.950
And they thought about
all the use cases

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.380
that they could cover in
that, for that functionality

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.410
and how those different
devices apply to each use case.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.760
So now they are on
phones and tablets

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.420
but also on TV through
Chromecast and on Wear.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.040
And they have been
very successful,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.410
but they wouldn't have
been if they weren't

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.580
ready positioned
to take advantage

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.960
of all the key features that are
available on Android to drive

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.660
engagement.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.480
And all the things
that we talk about

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.130
are the things that
they have done.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.310
And I'm not saying-- they are
a great example of driving

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.650
engagement through these things.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.760
I'm not saying that just
because they're Italian.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.170
I mean they are, and
that's very important.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.010
But I just wanted to
show you an example

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:21.849
of how well they use
notifications and the context

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.520
aware example and also
how intents is key here.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.880
So Play Music app here.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.680
A user is playing a song.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.790
They listen to an intent.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.490
Every music player
sends an intent

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.670
to the phone of what
song is playing,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.740
and they listen to that.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.270
They recognize
the song, and they

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.994
send you notification-- very
personal, very context aware.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.410
This is the song
you're listening.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.690
I recognized it.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.820
If you tap on that,
they open a widget

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.660
that overlays the Play Music
song-- the Play Music app--

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.410
and shows you synced lyrics.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.224
You have opened the
app without opening it.

00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:55.140
This is very relevant.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.950
It is context aware.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.491
You installed the
app, and now allows

00:17:57.491 --> 00:18:00.040
you to do that even if you
forgot about musiXmatch,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.070
Having done all of this--
launch this feature,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.050
work on all the key
areas that we talk about,

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.080
and being available now
on all these platforms--

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.670
the last few months, it's like
three or four months, they

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.280
saw two times more
daily active users--

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.540
and we are talking about
millions of users here--

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.780
and four times more
streaming events, two

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.070
times longer average sessions.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.340
So it really pays off to
focus on these things.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.871
To wrap up, we talked
about intents--

00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.620
how you integrate into
[INAUDIBLE] system,

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.770
anticipating user-- sorry not
anticipating, but actually

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.370
intercepting their needs.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.310
And then how you can
capture identity and context

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.950
and leverage that to
anticipate those needs.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.490
And use rich notification to
extend your UI outside the app

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.190
and how this allows you
to build the best possible

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.050
cross-platform user experience.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.760
If you have questions,
I will be around.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.530
You have my email.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.920
If you don't, this is my email.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.640
Send emails.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.560
I will reply.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.330
Thank you.
