00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.640
For every 3 hours
of computer games,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.390
Sandy has 2 hours of homework.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.970
For every 7 hours
of computer games,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.350
Madison has 4 hours of homework.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.990
I guess they have to do a
certain amount of homework

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.240
for every amount of computer
games that they play.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.510
The following graphs
describe the relationship

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.570
between the number of hours of
computer games on the x-axis

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.300
and the number of hours
of homework on the y-axis.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.690
Which point can tell us how
many hours of homework Sandy

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.380
had if she played computer
games for 5 hours?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.270
So we have to pick which
one of these graphs

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.460
describe the relationship for
Sandy between computer games--

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.160
that's what's going on on
the x-axis-- and homework.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.410
So they tell us for Sandy, that
for every 3 hours of computer

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.900
games, she has 2
hours of homework.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.790
So for every 3 hours of
computer games on the x-axis,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.170
she has 2 hours of homework.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.710
So it looks like that
point is sitting right here

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.480
on this red line.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.800
And this red line,
every time the x-axis

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.790
increases by 3-- which means 3
more hours of computer games--

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.180
it increases by 2.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.680
So there's 2 more
hours of homework.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.650
So this red line
describes the relationship

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.310
between hours of
computer games and hours

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.130
of homework for Sandy.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.030
So we have to look
at the red graph.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.300
And so they're saying, if Sandy
played 5 hours of computer

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.870
games, so 5 hours of
computer games for Sandy,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.210
you go to the red graph.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.550
You get to point C.
So this describes it.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.510
It looks like it's a little
over 3 hours of homework,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.840
if she spends 5 hours
playing computer games.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730
Pick choice C. And it is right.
