00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.010
What are the solutions to
the system of equations y

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:13.610
is equal to 1/2 x and 2x squared
minus y squared is equal to 7.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.460
And they say solutions,
because these two,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.750
if we view them as two
curves, they could very well

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.154
intersect with each other twice.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.570
So let's see what's
going on here.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.530
We have y is equal to 1/2 x
and 2x squared minus y squared

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.804
is equal to 7.

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:32.220
And the best way
to approach these

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.620
is to just try to
substitute one constraint

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410
into the other
constraint, or substitute

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.680
one equation into the other one.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.340
It seems easier to substitute
1/2 x for y into this equation,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.100
because they've already
solved for y here.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.590
Here, it's much harder to solve
for x or y, so let's do that.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.520
Every place we see a y here,
let's substitute it with this,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.650
that y must also
be equal to 1/2 x,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.470
and then see if we
can solve for x.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.290
So on this equation, we have
2x squared minus y squared.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.240
But now we're saying that y
must also be equal to 1/2 x.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.720
And that is going
to be equal to 7.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.380
Now let's see if
we can solve for x

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.080
doing a little bit of
algebraic manipulation.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.230
So we get 2x squared minus.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.500
So 1/2 squared is 1/4,
and then x squared.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.760
So we could say x squared
over-- let me write that as 1/4.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.980
So let's say it's 1/4 x
squared is equal to 7.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.710
So I have 2x squareds, and I
subtract out a 1/4 x squared,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.580
so I'm going to have
a 1 and 3/4 x squared.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.610
Or you could view this as 8/4
minus 1/4 is 7/4 x squared.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.980
7/4 x squared is equal to 7.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.594
Multiply both sides times the
reciprocal of 7/4, so 4/7.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.890
Multiply both sides by 4/7.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.810
And we get x squared
is equal to 4.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.140
And so x could be
positive or negative 2.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.550
It's the positive and
negative square root of 4.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.140
So x is equal to the plus
or minus square root of 4.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.913
x is equal to positive
2 or negative 2.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:31.020
Now, given that x is
positive 2 or negative 2,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.070
let's substitute back into
either of these equations

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.540
to figure out what y is,
what the corresponding y

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.040
is for each of these.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.190
So if x is 2, y is
going to be 1/2 of that.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.570
It's going to be 1.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.270
So we have the point 2 comma 1.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120
All I did is say, look, x is 2.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.990
1/2 times 2 is 1.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.610
If x is negative
2, then y is going

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000
to be 1/2 times
negative 2, which

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.020
is going to be negative 1.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.430
And both of these definitely
satisfy this first constraint.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.140
And you can verify
that they also

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.440
satisfy this second
constraint right over here.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.410
2 times 2 squared is--
well, 2 squared is 4.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.250
2 times that is 8.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.130
Minus 1 squared is 7.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.875
2 times negative 2
squared is still--

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.250
this whole thing's
going to be 8.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.060
Minus negative 1
squared still equals 7.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.880
So the solutions to the
system of equation-- one

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.176
is the coordinate 2
comma 1. x is 2. y is 1.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.800
The other is the
coordinate negative 2,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.310
negative 1. x is negative
2, and y is negative 1.
