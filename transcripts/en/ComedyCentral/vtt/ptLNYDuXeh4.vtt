00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.135
- I would get frustrated
with Jay for wanting me to come.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.237
I was like, why can't you just
fuck me and come?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.671
And like, why do you have to
worry about me so much?

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.206
- Agreed. Agreed.
- (Jay) Sorry.

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.509
- Sometimes I'm like,
I like to be just used

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.279
'cause I'm like, I don't even--
I'm gonna come? Yeah, right.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.747
- You hear that, ladies?
Sorry.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.416
Don't worry about it, ladies.
Where's my lens?

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.251
Ladies, don't worry about it.
I'm sorry. I just, yeah...

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.720
You have to come first,
or it's not gonna happen.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:24.490
I guess I'm a piece of shit
like that.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:25.558
♪♪

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.161
(fire crackling)

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.296
I'll tell you what.
The happiest kids in the world

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.666
to me by, uh...
you know, per capita

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.137
seems to be these rich kids
who end up in my building

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.373 line:0%
where their parents pay for them
while they go to college...

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.275 line:0%
- To get into college.
- ...to just fucking party...

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.843 line:0%
- Yeah.
- ...in my building.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.311
- Well, see what's crazy about
that is I--

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.146
- That's it.
Now there's party-- (stammering)

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.781
My building's--
the apartments are expensive.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.817
- It's the best time of life.
- These college kids can do--

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.552
But there's five of them living
in an apartment

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.387
and they just fuck shit up.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.322
- It's the best.
- And they seem super happy.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.857
- They do seem super happy.
- It's the best time of life.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.692
- They don't seem dark.
- Yeah, but see, like, for me--

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.294
the drinking was
a little more sad

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.129
'cause I didn't have
any money coming in from family.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.530
So you're just like dead broke.
- No, right.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.866
That's what I'm saying.
when you're genuinely broke...

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.601
- You're like, when you're
getting fucked up

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.570
because it's like,
sure it's fun,

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.805
but also it makes sleeping
on an air mattress

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.707
in a windowless room better.
- It really does.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.477
- I didn't get too dark until
my early 30s when you're like,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.745
I think I'm a fuckin'
dark, weird failure.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:21.347
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.648
- I think I'm failing at this.
- Isn't that funny?

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.283
The 30s is the hangover
of the 20s

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.352
where you're just like,
oh, fuck. Oh, goddamn.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.687
I thought that was a great idea.
- Wow.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.355
That's profound.
It really is.

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:32.291
'Cause I look back on my 20s,
I'm like, it was blissful.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:36.129
I was broke
and, like, not healthy,

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.432
and hung over all the time,
but I had the best ti--

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.267
I had the best time
getting fucked up.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.735
- Yeah.
- I really, like,

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:44.237
if you're getting
fucked up currently

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.172
and still drinking,
I always like to say

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.341
just have some fun 'cause
you're gonna get to a place

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.876
where you can't do it anymore.
- Yeah.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.912
- And I look back and I'm like,
I had the best time

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.814
and I won't ever go back to it,
and it's--

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.215
I kind of mourn it.
- I had a brief time.

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.750
I have a very brief time
of, like, uh...

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.385
- Enjoy it.
- ...drinking heavy

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.820
and stuff like that. Yeah,
it was like three years ago.

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:02.388
- (Nikki) Yeah.
- It was, uh, I think it should

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.856
been in my teens or early 20s.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.491
- Was it-- Did you have
a great time, though?

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.894
- But-- Uh, no, 'cause Christine
was drinking, too,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.495
and she's not that great
when she's drunk.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.831
So it went haywire.
- Yeah. Well, yeah, you don't--

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.499
- But that was my only time.
She doesn't drink now at all.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:14.934
- (Nikki) Yeah.
- But, like, that was my only

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.369
time really drinking.
I didn't drink much.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.503
I had my daughter young, though.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.272
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just--

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.240
- Man, I really lived
hand to mouth for awhile.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:22.642
- Do you agree with me?
- I was drinking--

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.878
Uh, it's fun up until the end.
- Up until it's not fun

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.346
and then you quit.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah-yeah.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.781
- The end is awful.
That's why you quit.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.883
- When it stops being
not fun anymore,

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.385 line:0%
it gets awful,
then you're just, like--

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.220 line:0%
- But people who have guilt
over drinking

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.290 line:0%
around me sometimes will be,
like, "I-- Is it weird?"

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.457
But they're still having fun
with drinking.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.193
- Yeah.
- It hasn't become a sad thing.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.628
I'm always like, no!
Live it! Be in the moment!

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.264
- I watch Bert Kreischer,
and I'm like,

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:46.899
I wish I could drink again.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.268
- That, uh...
- I want to drink with Bert.

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.736
He's, like, one of the people
I would want to drink with.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.471
- Yeah, he does have fun.
- There's a real heavy,

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:56.409
heavy documentary about
the guitar player from Korn,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.211
the one guy who left
and came back.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.545
- Yeah.
- But he talks about,

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:02.381
in that documentary,
the lead singer from Korn

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.550
said he was one of the first
ones to get sober.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.285
- (Dan) Yeah.
- And he said when he got sober,

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.553
they were,
like, worried about,

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.222
like, partying around him still
and everything,

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.556
and he said--
He was like, "No, I loved it."

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.692
He goes, "I used to really enjoy
the act of, like,

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.427
"cutting the lines
and everything for everybody.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.695
I would, like, still prep it
for everybody."

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.929
- Yeah.
- "I just can't do it,

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:18.431
"but you guys fucking rock out.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.699
"If it's not causing your lives
to fall apart,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.400
go for it."
- And as soon as those people--

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:23.536
like, people get worried
about getting sober

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.371
that you're gonna
lose all your friends,

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.774
but what happens is you just,
like, see what you thought

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:30.610
you were having fun doing, and
then you kind of see it clearly,

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.378
and you're like, oh,
this isn't as fun.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.713
And then you just naturally
don't want to do it.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.382
It's not like you're like,
"I long to have fun

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:37.683
like that again!"
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.318
- Do you agree?
- Yeah, I walked by this bar,

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:40.686
and I always used
to romanticize it

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.521
from my drinking, like,
my hard drinking days.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.591
And I'm like, it's just such
a great neighborhood scummy bar.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:46.726
- Yeah.
- And then you walk by now

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.994
and you're like, whoa.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.396
- Now you get your joy
watching grown men

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.998
in costumes fake fight.
- (Nikki) Oh, my God.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.333
- And that... that's healthy.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.436
- And let me tell ya.
That-- That has no psychological

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.572
reprimands at all.
- Dan, find your lens.

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:02.441
- Wrestling... wrestling's
better than drinking.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:03.643
(laughter)

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.278
Pivot.
Move.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.879
Uh, wrestling--
Yeah, dude, I don't know.

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.581
My life,
drinking was a lot of fun,

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.683
but it was also very destructive
at the same time.

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.019
I was just like, you know--

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.553
- You were-- it was physically
destroying you.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.355
- Physically destroying me.
- You would have--

00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:18.391
If you would've
been drunk at that event

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.393
that you're talking about
being joyful at,

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.362
that has a bunch of acronyms
I don't care to remember.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:24.964
- The WWE. Monday Night Raw.
- The WWE...

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.532
- If I would have got
hammered last night...

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.968
- ...TC, is it another?
- No. WWE Monday Night Raw.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.770
- Oh, okay.
That was where you were at.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.471
- Yeah, I was at Raw last night.
If I would have gotten drunk

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.440
last night, that would
have been the best

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:35.975
for the first hour and a half.
- Yes, but then...

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:38.010
- And then I would
have been obnoxious.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:39.512
- And you wouldn't remember
it... as much.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.414
- Well, again, when I just
always argue

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:45.051
about the drinking thing that
I just don't fully understand,

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:49.322
is the day after the next,
if it's the same thing,

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.756
the same mistake...
- Yeah.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.591
- ...day after day, like--
- (Dan) Groundhog Day.

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:54.360
- And it's like Christine has
explained it to me as best

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.662
she can, and I don't think
it's a bad explanation,

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.397
although, I just don't
get it when she--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.667
I was like, if you know four
drinks is where you get,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.070
like, it's a fun night.
We're having a really fun night.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.072
- Then by the time
you're at three and a half,

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.908
and you see four closing in...
- Right.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.743
- ...you're like, I'm gonna get
five, six, and seven.

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.812
- And the person that's gonna--
- But-- But here's my thing

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.015
what I don't understand is,
but you know for sure,

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:19.051
as last night
and the two before told you,

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.120
five and six are the ones
where you puke,

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:23.723
but you're right here,
and still you believe, he goes,

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.458
"No, but tonight--"
She's saying that

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.859
basically you're saying,
"No, but tonight it's just gonna

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.427
maintain that buzz.
- (Nikki) Gonna be different.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.795
Right.
- And I don't understand that.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:31.630
I'm like, I don't know.
- It's because the person

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:34.567
in your head that's supposed
to stop you at four gets drunk.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.436
- Yeah! That's exactly it.
- Yeah, my mind doesn't do that.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:38.738
- That is exactly it.
Straight up,

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.106
your inside brain is hammered,
and it's like,

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.007
go smoke a cigarette,
come back,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.876
have two more.
- "Live your life, dude."

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:44.977
- Yeah. Who do you--
Who do you--

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.545
Dude, that's my favorite.

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:48.114
That was my favorite drunk
thought of all time.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.049
It would always be like,
Dude, who's telling you not

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:52.451
to do that?
You should do it.

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.620
I think you should
step up and fucking do it.

00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:55.921
- Most of my drunks
have been with you.

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.523
(Nikki)
Doesn't make any sense.

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:58.991
- Christine, most of my drunks
have been with you.

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:02.728
Have I made you think, though,
like I would say my mind,

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:05.464
like, my brain function
of what should happen next...

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.700
- (Dan) Yeah.
- ...does stay sober.

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:09.602
Wouldn't you agree with that?
- Yeah, it's a bizarre thing,

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.437
and drinking with Jay was...
- Like, I never-- I never lose--

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.406
I would never have a thing--
Like I said, I've never...

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.541
I can't wrap my brain
around the idea

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.443
if somebody came
up to me and was like,

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.078
"Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave."

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:20.613
I would immediately assume

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.148
I am the one
who did something wrong,

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.883
and I would be like,
I'm sorry, did I fuck up?

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.518
Am I drunk and I fucked u--

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.686
That's how I would react--
even if I'm slurring words,

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.155
I'd go-- I would assume
it was me.

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.756
I would never be
in a place going,

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.625
What the fuck?! I don't have to
fucking go anywhere.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.894
- Let me tell you where
drunk Dan would be.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.829
"I can win 'em back."

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:38.164
(laughter)

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.598
- Oh, yeah.

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:41.901
- A hammered Dan
would be like--

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.135
- I think that would be me, too.

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:44.703
- I'd be like,
"What's your name, man?

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:46.639
Why are we doing this?
What's up? Are you okay?"

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:47.807
- That's a good point.
- "You need to leave.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.074
You want to get a beer?"

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:50.509
- "Listen, who's telling
me not to?"

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.911
What was your argument?
- Yeah.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.980
I'm gonna do it because
who's telling me not to do it?

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:56.682
- That doesn't make any sense.

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.951
It's such a drunk, like...
- It's such a drunk mantra.

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.619
- ...motivational mantra, yeah.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.855
- You know what? I wake up
the same as I went to sleep:

00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:04.056
breathing and walking.

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:05.524
(laughter)

00:07:05.557 --> 00:07:06.759
Here we go.
Here-- Then I'd wake up

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.561
to go work at Dose,
and I'd be like,

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.463
I think I'm gonna throw up
and everything is sideways.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.965
- I put my pants on like
everybody else.

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.800
Pants on.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.536
- "I go to sleep,
and that's where I dream,

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.537
"and when I dream
is when I plan,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.072
and when I plan, I execute."

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.942
- Mine's like, "Life is short."
That's always... (stammering)

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.677
- Yeah. "Life is short"

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.245
is such the
"take another shot."

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:29.114
- It's just "carpe diem,"
"FOMO," like all of that,

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:31.016
just, like, "Why are you?
Just be--"

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.486
And that's what I do
with everything in life, though.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:34.920
Anything I want
to convince myself to do,

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.556
I just go, we're gonna--
we're all gonna be dead!

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.058
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It doesn't ma--

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.627
Like, everyone who could maybe
judge me for this is gonna die,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.729
and then the people that they
tell are gonna die.

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:45.197
Like, there's gonna be--
- You know how easy it would be

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.699
for me to become 500 pounds
in my life

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.634
if I lived like that, though?
- (Dan) Oh!

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.570
- Who's-- Why would
I not have a--

00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:52.771
When I'm on my death bed,
I'm not gonna think about

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:54.173
all the cheese steaks
I didn't eat.

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:57.176
- Yeah! I'll be full
of cheese steaks.

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:58.611
So, I won't think
about cheese cakes.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:07:59.979
- Mission accomplished.
(fire crackling)

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:02.615
We were talking earlier
about the-- not on the show,

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:05.851
before the show,
about the things that a guy

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:08.954
will dial back to, if it's not
gonna happen sexually.

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:11.790
I said I've-- When you get
to that point where later,

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:14.293
immediately after you come,
you go, like,

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.128
that was ridiculous
that I even asked

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.863
for that thing to happen.
But I'm--

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:20.299
So for a good example,
I remember a time

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:22.568
I said I was hookin' up
with a girl,

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.604
and I made her come quick,
I think, eating her pussy.

00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:28.741
And then, I thought it was time,
and then she had like--

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.709
I don't know if it was like,
we shouldn't be doing this or...

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.745
- She just like--
her head was clear,

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:35.614
and then she was like, um,
I don't like you.

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:37.283
- The same thing, whatever
it was, but she was like--

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.918
- Not you, but you know,
I've been there.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.653
- Whatever it was, she didn't
want to do the thing,

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.621
and it was... when you
dial back and you're like,

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:43.989
will you just do the--

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:45.824
And she's like, I guess,
you know, you could jerk off

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.593
if you want, and then you'll
be doing that.

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.695
It's like-- And then you start
making the negotiating.

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:50.896
"Can I just see a tittie?

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.231
Can you grab the base
or something?"

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:53.666
Just the things people
ask for...

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.301
- "If I rub my cock
against your calf,

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.735
"is that cool?
Just like your--

00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:57.970
"would you just shame me
if I just want

00:08:58.003 --> 00:08:59.705
like two or three
little magic wands?"

00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:01.774
- I would nev-- I'm not
into feet a little bit,

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:03.876
but if a girl goes, "The only
thing that's gonna happen,

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:06.045
"and you have a rager
and I've already come?

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:07.279
You can fuck my toes,"

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:08.681
I'd think about fucking
those toes.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.182
And I don't give
a shit about feet.

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:12.785
- If she was like, "You can
TSA wand me with your boner."

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.653
(laughter)

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:17.323
I'd be like, yes!
Yes!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.124
- And then you tap it on
her hip and you go,

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.693
"What's this here?
Keys?"

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.227
- And she goes, "You're not
moving today, boss."

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.929
I go "All right"
and keep moving.

00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:25.831
- Why were you in a relationship
with a girl who didn't want to--

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:27.933
- That was-- No, I don't think
these are ever relationships.

00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.335
- Oh, this is just a girl,
yeah, yeah,

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.903
you made come and then--
- My example was--

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:33.606
- I don't relate to coming
right away with a guy.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.808
I just don't relate to that
in a hookup.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.043
And then I also
don't relate to me--

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:41.747
like, I have this sense of
obligation to make a guy come

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.883
that I would-- I don't relate
at all to being like, ugh.

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:47.152
I mean, I definitely have been--
- That's great.

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.354
I love the devotion,
it's like,

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.955
Don't you understand?
She's the best!

00:09:49.988 --> 00:09:51.090
She's like Rambo.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.691
She has one mission!
- Yeah...

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:54.893
- To make a man come!
- And even if you were like,

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:56.862
Can I jerk off?
I'd be like, yeah, that's awe--

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:59.632
I don't have to do anything?
You just want to jerk off on me?

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:01.767
Great! Like, that is--
or just--

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.135
- But you've never been
approached for that,

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.370
because you wouldn't
make a guy

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:05.771
just jerk off
in front of you.

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:07.139
- I mean,
there have been times

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:08.941
where I've hooked up with a guy
recently where I'm like,

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:11.877
you have not earned me
to touch your dick in any way.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.979
You've done nothing to me,
and they wanna come,

00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:15.714
and I know that they're not
gonna be able to make me come,

00:10:15.747 --> 00:10:17.349
and so we're kind of just
at a stalemate

00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:18.651
where they're like,
touch my dick!

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:19.918
- Why do you know they can't--

00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.687
you can't with a new person
right away?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.855
- Because they're fingering me
and it's worthless.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.289
And they're just--
there's so--

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:25.391
- Overhand?
- There's not enough coaching

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.693
that is gonna--
it's just--

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.128
They're not saying
the right things.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.664
I'm already just--
(stammering)

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.065
- What's the most coaching
with a fingering

00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:34.967
you'll hang in there for?
I've made this joke--

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.268
(Dan)
Do they have to show form?

00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.670
- I've made the joke
on stage so much

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.038
about a guy fingering
overhand...

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.439
(Nikki)
They've just gotta say
some hot shit.

00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:41.907
- ...where most girls say
lots of guys

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.942
think they go in
overhand fingering.

00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:45.377
- No way.
- It's very bizarre.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.679
- Uppercuts, for knockouts.
- Uppercuts.

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:47.846
- Of course upper-- shallow!

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.415
By the way,
shallow uppercuts.

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:52.017
- Yes. Yes.
- (vocally clicking)

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.385
- And--
- Give it a little Terminator.

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:54.820
- But this guy was already
fingering

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:56.822
before I was even
wanting it, I think.

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:59.091
- Problem is,
you hit that shallow--

00:10:59.124 --> 00:11:01.994
you hit the shallow uppercuts,
the problem is, afterwards?

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:03.762
You might be jerking off
to a tit.

00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:05.097
(laughter)
- Yeah, yeah.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.865
Yeah, that's a good point.
- Have you ever--

00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:09.368
- If you do too well.
- Has a man ever made you came,

00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:11.036
and then you're like,
Well, we're good here.

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:12.037 line:0%
- No. No.
- Okay.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.439 line:0%
(fire crackling)

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:14.907 line:0%
- But, I will say I've been
in that predicament

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.475 line:0%
of like, I don't want
to touch your dick.

00:11:16.508 --> 00:11:17.976
I'm not gonna blow you,
'cause you haven't earned it.

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:20.079
You-- you're just--
you're not--

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.814
But I do want you to come
because I want you

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.782
to have a good experience
and your dick is hard,

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:26.885
and I don't want to leave you
feeling unsatisfied.

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:29.088
And, I want to have like
a fun, weird sexual experience.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.424
So I'll be like, just jerk off,
I'll watch, or whatever, or--

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.959
- Man, is that hot
until you come.

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:35.327
- Recently--
- And then you're like...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.829
(sighs)
So...

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.731
- You're like,
I was a total asshole here.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.099
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you just come

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.467
and you're like, fuck.
- No, I don't think it's--

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.735
I think guys are weird
about it now

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.169
becaue of all
the Louis stuff.

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:45.838
Like, oh, I don't want
to jerk off in front of a girl,

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.206
that's weird.
I'm like, no, it's awesome.

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:48.974
- Do you think before that,
they were like,

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:50.809
are you gonna come and you go,
do I get an FX show?

00:11:50.842 --> 00:11:53.512
- Yeah. Not unwanted,
but if I ask you to, that's--

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.347
it's hot.
It can be so hot.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.916
And-- so this guy,
in particular,

00:11:57.949 --> 00:12:00.986
so we were like,
we were makin' out and stuff.

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:04.890
I knew that he was not
even gonna do anything to me

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:06.391
that would make me come.
- How did you know that?

00:12:06.424 --> 00:12:09.828
- Because, um, he wasn't saying
the right things, he wasn't--

00:12:09.861 --> 00:12:11.964
- Jacob's taking notes so
he can keyword search all this

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.298
for a jazz session later.

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.801
- Jacob goes, did he walk
with his shoulders back?

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:18.370
- (laughing)
- I like that. (chuckles)

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:19.938
Nikki--
I like that Nikki cases it--

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:21.774
- Did he have the posture
of a gentleman?

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.909
- I like that Nikki cases it--
like, cases dudes like,

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:25.110
you know,
like she knows, like,

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:26.812
how to like pick pockets,
you know.

00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:28.113
She goes, I could tell
by the way he walked,

00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:29.381
he had a heavy wallet.

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:30.883
She goes, walkin' in,
I knew I was dry.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.284
I was gonna be dry
for the whole night.

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:33.519
Bring back
my old-timey music, Lou.

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.120
We're gonna start talkin'
like this again.

00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:37.489
- He just didn't...
like me enough to give a shit.

00:12:37.522 --> 00:12:39.224
You know, like,
he just wanted to come.

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:41.093
That was what this was about.
- So you felt that was just--

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:44.530
- I just knew-- yeah.
And I just didn't--

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.999
- And you still feel obligation
to have them come?

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.001
- I didn't want him--
in this particular instance,

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.536
I didn't care
if he came or not,

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:52.838
but I was gonna get something,
a story, out of it.

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.239
- Sure.
- Or at least like--

00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:55.908
just something weird sexually,
'cause I like to be

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.810
a little bit deviant sometimes
and throw my--

00:12:57.843 --> 00:12:59.444
and I'm sober,
and so it's hard for me

00:12:59.477 --> 00:13:00.913
to be as deviant as
I used to be.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.882
- Yeah.
- And so, it was like--

00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:08.153
I was in, like, a leotard.
It's a long story, but I--

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:10.022
- Original dance moves?
Did you guys--

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.257
- Jacob says...
details, please.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.027
- Go forward. Is there
a plié barre in the room?

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.863
- We were in a trailer...
- I'm gonna lose my shit.

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:20.899
- ...and, like daytime.
Hooking up.

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:22.968
Wasn't-- I wasn't--
it wasn't-- it was like--

00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:24.236
maybe I wasn't
gonna come because

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:25.904
I was, like, not comfortable
because a P.A...

00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:27.105
- Yeah.
- ...could have walked in,

00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:28.440
or-- you know what I mean?
- True.

00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:29.975
- It was like that
kind of thing.

00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:31.476
- A knock on a trailer is
a real boner killer.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:33.312
- And he was just like plea--
can you do-- what are you--

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.480
And I don't even know that
he wanted me to do anything,

00:13:35.513 --> 00:13:36.982
but I decided--
I didn't even want

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:38.183
to jerk him off
through his pants.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:40.085
Like, he didn't deserve
my hand, I felt.

00:13:40.118 --> 00:13:41.587
- Okay.
- I don't know why.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.055
And also, I just don't feel
that confident

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.456
in hand jobs.
- In hands?

00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.325
- So, I think I also avoid them
because I'm just like--

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:47.926
- Good for you.
- (Dan) Christine, what's your--

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:49.394
- Better to be, uh...

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:51.163
- I know what I'm good at.
- ...to be not self-confident.

00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:52.598
Yeah, if you're better--
don't think you're good at it,

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.600
'cause a bad one will make ya...
- Yeah, I just--

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.168
- You don't wanna
fumble around with it.

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:57.936
Fumble the ball right when
you get it, so to speak.

00:13:57.969 --> 00:13:59.271
- I legit...
- Ooh-fa!

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:01.306
- ...just took my--
I was straddling him,

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:03.976
and I just, like, went like this
with my shin.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.611
Like, I just kind of like--
- Oh, my God!

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.546
You did the calf move
I was joking about?

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.114
- I'm not joking, though.
I did that.

00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:11.483
And he didn't come,
but it was kind of hot.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:13.986
And funny.
- It's skin on skin.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:16.088
- It wasn't even his skin,
it was through his boxers,

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.623
but I just did that
for awhile.

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:20.025
- Were they Umbros?
Any chance of Umbros?

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:22.194
- Oh, we were talkin' Umbros
in a couple weeks.

00:14:22.227 --> 00:14:24.029
- Oh, Umbros!
- We were saying those--

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:25.230
that's-- those are the shorts
for those.

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:26.565
- Those are coming back.
- That's the--

00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:28.267
If a girl shin-fucked me...
- Yes!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.002
- ...in my Umbros,
I'd be like, keep going.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.971
- Oh, yeah, that's a great
hand job or out-- yeah.

00:14:33.004 --> 00:14:34.439
- Over the pants hand-- yeah.
- Outside panting.

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:36.441
That's a great fabric for that.
- Oh, it's the perfect one.

00:14:36.474 --> 00:14:39.177
- And old Italian man jumpsuits.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.612
- Yes. Suede.
- That's just-- (laughing)

00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:41.947
- Suede is--

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.382
- Suede?
- I don't know, it's warm.

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.384
- Suede will rip your goddamn
dick skin off. Suede?

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.986
- Suede. Suede's soft.
- For women, it's like, um...

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:49.988
the best thing
to get fingered through,

00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:53.125
Christine? Like, denim...
- Basketball shorts.

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.493
- Best thing
to get fingered through?

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:55.961
Christine is gonna answer,
her pussy.

00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:58.096
I, uh, you can finger
right through it.

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.432
- Like, you don't want it to,
like, soak through,

00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:02.167
because you're gonna get wet
so you want it to be

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.469
a little bit, like,
of a coarser mater--

00:15:04.502 --> 00:15:06.138
like a corduroy?
- (Dan) All right.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.441
- I don't know if I've ever just
done over the pants stuff.

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.243
- Oh, I love it!
- (Jay) Hey.

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.412
While you girls
are syncing up periods,

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:17.082
Dan thinks it would be okay
to get jacked off with suede.

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:19.084
And he's arguing
that it's a soft material

00:15:19.117 --> 00:15:20.485
that would feel good
on your dick.

00:15:20.518 --> 00:15:22.387
It will not!
- I think it could.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.289
- It will not.
It will rip your dick off, Dan!

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:26.058
It's like jerking off with
a baseball mitt, you psycho.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.993
- But you need suede that like
changes color when you,

00:15:28.026 --> 00:15:29.428
like, rub your hand across it.
- Oh!

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.729
- You're talkin' about velvet.

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:32.064
I think you're both talking
about velvet.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.298
- I mean velvet.
- Velvet!

00:15:33.331 --> 00:15:35.534
- Oh, I'm sorry, I got--
I got gator cock!

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.235
(laughter)
It's all coarse and hard!

00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:39.438
- Jesus, fuck, what is happening
to your dick?

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.740
- You guys don't jerk off--
- You are from Colorado!

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:44.276
- Okay, we call that
a little Fort Collins handy.

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:45.477
- He goes, I'm gonna go
jerk off.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.012
Pass me my naugahyde!

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:49.181
- (laughing) You guys got
some raw leather?

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.550
- My friend, Andrew Collin--
- Oh, never mind.

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:52.718
- There you go, Dan.

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.453
Fuckin' wrap that around
your dick, dude.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.121
(laughter)

00:15:56.154 --> 00:15:57.656
Why don't you give yourself
a good beat-- why don't you

00:15:57.689 --> 00:15:59.224
stick your dick between those
two suede flaps and pump away?

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:01.059
- I'm an idiot.
I'm an idiot.

00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:02.728
- You're gonna rip
your pee hole open!

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.596
- Is there anything to this?
My friend, the guy

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:06.198
who comes out
on the road with me,

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.467
he's on my show all the time,
Andrew Collin, he, um...

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.269 line:0%
he thinks-- he needs--

00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:13.338 line:0%
He's jerked off with his hand
for so long,

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:15.440
'cause he's been single that--
and dry.

00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:16.608
He doesn't, like, use lube.

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.010
So, like...
- Me, either.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.177
- Now he's having sex and stuff.
- What?

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.212
- And he's like,
"It's all too wet.

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.646
Like, I can't..."
- What?

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:24.216
- "I need more...
I need drier vaginas."

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:26.752
- This is cra-- first off...
- Does that make any sense?

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.620
Because guys really--
- You dry jerk?

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:30.088
- I dry jerk, yes.

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:31.256
- Okay, wow.
We're on to something.

00:16:31.289 --> 00:16:32.657
- What?
- This is opening up

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.359
a whole new thing.
- That's-- that's real--

00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:37.496
- What do you use?
- Uh, lotion or lube.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:40.098
- I mean, to--
to pull out lube to jerk off

00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:41.666
is downright ridiculous.

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.435
- Why is it ridiculous?
It's awesome.

00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:45.337
- It's ridiculous.
- Why would you do that?

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.772
Maybe I want to treat myself.
- Lube? Like, a brand of lube?

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.774
- Like a little, like,
warming jelly.

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:51.043
(laughter)

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.244
I got a tube of it.
- That's so cute

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.645
that you treat yourself right.
- Yeah.

00:16:53.678 --> 00:16:54.780
I got a tube of it at CVS
on the road.

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:56.381
I was like,
I'm gonna beat to this.

00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:59.518
- You have an English
breakfast tea next to you?

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.086
- Sleepytime Tea.

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:03.121
- I do some English
bran muffins in the morning

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:07.092
and I have a nice lubed jerk.
Why not, dude?

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.327
I found it at the CVS.
- No, you absolutely should.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.830
- It's a good hotel jerk.
It's like a treat.

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.532
- You bring it
on the road with you?

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.067
- In his little Dopp kit.
- It's a little--

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.234
- Yeah, he's got
a little compartment

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:17.602
in the shower hanger
Dopp kit thing.

00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:19.137
- That's where I found it.
I found it on the road

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.505
when I was at a CVS,
so I was like...

00:17:20.538 --> 00:17:22.641
- Do you keep it hooked
on to your bag like it's Purell?

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.342
(laughter)

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:27.746
- Yeah, I go through, I go,
you can take a spritz if you--

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:29.381
- Hey, man, I'm gonna
hit the can.

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:31.083
It looks like our flight's
delayed about a half hour.

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:33.652
(spurts)
Ahh.

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:35.253
(laughter)

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:37.823
Sim sala bim.
Here we go.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.624
- You wanna...
you wanna get a nut?

00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:41.226
- 'Cause, what do you do?

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:42.727
- You just jerk dry
like a fuckin' old fisherman?

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.630
- I fuckin' grab my dork
and I pull on it.

00:17:45.663 --> 00:17:47.099
- Yeah, that's--

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:48.300
- No lubrication at all?
- And then, by the way--

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:49.701
of course--
here's what'll happen.

00:17:49.734 --> 00:17:52.771
When you're jerking off,
there's gonna be a little sad,

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:55.107
like, you know, the garbage
Indian tear,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.176
and I will-- I will take
the thumb across that

00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:00.178
and I'll work that
right around, you know,

00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:01.713
the rim of the fuckin' helmet.
- You will use

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:03.648
your own pre-cum as lube.
- Dude, wow.

00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:06.585
You're like a person
that has a fresh water well.

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:07.853
Like, that's all you drink.
- I've been judged a lot

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.421
for my things--
I said after--

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:11.723
I'm a pretty sexual person
and I'll go for it.

00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:14.359
I've had-- someone
was defending me online,

00:18:14.392 --> 00:18:16.328
but on The SDR Show one time
I said after--

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:18.163
like, what do you--
when you come, what do you,

00:18:18.196 --> 00:18:19.598
like, put it
in the tissues and...

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:20.765
- Yeah.
- ...do all that stuff?

00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:23.335
And I go, no, generally
where I jerk off

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:25.270
is in a hotel before
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:26.238
- Okay.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.140
- Or at home, like, you know,

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:31.243
somewhere between,
uh, ten minutes to an hour

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.812
before I take a shower.
And I go, no, if it--

00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.447
generally, it's like--
first of all, it's not--

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.349
I'm not blowing, like,
fuckin' porn loads on anything.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.683
- (Nikki) Mm-hmm.
- (Dan) Sure.

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:39.918
- I go, I just kinda
like go like--

00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:41.419
I said, I'll wipe it on
my goddamn thigh

00:18:41.452 --> 00:18:43.288
and get ready
for the shower and whatever.

00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:45.824
Everybody was like, "Oh, man!"
I'm like, who gives a fuck?

00:18:45.857 --> 00:18:47.259
- Yeah.
- No. I mean, I've had it...

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.426
- Who gives a shit?
- ...all over me,

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:50.228
so that doesn't--
who cares?

00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:51.696
- Who cares?
- Yeah.

00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:54.199
As a woman that, like, you know,
girls get it all over them.

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:56.368
- Christine's definitely
walked to a store next to me

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.636
with cum all over her body
in some way.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.204
- (Nikki) Yes.
- Absolutely.

00:18:59.237 --> 00:19:01.540
- I taught English with cum
all over me once.

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.542
- Oh, I'm gonna--
Jacob, write that down for me.

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:04.910
- (Dan) Yeah.
- That's going in my spank bank.

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.545
- I like that one.
- Yeah.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.914
You taught-- you taught fuckin'
verb "congregate"-- yeah.

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.649
(class bell rings)

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:11.917
You taught adjectives

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.618
and you had fuckin'
dry cum on you?

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:14.920
- Teaching a summer school

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.788
to Korean students,
'cause Korean parents

00:19:16.821 --> 00:19:18.256
don't send-- let their kids,
right?

00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:19.925
- And they bukkaked you.
- (Dan) Yeah.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.460
- They love that
over in Korea.

00:19:22.493 --> 00:19:24.262
- I was on a lunch break
and I came back.

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:27.499
- (accented)
My son tells me
that you smell like cum.

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:30.869
I had-- I had to meet
the teacher who smells like cum.

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:32.237
(Jay, accented)
It's a little bleachy.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.605
- Oh, man.
That's really gross.

00:19:33.638 --> 00:19:35.273
I shouldn't have admitted that.
- Man, how did you--

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:36.775
How did you find that out?
When you got home?

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.277
- I just rea-- I don't know if
I actually had cum on me,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.246
but I was in circumstances
where I did not shower

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:42.814
after having
a night of filthy sex,

00:19:42.847 --> 00:19:44.349
and I would go in to work.
- Awesome.

00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:45.684
- And there was one time
on a lunch break

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:46.952
where I gave a guy a hand job,

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.687
and I remember going
back to work being like,

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.489
I am-- like, I felt--
I had a skip in my step,

00:19:51.522 --> 00:19:53.491
'cause I'm like, what a slut.
- Yeah!

00:19:53.524 --> 00:19:55.493
- I was like, you are
a fucking whore.

00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:56.962
- What a winner!
- Who do you think you are?

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:59.698
You're gonna go teach children
after you just,

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.399
like, defi--
let a man defile--

00:20:01.432 --> 00:20:03.268
- Touch 'em all in their
little flat faces

00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:04.836
with your cum-- with your fu--
- (Nikki) Oh, God.

00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:06.938
- With your salty dick hand?
- Yeah.

00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:08.640
- Salty dick hand.
- It was fun.

00:20:08.673 --> 00:20:11.476
- Oh, dude, there was a waitress
at The Cellar one time

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:14.846
said to me as, like,
joking but dead serious,

00:20:14.879 --> 00:20:16.648
and she goes, uh...
Oh, I want to--

00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:18.717
I'll telll you her name off-air.
Everyone knows her.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.884
- I know who it is.
- Yeah.

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.353
- I already know
who it is by the story.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:22.854
- She comes over,
like, laughingly and--

00:20:22.887 --> 00:20:26.291
and she puts like her hand
over my, like, face and nose.

00:20:26.324 --> 00:20:27.993
And I was like, wha--
And she goes, she goes,

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.427
"I just jerked a guy off."

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.929
And then I could--
when she said that,

00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:32.998
the smell kicked in,
we were like,

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.900
that is the salt of...

00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:37.502
- Yep.
- You had cock salt?

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:38.837
- Oh, I smell it sometimes.
- It's-- it's--

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.405
it's spit
and fuckin' dick salt.

00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:41.906
- Yeah, cock salt. Cock salt.
- I can smell it.

00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:43.875
At the gym, guys will work out
next to me on the treadmill,

00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:46.311
and once they start sweating,
like, whatever cum is on them

00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:49.547
starts, like, you know,
warming up.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.650
Like essential oils.
(laughter)

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:54.019
And then it just
starts misting through

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.454
my section of the gym.
And I'm like,

00:20:56.487 --> 00:20:58.890
there is a cum scent.
- Yeah.

00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:01.293
- A strong--
a warm cum scent.

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:02.694
- Someone in this town--
someone--

00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:04.496
- But it's not just cum.
- Among the eucalyptus towels.

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:07.365
- It's not just cummy,
it's like spitty dick.

00:21:07.398 --> 00:21:09.067
(Christine)
It's like dick hands.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.736
- Yes, it smells like
dirty sex.

00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:13.638
- Didn't she just walk up
and put her hand on your face

00:21:13.671 --> 00:21:15.340
and say, "Smell like dick?"
and start laughing.

00:21:15.373 --> 00:21:16.741
- (Nikki) Oh, God.
- I thought that's how it went.

00:21:16.774 --> 00:21:18.510
- No, she said to me--
she goes "I just jacked a guy--"

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:19.944
she goes,
"I just jerked off a guy."

00:21:19.977 --> 00:21:21.713
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- That's so funny.

00:21:21.746 --> 00:21:23.014
- Yeah, unmistakable scent.

00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:24.582
- I couldn't even be that mad,
it was so funny.

00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:25.984
- It's so funny.
- I was like,

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:27.485
I don't know,
I can't get mad at that.

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:29.487
That's fucking hilar--
'cause she's not lying.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.357
It smelled-- I was like, she
definitely jerked off a dude.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.725
- Oh! Instead of shaking
a person's hands

00:21:33.758 --> 00:21:35.060
when I've just washed
my hands and they're wet,

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.594
I won't go-- I just--

00:21:36.627 --> 00:21:38.330
I just jerked a guy off, sorry.
- That's so funny.

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:40.765
- But every guy--
every guy here for sure

00:21:40.798 --> 00:21:43.501
has gone to a store also,
conversely, with--

00:21:43.534 --> 00:21:44.836
Well, I don't know.
Everybody here

00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:46.438
might be naked fuckers.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:50.075
But I've definitely had, like,
uh, girl juice...

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.743
- (Dan) Dude--
- And when you get to the store

00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:53.545
and you start seeing, it just
turns white later like...

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.080
- Yes!
- Oh yeah, it's like toothpaste!

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.381
(Jay)
Like you're drying out
ketamine.

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:57.549
- It's like toothpaste.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.084
It's like tooth-- yeah.
That's so funny.

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:00.452
It's like toothpaste
on the corner of your mouth.

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:01.720
- Yes.
- You don't realize it's there.

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:03.355
- Oh yeah.
- "Did you make a girl come?"

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.689
And you go... what?
- Uh-huh.

00:22:04.722 --> 00:22:06.458
- Dude, I had one--
- Oh, also having a beard

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.859
like this also, you will def--
- (Nikki) Oh my God.

00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:09.794
- But just getting to--
going to a store and being like,

00:22:09.827 --> 00:22:11.496
just going like,
and just go-- it's just that

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:13.998
it's soaking wet,
is what it is.

00:22:14.031 --> 00:22:15.600
Like, oh, wow.
- Dude, I had a funny one

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:17.502
where I-- tha-- when
I worked at KFMA--

00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:19.537
shoutout KFMA Day in Tucson.
- Doesn't exist.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.705
- (Dan) It's a real thing.
- It's not even

00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:22.374
a real thing at all.
- This girl came

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:24.576
to the radio station,
and I tittyfucked her

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.977
in an office, and then...

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.679
- Under a Jani Lane
Warrant poster.

00:22:27.712 --> 00:22:29.013
- (Nikki laughing)
- (Dan) It was pretty awesome.

00:22:29.046 --> 00:22:30.582
- ♪ Got a picture
of your house ♪

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.117
- It was under
a Hoobastank poster.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.119
- Hell yeah!
- (Nikki laughing)

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:36.721
- And I came, and we cleaned
it up or whatever.

00:22:36.754 --> 00:22:39.157
And I was wearing these,
like, um...

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.860
thin khaki shorts.

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.595
And I went,
and my post-cum

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:46.431 line:0%
had just leaked on me.
(fire crackling)

00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:48.800 line:0%
So you could just see, like,
a puddle of cum

00:22:48.833 --> 00:22:51.636
like where-- where my, like,
soft dick was or whatever.

00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:53.471
And I just walked in,
I was having a conversation

00:22:53.504 --> 00:22:55.774
with all these people in, like,
the fucking cafeteria area.

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.642
And then I left,
and the girl I was with,

00:22:57.675 --> 00:22:59.611
she's like, "I think it looks
like you pissed your pants."

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.112
- Yeah.
- And then I was like,

00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:02.747
they're gonna know that tha--
oh, goddammit.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.182
Oh, goddammit.
Oh, man, I did not--

00:23:04.215 --> 00:23:05.617
- Which is worse.
- Actually, this might

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.051
happen to girls...
- (Dan) Piss.

00:23:07.084 --> 00:23:08.720
- ...on a-- this might
happen to--

00:23:08.753 --> 00:23:11.756
to women on
a much larger level.

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:14.125
Because one of the worst things
too when you fuck,

00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:15.527
and as soon as you
finish fucking,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.895
put your underwear back on
as a guy--

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:18.696
- (Dan) Yeah.
- Sometimes later, you don't

00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:20.632
realize that your,
like, dick hole

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.700
has kinda become, like,
glued to the front of your--

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:24.636
- Yeah. Yeah, that's--
- Ow!

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.037
- It's just, like-- it's just,
like, a quick moment,

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.639
but when it pulls off,
it's like getting your eyebrow--

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:28.907
It's that one moment
of "ooh!"

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.508
- (Nikki) Yeah.
- So I'm saying on a girl level,

00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:32.043
it must-- so--
does it ever get,

00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:33.645
like, where it's almost like--
where it's just kinda like--

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:34.913
- Dried up in there?
- (Jay) Just wet?

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.514
- No, no.
- Not sticks to it?

00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:37.849
- No, we stay-- we st--
we keep it damp down there.

00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:39.584
- So you guys--
- So I don't think it has

00:23:39.617 --> 00:23:41.619
the chance to really...
- You don't papier mache at all?

00:23:41.652 --> 00:23:42.420
- No.

00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:44.088
- It doesn't dry
and then hook in?

00:23:44.121 --> 00:23:45.557
- No.
- (Christine) Well, wouldn't you

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.058
take your underwear off
if they got too wet?

00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:48.526
- (Nikki) Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, like,

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:49.928
if your underwear gets too wet,
you just, like,

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.629
throw 'em in your bag.
- (Dan making whoosh sounds)

00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:53.531
- Yep. Do you ever go to--
- Throw 'em in your bag?

00:23:53.564 --> 00:23:55.467
Get rid of 'em, ya slob!
What're you keepin 'em for?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.569
- No, wash 'em and fucking
wear 'em again later.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:58.970
- Yeah, if they-- yeah.

00:23:59.003 --> 00:24:00.672
If you get, like, turned on.
Do you ever get tur--

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.073
do you ever, like,
talk to a guy

00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:03.241
and you don't even realize
you like him

00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:04.676
till you go
to the bathroom later

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.678
and you're like, whoa,
that was slick.

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:08.646
- Really? That's a thing?
- I swear to God.

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:09.814
- We don't get--
- And I'm, like, whoa,

00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:11.549
what happened up there?
And then I go,

00:24:11.582 --> 00:24:12.917
oh yeah, that one thing
turned me on for a second.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.819
- That's so funny,
we don't get delayed boners...

00:24:14.852 --> 00:24:16.554
- (laughing) Yeah, you don't.
- ...where you're just, like,

00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:19.524
you're just, like, in a cab
and you go, whoa, whoa!

00:24:19.557 --> 00:24:21.659
I was fuckin'...
- Dan was on fire today, huh?

00:24:21.692 --> 00:24:23.962
Dan was m-- I guess he was more
on fire than I knew.

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:25.797
- It's, like, seconds
between the lightning

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.599
and the-- the sound.
- Yeah! (laughter)

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:29.067
It's like thunder and lightning?
- You're like, oh,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.802
it's about three miles away
was when I was turned on.

00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:32.504
- One thou-- one Mississippi...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.506
- ...two Mississippi.
So 30 minutes ago,

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.841
I wanted to fuck him.
- Yes, someone up there said--

00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:39.544
- Did we all learn that
from "Poltergeist"?

00:24:39.577 --> 00:24:40.979
- Oh, is that where
that got started?

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.780
- That's where I heard it
from the first time.

00:24:42.813 --> 00:24:44.649
- (Nikki) Oh, interesting.
- It was count the seconds

00:24:44.682 --> 00:24:46.050
between, like, you know, if
it's getting further or closer.

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:47.685
- (British accent) My mother
taught me that in a--

00:24:47.718 --> 00:24:49.087
- Yeah, I feel like it was
just like a...

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.755
- Well, your mother
learned it from "Poltergeist."

00:24:50.788 --> 00:24:52.156
- (Nikki) Mmm.
- And she tried to pass it off

00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:53.658
like she was a philosopher.
- Stop it.

00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:55.193
She was smoking
a cob pipe.

00:24:55.226 --> 00:24:57.562
- (laughing)
- She told me--

00:24:57.595 --> 00:24:58.997
(British accent)
She told me that astrology

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.765
is next to knowing the gods.
- "Dan, I'm gonna give you

00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:02.800
the only wisdom I have."
- (Dan) She goes--

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.636
- "Count between
the lightning and thunder

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:05.970
and you'll know how close
the storm is."

00:25:06.003 --> 00:25:07.672
- Thermos-- for Thermoses,

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:09.741
use either screwdrivers
or rum and Cokes.

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:11.209
- (Jay laughing)
- And lightning.

00:25:11.242 --> 00:25:12.777
You can count it.
- Oh, good advice

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.612
from your parents--
Do you have to go to break?

00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:16.748
- Yeah, we have to take-- we'll
take our last break, though,

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.917
and then we get to come back
and go t-- the whole way.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.618
- Well, my dad just
recently called me ab--

00:25:20.651 --> 00:25:22.053
Can I just tell this
quick story about...

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:24.155
- (Jay) Mm-hmm, sure.
- ...parent-- parental advice.

00:25:24.188 --> 00:25:26.691
- Apparently, until Thursday,
we play by our own rules here.

00:25:26.724 --> 00:25:27.926
Then they change the system,

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.627
we have to take
hard line commercials.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.629
Jacob says he's terrified.
- Okay, okay.

00:25:31.662 --> 00:25:33.698
When I sense that it's urgent,
I'll-- I'll speed it up.

00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:35.033
Okay.
- No, no urgency here.

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.734
We play by our own rules.
- Well, now I'm just

00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:38.169
gonna really
tuck into this thing.

00:25:38.202 --> 00:25:39.771
- (Dan) Yeah, NPR it.
- Stretch it out.

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:40.939
We don't have to take
commercial breaks at all.

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:43.041
- NPR this shit.
- Um, you know the girl

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.842
that just recently got
into the wrong Uber

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:46.711
and then was murdered?
- Yeah, yeah, down in Carolina?

00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:47.745
- (Jay) Mm-hmm.
- Terrible.

00:25:47.778 --> 00:25:49.781
- Yeah.
- Um, my dad--

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.249
- You didn't have
to disclaimer that.

00:25:51.282 --> 00:25:52.917
He goes, "I'm against that..."
- (Dan) Yeah.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.252
- ..."now."
- Honestly, I think that it

00:25:54.285 --> 00:25:55.687
was really unfortunate.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.121
I do wanna say,
it's the most unlucky day

00:25:57.154 --> 00:25:59.290
of her life and the luckiest day
of that murderer's life.

00:25:59.323 --> 00:26:01.326
- He's like...
- That a-- a girl just--

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:03.127
He-- he happens
to be a murderer,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.629
I don't think
he sought her out.

00:26:04.662 --> 00:26:05.930
I think he was just
drivin' through town,

00:26:05.963 --> 00:26:07.365
a girl got in his car,
and he goes,

00:26:07.398 --> 00:26:09.834
"Well, I guess."
- I mean, from his perspective,

00:26:09.867 --> 00:26:11.235
he really was like,
"Wh-- I mean,

00:26:11.268 --> 00:26:12.637
fate really brought us
together, huh?"

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.005
- Yes, I mean,
that's the thing.

00:26:14.038 --> 00:26:15.707
You can argue fate for all
these things that y--

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.775
are positive in your life.
Like, that's the reason.

00:26:17.808 --> 00:26:20.078
But a guy could justify
murdering someone if he's like,

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:23.047
you know, God show me a sign
that I should not mur--

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.983
like, if I shouldn't murder,
don't give me a sign.

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:27.652
But if I'm meant to--
In his crazy brain,

00:26:27.685 --> 00:26:29.153
boom, there's a sign.
- Well-- yeah.

00:26:29.186 --> 00:26:31.823
- Anyway, my dad calls me
the next day and is like,

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.691
"You heard about this girl?

00:26:33.724 --> 00:26:36.728
You know that I told your mom
that would never happen to you."

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:39.063
I'm like, okay, what's...

00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:42.000 line:0%
"First of all, she was drunk."
Oka-- oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:44.268 line:0%
Um, "but you know better,
you know that--"

00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:47.872
My dad's only advice to me
in self-defense against men is

00:26:47.905 --> 00:26:50.308
if a man gets you in a car--
and it is good advice--

00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:52.010
you gouge his eyes out.
- Nice.

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.846
- Just stick your two fingers
as deep as you can into his eyes

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:56.114
because even if
he crashes the car,

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.849
you have a better chance
of surviving the crash

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.417
than you do
wherever he's taking you.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.853
And it is, like,
statistically accurate.

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:03.321
- That's a smart piece
of advice.

00:27:03.354 --> 00:27:05.390
- It is.
- The ol' Glaser Gouge.

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:07.058
- You find the one guy--
- You go right for the eyes.

00:27:07.091 --> 00:27:09.394
- You find the one guy whose
eyes that you gouged out,

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:10.995
he was taking you to this,
like, beautiful place

00:27:11.028 --> 00:27:12.664
he built for you.
- (Dan) Yeah.

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:14.098
- "I've been in love with you
and I've been

00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:15.867
"writing you letters,
and I thought you corresponded.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.135
I am everything you ever wan--"
- That is the problem.

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.703
- You go, was he handsome?

00:27:18.736 --> 00:27:20.071
You go, when I think about it,
when he had eyes,

00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:21.673
he was pretty handsome.
- Yeah. (laughing)

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:24.242
- Steel-- steel gray eyes.
- They were!

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.910
Crystal blue. Oh, God.

00:27:25.943 --> 00:27:27.879
That was the best thing
about him, goddammit.

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:29.881
- And I could-- I could smell
the warm cum on him.

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.016
- He's showing you
the seventh la--

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:34.285
the seven-story treehouse
he built you.

00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:35.687
Your dream--
- (Nikki) You know what...

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.055
- Your dream enchanted
dream house.

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:38.823
- ...I did love the way
he used to look at me.

00:27:38.856 --> 00:27:40.224
- Yeah, this is...
(laughter)

00:27:40.257 --> 00:27:41.793
- I'll never have that again.
- This is made with

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:44.062
no animal products.
(laughter)

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:45.697
This is all out of the tree
and it's actually...

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.798
- This is all
I've ever wanted!

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.132
- ...it's good for the tree.

00:27:48.165 --> 00:27:50.001
Look, you have your little
joke-writing nook.

00:27:50.034 --> 00:27:52.303
- Oh my God!
- I would-- I would show you,

00:27:52.336 --> 00:27:54.238
but my eyes are gouged out

00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.908
'cause your father
is a boxcar man.

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:58.776
- I'm gonna put my hand
on your shoulder.

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:01.746
Can you-- can you walk me
and assist me in the bathroom?

00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:03.081
- "Now, Nikki--"
It sounds like--

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:04.916
- Can you tell me when
I'm done wiping, Nikki?

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.884
I'm sorry, I know I used to be
very attractive to you.

00:28:06.917 --> 00:28:08.252
But now...
- (Dan) It sounds like advice--

00:28:08.285 --> 00:28:10.455
- Can you tell me, is there
poop on this paper?

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:11.789
(laughter)
- It sounds like--

00:28:11.822 --> 00:28:13.057
it sounds like...
(laughing)

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.926
That sounds like Nikki's advice
her dad gave her

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:17.929
over a can of beans
by a campfire in a junkyard.

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:20.798
He goes, "Now, you ever alone
with a man in a car,

00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:22.934
"gauge his--
gouge his eyes out.

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:24.502
"He's probably from
the government

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.471
or wants something for..."
(laughter)

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.740
- I grew up in
a militia, sorry.

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:30.808
- "Are you done with
your pot of beans?"

00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:32.376
- Like, when do you go
for the gouge, though?

00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:33.978
- Yeah.
- That is the thing.

00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:35.480
Like, when do you go--
- I was so many steps ahead,

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:37.381
I'm like, how does this guy
ever find out

00:28:37.414 --> 00:28:38.983
when he's done wiping if
he doesn't have

00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:42.019
a woman who loves him?
- Y-- yeah, that's a good point.

00:28:42.052 --> 00:28:43.321
- You've embarrassed him
the rest of his life

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:44.756
by gouging his eyes out.

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:46.157
Even when he's in-- sitti--
if he goes

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.959
to prison for what he's done--
- That's why I'm against

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:50.261
violence against men
who are violent against women.

00:28:50.294 --> 00:28:53.064
- Yes, good stance.
- Because he could love you,

00:28:53.097 --> 00:28:56.501
ultimately, and why would you
be hurting a man that w--

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.469
is doing this out
of love, okay?

00:28:58.502 --> 00:29:01.305
- Love. Love.
- So just take it, bitch.

00:29:01.338 --> 00:29:03.107
- (Jay) I mean, you've definit--
- Shut your mouth.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.510
- You've definitely heard
the WorldStarHipHop rants of

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.512
like, a girl taking
the thing to be like,

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.481
"If he don't beat you,
it's 'cause he don't care."

00:29:10.514 --> 00:29:11.849
- (Nikki laughing)
- And they mean--

00:29:11.882 --> 00:29:13.251
they are so dead--
- I know!

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.886
- It's like someone's
telling you flat earth

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:16.187
with, like, a straight face.
- (Nikki) Yeah.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.922
- They go, no--
There's nothing kidding here.

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:19.257
He goes, if he doesn't hit you
it's cause he has

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.458
no passion for you.
- Oh...

00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:21.859
- That's always great
when you see--

00:29:21.892 --> 00:29:23.327
- I cannot make
Christine believe it.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.096
- (Dan) Broken women like that--
- She just calls it "abuse."

00:29:25.129 --> 00:29:26.831
Every time, I'm like,
no, honey...

00:29:26.864 --> 00:29:28.132
- (Nikki laughing)
- ...I'm hitting you

00:29:28.165 --> 00:29:29.433
'cause I'm passionate
about what you're doing.

00:29:29.466 --> 00:29:31.469
This food is cold!
(laughing)

00:29:31.502 --> 00:29:33.538
I'm very passionate
about my food being hot.

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.139
- Yeah! (laughing)
- I'm passionate about

00:29:35.172 --> 00:29:37.208
your culinary skills,
I feel like you're slipping.

00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:38.576
- I'm passionate.

00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.545
What if you have to cook
for a lot of people one day?

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.113
- You won't know the timing
of the dishes!

00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:44.448
- But I just know
that if I ever get murdered,

00:29:44.481 --> 00:29:45.883
my dad is gonna be like,

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:47.285
"She just didn't
gouge his eyes out."

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:49.187
Like, that's gonna be the story.
It's not gonna be like--

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.189
- Or-- or while they're
walking him to the court,

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.291
in the courtroom, your dad is
gonna stand up and go,

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:56.260
"Did she go for your eyes?"
And he'll go, "She did."

00:29:56.293 --> 00:29:57.995
And he's gonna be like,
"I taught her well."

00:29:58.028 --> 00:30:00.464
- (Jay) Or it'd be funny if y--
- "Sleep, my angel.

00:30:00.497 --> 00:30:03.067
Sleep forever, my angel.
She tried!"

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.903
- "Sleep, my angel!"
- In the car accident,

00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:07.471
it'd be funny--
in the car accident,

00:30:07.504 --> 00:30:09.140
Nikki died
but that guy survived.

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:11.275
And when he went to court--
Nikki's dad went to court

00:30:11.308 --> 00:30:12.910
and showed up, and the guy
walked in with the glasses

00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:14.178
and the cane...
- (Nikki) Yes!

00:30:14.211 --> 00:30:15.947
- And he went-- he went,
"She still got him!"

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.316
- Oh my God, that's
a great ending to the story.

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:20.351
- "My baby got him.
My baby got him after all."

00:30:20.384 --> 00:30:23.621
- And then he takes 'em off
and he has Jerry Orbach's eyes.

00:30:23.654 --> 00:30:27.058
- (laughing)
- 'Cause they were donated

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.293
through...

00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:36.067
- Full track suit.
Can't do it.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.935
Oh, man, can't do it.
There's not a chance.

00:30:37.968 --> 00:30:40.538
- Nick Mullen did one yesterday
at The Stand that was impr--

00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:42.473
- Shane's all about it,
he said.

00:30:42.506 --> 00:30:44.942
- Yeah, I can't--
I couldn't--

00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:47.612
Oh, is Christine going
to get soda?

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.213
- Well, well,
guess someone

00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:50.181
thinks they're better
than everybody.

00:30:50.214 --> 00:30:53.050
- Looks like the rats
have fleed the ship.

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:55.219
- Yes, sir, it's what
you think in a track suit.

00:30:55.252 --> 00:30:58.322
It's Mafee from TV's "Billions."
- Hi, how are you?

00:30:58.355 --> 00:30:59.624
Five dollars...
- 'Cause they're staring at us,

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.092
we have to do
a fake kiss now...

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.060
- Yeah.
- ...that they're, like,

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:03.494
that they're watching.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:03.527 --> 00:31:04.629
Wa-- no, you go to the left.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:07.031
(muffled laughter)
Get him.

00:31:07.064 --> 00:31:08.099
(Jay, muffled)
Let go of my shoulder.

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:09.267
Hang on, let go
of my shoulder.

00:31:17.241 --> 00:31:19.143

But, like, the entire desk

(both laughing)

Dude, I looked over my shoulder
and I see...

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.522
if these two were looking,

00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:33.691
and the entire desk
was like...

(laughing)

00:31:38.228 --> 00:31:39.530
- Oh, that's content.
- I don't know.

00:31:39.563 --> 00:31:40.664
For the first time in my life,

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:42.700
I have no idea what to do when
we walk in that door.

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:44.168
- I'll tell you what you do...
(both laughing)

00:31:44.201 --> 00:31:46.370
...you're going right
for the elevator.

00:31:46.403 --> 00:31:48.172
- And everyone tomorrow
forgets it ever happened.

00:31:48.205 --> 00:31:50.107
I didn't think that it's...
- I mean, they got it.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.410

of everybody...

- Holy shit, dude.

00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:55.680
Can we blur things?
You guys film

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:58.950
the people inside looking?
Everyone was looking.

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:00.618
- Damn it.
- I went over your shoulder

00:32:00.651 --> 00:32:02.119
to take a peek.
- Also, I think

00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:04.689
I lost this guy as a fan.
- (laughing)

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.023
- He's that kinda guy
where he goes,

00:32:06.056 --> 00:32:07.024
"I don't want no queer shit."

00:32:07.057 --> 00:32:08.326
- "Yo, fuckin' 'Billions'
into queer shit?"

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.560
- Yo... (laughing)
- Dude, everyone's

00:32:09.593 --> 00:32:11.028
looking at us.

00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:12.296
I don't know what to do, Dan.
- Yeah, let's--

00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:14.165
- I wanna go in
a different entrance.

00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.232
- No, let's just walk in.
- Can we go in

00:32:15.265 --> 00:32:17.468
from Del Frisco's?
I hate this.

00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:19.103
(laughter)

00:32:19.136 --> 00:32:21.439
This is why I would not
be a good impractical joker.

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.640
- Yeah.
- I'd be so bad at it

00:32:22.673 --> 00:32:24.675
'cause I'm all like,
"Can we leave?!

00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:27.478
I wanna leave!"

00:32:27.511 --> 00:32:28.980
- Dude, this is great.

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:32.083
- They are unabashedly
staring at us hard.

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:35.586
- Yeah, let's just walk in
and go to the elevator.

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:36.720
We can do it.
- I don't know what to do.

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.556
My instinct's to throw you
under the bus completely.

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:40.024
I don't know why.
- Yo...

00:32:40.057 --> 00:32:41.092
- That's right, everyone,
it's Dan Soder

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.326
from Showtime's "Billions".

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.063
- You gonna shoot me in the leg
when the zombies are coming?

00:32:46.096 --> 00:32:48.499
- (exhaling) This isn't gonna
make it any better.

00:32:48.532 --> 00:32:52.069
(both chuckling)

00:32:52.102 --> 00:32:54.138
- That's not gonna make it
any better.

00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:57.108
- Def busted.
- You're busted.

00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.144
- Um...

00:33:00.177 --> 00:33:04.081
Come on.

00:33:04.114 --> 00:33:05.750
Please don't make me
go to the desk.

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.118
- Oh, dude.
- I thought my thing

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:10.287
wasn't working.
- Oh, my God.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.057
You know what I like,
is that dude was just, like,

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.493
sitting there staring.
- I mean--

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:17.561
- Like a child of the corn.

00:33:17.594 --> 00:33:19.096
(both laughing)

00:33:19.129 --> 00:33:19.930
- Hey, hey, 'sup, fellas?
- What's up, buddy?

00:33:19.963 --> 00:33:21.031
- Hey, what's up, Jack?
How are you?

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.733
- Don't believe what you hear
about us out there.

00:33:22.766 --> 00:33:23.768
- Yeah.

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.369
We're-- we're straight...

00:33:25.402 --> 00:33:26.637
heteronormative men.
- Yeah, you know what?

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.139
You're right, just go that way.
- Yeah.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.273
- I say just go that way.

00:33:29.306 --> 00:33:32.176
- No? Okay.
We're in trouble.

00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:34.678
I knew it.
I knew our love...

00:33:34.711 --> 00:33:35.713
Dude, that guy's like,

00:33:35.746 --> 00:33:36.781
(deep voice)
"Hey! Hey!

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:38.416
"That's the guy
from 'Billions'.

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:40.184
"What's he doin' out there?
They're probably, like,

00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:42.153
filming some behind the s--
Oh, my God!"

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.721
- "Queerin' off!"
- "Oh, my--"

00:33:43.754 --> 00:33:46.157
- "Oh!"
- "Oh, they're both big!"

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.825
- (laughing)
- "So I imagine it's--"

00:33:47.858 --> 00:33:49.226
- "What a lumbery kiss!"

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:51.095
- "I mean, I imagine
at some point

00:33:51.128 --> 00:33:53.697
it's painful for one
of the two of 'em."

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.433
- "One of the grips
has to hurt."

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:57.802
- "I mean, one is giving,
one's receiving.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.703
Maybe they both do?
Is that true love?"

00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:01.338
- "You think it's
a real tonsil hockey,

00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:02.606
or they're just going
open-mouth?"

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:04.108
- "He's in a sweat suit?"

00:34:04.141 --> 00:34:05.309
Did you guys get--
you got it, right?

00:34:05.342 --> 00:34:07.411
We're g-- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, sorry you have to wa--

00:34:07.444 --> 00:34:09.313
- We're doing a talk show.
- (woman) I-- God,

00:34:09.346 --> 00:34:10.614
I feel like I just walked
into a reality show.

00:34:10.647 --> 00:34:11.615
- This is how we pitch.

00:34:11.648 --> 00:34:13.384
- What's your yearly salary?

00:34:13.417 --> 00:34:15.086
It's called "Personal Questions
in the Elevator".

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.288
- Not enough.

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.756
- How many people
are you seeing currently?

00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:20.758
- Yeah.
Are you an organ donor?

00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:22.793
- Are you currently cheating?
- This is...

00:34:22.826 --> 00:34:24.295
this is the worst elevator
I've ever been on.

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.729
- Who should be president?
- No, this was good.

00:34:25.762 --> 00:34:27.098
We got a lot--
we got a lot done.

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.166
- Is Hannah Gadsby's
special good?

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.302
- What is art?
- (laughing)

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:33.304
- Is art...
- Like, personal questions.

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.438
Is your clit pierced?
- Yeah.

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:37.308
- Okay. You could say no.
- Would you say your fa--

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.343
your relationship
with your father is strong?

00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:43.748
