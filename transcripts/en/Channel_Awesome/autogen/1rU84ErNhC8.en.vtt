00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.290
character which it probably didn't drag
as much because they added that

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.300
as much because they added that
 

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.960
as much because they added that
character in mm-hmm and like I kept like

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:30.970
