&gt;&gt;Lee Stimmel: Hi everyone, thanks for coming
to our ever expanding Performance Art@Google

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.060
series. Today we have a couple dancers from
the New York City Ballet as well as Meghan

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.420
Kent who's gonna moderate the discussion promoting
their performance called Dancers' Choice this

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.420
Sunday at Lincoln Center.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
So Meghan you wanna take it from there?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.420
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Lee Stimmel : Introduce Amanda and Adrian.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Sure.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.109
Hi, I'm Meghan Kent and we're very pleased
to be here today. We have two dancers from

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:40.199
the New York City Ballet, New York City Ballet
Corps de Ballet member, Amanda Hankes, and

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.640
soloist, Adrian Danchig-Waring.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
[applause]

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640
[chuckles]

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.309
So first of all just to get a little background
on your training, kind of how you chose this

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.859
career path, how you ended up to be a professional
dancer what was that like, Amanda do you wanna

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.710
start telling us a little bit about yourself.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.769
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I can start. I actually came
to ballet, my mother was a professional ballet

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.009
dancer briefly and she took me to see the
Nutcracker and the girl playing Clara had

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.549
very pretty hair and I wanted pretty hair
so I said, "Can you sign me up?" And I didn't

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:18.350
end up with the same pretty hair she had but
I'm not sure what she's doing now.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.869
I trained at a school in New Jersey with a
woman named Irine Fokine who was the niece

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.750
of Michael Fokine who was a very prolific
choreographer, contemporary, slightly earlier

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.759
than Balanchine but they did a lot of stuff
around the same time. So she came from a huge,

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.619
heavy duty ballet background and sort of got
me the training that I needed and between

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.360
she and my mother kind of steered me along
the right path to be where I needed to be

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.200
to get the training I needed and get the exposure
that I needed to actually get a job. [chuckles]

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: And how 'bout you Adrian what
was your experience like?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I was just always
dancing and I started doing some Russian folk

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.890
dance. I grew up in San Francisco and I performed
with like a youth company and my parents just

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.569
kinda of kept finding things to satisfy my
sort of unyielding appetite to move.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.879
So I did like Chinese acrobatics with a group
called the Pickle Family Circus and then I

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.290
started doing tap and modern and jazz, and
ultimately I found myself at a studio that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.290
was very focused on ballet. And I had a teacher
who was really tough as nails and he kind

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.849
of insisted that ballet was the backbone of
all other movement, which in a historical

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.530
context may be a fallacy but it appealed to
my mind that there could be some sort of structure

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.819
that you could adhere to always and then divert
from at a later point. So that just kinda

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.319
became my path.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:03.330
So I entered a pre-professional dance program
when I was 13 and I did independent study

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:17.780
high school program so I graduated from high
school when I was 16 and I moved to New York

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.230
and I started working for New York City Ballet.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:31.060
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So at what age for both of
you do you think that you really decided this

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.170
is the career that I wanna pursue?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.270
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I mean I'd say it
was at 13. I think it was sacrificing so much

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:45.090
in the way of sort of traditional academic
path and the socialization that you experience

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:56.640
through that. I don't think I'm lacking for
social skills because of it, but it was definitely

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640
at that point a question mark.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: How 'bout you Amanda?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: It was about 13. I had to
make a decision whether I wanted to start

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
going into New York City for ballet classes
to go to the School of American Ballet which

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640
is a pre-professional school, it's the official
school of the New York City Ballet. And if

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
I was gonna to that classes were gonna be
a lot earlier in the day and I would have

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640
to sort of work my academics around my ballet
schedule. So it was sort of put to me as,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640
"You can do this, but if you're gonna do it
this is where you need to be and this is what

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640
you need to do. So you need to actually make
the decision." And it was right before high

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
school.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Oh. And did either of you know
a lot about New York City Ballet before getting

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.400
into this school or anything? What drew you
to the company?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.780
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I had grown up going to see
New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.810
I was very fortunate that my mom took me to
see pretty much everything dance related in

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.070
New York City growing up, so I was very familiar
with it.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.570
And I chose to go to the School of American
Ballet, well I was accepted into the school

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.110
and it's a school that a lot of companies
draw from, so even if it wasn't gonna be New

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.620
York City Ballet which it actually wasn't
right away I danced with Miami City Ballet

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.450
before I danced with New York City Ballet.
But it was a great place to be seen and get

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.090
exposure.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:57.820
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Just kind of wanna talk about
your daily schedule 'cause it might be a little

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.100
different than a typical work schedule for
some people. Amanda, if you can continue and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.650
tell us about what's a typical day like for
you when we're in season.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.970
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: A typical day in season is
a very, very busy day. It starts out you get

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.140
to the theater probably 9:45, 10 o'clock to
warm up for class; you have daily class which

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.240
when we're performing is an hour long. So
you do that every single morning, or six days

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.990
a week and then you can have anywhere from
an hour of rehearsals to six hours of rehearsals

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.050
and then that'll take you to about six o'clock.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.400
If someone has gotten injured during the day
they will then throw in an emergency rehearsal

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.410
which is about a half an hour, it takes you
to about 6:30 where you've now canceled your

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.740
physical therapy appointment [laughs] and
someone has run to the deli to get you a sandwich

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.100
which you eat while putting on your stage
makeup.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.710
If you have the first ballet, start warming
up probably at about seven, 7:15, although

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.120
if you've been rehearsing 'till 6:30 you can
fudge that a little. [chuckles] And then a

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.300
lot of times when you're working a lot in
the corps you might have all three ballets

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.530
that night.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.600
So if you have the first ballet then you change
your costume, do the second ballet, [chuckles]

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.280
change your costume again, do the third ballet
and then you go home, eat some more food or

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.210
you go out to eat with friends 'cause that
keeps you sane. [chuckles]

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.740
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: There's also so much
adrenaline pumped like you're working like

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.360
your whole day builds to this climax, this
performance, so it's like you can't go home

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.660
and go to bed and prepare for the next day
'cause you're like totally jacked. So you

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.660
kind of need --

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Some wind down time.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.660
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.660
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: [laughs]

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.120
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: But I think that
the company class like taking ballet classes

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.570
every morning is this really unique element
of the ballet dancer's life 'cause everyday

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.630
you return to the ballet barre; you like start
with the basics. So it would be like if every

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:59.620
day in whatever given field you work in you
have to like go back and revisit the a, b,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.850
cs. Like if you work in language in any capacity
it's like really relearning the alphabet and

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.130
establishing it. It is warming up the body
but there is this cultivation of technique

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.480
that kind of is a through-line through your
career. So that is a major and it sets the

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.480
tone for the day.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.870
So you're in and out of rehearsals all day
and New York City Ballet is a repertory company

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:28.530
and we perform up to 65 works in a given season.
So let's say Amanda or I is dancing in 30

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.610
of them over the course of 8 weeks. So like
all of this choreography is like living in

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.880
your body somewhere. We talked a lot about
muscle memory --

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.310
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Which daily class sort of
reminds you of, reminds your muscles of what

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.880
the basic positions are and the steps, but
then you've also got the ballets that the

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.220
sequences of steps that have to go together
and a lot of it never actually makes it to

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.720
your muscles it stays in your brain and hopefully
it gets there when it needs to. [laughs]

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.550
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: It's like you re-establish
that fluency in the morning and then you speak

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.550
it all day.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.810
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: And speaking of company class
do you guys have if you're performing a certain

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.530
role that evening do you have a different
focus during on-class depending on what the

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.970
rest of your day looks like or how do you
approach class, I guess personally?

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:15.690
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I guess it really
depends on like what the role is --

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.690
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Yeah.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.940
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: how physical it is,
if it's a debut, if you have nervous energy.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.880
I think that we have a really hard time pulling
back like we have a really hard time marking

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.950
and so so much of our day is like a 110 percent
all the time.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.130
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I don't have that much trouble
marking. No. [laughs]

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.130
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I don't believe that.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.130
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: [laughs] Sometimes if I see
an --

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.130
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: [chuckles]

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.729
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: opportunity [chuckles] I'll
take it. As far as company class goes if you

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:48.030
have something that is gonna require great
feats of technical wizardry you will work

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.520
a little harder on that during class. If you
have something where you have to do a lot

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.250
of pirouettes or a lot of tricks, what we
would call tricks, which would be very different

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.720
from something that was a more contemporary
or neoclassical piece that was in either barefoot

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.060
or in flat shoes. We don't have a lot of those,
but your weight shift changes, you sort of,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.640
you might start to think about it, you're
more likely to think about it while you're

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.620
warming up for the show to sort of tailor
whatever your warm-up is to what you need

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.970
to do that night.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.340
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Also something interesting
that Amanda touched on and that is like in

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.840
a given performance, one of us might dance
three separate roles in three separate ballets

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.900
by three different choreographers that were
made over the course of 60 some odd years.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:38.240
So it's this kind of incredible like quick
transition from one idiom to the other. Like

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.520
you often find yourself doing some jazzy Jerome
Robbins things like West Side Story Suite,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.170
and then you have to go put on a leotard and
tights and be a prince, and then you close

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:57.450
out the evening doing some sort of Fred Astaire
inspired soft shoe finale. So it's like this

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.450
roller coaster.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.450
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Frantic.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.450
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.320
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: It's completely [laugh].
You could have three different types of shoes

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.990
that you're wearing which affects how you
move and three different characters. I think

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:12.840
I had one show where I had five different
characters, it was one of those like West

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.840
Side Story,typic, fancy-free and I mean by
the end of the night you're not really sure

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
what just happened. [laughs]

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.610
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So you probably have a lot
of, you're able to kind of jump around too

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.730
in the rehearsal process. I mean your whole
day you could go from doing one style to the

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.830
next to the next. Could you tell us a little
bit about the rehearsal process at New York

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.640
City Ballet. How do you learn a ballet that
you've never done before, one that's been

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.170
in the repertory for a long time?

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.330
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: There are ballet
masters on staff who are each responsible

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:53.950
for a given allotment of works. So you go
into the studio and whoever's in charge of

00:10:53.950 --> 00:11:03.910
X Balanchine ballet knows it, like, intrinsically,
like knows every role for every person in

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:10.660
a cast of 45. And so they, I guess they really
decide how much rehearsal needs to be had,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.820
like how much time needs to be allocated in
order to get everyone doing what they need

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.890
to do.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:26.100
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Exciting, ever changing. I
mean I think that's something with our company

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.100
because we do our repertory one night we'll
have three different ballets as opposed to

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.710
some other companies where they'll do a run
of Sleeping Beauty for two weeks and then

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:38.220
a run of another ballet for two weeks. It's
really mixed up really; good challenge for

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.220
you guys.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.770
So how often, what about a new ballet when
someone's choreographing on you? I know that

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:48.410
Adrian you've got some experience with that.
What's that experience like and how does that

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.470
differ from regular repertory?

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.900
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I mean I think one
of the most exciting things about New York

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:00.320
City Ballet is that there's this legacy of
Balanchine and Robbins sharing this company,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.710
sharing these dancers and making new works
in a sort of unprecedented volume, and so

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.450
there continues to be a heavy investment in
new works.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:15.660
Some seasons we'll do seven new commissions,
some seasons one or two, but I definitely

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:21.710
feel that it accelerates your understanding
of self as a dancer being in the studio with

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:28.730
dance makers, being able to sort of collaborate
in the creative process. And it's definitely

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:35.130
personally the most fulfilling time that I
have sort of learning like experimentation

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:43.500
and trial and error, you feel safe 'cause
there aren't any existing restrictions except

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.500
the self-imposed ones.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.140
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: How 'bout you Amanda, how do
you feel about that?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.380
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: It's a different process
than trying to learn a ballet that's already

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.770
been choreographed. Some choreographers come
in very prepared, they know exactly what they

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:05.720
wanna try out that day and that is always
sort of delightful [chuckles] as a dancer

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.810
because they can actually then tell you what
they want and if it doesn't work out they'll

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.131
go home and rethink it and come back. It's
rare for a choreographer to come in with that

00:13:13.131 --> 00:13:20.180
clear of an idea. Most of the time they come
in with sort of a sketch in their mind and

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:27.160
there's a lot more back and forth of communication
trying to figure out what exactly they're

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.340
trying to get out of you. I find that to be
sort of a frustrating experience.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.250
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I mean it's interesting.
Again it sort of illuminates this polarity

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:42.160
that exists in that much what we do is repertory
it's like learning existing information and

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.540
assimilating it muscularly, physically as
quickly as possible and then getting it on

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:56.020
stage, and then this other part is the more
sort of like artistic, indulgent element.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.839
I just think that swinging back and forth
like the pendulum from one to the other is

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:04.190
sometimes really difficult thing to bridge
like on a five minute break between rehearsals

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.370
to sort of go from one mode to the other.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:17.840
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Now let me ask you too when
you're learning a ballet that's been in the

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.730
repertory for a while, say it was choreographed
in the '50s. You say you watch video tapes

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.730
and you have ballet masters. How much of yourselves
are you able to put into that role?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.640
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: It really depends
on the role. I think for like corps de ballet

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.620
things you often, it's about getting in line
and making the line like the physical line

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:38.600
from like head to toe, and soloists and principal
roles depending give you a lot more room for

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:45.160
character development, a lot more room for
explorations of the physical dynamic that

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.080
exists in whatever idiom you're working.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.190
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I sort of disagree that in
the corps there's no room for that. I think

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.800
the staying in line becomes second nature,
it becomes something that you just sort of

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.900
automatic, well you should automatically do.
You have peripheral vision and if it's your

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.940
first time in a ballet you're gonna be a little
more aware of everybody else. But if it's

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.740
a ballet you've been doing for awhile there
can be a lot of freedom in that. That's sort

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:17.170
of the beauty of some of the choreographers
that we perform the Robbins' work and the

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.190
Balanchine work specifically. The Robbins'
work there's sort of a lot of freedom for

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.000
self expression and to associate with other
dancers on stage. The Balanchine work a little

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.399
bit less so, but there is enough freedom in
the choreography that you can sort of have

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:37.460
your own personality, musicality is trickier
to play with when you're dancing in the corps,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:44.600
but when you're on your own there's a lot
you can do. I don't find it as stifling I

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600
think as you [laughs],

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.660
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I accept that, I
accept what you're saying.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.660
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent and Amanda Hankes: [laughing]

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.410
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I think there's room
for growth in that way, I don't necessarily

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.110
think it's encouraged.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.890
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: No it's not encouraged. [laughs]

00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:02.870
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Dancers' Choice Program, can
you tell us a little bit about the history

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.140
of it? This is gonna be the third Dancers'
Choice Program, Adrian do you wanna start?

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.880
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah, so Dancers'
Choice is this really interesting opportunity

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:18.690
and challenge for us. It is traditionally,
the model of it is this that our Ballet Master

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:25.520
and Chief, Peter Martins, asks a dancer to
program and organize an entire evening's program,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.810
like an entire evening at the ballet as a
fund raiser for Dancers' Emergency Fund. And

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.149
the last two years have been singular, or
the last two installments were just single,

00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:41.680
principal dancers and this year we were asked
to co-chair this event which means overseeing

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.750
every creative element of it and promotional
element of it: advertising, marketing, I mean

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:55.920
working with it with the various divisions
of the company but also fund raising and a

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920
lot of hidden responsibilities. [laughs]

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.420
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent and Amanda Hankes: [laughs]

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:05.550
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: And so we decided,
I mean for a number of reasons we decided

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.050
that we would kind of try to launch this some
sort of guerrilla advertising campaign, the

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:16.550
major motivator being that we had no budget.
So we thought how brilliant would it be if

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.339
we just like canvassed Lower Manhattan with
red pointe shoes. And that turned into this

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:27.900
notion to make like a promo film of that process.
I mean it's very tongue in cheek, obviously.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.840
That this girl gang of ballerinas gets out
of their working day of 12 hours of dancing

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840
and dances some more.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.090
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: They're unwinding.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.970
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: They're unwinding.
So we got in touch with some friends who make

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.830
film and kind of cultivated this and this
is the outcome of it and the hope would be

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.590
that it could sort of have the capacity to
be some viral video somewhere in order to

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:57.190
stimulate younger interest in what we're doing.
'Cause we very much feel connected to this

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:03.270
legacy, this house that Balanchine built and
consistently ask ourselves like why we struggle

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:09.450
to motivate our contemporaries to see why
it's so compelling, why it's so relevant still.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.640
So this is an attempt at sort of bridging
that distance.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.530
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: And you mentioned the Dancers'
Emergency Fund, can you tell us a little bit

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.910
about that, the history about that, Amanda?

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.060
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Dancers' Emergency Fund was
something that was set up to sort of help

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.120
out dancers if they find themselves needing
some financial assistance outside of our salary

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.590
or paycheck for something that's gone on in
their life. And it has proven to be a very

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:42.210
useful tool; several dancers have used it
for things that really just reach beyond what

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.410
we make as artists, it's a short career, and
it's an artistic career and very not for profit

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:52.290
[chuckles] so the fund was set up for that
and then the fundraiser came afterwards. The

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.550
fund has been around I think a lot longer
than Dancers' Choice has and they --

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.020
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: 1980 it was set up by Jerome
Robbins. Yeah.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.380
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Thank you.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.400
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: [laughs]

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.730
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: And so then this performance
became attached to it and turned out to be

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:15.690
very successful as far as raising money for
that fund. So it's doing very well.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.010
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: It sounds like a thrilling
opportunity for you both, but you also mentioned

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.910
some unexpected challenges and responsibilities.
Can you talk about some of those?

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:28.130
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah, the most active
one [chuckles] today is that we shot a documentary

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.410
that will screen the night of this performance.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:37.220
But going back in time to give you some context,
one of the big elements of this program is

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.160
that it provides an opportunity for young
dancers to step into roles they otherwise

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.510
wouldn't have the opportunity to dance yet.
So in our casting and our programming that

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.550
was very much at the forefront of our minds.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.530
And so we decided to undertake a film tracing
one of our sort of preeminent ballerinas,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:59.370
Wendy Whelan, casting and coaching a young
woman in one of her significant roles and

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.870
we wanted to capture that. We also wanted
to tie it into this sort of broad theme of

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:09.270
the evening which is an exploration of the
importance of the muse in the creation of

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.691
dance works, whether that be between choreographers
and composers or whether that be between dancers

00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:23.070
and dance makers. So we shot this film, this
sort of mini doc, a couple weeks ago and this

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.110
gets to the meat of it.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:31.299
The editors were traveling to Hong Kong for
work immediately after shooting, like several

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:35.770
hours after shooting. So they took all the
footage with them and had 10 days to edit

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:41.440
while in Hong Kong and then upload the file
to Dropbox for me. And they couldn't find

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.270
a fast enough Internet connection in Hong
Kong which is weird because it's Hong Kong.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.270
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent and Amanda Hankes: [laugh]

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.150
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: And now they are
backpacking in Thailand with a laptop under

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:57.160
their arm trying to find some way to upload
this film that will take less than 40 hours

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.740
in an Internet cafe. So we're cautiously optimistic
that we'll wind up with some content.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.740
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: We have 15 hours left --

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.740
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Fifteen hours left
to upload yeah.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.740
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: they're in the middle of
it.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.250
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: They're in 15 hours
left of a 40 hour --

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.530
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: We're hoping it comes through
by Sunday. [laughs]

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.500
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: It must be DSL.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.860
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So now with New York City Ballet's
repertory we have wide, vast, many pieces

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.929
to choose from. How on earth did you pick
what pieces you wanted to show for this program?

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:27.280
What was the process like?

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.360
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I had sat on a committee
for the first Dancers' Choice so I sort of

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.720
knew what was going to get poo-pooed [laughs]
and also there is an enormous, active rep

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.590
list like you said and it's daunting 'cause
then there has to be rehearsal time and dancers

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:51.059
donate their rehearsal time, ballet masters
donate their rehearsal time, everything gets

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:56.940
donated so everyone's doing it for free and
you kind of hope to tailor it a little bit

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.941
to alleviate some of the workload if you can.

00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:01.550
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Great incentives
for people.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:06.600
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Yeah. And we were actually
very lucky that this year in the spring season

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.880
were a lot of the ballets that sort of tied
into this idea that Adrian came to me with

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.381
which was this notion of the muse and how
can we at least try to make a cohesive evening,

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:25.140
put together a program that's not just a bunch
of excerpts and snippets which sort of is

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:31.530
like a bad tasting menu to quote a recent
reviewer [chuckles]. But to actually put together

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:38.110
an evening with a really good program that
was a pretty broad sampling of what we do.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.150
And so we came up with a couple ballets. We
started with a huge dream list [chuckles]

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.150
go big --

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.951
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Like all the ballets
that we always try to see from the audience

00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:52.570
if we can. It was like what are the ballets
like I just can't live without? Like what

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.809
are the reasons I'm here doing this thing?
And so that was a really massive list luckily.

00:22:57.809 --> 00:22:59.170
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: [chuckles]

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.530
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: And then we sort
of wheedled it down --

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.570
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: You weed it down by picking
like who you would envision casting in these

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.549
roles which is a huge incentive to even say
yes to Dancers' Choice because you are always

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:14.690
wanting to get your hands on the casting choices.
[chuckles] So we actually had that opportunity.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.860
And you're casting sort of affects that you
can't cast the same person in all six ballets

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.970
because they would be exhausted. So that sort
of tweaks your list a little bit and I think

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.370
at our first meeting with Peter he looked
at what we wanted at our proposed program

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:35.510
and said, "You have seven Stravinsky ballets
on here which we hadn't really noticed. Stravinsky

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.510
can be a little hard on the ears sometimes.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.510
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: They're amazing.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.690
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: [laughs] They're amazing
ballets and the music's amazing and for us

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.230
it's like home but if you're not used to seeing
neoclassical --

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.590
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Or hearing.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:50.570
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: or hearing neo-classical
Stravinsky ballets, seven in a row [chuckles]

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.410
would be really hard on the audience. So that
sort of shaped our ?

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.650
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Highly immersive
is what I would call it.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.590
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Highly. [laughs] That shaped
some of our programming.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.630
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah. So ultimately
we came up with something that we really felt

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:07.490
like tied into this narrative of exploring
the importance of these muse relationships.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:13.940
So we're opening the evening with Apollo which
is a Balanchine masterpiece which quite literally

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:21.940
tells this story of a young disaffected demigod
finding his muse. And in this way because

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.960
it's a story, although an abstracted story,
it honors the inheritance of ballet which

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.760
was very much a storytelling art form sort
of through the early operatic versions in

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.820
the 16th century.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.130
And then we wanted to sort of look at more
modern iterations of this relationship. So

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:47.330
to us the most pertinent example of that was
Wendy Whelan, this ballerina working with

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.919
Christopher Wheeldon, who was the resident
choreographer of the company for seven years

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:55.220
and continues to make work nearly every year
for us.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:03.450
And so we put on a program, the second act
will be all pas de deux, so male/female duets.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:08.900
Because so much of Balanchine's work really
and Robbins' work and Wheeldon's work highlights

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:15.020
the dynamic between men and women in space.
Like you strip people down to the barest essential

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:23.970
clothing that our Victorian sensibilities
allow and you see what happens. So you remove

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:30.510
all these trappings, all the sort of Baroque
frills of ballet's story and you just have

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:37.440
the human story and so that's what this second
act is all about. So it's about the human

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:44.500
form as a mechanical instrument and man exploring
woman in this way which you see so much in

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.970
these black and white ballets of Balanchine's,
these neo-classical works.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:55.150
And then we're closing it, the evening, with
Rubies which is a Balanchine/Stravinsky collaboration

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:02.080
that really takes New York as its inspiration.
So it honors Stravinsky, genius of Stravinsky,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.470
and there's this great Balanchine quote that
I will misquote for you now, or maybe paraphrase

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:13.960
wrongly. And that is something to the effect
that like he kind of discounted, humbled himself

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.679
about his genius saying that like what I do
is just translating music. All I do is translate

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:25.100
the musical score into movement. But the real
genius lies in the composer, the real genius

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:31.000
lies in this person who's able to take from
nothing to pull from the ether, melody. And

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.120
so we wanted to respect that and also highlight
that Rubies is just this amazing work, this

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.030
amazingly dynamic work that's like sexy and
fresh as the day it was made and all about

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.300
New York and all about American promise.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:53.220
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Now when you touched a little
bit on the casting I think in another unique

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.640
thing with this program as you mentioned,
I mean almost all the dancers are going to

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.100
be in debut roles for this, can you talk a
little bit about that? How you chose who would

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.700
dance what for this program?

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.270
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: There were definitely some
people that I had been dying to see in some

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:12.860
roles over the years so it became sort of
an opportunity to do that. Sean Suozzi's gonna

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.940
be doing the lead in Rubies and I am so excited.
He is a fantastic dancer, very dynamic, very

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.419
energetic, and I think will fit the role like
a glove. So we're very excited to see that.

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:30.320
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So when the audience goes and
see this program what do you think they're

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:37.840
gonna see that's gonna be different than going
to a regular repertory performance? What can

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.860
they expect by going to this performance?

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.460
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: [chuckles] Well I think that
they'll see a very cohesive evening with a

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.429
really good program and hopefully it is a
program that will appeal to a younger audience

00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:57.760
and they will see that it's not all pink tutus
and Black Swan [laughs] and that there's a

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.660
lot more to what we do that's interesting
and dynamic and inspiring.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.290
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I also think because
it's like by the dancers for the dancers there's

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:16.049
a really palpable energy that surrounds it,
that surrounds the rehearsal process now that

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:21.030
I think will really culminate in this performance.
So I think that there's, it's hard to put

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.280
into words, but I think that there's just
such an investment of time and energy and

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.630
it's such an opportunity for all these dancers
who are stepping onto the stage in these roles

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:34.660
for the first time, that it's kind of like
being in the audience for this program is

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:43.160
like being present at the, I don't know, like
the make or break moment of an artist's development.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:55.160
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: And now dancers are also involved
in other ways as well for this program correct?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.940
Can you talk about a little bit of the other
things that they've done. I mean Adrian you've

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.960
done the logo, the Make Your Move --

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Yeah --

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: you wanna talk about that?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I cut the stencils
--

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.960
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: [laughs]

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: [laughs] and Mark,
our company's designer and I worked on the

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.950
Dancers' Choice logo which is the Apollo image.
We have Janie Taylor, who's a principal dancer

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:17.830
who styled the girls for this video and also
contributed photographs, both she and Wendy

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:26.530
Whelan are really into Hipstamatic photography
in quotes so we've issued a series of postcards

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.530
of their work collaboratively.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:34.630
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: We had a lot of people help
us dye red pointe shoes because we had hundreds

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.530
of pairs [laughs] and that's everybody's old,
used pointe shoes that we started collecting

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:45.680
a couple months ago and so there were a lot
of those to spray. People have helped out

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680
--

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: How long did that take to dye
all of these?

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.250
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: You do it on your hour off
or if you only have the last ballet you run

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.870
up to the spray room with a can of spray paint,
so we did it over the course of two or three

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.650
weeks, but then they all had to have ribbons
on them. We cut the ribbons off our pointe

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:05.799
shoes when they're used to reuse them, so
we had 200 pairs of pointe shoes with no ribbons,

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:10.200
how are we gonna tie them together so we put
ribbons back on [chuckles] which seemed really

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200
counterproductive [laughs].

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Do you guys have any questions
--

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Job creation.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.200
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: [laughs]

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: do you have any questions for
our artists while they're here?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200
Yeah.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200
&gt;&gt;female #1: So you said those two [inaudible]
inspired you [inaudible].

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.460
&gt;Meghan Kent: Just so everybody can hear,
what are the shows that everybody can see?

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:34.679
What are the shows that, ballets that you
love and that you wanna put out there?

00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:39.080
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I mean I think that's,
in my mind they're mostly Balanchine works,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.500
Stravinsky Violin Concerto, Agon, Apollo --

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.950
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Serenade --

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.400
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Serenade --

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.340
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Serenade definitely.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.020
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Episodes. These things
just like, it's also hard for us to put them

00:30:53.020 --> 00:31:02.370
in their historical context but they still
just feel so incredibly visionary. And I think

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.200
that those are the works that really stand
out in my mind as always, and always offering

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.850
something to the dancers who inhabit them.
So you always see they push people in ways

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.919
that not everything does. So like when you're
present in those moments of performance, as

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:24.880
dancer or as audience, there are always some
wildcards and I think that's the beauty of

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.750
dance so much of the time is that it's all
this preparation, all this tireless work,

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.510
and at the end of the day it's for like this
very ethereal, fleeting product, like that

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:41.140
moment on stage and a feeling. So I think
that those works really embody that.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.770
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: We're very lucky to be in
a company where the bulk of what we do is

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:52.640
really, really spectacular. To have these
works available to us is kind of a gift. There

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.020
are a couple doozies but there really aren't
that many. [laughs] We're very fortunate to

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.530
be able to out every night and do great ballets.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.220
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: And I guess just for some of
you who may not have seen the company yet,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:10.059
can you in just a couple quick words how would
you describe the aesthetic of New York City

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:12.340
Ballet, just for someone who hasn't seen us
before?

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:24.030
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Long, lean, exacting,
voluminous, dynamic --

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.830
[laughter]

00:32:28.830 --> 00:33:12.030
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Any other questions from the
audience? Yeah.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:21.990
&gt;&gt;female #2: It's just so fun to have you
here [inaudible] You talked about Black Swan

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.990
I'm sure you get this question all the time
[inaudible] you kind of mentioned it with

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.120
a bad connotation. I'm thinking that probably
[inaudible]

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.150
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Just so everybody could hear
too just the impact that Black Swan, the movie,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.150
had and the effects of it.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.150
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I think our spring season
last year sold very, our winter season, it

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.919
was our winter season, sold very, very well.
We had a run of Swan Lake that season that

00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:32.929
we actually ended up adding shows because
there was such a demand. So the exposure was

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.929
great --

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:35.710
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Right. And people
calling in asking when Natalie Portman was

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:36.710
on stage.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.710
[laughter]

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:43.190
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: So there was a lot of misinformation
out there, but all press is good press to

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.190
some degree [chuckles].

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:49.539
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: It's true, I mean
I think to bring ballet back towards the mainstream

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:54.620
in any way is a boon to us.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.620
So we're still trying, we're trying to figure
out how to ride that wave 'cause like so much

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.360
media right it's just like a flash in the
pan, it's an Oscar season and then it's like

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.430
moving on to the next thing.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.640
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: But if it brings people in
and gets them interested then I think it's

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640
really good.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.249
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: Can I say something?

00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:11.249
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Yeah, of course.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:14.710
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I think it's really
interesting what you're saying about attending

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:20.099
the ballet and that much of it stems from
the fact that you were brought up doing that.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:23.879
Like that your parents passed that on to you
and this is a really interesting question

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:28.819
that we're always asking is like, "How do
create that familiarity, how do you give someone

00:34:28.819 --> 00:34:34.460
that context to appreciate this very rarefied
art form?"

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.839
male #1: [inaudible]

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:53.999
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So in terms of the marketing
and Facebook you use social media what worked,

00:34:53.999 --> 00:34:55.329
what didn't, what did you learn from this?

00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:58.640
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I mean in terms of
marketing we see the ticket sales as they

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.690
stand right now are about twice what they
were at this point for the previous Dancers'

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:08.089
Choice. So that's something, it's really hard
to trace the direct correlation between these

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:14.119
things. I think that I've definitely seen
a lot of like at New York City Ballet Twitter

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:20.869
feeds photos of red pointe shoes up in So
Ho and Lower East Side so people are aware,

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:26.650
maybe slightly more aware that this is happening.
It's hard --

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.609
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Facebook and Twitter have
been huge places for us to sort of get out

00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:36.279
and be seen. We've had to learn how to Twitter
[laughs] some of it is new to us 'cause we

00:35:36.279 --> 00:35:44.150
spend a day in the theater [laughs] not in
front of a computer. So there's been a learning

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:49.039
curve for that but it has proven to be, as
far as exposure goes and bringing in people

00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:53.650
who had no idea what you were doing or what
you were up to, it seems to have generated

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:59.499
a lot more interest with a different demographic.

00:35:59.499 --> 00:36:06.619
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Questions? Yes.

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:11.960
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.450
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: In the Courts at
Versailles --

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.069
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: [chuckles] bringing --

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:22.650
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: maybe not of the
masses right so I guess it was never a populist

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:28.329
thing. I think that if you, I don't know,
I think that the most palpable sense of ballet

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:34.079
being in the mainstream was very much embodied
by Baryshnikov in the '70s and '80s. I think

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:39.160
that because he had this sort of crossover
appeal with Hollywood, made a couple films,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:47.630
impregnated actresses, and it seems like it's
a successful path 'cause it's yeah, yeah.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:54.099
So I think that there is, I think that that's
the sort of the peak of it when people were

00:36:54.099 --> 00:37:08.150
like lining up in the subway tunnels at Lincoln
Center to buy tickets to see Nureyev and Fontaine.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:16.809
It's interesting 'cause I think ballet very
much relies on this codified language so the

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:21.719
syllabus that can be used like the steps that
can be used, there's this Balanchine quote

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:27.200
that something to the effect that there are
no new steps just new combinations of steps,

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.099
and I think there are no, I wanna say there
are no new words, but there are 'cause we

00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:38.530
keep changing the dictionaries. I think that
the sensibility can change, I think that at

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:42.930
the end of the day that the--

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:49.819
format needs to remain intact. I don't necessarily
think that needs to be your traditional opera

00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:57.329
houses, I don't think that necessarily needs
to be --

00:37:57.329 --> 00:38:03.799
I mean there are so many constraints, right.
There's the pointe shoe, there's this vocabulary,

00:38:03.799 --> 00:38:10.799
I don't know like the more I try to answer
this question the more I feel like it's unanswerable.

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:13.969
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: I think the art form has
changed, I think as the art form has evolved

00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:20.359
the audience has evolved a little bit. We've
seen examples of where Broadway shows have

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:25.150
been hugely successful, so ballet companies
try to do stuff that's more Broadway oriented,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:31.359
and while it may initially sell tickets what
I think they're finding is happening is that

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:36.480
they've done something, I don't wanna slam
Broadway, but I think they feel like they

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.140
dumbed it down for the audience and then the
audiences don't come back they just come for

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:46.680
that one show. But they've found where if
you have a really good, cohesive program that

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.779
brings people back to the theater. So I think
programming is a big thing, I think getting

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:53.450
the word out, I think sort of --

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.359
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: It's like, it's a
question of the commercialization of a rarefied

00:38:57.359 --> 00:39:03.599
art and I think that there need to be concessions
made if this specific art is to stay alive,

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:07.430
and I don't necessarily know what that means
from a dancer's perspective I don't know what

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:16.049
that means, but I think that there do, we
do need to incorporate a greater awareness

00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:21.039
of what audiences want and what they're willing
to pay for.

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:23.700
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Yes, one more.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.700
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.829
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Ah.

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:26.829
&gt;&gt;[inaudible]

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:34.869
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: So what's next after your performing
career, what do you see for yourselves? Has

00:39:34.869 --> 00:39:37.529
this experience impacted you any?

00:39:37.529 --> 00:39:45.960
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: To a degree. I used
to have a lot of anxiety about this and like

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:52.529
I have less and less, I don't know why. 'Cause
I'm like my life is so structured I kinda

00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:56.160
look forward to a moment of uncertainty.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.420
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Look forward to a nap. [laughs]

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.420
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: [laughs]

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.920
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Yeah, it's a very anxiety
inducing question it's something we all deal

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.969
with, but because of the threat of injury
it's not like you can, I mean you should plan

00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:16.710
for it absolutely, you should try to get your
ducks in a row as you get older, but you could

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.730
also turn around and have an injury tomorrow
that ends your career. So it's a very scary,

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:25.339
it's a scary reality.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:31.029
This has probably shaped my, this experience
has probably shaped my transition plans a

00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:38.069
little bit just to sort of see what goes into,
see what actually goes in to putting a ballet

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:45.039
up on its feet or marketing an evening. You
think you wanna transition into the ballet

00:40:45.039 --> 00:40:50.589
world, you're not quite sure, and it sort
of has exposed us to all the different maybe

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:53.031
opportunities or possibilities that are out
there.

00:40:53.031 --> 00:40:57.950
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: I do think though
that like whatever I know I personally do

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:02.849
after dancing it will involve going back to
school and sort of learning a new skill set

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:09.140
'cause I feel like that's what feeds me. I
don't necessarily think that like transitioning

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:18.880
to another element, another role in the ballet
establishment is right for me, but I really

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880
can't say at this time.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.049
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Anything else you guys wanna
say?

00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:22.059
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: No, thank you guys
for your --

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:23.059
&gt;&gt;Amanda Hankes: Thank you.

00:41:23.059 --> 00:41:24.059
&gt;&gt;Adrian Danchig-Waring: afternoon interest.

00:41:24.059 --> 00:41:25.059
[applause]

00:41:25.059 --> 00:41:26.059
&gt;&gt;Meghan Kent: Thank you.

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:26.060
