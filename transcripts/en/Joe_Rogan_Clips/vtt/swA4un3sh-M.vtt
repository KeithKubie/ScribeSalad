WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.710
Uh,
I became aware of you,

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:06.711
like many people did with the infamous Halloween costume incident at Yale.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.730
Uh,
where,
uh,

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.200
explain that for people who don't know what happened cause it was kind of a

5
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.640
crazy scene.
It went national.
Yes,
it was a moment when,
uh,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.570
around the country,

7
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:23.100
many students were struggling with how to balance a conflicting,
um,

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.380
sort of needs a little bit closer,
conflicting needs.
Uh,

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.840
uh,
how on the one hand to create an environment in schools where people,

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.790
everyone sort of felt welcome as we've democratized,
uh,

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.770
admissions to our American universities as I think we should have.

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.520
People from all walks of life have started moving into these institutions,

13
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.940
claiming them for their own,
which I think is appropriate.
But at the same time,

14
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.200
these institutions had wonderful heritage is of commitment to free expression

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.750
and open debate and,
um,

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.990
and reason as a principal for resolving our differences and us and some of those

17
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.470
values came into tension.

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.400
And so around the country there was a lot of heat about this.

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
And I happened to walk into a propeller,
uh,
myself and,
um,

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
and wound up,
um,
in some challenging circumstances.

21
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.740
And,
um,
you know,
I,
I,
it was not,

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.390
it was not the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
but,
you know,

23
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.800
it was in the top 10,
uh,
challenging moments I've had in my life,
let's say.
Yeah,

24
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.010
that's a very lawyer like way of describing exactly what happened.

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.610
I mean,
the thing is,
I,
you know,
I,
I,
I,
you know,
I struggle.
I mean,

26
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.100
you can tell the story if you want and then I can correct things.

27
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:46.101
But here's the thing is it's my job to be a teacher and I have taken

28
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.630
responsibility for teaching young people.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.460
And it is the case that many people lost their minds.

30
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.120
I mean,
lost their senses.
And,
and,
and the faculty too,
incidentally,
I mean,

31
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.750
you know,
the,
it's one thing to talk about people in there,
in college age people,

32
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.010
but then,
you know,

33
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:05.100
the faculty also didn't necessarily do what they should've done,
but,
um,

34
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.990
but the thing is,
is that,
you know,
my commitment,

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.930
my commitment is to,
is to teaching more generally.

36
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.860
And I don't want to be defined by that event.
I don't want that to become a,

37
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620
the most important thing about me.
You know,

38
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:21.300
I have this book or this book that we're going to talk about that is an

39
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.870
important thing in my life.
Instantiates my values.

40
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.540
It talks about what I think is important about the world.
So,

41
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.110
so I'm trying to be balanced about it.
Just,
it's one thing that happened.

42
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.660
I did my best.
It's in the past.
Let me,

43
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.670
let me help out here because you're being so nice about the whole thing.
Um,

44
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.490
so people know what we're talking about.
There was a,

45
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.830
an incident that was captured on someone's cell phone where you were standing in

46
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.080
people,
it was an hour of footage,
five or six different angles.

47
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.400
So a clip went viral.

48
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:55.230
But I want to emphasize that there were many people filming that day and an hour

49
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.840
or more of the two or three hours I was out there as available.

50
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.040
But I'm glad that you had the

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 1>courage to do that though,
to stand out there and talk to those kids.</v>

52
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.100
But some of them were clearly,

53
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.150
there's something that happens when people become extremely self indulgent when

54
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.040
they know that they have this platform and they,
uh,

55
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.710
have someone who is in a position of authority and they get to hamstring them in

56
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.350
front of the public.
And that's what I felt was going on.

57
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
Just my understanding of human nature.
I knew what she was doing,

58
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.260
what she was doing by shouting and screaming,
this is our fucking home.
You know,

59
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.870
uh,
you know,
we were supposed to be safe here.
I was like,
oh,

60
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.704
I see what's going on.

61
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.150
She's throwing up the flag of virtue for all of her friends to see how amazing

62
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.330
she was.
So she's putting on a show.
Uh,
people do that.
It's,
it's,

63
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.040
it's human nature.
You handled it admirably.
You stood there and you,

64
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.230
you just listened to her and you never yelled back and you never raise your

65
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.270
voice and you remain calm.

66
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:57.271
But that sort of environment where the children,

67
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.270
and I want to say children,
they're basically adults,
but acting like children.

68
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.390
This is one of the ironies of the people that age,
you know,

69
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.360
can fight in wars as lose their lives.

70
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.910
And so I think it's a,

71
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.300
it's a difficult challenge because on the one hand it's right and appropriate to

72
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.020
hold people responsible for their actions.
Certainly if you're 20 years old,

73
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:19.870
you're an adult,
you're still growing,
you're still changing,

74
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:20.650
you're still learning.

75
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.650
I'm not the same man I was when I was 20 but you have to be responsible for your

76
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.440
behavior.
Yes.
I don't think you get a total pass either.
It's hard.
No,

77
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.740
you do not get a total pass.
And you know,

78
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.950
for folks who don't have a 20 year old in their life and don't remember what it

79
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:43.080
was like,
you know,
you're not a fully formed thing yet.
You're,

80
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:46.690
you're filled with chaos,
emotions and hormones and,

81
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.350
and then you're at school and you're probably away from the instructions of your

82
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:57.640
parents for the first time and you know,
you're cutting loose and trying out new,

83
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.140
new ways of communicating that way.
It's a lot of,
it's a mess.

84
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.350
But most people felt horrified watching that,

85
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.110
that you were subjected to that when you're being very reasonable.

86
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:13.111
And also what it all came about was your wife had sent out an email saying like,

87
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.220
hey,

88
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.220
maybe it should be okay for someone to wear a fucked up Halloween costume.

89
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.630
Know.
Maybe it's okay to ask for someone to dress up like crazy horse.
We have,

90
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.080
we'll actually,
just to be clear what Erica was saying in that note,
uh,
was not,

91
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.480
this is very important intellectual distinction.
I think we've,

92
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.230
we've lost a lot of nuance in our political lives in general in our country

93
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.640
right now.
And also in the,
in the nuance,

94
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.970
in the way we think about difficult topics.

95
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.370
So what Erica was saying was not that necessarily the people,

96
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.110
she was not taking a position on any particular costumes like this is okay.

97
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.411
In fact,

98
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:50.200
many of the costumes that would have offended the students would offend her,

99
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.450
but she was saying was that she didn't think the university should be telling

100
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.280
students what to wear.
And she was asking,

101
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 0>the students,
do use students really at this age at Yale,</v>

102
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.260
do you really want the university to be sending you guidance on what to wear at?

103
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.560
Perhaps you should think about that.
You're adults,
you're smart,

104
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.560
you're in an environment that privileges free expression.

105
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
Do you really want to grant the power to an institution to tell you how to

106
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.263
communicate?

107
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.580
And people then a thought that she was saying that,
uh,

108
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:29.960
that she was defending a particular course of action.
What she was saying was,
um,

109
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.870
you,
uh,
she was saying,

110
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.500
do you students really want to surrender that kind of control over your own

111
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:38.090
lives to older adults?

112
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.020
And apparently many students did actually they wanted dated.

113
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.630
So I don't believe they did.

114
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.690
I think they wanted absolute enforcement of what they thought to be wrong or

115
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:55.190
right.
Yes,
yes.
I think that's right.
So they,
they,
they,

116
00:06:55.191 --> 00:07:00.050
uh,
they did the many,
but not all of the students.
I mean,

117
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.820
let's be,
let's also be very clear.
And in part of the motivation in,

118
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.230
in Erica a writing that note was that,
uh,
many,
uh,

119
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.310
many of her students and in fact many hundreds of other students felt

120
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:15.230
infantilized by this policy.

121
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.690
And there had been a big build up prior to that event,

122
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.660
including an article in the New York Times about these Halloween costume

123
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:23.720
policies around the country.
And weren't they kind of ridiculous.

124
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.100
And so there was a,
there was a kind of a,
a ferment where people were saying,

125
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:32.510
wait a minute,
do we really need adults to be told in this institution,

126
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.950
especially given its commitments to open expression,
uh,

127
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.940
what to wear?

128
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.800
And keep in mind that there could be many ways in which a costume that offends

129
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:45.950
you might not,
might,
I might not know why.

130
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:49.580
So let's say you had been abused by a priest and you were,
uh,

131
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.940
that one of the rules said you shouldn't emoc religion,
for example,

132
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.760
was what one of the Pr,
one of the provisions.
So,
so a,

133
00:07:55.761 --> 00:08:00.590
a university wide email went out,
signed by 13 people saying,
um,

134
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.360
you know,
don't,
don't,
uh,
don't mock people's deeply held faith traditions.

135
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.520
Well,
what if for the sake of argument,
you had been a,
uh,

136
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:12.260
abused by a priest and you want it did Halloween to dress up as a Catholic

137
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.210
priest,
for example.
Uh,
you know,

138
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:18.350
holding a doll and someone else who had a different,

139
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.890
who was Catholic was very deeply offended by that.
Well,

140
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.990
who should adjudicate that?
Like,
you know,

141
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.130
is it the role of the institution to come down and say,
yes,

142
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:32.480
you can express yourself this way?
No,
you cannot.
And so the argument was,

143
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:37.490
let the young people learn,
let them sort it out themselves.

144
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:41.150
Let them learn by talking to each other,
expressing themselves,
saying,
you know,

145
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.800
that hurts my feelings.
Here's why it hurts my feelings.
And the other person say,

146
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.110
oh,
I understand,
or I don't understand.
I reject that reason.
And,

147
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.030
and sort of buy into a kind of commitment to free and open expression that

148
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.140
actually I think ultimately serves the objectives of righteous social progress.

149
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.610
If we really want to do better in our society or in any society in my view,

150
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.910
we have to create an environment where we can talk to each other,
grant,

151
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:08.910
good faith,
uh,
listen carefully,

152
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.250
make subtle distinctions and,

153
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.940
and free people up to express what they're thinking so we can have a real

154
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:19.350
marketplace of ideas.
That's,
you know,
my commitment or my belief.

155
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.840
Well that's a wonderful belief.
11,

156
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.270
<v 1>I mean that's really a,
I couldn't agree with you more,
more enthusiastically.</v>

157
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.680
That's really,

158
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.360
that sounds like the best possible environment for growing up and learning as

159
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:38.361
long as you have someone to sort of moderate or someone to mediate if things go

160
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.563
sideways.

161
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.210
<v 0>Yes.
Or I don't think you necessarily need a third party mediator,</v>

162
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:47.360
but you do need a shared understanding of,

163
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.230
of a core liberal principles.
And these principles do include,

164
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:54.530
as I mentioned earlier,
I kind of commitment to free and open expression,

165
00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:56.840
a commitment to debate,
a commitment to reason.

166
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.680
So how are you and I going to come to a better understanding of what is true

167
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.740
about the world we could fight,
right?
And then the,

168
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.670
the stronger person would decide what's right.
We could vote.

169
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.830
Doesn't seem quite right either.
You know,

170
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:14.690
350 cardinals voted that Galileo was wrong.
That didn't make Galileo wrong.

171
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.880
Or we could use principles of reason and inquiry to try to appreciate the world

172
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:23.090
together.
Right?
We're looking at at the world and saying,
that's confusing.

173
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.680
You know,
does the sun,

174
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.860
does the earth revolve around the sun or does the sun revolve around the earth?

175
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.130
Or that's confusing.
Should a king have monarch,
you know,

176
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.030
should a king of ultimate authority in a state or is that not how we want to

177
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:39.680
organize a state?
So we,
you and I look at the world and debate and think about,

178
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:40.130
okay,

179
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.130
and we exchange reasons and we use evidence and ways of understanding and

180
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:49.940
studying the world.
That to me is the only way to truth.
Actually.
Now,

181
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.820
some people will think that religion is a way to truth,
right?

182
00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:55.790
They think that the truth is,
you know,
has god given.
For example,

183
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:58.880
now I am very sympathetic to religious belief systems,

184
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:01.310
but I don't think that's a way to truth that it's a way to,

185
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.210
some truths actually it's a way to some some wisdom,
but anyway,

186
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.850
so that's what our universities in our society,

187
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:12.050
our universities are officially committed to that the mottos of our universities

188
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:17.051
are all about free inquiry and pursuit of knowledge and our country is committed

189
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:18.500
to that in our bill of rights,
right?

190
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:21.800
We have a commitment to free and open expression,
freedom of assembly,

191
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:26.240
freedom of religion and so forth and,
and those ground rules then in my view,

192
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:29.970
make it possible for us to have a better society and,

193
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.830
and there's

194
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.270
<v 1>more academic.
Well,
I'm sure we will get into it.
No,
I'm sure we will.
Again,</v>

195
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.190
I couldn't agree with you more enthusiastically.

196
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.390
I just think we need more reasonable conversations in this screaming and

197
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.920
shouting people down and less toxic mob action.
Yes.
Yes.

198
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:50.921
The mob action is very weird because I don't remember it well from the like from

199
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.190
the Vietnam war

200
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.250
<v 0>protests to what's going on today.</v>

201
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:02.251
There was this long gap where you didn't hear about university shutting down

202
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.610
speech.
Yes.
This is fairly new.

203
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.320
This is within the last half decade or so.
Yes,

204
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.080
yes,
yes.
I mean they're always there.

205
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.440
There's always an undercurrent of tension about this at,

206
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.350
at universities and in our society at large.
Uh,

207
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.440
I mean let's not forget the McCarthy era where you had the right wing was,

208
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.660
you know,
really interested in shutting down communists.

209
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:30.040
Like if you were a professor or an artist who had far left political views,

210
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.130
you were screwed.
Yes.
And that's what's wrong.

211
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.160
Or even if you'd want went to a communist meeting yes.

212
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.640
Find out what it was all about.
Yes.
Just to educate yourself.
Yes.
In fact,

213
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:40.800
that's a great example because that,

214
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.810
like right now I see a lot of people being criticized for following online

215
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.280
people they disagree with,
which is nuts.
Crazy.
So I just,

216
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.130
because I follow someone doesn't mean I agree with what they're saying.

217
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.220
I'm interested to learn.
What are they saying?
I'm friends with people.

218
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.960
I don't agree with me too.

219
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.050
I am friends with so many people that don't agree with.
I have a friend.
I have,

220
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.780
I have friends across the political spectrum from the,

221
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.970
I don't have any monarchists among my friends who are Monica,

222
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.480
but I have friends from the far right to far left.

223
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.540
I have a friend who really believes you sold libertarian.

224
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:18.160
He thinks there should be private ownership of roads.
Uh,
whoa.
Yeah.
I mean,

225
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.630
yeah,
I think that's ridiculous.
And we debate,
but he must be white.

226
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.710
He's actually
my wife.

227
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:31.580
My wife says she'll just once like to meet a poor libertarian female

228
00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:35.920
libertarian.
Yes.
No.
Um,
yeah.
That's a ridiculous position.
I think.
So.

229
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:37.490
Private roads get the fuck out of here.
