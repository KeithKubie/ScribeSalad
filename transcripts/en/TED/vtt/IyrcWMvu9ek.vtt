00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.296
Don't you love a good nap?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.536
(Laughter)

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.976
Just stealing away
that small block of time

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800
to curl up on your couch
for that sweet moment of escape.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.256
It's one of my favorite things,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.856
but something I took for granted

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.800
before I began experiencing
homelessness as a teenager.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.256
The ability to take a nap is only reserved
for stability and sureness,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.496
something you can't find

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.176
when you're carrying
everything you own in your book bag

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.976
and carefully counting the amount of time
you're allowed to sit in any given place

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.600
before being asked to leave.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.016
I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.856
bouncing from house to house

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.176
with a loving, close-knit family

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.536
as we struggled to find stability

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.760
in our finances.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.376
But when my mom temporarily
lost herself to mania

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.136
and when that mania chose me
as its primary scapegoat

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.816
through both emotional and physical abuse,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.240
I fled for my safety.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.215
I had come to the conclusion
that homelessness was safer for me

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.440
than being at home.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.440
I was 16.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.616
During my homelessness,
I joined Atlanta's 3,300 homeless youth

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.616
in feeling uncared for,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.920
left out and invisible each night.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.216
There wasn't and still is not any place

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.616
for a homeless minor
to walk off the street

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.040
to access a bed.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.816
I realized that most people
thought of homelessness

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.096
as some kind of lazy, drug-induced
squalor and inconvenience,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.816
but that didn't represent my book bag
full of clothes and schoolbooks,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.560
or my A+ grade point average.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.976
I would sit on my favorite bench downtown

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.816
and watch as the hours passed by

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.496
until I could sneak in
a few hours of sleep

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.336
on couches, in cars,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.640
in buildings or in storage units.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.456
I, like thousands of other homeless youth,
disappeared into the shadows of the city

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.736
while the whole world kept spinning

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.320
as if nothing at all
had gone terribly wrong.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.600
The invisibility alone
almost completely broke my spirit.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.120
But when I had nothing else,
I had the arts,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.456
something that didn't demand

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.000
material wealth from me
in exchange for refuge.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.936
A few hours of singing, writing poetry

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.936
or saving up enough money

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.616
to disappear into another world at a play

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.200
kept me going and jolting me back to life
when I felt at my lowest.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.296
I would go to church services
on Wednesday evenings

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.816
and, desperate for the relief
the arts gave me,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.056
I would go a few hours early,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.416
slip downstairs

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.856
and into a part of the world
where the only thing that mattered

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.576
was whether or not I could hit
the right note in the song

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.920
I was perfecting that week.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.280
I would sing for hours.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.176
It gave me so much strength
to give myself permission

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.480
to just block it all out and sing.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.216
Five years later,
I started my organization, ChopArt,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.360
which is a multidisciplinary
arts organization for homeless minors.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.536
ChopArt uses the arts
as a tool for trauma recovery

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.296
by taking what we know
about building community

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.136
and restoring dignity

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.360
and applying that to the creative process.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.176
ChopArt is headquartered
in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.016
with additional programs
in Hyderabad, India, and Accra, Ghana,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.296
and since our start in 2010,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.800
we've served over 40,000 teens worldwide.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.216
Our teens take refuge

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.640
in the transformative
elements of the arts,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.560
and they depend on the safe space
ChopArt provides for them to do that.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.096
An often invisible population
uses the arts to step into their light,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.360
but that journey out of invisibility
is not an easy one.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.976
We have a sibling pair, Jeremy and Kelly,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.440
who have been with our program
for over three years.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.000
They come to the ChopArt classes
every Wednesday evening.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.480
But about a year ago,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.320
Jeremy and Kelly witnessed their mom
seize and die right in front of them.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.399
They watched as the paramedics
failed to revive her.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.736
They cried as their father

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.536
signed over temporary custody
to their ChopArt mentor, Erin,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.200
without even allowing them to take
an extra pair of clothes on their way out.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.040
This series of events broke my heart,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.776
but Jeremy and Kelly's faith
and resolve in ChopArt

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.040
is what keeps me grounded in this work.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.496
Kelly calling Erin in her lowest moment,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.856
knowing that Erin would do
whatever she could

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.856
to make them feel loved and cared for,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.976
is proof to me that by using
the arts as the entry point,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.720
we can heal and build
our homeless youth population.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.640
And we continue to build.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.216
We build with Devin,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.416
who became homeless with his family

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.120
when his mom had to choose
between medical bills or the rent.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.640
He discovered his love
of painting through ChopArt.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.016
We build with Liz,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.216
who has been on the streets
most of her teenage years

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.256
but turns to music to return to herself

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.000
when her traumas feel too heavy
for her young shoulders.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.216
We build for Maria,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.576
who uses poetry to heal

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.096
after her grandfather died in the van

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.360
she's living in
with the rest of her family.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.376
And so to the youth out there
experiencing homelessness,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.600
let me tell you,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.920
you have the power to build within you.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.656
You have a voice through the arts

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.496
that doesn't judge
what you've been through.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.976
So never stop fighting
to stand in your light

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.336
because even in your darkest times,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.560
we see you.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.336
Thank you.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.600
(Applause)
