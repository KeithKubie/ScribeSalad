00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:14.321
- Our next speaker is Susan Mizner.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.797
Susan is Disability Counsel from

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:20.059
the ACLU here in San Francisco,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.567
and is back by popular demand

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:26.836
to hear more about
supported decision making,

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:30.338
civil liberties and
alternatives to conservatorship,

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:31.819
to guardianship.

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:35.652
Thank you so much for
being here today, Susan.

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:41.964
- And this stool is my
reasonable accommodation.

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.275
Thank you to Gerry and
Lucy for the invitation,

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:47.964
it's really lovely to be here.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.355
How do I work this?

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:52.522
I just go forward. Got it.

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:04.306
Okay. Is someone else
gonna turn these for me?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.706
Will you move them forward for me?

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:13.523
- You just push this right here.

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:15.139
Forward, reverse.

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.222
- Okay, great. Thank you.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.706
I'm in control. I like that.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.539
(audience laughs)

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:29.993
Giving you your workout for the day.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:34.122
(applause)

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:37.689
The thing that I take off of my bio

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.568
is that I'm a graduate
of Yale and Stanford,

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:42.568
and this is exactly why.

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:50.147
We're gonna cover the three...

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:52.847
Yes, there we go.

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:55.945
The three main issues
that we're covering today

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:57.943
are the problems with conservatorships,

00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:00.191
the promise of supported decision-making,

00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:03.017
and then going beyond the binary

00:02:03.017 --> 00:02:06.722
in trying to do competency evaluations.

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:10.722
The first two, I'm hoping,
are a bit of a review

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.439
but I want to ask first,

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.255
how many of you have worked

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.249
with people under conservatorship?

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.249
A lot. Okay.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.522
How many of you have done
competency evaluations?

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.768
A smaller number. All right.

00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:31.868
And then, how many of you know

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:34.701
what supported decision-making is?

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.752
Pretty good.

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:38.609
And how many of you have practiced

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.191
supported decision-making
in your practice?

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.693
Okay, it's probably more of
you than who raised your hands,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:46.610
but we'll go over that.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:53.234
Let's talk about what
conservatorship is, first.

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:58.145
It's a legal process, right?

00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:00.975
You have the court,

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.366
you have an individual with a disability,

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:06.229
and the court appoints someone else

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.812
to be making decisions
for that individual.

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.623
The legal standard for doing that

00:03:14.623 --> 00:03:17.183
is that the individual is unable to

00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:20.587
provide for his or her personal needs,

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:23.430
being able to provide
food, clothing, shelter,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.318
even with supports,

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:27.095
that's important,

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:29.654
and also important, there are no

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:32.119
less restrictive options available.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.286
I'm forgetting to do this.

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:49.902
You're moving these for
me, aren't you? Okay.

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.735
(audience laughs)

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:58.420
The conservator controls
essentially everything

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.026
when it is a plenary conservatorship.

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.307
There are conservatorships that

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:06.925
are supposed to be more restrictive,

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:11.384
that they only control a
certain part of someone's life.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:15.552
But even after decades
of advocacy to improve

00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:18.628
the way we implement conservatorships,

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:21.479
we find that that
generally doesn't happen.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.293
That plenary conservatorships are the

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:26.005
default mode for most judges.

00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:27.219
It's understandable.

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.784
They're worried about what would happen

00:04:29.784 --> 00:04:33.053
if they don't provide enough protection.

00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:36.425
There's a very paternalistic culture

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.258
in conservatorship probate courts.

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:43.228
But what this means is that

00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:46.940
the person who's under conservatorship,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.492
essentially ceases to
exist as a legal entity.

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:52.866
The conservator takes away

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:56.533
any possibility of
decision making, legally.

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:01.440
We've had situations in
which the conservator

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.807
not only controls the money
and the living situation,

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:08.974
but also whether or not to
go to religious observances,

00:05:10.273 --> 00:05:13.766
whether the individual is able to see

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.433
or refuse to see family members,

00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:22.450
and whether the individual
is able to marry

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.617
or make medical decisions.

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:29.023
Next slide, and I'm gonna do it this time.

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:32.211
From the ACLU perspective,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.127
we care about this because it is the most

00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:40.539
complete deprivation of civil liberties

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.903
aside from the death penalty,

00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:45.820
which Claude Pepper acknowledged in

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.392
congressional review of
this issue years ago.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:54.559
But we have made fairly
little progress since then.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.179
From a parent's perspective,

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:01.187
civil liberties probably
aren't that important.

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:04.697
What's much more important is the way that

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:09.546
the conservatorship will
affect the child's life.

00:06:09.546 --> 00:06:11.963
We've already gone through...

00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:26.131
We've already gone through
the fact that the court

00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:28.082
appoints the conservator.

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:30.501
But I should also point out

00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:33.625
that the court can remove the conservator.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.749
We have had situations in which

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:39.553
the court has appointed a parent

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:43.754
because that was the plan for the family.

00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:45.921
But then the parent is resisting

00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.515
what the court is
ordering the parent to do,

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:52.265
and decides, "okay fine. I'm
removing you as conservator,

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:56.165
and I'm appointing a
professional conservator."

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.616
Professional conservators often don't have

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:01.354
a lot of time to get
to know the individual.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.187
They often go by rote,

00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:08.759
and often will default to
institutional placements

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:11.342
when other options aren't easy.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.869
The other piece is that,

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:20.859
for many of the population
that we're most interested in,

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:24.321
folks with developmental disabilities,

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.571
decision making can increase with time.

00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:32.712
Conservatorship may be
something that isn't

00:07:32.712 --> 00:07:35.220
that bad at the beginning,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.387
when it's imposed when the
individual is 18 or 19.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.801
But it's not something
that's easy to reverse.

00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:48.091
Courts really, really don't like

00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:52.008
taking someone out from
under a conservatorship

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:56.277
once it's in place.

00:07:56.277 --> 00:08:00.387
That person at 40 or 45 may
be living independently,

00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:03.804
may be working at a job almost full time,

00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:07.661
but is still under conservatorship.

00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:09.791
We've worked with folks in this situation

00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:12.420
and found it very difficult to get them

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.337
out from under the conservatorship.

00:08:19.702 --> 00:08:22.245
Again, from the parent's perspective,

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.620
this isn't just a
problem in the long term,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.067
it's also a problem in
terms of what is best

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:29.264
for the individual.

00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:31.104
For the individual's perspective

00:08:31.104 --> 00:08:32.566
it's a problem in terms of

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:35.149
what's best for the individual.

00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:41.458
We all learn how to make
decisions by making mistakes.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:44.174
We all learn how to make decisions by

00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:46.886
practicing making decisions.

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:49.556
If someone is making the decisions for you

00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:51.821
that skill is much harder to develop.

00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:53.404
It may not develop.

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:57.980
Most studies that have looked at this

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.398
show that folks who have that practice,

00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:04.094
who have been able to
exercise decision making

00:09:04.094 --> 00:09:06.352
and self-determination,

00:09:06.352 --> 00:09:10.785
are in fact better able
to protect themselves

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.618
from abuse or neglect.

00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:15.638
They know who to go to,
they know who to ask,

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.638
they know how to say no.

00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:23.707
Let's talk for a few moments

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:25.517
about supported decision-making.

00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:29.390
Does anyone want to try
and define it for me?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.307
Brave soul?

00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:36.553
You wouldn't be wrong, because
(audience laughs)

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:40.731
supported decision-making
has so many definitions.

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:42.981
It's a very broad category.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.397
What we like about it most at the ACLU

00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:49.807
is that it allows people with disabilities

00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:51.613
to retain their legal status,

00:09:51.613 --> 00:09:53.878
to retain their civil liberties.

00:09:53.878 --> 00:09:57.646
The idea is that an individual chooses

00:09:57.646 --> 00:10:00.345
one to sometimes three or more

00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:02.275
people who they trust

00:10:02.275 --> 00:10:06.442
to help them with the
process of making decisions.

00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:10.360
Because it is a less restrictive

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.083
alternative to conservatorship,

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:15.044
under California law

00:10:15.044 --> 00:10:17.244
we believe it should be tried

00:10:17.244 --> 00:10:20.077
before imposing a conservatorship.

00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:28.964
A little more about
supported decision-making.

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:33.692
The key piece of supported decision-making

00:10:33.692 --> 00:10:36.803
is recognizing that we don't have

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.907
an on/off switch with capacity.

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:41.907
It's not all or nothing.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.000
People's ability to make decisions

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.833
depend on the context,

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:50.175
depend on the issue,

00:10:50.175 --> 00:10:54.396
depend on how they're doing
at that moment in time.

00:10:54.396 --> 00:10:56.300
We all use supported decision-making.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.900
I use it for everything from
making major medical decisions

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.230
to certainly what I'm gonna
do with my adolescent.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.333
(audience laughs)

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.376
Even whether I'm gonna buy
these dining room chairs

00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:13.043
versus those dining room chairs.

00:11:14.098 --> 00:11:15.348
The idea behind

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:21.696
the more formal designation
of supported decision-making

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:24.779
for people with disabilities, is that

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:29.532
the agreement is recognized.

00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:34.575
That both sides understand that

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:37.492
for these areas of decision making,

00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:42.355
I'm gonna go to these people for advice.

00:11:44.923 --> 00:11:49.442
There are formal documents
that can be signed.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.567
We have examples of them on our website

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:55.734
on the ACLU, which is at
the end of your PowerPoint.

00:11:56.622 --> 00:12:00.289
But we also have more
informal arrangements.

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:03.981
The good thing about
supported decision-making

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:07.197
is that you don't have to go to court,

00:12:07.197 --> 00:12:11.364
and as your relationships change,
as your capacities change,

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.399
as your opinions and interests change,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.244
you can change who is
providing you the advice,

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:22.994
who is providing you the support.

00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:32.170
Some of the ways that we encourage people

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.193
to think about providing support

00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:38.904
really breaks down into
how decisions are made.

00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:41.071
Every decision has a goal.

00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:46.131
That needs to be clear at the outset.

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:48.214
Then identifying options,

00:12:49.642 --> 00:12:53.072
evaluating the pros and
cons of those options,

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.763
reminding the individual of

00:12:54.763 --> 00:12:58.165
what values they bring to the decision,

00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:01.215
and finally making the decision.

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:04.579
Supporters should be willing to help

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:08.881
with articulating any of
those first four issues:

00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:11.040
what's the goal, what are the options,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.303
pros and cons, what
are the values at play.

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:17.293
But the idea is that the individual

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:19.067
is the person who makes that fifth,

00:13:19.067 --> 00:13:22.484
final step of what the final decision is.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.028
Supporters also may be really key in

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:30.534
translating complicated
ideas into plain language.

00:13:30.534 --> 00:13:34.256
One of the things that
we did at the ACLU is

00:13:34.256 --> 00:13:38.954
translate powers of attorney
into plain language.

00:13:38.954 --> 00:13:40.609
So powers of attorney for healthcare,

00:13:40.609 --> 00:13:43.276
powers of attorney for finances,

00:13:44.507 --> 00:13:45.507
permissions,

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:51.168
HIPPA releases translated
into plain language.

00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:55.001
Permission to work with
the educational system

00:13:56.282 --> 00:13:57.865
once a child is 18,

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:02.296
translated into plain language.

00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:04.587
With these plain language documents,

00:14:04.587 --> 00:14:08.754
almost anything that you
need legal authorization for

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:11.876
you can use and talk with

00:14:11.876 --> 00:14:15.126
an individual with a disability through

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:18.312
if they want that support.

00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:24.088
Finally, helping to
communicate wishes to others.

00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:25.671
This may be because

00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:30.395
the individual has cerebral palsy

00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:33.966
and it is a skill that's developed

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:36.560
to be able to understand
what they're saying,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.529
or it may be because of a lot
what Rudy was talking about

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.478
in that you've spent enough
time with the individual

00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:45.984
that you have a better guesswork system

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:49.734
to be able to convey
their values and wishes.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.826
How do we know if
supported decision-making

00:14:57.826 --> 00:15:01.243
might work for the patients that you see?

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:05.993
The first step is to acknowledge

00:15:05.993 --> 00:15:08.993
that there's a wide range of issues,

00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:14.157
and we don't have a "yes"
or "no" for each of them.

00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:18.209
The second is to help
them identify which areas

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.334
they might need support in

00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:23.084
and help them find who they might

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:26.379
use to provide that support.

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:32.746
One of the things that I'm...

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.692
I'm glad that we're doing
pretty well with time.

00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:38.171
I want to spend a fair
amount of time talking now

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:41.781
about a new tool for
competency evaluations.

00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.086
Those of you who've done
competency evaluations,

00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:48.255
what do you usually use to do them?

00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:51.005
I really do want you to speak up.

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.160
Someone be brave.

00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:01.462
(comment from man in audience)

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.441
- So you're talking about
a competency evaluation

00:16:28.441 --> 00:16:30.378
for one particular decision,

00:16:30.378 --> 00:16:31.421
and you try and make sure that

00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:33.456
you understand that one decision.

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:34.695
Okay, great.

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.009
(comment from audience)

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:37.092
Great, okay.

00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:41.584
Has anyone done competency evaluations

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.417
for a conservatorship?

00:16:44.815 --> 00:16:48.898
(comment from woman in audience)

00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:53.970
- In California, guardianship applies

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.636
to people under 18, youth,

00:16:56.636 --> 00:17:01.198
and conservatorship applies
to people over 18, adults.

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:03.948
I'm talking about people over 18.

00:17:05.216 --> 00:17:06.627
In the rest of the country,

00:17:06.627 --> 00:17:08.885
guardianship generally applies to adults.

00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:13.052
It's confusing for those
of us who work nationally.

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:18.797
(comment from woman in audience)

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:44.337
- Okay. That's really important

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:45.573
and we're gonna come back to that.

00:17:45.573 --> 00:17:48.864
There's someone whose
hand was up back here.

00:17:48.864 --> 00:17:52.947
(comment from woman in audience)

00:17:58.663 --> 00:18:01.061
Their social situation.

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:03.303
Their past medical history.

00:18:03.303 --> 00:18:04.886
Neurological exams.

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:08.034
Ability to communicate.

00:18:08.034 --> 00:18:08.867
IQ exams.

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:16.486
(comment from woman in audience)

00:18:25.122 --> 00:18:26.622
- Okay, thank you.

00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.574
There's a good clarification
that's happened here,

00:18:31.574 --> 00:18:34.819
the term of art that you use
is a competency evaluation

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.995
is competency to stand trial

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:39.079
and conservatorship evaluation

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.947
is a conservatorship evaluation.

00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:42.383
All right, then let me change my language

00:18:42.383 --> 00:18:46.550
because I'm talking about a
conservatorship evaluation.

00:18:47.858 --> 00:18:50.499
The tools that I've usually seen

00:18:50.499 --> 00:18:53.626
and that the courts have usually requested

00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.709
are what you were saying of IQ exams,

00:18:58.601 --> 00:19:01.789
various short term memory tests,

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:04.547
problem solving skills, et cetera.

00:19:04.547 --> 00:19:07.464
They're usually tools that are done

00:19:08.493 --> 00:19:12.801
in a relatively artificial
context in an office.

00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:16.699
They're usually done without any support,

00:19:16.699 --> 00:19:19.030
even if the person
generally does have support

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.697
in their daily life.

00:19:23.102 --> 00:19:26.102
They aren't done with what decisions

00:19:27.816 --> 00:19:31.483
an individual make
actually make day to day.

00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:35.452
From our perspective as lawyers,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.027
the ideal process would be

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:45.071
spending real time from dawn
to dusk with an individual,

00:19:46.722 --> 00:19:49.781
walking with them through their life,

00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:54.275
seeing at what points
they act independently,

00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:57.119
at what points they act with support,

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:00.550
and at other points
someone else is intervening

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.048
because they are unable
to make a decision.

00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:07.825
That would be something that
happens over a week or two.

00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:10.408
Obviously the ideal approach is

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:15.251
administratively and
financially unfeasible.

00:20:15.251 --> 00:20:18.976
That's not something we
can ask you to implement.

00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:20.726
Was there a question?

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:25.792
(comment from woman in audience)

00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:10.304
I don't want to miss what you're saying.

00:21:10.304 --> 00:21:12.260
The folks who are in the overflow room

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.642
aren't gonna be able to hear you,

00:21:13.642 --> 00:21:16.422
so I just want to try
and summarize quickly.

00:21:16.422 --> 00:21:18.233
What you're saying is that
usually in New Jersey,

00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:19.411
you're from New Jersey,

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.130
you've got two people doing this.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.450
And you, as the
psychologist? Psychiatrist.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.533
Want to do the functional assessment.

00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:30.156
Quickly.

00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:35.247
(comment from woman in audience)

00:21:37.024 --> 00:21:41.191
And the hardest ones to
do are broad based. Right.

00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:43.825
Let me just move on.

00:21:43.825 --> 00:21:47.075
I'm hoping that this is in your packet.

00:21:48.695 --> 00:21:51.310
There are two different forms.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.988
One is for a physician and
one is for an individual

00:21:54.988 --> 00:21:58.655
and/or individual and supporters.

00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:05.266
They are essentially checklists.

00:22:08.908 --> 00:22:10.825
This is a tool that the

00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:16.036
Missouri Center on Excellence
and Disability began,

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:21.168
and that we have modified
and have been trying out.

00:22:21.168 --> 00:22:23.455
This is version 2.0.

00:22:23.455 --> 00:22:26.427
I expect we'll get to version 16.0

00:22:26.427 --> 00:22:29.010
before we're satisfied with it.

00:22:30.317 --> 00:22:33.150
But I wanted to review it with you

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.724
and ask for your help with this,

00:22:36.724 --> 00:22:40.253
because we want you guys to be the ones

00:22:40.253 --> 00:22:44.420
who are doing the evaluations
for conservatorships.

00:22:45.574 --> 00:22:47.811
You are the ones who work with people

00:22:47.811 --> 00:22:49.736
who have developmental disabilities.

00:22:49.736 --> 00:22:53.569
You understand better
what the capacities are,

00:22:54.742 --> 00:22:56.562
what the potential is.

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:59.062
You're gonna be less likely to

00:23:00.218 --> 00:23:02.361
default to stereotypes

00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:04.973
about limitations and the need for

00:23:04.973 --> 00:23:07.435
a plenary conservatorship,

00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:10.935
and more likely to identify that there are

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:13.472
many ways in which people who would

00:23:13.472 --> 00:23:17.121
otherwise be put under conservatorship

00:23:17.121 --> 00:23:20.788
could in fact use
supported decision-making.

00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:30.059
It's very hard to put a
chart up on a PowerPoint,

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:32.976
but I want to pull this out for you

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.947
to highlight that there are
not yes/no columns here.

00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:44.137
There are three columns.

00:23:45.647 --> 00:23:49.480
On the left hand side
are the various areas...

00:23:51.588 --> 00:23:54.421
Thank you, it's in the book. Good.

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:58.241
Various categories in which people

00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:01.241
may or may not need support.

00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:03.390
Various categories in which people

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.057
may or may not be able
to act independently.

00:24:10.123 --> 00:24:13.345
One of the ways that we are hoping

00:24:13.345 --> 00:24:15.678
to expand and change the way

00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:23.879
these competency or conservatorship
evaluations are done,

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.879
is to have an individual

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.619
first fill this out for themselves

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:32.869
with any available support,

00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:38.852
and talk through with
whomever is supporting them

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.104
which areas they are
able to do by themselves.

00:24:45.104 --> 00:24:49.271
Maybe they're able to
communicate very effectively.

00:24:50.694 --> 00:24:54.861
Maybe there is no problem with
them being able to understand

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.863
how they make choices.

00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:07.204
But this moves from
communication, to personal care,

00:25:07.204 --> 00:25:10.287
to staying safe, to home and friends,

00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:16.150
and breaks each of these
areas down into small bits

00:25:17.013 --> 00:25:20.610
so that you can have a conversation

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.110
with the individual about both

00:25:24.384 --> 00:25:26.626
whether they do this by themselves,

00:25:26.626 --> 00:25:30.356
whether they really don't do it at all,

00:25:30.356 --> 00:25:34.568
or whether they might be
able to do it with support.

00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:37.331
And if they could do it with support,

00:25:37.331 --> 00:25:39.414
who that person might be.

00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:43.670
I'm gonna just reemphasize

00:25:44.913 --> 00:25:47.246
that this is a tool that we,

00:25:49.023 --> 00:25:50.106
as attorneys,

00:25:51.455 --> 00:25:55.785
want the courts to begin
to pay attention to.

00:25:55.785 --> 00:25:58.035
This is a tool that we hope

00:25:59.228 --> 00:26:00.645
will develop some

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.557
real life use to you

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:10.274
and to us when we are working with people

00:26:10.274 --> 00:26:13.235
who may be put under conservatorship,

00:26:13.235 --> 00:26:16.671
or may be eligible for
supported decision-making.

00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:19.588
It's also a tool that can just help

00:26:23.327 --> 00:26:27.009
in facilitating someone's independence.

00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:29.759
It's a way of seeing which skills

00:26:30.678 --> 00:26:34.257
might be able to be increased with support

00:26:34.257 --> 00:26:36.090
and learned over time.

00:26:40.453 --> 00:26:43.635
Let me just give a couple
more examples here.

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.218
For example, in transportation.

00:26:49.097 --> 00:26:51.514
It may be that someone who is

00:26:53.204 --> 00:26:55.204
going regularly to a job

00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:00.222
or to a friend's house or to a store,

00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:02.312
has learned that skill,

00:27:02.312 --> 00:27:04.167
knows which bus to take,

00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:06.777
knows where their Clipper Card is,

00:27:06.777 --> 00:27:09.297
and knows the route or even what to do

00:27:09.297 --> 00:27:13.134
if they miss their stop
and need to go backwards.

00:27:13.134 --> 00:27:17.325
That would be a skill that
is fully independent, right?

00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:20.473
There is no need for support.

00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:22.660
But if they have a doctor's appointment,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.673
or a specialist's appointment

00:27:23.673 --> 00:27:26.199
that they haven't been to before,

00:27:26.199 --> 00:27:27.366
it may be that

00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:30.713
that is something that they

00:27:30.713 --> 00:27:32.845
could figure out with support.

00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:36.678
Someone reminds them of
the map and the route,

00:27:37.832 --> 00:27:41.297
and talks about that with them beforehand.

00:27:41.297 --> 00:27:43.646
Or it may be that for that one instance,

00:27:43.646 --> 00:27:45.709
they need someone to go with them.

00:27:45.709 --> 00:27:47.790
Or they need someone to order a taxi

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.058
to take them back and forth.

00:27:50.058 --> 00:27:51.864
That's the kind of thing that,

00:27:51.864 --> 00:27:56.031
as you work with in individual
who has a disability,

00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:59.159
you can develop systems for

00:28:00.676 --> 00:28:04.520
and avoid the types of crises that often

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.962
lead people to say, "this
person needs a conservatorship.

00:28:06.962 --> 00:28:10.545
This person can't be
living independently."

00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:15.526
I'm going to reiterate that

00:28:15.526 --> 00:28:16.859
I recognize that

00:28:17.793 --> 00:28:19.710
folks here are prone to

00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:24.132
support independence. Thank you.

00:28:24.132 --> 00:28:26.297
They're prone to support
supported decision-making.

00:28:26.297 --> 00:28:27.130
Thank you.

00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:31.445
But just because that's your bent,

00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:33.647
doesn't mean we don't want you doing

00:28:33.647 --> 00:28:35.945
conservatorship evaluations.

00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:39.347
When we have cases that are brought to us,

00:28:39.347 --> 00:28:42.615
the people who've done the
conservatorship evaluations

00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:44.948
always find that this person

00:28:44.948 --> 00:28:47.241
needs to be under conservatorship.

00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:51.054
We need folks who can present
counter-balancing evidence

00:28:51.054 --> 00:28:55.221
that there are ways in which
this person can function

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.113
and can at least try
supported decision-making

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.863
before we condemn them to what is

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.594
the greatest deprivation
of civil liberties

00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:08.568
aside from the death penalty.

00:29:08.568 --> 00:29:09.401
Questions.

00:29:10.806 --> 00:29:14.973
(question from woman in audience)

00:30:14.096 --> 00:30:15.429
Thank you, yeah.

00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:28.208
We need to move to the next one

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.632
and have some conversation afterward,

00:30:29.632 --> 00:30:31.221
but I'm very glad you brought that up

00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:32.829
because you're absolutely right

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:35.692
that the intent behind conservatorships

00:30:35.692 --> 00:30:38.217
and even the language

00:30:38.217 --> 00:30:41.433
of what direction the
conservatorship is given

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:43.350
is one of collaboration

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:48.665
and one of representing
the individual's interest.

00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:50.582
That is absolutely what

00:30:52.023 --> 00:30:54.606
many, many conservators do

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:55.689
for the ward.

00:30:57.965 --> 00:31:01.382
I do not mean to impugn what really good,

00:31:02.338 --> 00:31:05.588
really helpful people are trying to do.

00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:09.402
At the same time, legally,

00:31:09.402 --> 00:31:12.747
if the individual disagrees
with the conservator,

00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:14.628
there is no recourse.

00:31:14.628 --> 00:31:16.160
There's no recourse.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.077
Legally, that person is essentially

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:26.133
at the whim and mercy of the conservator.
