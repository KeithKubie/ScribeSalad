00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.830
- [Instructor] Figure A is
a scaled copy of figure B.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.980
And then they say what is the value of x?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.400
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
All right, given that figure A
is a scaled copy of figure B,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.270
that would also mean that figure B is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.920
a scaled copy of figure A.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.970
And so we would have a common scale factor

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910
between corresponding sides.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.920
So, for example, this
side right over here,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.940
it looks like it's playing the same role

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.140
as this side right over here.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.090
And so what would be the scale factor

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.230
to go from 10 to 12.5?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.790
What do I have to multiply
10 by to get 12.5?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.260
Well, I'm multiplying
it by a scale factor.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.580
I'm using a scale factor of 1.25.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.620
I'm multiplying times 1.25,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.030
or you could also think of it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.580
as I'm multiplying times 1 1/4,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.230
either way of expressing the same number.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.450
Well, if I'm thinking about x,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.540
if I want to know this
length right over here,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.440
corresponding to this side on figure B

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.680
would be this side on figure A,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.450
which has length 16.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.930
And so I would use the same scale factor.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.093
So my scale factor here,
once again, would be 1 1/4.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.903
So I'll multiply times 1 1/4.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.820
And 1/4 of 16 is four.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.000
So it's going to be 16
and then another four

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.833
is going to be equal to 20.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:37.550
1.25 times 16 is equal
to 20, and we're done.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.483
Let's do another example.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.570
Here we're told figure A is
a scaled copy of figure B.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.780
All right.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.560
Figure A is made from figure B

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.072
using a scale factor of 5/2.

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:55.260
What is the value of x?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.340
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.030
Well, when they tell us that figure A

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.550
is made from figure B using
a scale factor of 5/2,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.790
that means when we're making figure A,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.990
if we look at the
corresponding side on figure B,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.640
so we have this side on figure B.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.260
It looks like it corresponds
to this side on figure A.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.960
And so to go from five to x,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.190
we would use a scale factor of 5/2.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430
We're gonna multiply by 5/2.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.920
Well, what is five times 5/2?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.170
Let me just write here, x
is going to be equal to five

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.960
times our scale factor, times 5/2,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.540
which is going to be equal to 25.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.690
Let me write it this way.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.000
It's going to be equal to 25 over two,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.750
which, if we want, we
could write it as 12.5.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.430
So x right over here, the
length right over here, is 12.5.
