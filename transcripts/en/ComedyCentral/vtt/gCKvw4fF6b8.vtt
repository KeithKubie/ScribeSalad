Hey, Forrest, how come
you've never reviewed

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:06.739
being hit by a car?

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.474
It's weird.

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:11.411
Anyway, what's it
like to be pranked?

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start size:50% position:50%
Oh, see that?
Look at that.

come a bit early this year.

Ah, well, here
I go to get pranked.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.563
This should be a fun one, right?

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.265
Forrest: At first,
being pranked appeared

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.766
to be just the assignment
I needed after

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.368
the emotionally exhausting
experience

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.304
of vetoing
my ex-wife's request.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:41.541
But then I realized that
since I can't prank myself,

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.709
this had the potential
to be uniquely challenging.

Hi.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.612 align:start size:44% position:56%
Hello, Grant.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.183 size:72% position:36%
Well, I should talk
to you about something.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.251 align:start position:0%
This is very difficult
in light of recent events,

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.120 size:63% position:31%
but I'm just gonna
cut to the chase

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.422 size:63% position:31%
and tell you
what I just learned.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.157 align:start size:47% position:53%

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.161 size:66% position:33%
"Review" has, uh,
been canceled.

What?

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.767 align:end position:100%
Did you just tell me
that "Review" has been canceled?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.502 align:start position:0% line:85%
Afraid so.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.771 size:72% position:64%
No. That can't be true.
No, Grant, Grant.

They can't do that.

You can't do that, Grant!

Hey, listen to me.

What you are saying
now cannot happen.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start size:66% position:34%

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.559 size:59% position:70%

told me to!

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:36.162
[Bleep] no!
Get back on the [bleep] phone,

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.697 align:start size:72% position:28%
and you tell them, "No.

will [bleep] kill himself.

Absolutely not."

Oh.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.849
Grant's prank was a true
masterpiece of the form.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.886 size:63% position:69%
Grant, that was...
Hmm!

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.221 size:84% position:58% line:85%
That was a little too good.

Oh.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.690
The most impressive thing
about it was that it took me,

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.592
a man who was waiting
to be pranked,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.227
completely by surprise.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.662 size:75% position:38%
Okay.
I know that you're doing

But this is
actually real.

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.302 align:end position:100%
Why would they cancel "Review"?
I feel like an idiot.

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.705 size:72% position:36%
Well, it's the ratings.
They're really bad.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.507
Haven't you noticed how few
questions we've been getting?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.309 align:start size:69% position:31%
You're still doing it?

I fought for you.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.525
I guess people just didn't care
for the show as much as we did.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.826 size:63% position:69%
You really thought
it through, too.

no one was home.

it's that this prank

was really not
all that believable,

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.393
because what kind of a universe

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.094
would be cruel enough
to allow "Review"
