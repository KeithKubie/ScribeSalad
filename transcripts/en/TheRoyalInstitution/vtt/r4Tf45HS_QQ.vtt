00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.320
Another example of resonance will be, ahh...
shown by Mr. Coates with this tube.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.840
Inside the tube, there's...
there's gas.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.660
So we have a gas column inside,...

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.240
...which we can, ahh,...

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.580
...prove to you
 by lighting the small gas jets,...

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.800
...which will come out
 through a series of holes drilled to the top.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Ahh...  and there,
 everything is virtually static.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.040
The gas jet is just sitting quietly inside.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.460
Small amounts of gas
 are coming out,...

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.900
...and the height of the flame
 indicates the pressure of the gas.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.420
Now this...  this column of gas
 is capable of vibrating in a longitudinal way,...

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.020
...and we have arranged
 that we can set it going...

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.740
...with various resonant frequencies,
 by way of a loudspeaker...

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.980
...that can be tuned,
 and is placed at the end of the tube.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.660
So, if we start off
 with a certain note,...

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.880
...then you can see that now
 we have a longitudinal vibration,...

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.480
With, ahh,...   one,...

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.740
...two higher notes.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.220
One, two, three...    waves.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.860
Ahh,...   One, two, three, four.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.980
And a succession of waves.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.100
That's fine, 
thank you very much.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
These waves are...

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240
...are associated
 with the pressure variation,...

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.180
...as the gas
 is compressed and extended...

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.880
...ahh,...  through the excitation
 provided by the loudspeaker at the end.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.960
Yet another example is the, ahh...

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.440
...is the vibrating plate.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.560
And here we have a steel...

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040
...plate, rather a thin one,...

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.740
...and so, fairly flexible.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.840
It's secured at the mid point,
 held down there,...

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.100
...but otherwise free to vibrate
 around the edges, and everywhere else.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.800
And, at one edge, we have a little vibrator,
which can be...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.500
...controlled by an oscillator,
which I'll now switch on.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.200
And you can hear the frequency...

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.740
...being generated on the plate,
but you can't actually see the plate moving.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.460
Even though
 you can hear the noise.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.360
Now, I'll try and get a large...

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.600
...frequency set up here.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.200
I think we might be able to see that
 if I sprinkle some powder on the top.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.620
This light powder
 is very light indeed,...

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.540
...and, as the plate bounces up and down,
 in various places,...

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.240
...so the powder bounces with it.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.340
And, gradually, it's bounced off
 the parts that are moving,...

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.380
...onto the parts that are still.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.220
Now, we can produce
 various patterns with this...

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.240
...arrangement, 
and here we're driving the plate.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.060
Now, at a certain frequency,...

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.740
...in which the powder is bouncing around quite merrily,
and forming a certain pattern,...

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.540
...accumulating in the one side of the plate
 in that case.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.280
Let's try another frequency, higher up.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.260
And that's quite a nice pattern
 coming up, I think.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.860
Now, parts of the plate are going downwards,
and other parts are going upwards.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.500
And the parts in the middle are...

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.360
...stationary, or virtually stationary,...

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.940
...and that's where the powder
 is accumulating.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.480
Perhaps one more frequency,
 at a higher...

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.180
And these, ahh...  these patterns are...
are displaying the...

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.300
...very complicated mode shapes
 that arise...

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.520
...if there's some external excitation
taking place...

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.100
...which, ahh...   coincides with an actual frequency
 in that particular mode.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.740
So, there's some interesting patterns
 that we can reveal...

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.540
...by, ahh,...
 small experiments of that kind.
