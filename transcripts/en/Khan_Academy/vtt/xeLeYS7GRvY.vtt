00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.660
The starting block below
is 16/9 units long.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.330
So this right here
is 16/9 units long.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.660
Use the tools to the right
to convert the starting block

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.750
into the goal block
that is 1 unit long.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.129
So this right over
here is 1 unit long.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.340
You can see your progress
as the current block.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.140
So how do we convert
this into 1 unit?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.860
Well, one we can start
cutting it into some pieces.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.200
Let's just see what happens.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.270
So if we cut it into
2 pieces, how big

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.710
is this red section now?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.280
So if we cut this in
half, a 1/2 times 16/9

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.910
this is now going to be 8/9.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.280
If we cut it into 4 pieces,
then this is going to be 4/9.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000
If we cut it into,
looks like we're

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.240
going to have to go all
the way to 16 pieces

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.190
to get it into 1/9.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.840
So let's cut this
into 16 pieces.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.600
So now if you take
16/9 and if you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.190
were to cut it into
16 pieces, this

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.120
is going to be 1/9
right over here.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.519
So if I have 1/9 and I
want to make it a whole,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.420
how many do I need?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.100
Well, I need 9 of them.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.570
So let's do 2/9, 3/9, 4/9,
5/9, 6/9, 7/9, 8/9, and 9/9.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810
And let's check our answer.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.450
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.140
So the starting block right over
here is 1 and 9/12 units long.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980
And we're going to use these
tools to convert the block

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.870
into a goal block that
is 1 and 8/12 units long.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.590
You can see your progress
as the current block.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.810
So the most obvious
thing to me is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.870
if I were to just convert the
starting block into 12ths.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.620
And then I could replicate, I
could copy those 12ths enough

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.681
to get to 1 and 8/12.

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.680
So how many times do I
have to cut this in order

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.830
to get it into just 1/12?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.570
So 1 and 9/12 is the
same thing as 12/12

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.320
plus 9/12, which is 21/12.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.370
So if I cut this into
21 blocks, each of them

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.170
are going to be 1/12.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.210
Because this is 21/12
right over here.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.440
So let me cut it into 21.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.230
So right now, I cut
this into 21 blocks.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.520
This was 21/12.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.120
If I cut it, this is 1/21 of
that, so it's going to be 1/12.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.620
So this is 1/12.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.580
And now I just have to
copy it enough times

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030
to get to 1 and 8/12.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.040
And 1 and 8/12 is the same thing
as 12/12 plus 8/12 is 20/12.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.131
So this is 1/12.

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.630
If I get 20 of these, then it's
going to be the same length.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.380
So let me do that.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.950
So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.710
17, 18, 19, 20.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.670
And we are spot on.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.996
Let's check our answer.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.120
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.170
This is fun.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.260
So this starting block
is 11/8 units long.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.350
We want to convert into a
block that is 1 unit long.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.440
So if I can convert the starting
block into eighths, and the way

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.110
that I could make
this into 1/8 is

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.350
by essentially
dividing it by 11.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.440
Now I have 11/8 and I divide by
11, I'm only going to have 1/8.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.030
So let me cut into 11 pieces.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.570
So now this is 1/8.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.430
And then if I take this
1/8 and if I replicate it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.560
so I have 8 of them, 8/8
is going to be equal to 1.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.880
So let me do that.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.990
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.180
And we got it right.
