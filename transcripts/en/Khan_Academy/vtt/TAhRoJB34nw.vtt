00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.270
I sensed some confusion
coming out of the last video.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.960
And for your good, so I
thought I would do another one.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.334
So let's make, let's
assume that there's

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:09.750
three cars in the
market, and what

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.166
I want to do with this is I
sense that some people thought

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.890
that I was suggesting that a car
in general is an inferior good,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.264
and that's not
what I was saying.

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:17.900
I was saying, if we
lived in a reality

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.560
where everyone owned a car and
a car was a necessity for life,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
and that is true in much
of the developed world,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.730
I was saying that the
cheapest car in the market

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.272
might be considered
an inferior good.

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:30.730
And to think about
that, let's just

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.350
think about the
entire population.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.370
So let's say this
line, this line

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.000
represents the entire
population in our place,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.590
in our developed country,
where everyone owns a car.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.160
And let's say, let's represent
this car with a blue.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.220
So let's say maybe 1/3 of the
people right now have that car.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.850
Now, let's say a good
chunk of the people

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.330
have this midsize sedan,
this is probably the car

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.160
that most people would like to
have, it's a little bit safer,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.116
it's a little bit larger,
it's a more powerful engine.

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:03.990
And so this is where
most people are sitting.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.400
And then you have this
ultra, this kind of luxury,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.540
you have this luxury
car, Rolls Royce maybe.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.710
And so that is a
very small segment.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.315
So this end of the line is
the poor, in our population.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.270
This is the rich
right over here.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.710
So this is at some
given income level,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.370
and maybe we could say this
is true at a particular price

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.870
point.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.900
But what we're going
to talk about is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.750
the general impact
on demand-- so

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.250
on the entire curve at
any given price point,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.310
always assuming that this
is the most expensive,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.220
this is in between, and
this is the least expensive.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.060
Now, what happens if
income goes up from here?

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.520
Well, the very
poorest, they're not

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.020
going to be able to
necessarily just trade up

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990
to this midsize sedan
yet, although they maybe

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.300
have more income
for other things

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.970
or maybe they can get a
nicer version of this.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.550
But for the most
part, they're still

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.250
going to be driving this car.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.840
But at kind of the
boundary right over here,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.250
if the incomes do
go up, there will

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.200
be people who now could
afford the mid-size car,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.410
and that's what they want.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.660
And so these people might
start buying the midsize car.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.150
And then what will happen
over here, well, maybe there's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.830
a few people at the
boundary over here,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.660
they now have the money to
afford this very expensive car,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.760
and it suits their tastes.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040
And so they also, a very small
proportion, also grows there.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.370
So what happened here?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.450
When income went
up, the quantity

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.430
demanded at a
particular price point

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.380
for this smallest car went down.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.200
But the demand for this
midsize car went up,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.560
it took a much bigger
chunk out of this blue

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.270
than a chunk was taken
out of it by the orange,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.780
and also the demand for this
very expensive car went up.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.126
And that was at a
particular price point,

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:04.000
but assuming that this
is the most expensive,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.600
this is the middle, and this
is the cheapest expensive,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.450
this would be true of
probably any price point.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.830
And so we have this phenomenon
that when income went up,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.780
the quantity demanded
at multiple price points

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.280
for this car-- so let me
draw its actual demand curve.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.080
So this car right over here,
this is price, this over here

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.640
is demand.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.909
If its old demand curve
looked something like this,

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.450
we're saying-- and maybe when
we thought about this at first,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.150
we're thinking of
the price point right

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.680
over here, we notice
when income went up,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.040
at that particular price
point, the quantity

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.940
demanded went down, and that'd
be true pretty much any price

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.570
point, assuming that this
is always the cheapest car.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.837
So at any price point, you
would have a decrease in demand.

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:54.920
Remember, when we talk
about a decrease in demand,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.090
we're talking about a
shift of the entire curve,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.760
we're not talking about just
one particular quantity.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.310
Now, there's another interesting
question that was asked,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.870
and I think it was a very
nice and subtle thing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.830
to think about.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.570
I keep drawing these
shifting demand curves,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.500
and if at least I understand
the question properly,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.170
the question is
well, does the curve,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.760
when it shifts, does it
necessarily shift perfectly

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.019
or does sometimes it change?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.800
Does it shift more at one
price point or another?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.430
And the simple answer is it can.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.215
In fact, in very few
circumstances would

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.950
it probably be a perfect shift.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.010
Depending on the
price point you're at,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.010
it would probably shift
a little bit different.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.990
So the actual shape
of the curve might

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.610
change while it's shifting.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.660
But anyway, going back to this,
so we see this cheap car right

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.700
here had the unusual property
that when incomes went up,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.690
the demand curve
shifted to the left.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.760
And that's why we call
this an inferior good.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.370
These other two cars when--
so that's price, and this is

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.150
demand-- these other two
cars when income went up--

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.250
so if this was the demand curve
at first-- when income went up,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.000
demand went up.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.950
The whole curve got shifted to
the right, so they are normal.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.500
So these are normal goods.
