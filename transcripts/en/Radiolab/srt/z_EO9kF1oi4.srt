1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,500
Uh, okay. Ready? Okay. This is radio
lab. Oh, okay. Yeah. You start saying,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,950
okay, this is radio lab today
we're talking about loops.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,690
I remember Krulwich Gentleman Ron. This
is Radiolab. It's all about loops. Yep.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm Jad and I'm in Robert, you're
listening to radio lab today.

5
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,780
We're talking about Luke. I'm Robert.
I'm jet and it's all about Lou gifts.

6
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,231
I'm Jan,

7
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,810
I'm Robert Talking about
loops and speaking of things
that happen over and over

8
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:26,500
and over again here on this show here.
Hello. Here he is again. Hi. Jad.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,800
Hey Steve. Steven Strogatz. How are
you? Mathematician Cornell University.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,820
How's it going? I'm good. And uh,

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,140
Steve told us a story
about a mathematical loop.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,290
The through mathematicians all over the
world for a loop story starts way back

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,220
with a guy named got lob. Frager got
lob. Frigo, how do you spell that?

14
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:47,730
It's not, it's not Gottlieb. It's,
it seems to be lob at the end,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,250
unless it's a Typo in
every book I've ever seen.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,600
Now just set this up
very quickly. God Club.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,700
The frago was a map petition back in the
1870s and eighties and he had a dream

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,300
that mathematics could unlock
the secrets of the universe,

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,150
that you could maybe even
build a machine, beat it,

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:07,320
some basic mathematical rules, and it
would just start churning out discovery.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,710
Wouldn't even need a human being. That's
how powerful he thought math could be.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,910
But that led him to a question,

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,790
if math is the most fundamental
thing in the universe,

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,410
what is the most fundamental part
of math? What's at the foundation?

25
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:22,170
Is it numbers? Is it, you
know, one, two, three. Well,

26
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,140
that's what you would think,
but God lab, he said, no,

27
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,560
there's a deeper thing than numbers.
The deepest thing of all is,

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,590
is what today we call sets the
set of things, you know, so that,

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,110
yeah, so like what's a
set, you know, you could,

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,050
Steve explained it to us using
the wall things. Sesame Street,

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,810
really old episode as far
as just to set it up here,

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,510
it's two people working
at the furry arms hotel.

33
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,730
There's Humphrey who's got a green nose
and a pink face and his girlfriend or

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,360
bike. I don't actually know what she
is. She might be his wife, Ingrid.

35
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,290
And so there are hotel keepers and Ernie
is in the background and so Ingrid and

36
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,740
Humphrey are taking an order

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,400
room service order from a room full
of penguins. You know, Humphrey says,

38
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:12,760
I'll take your order. Mr Penguin,
sir, would you lie? Oh, fish, fish,

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,460
fish, fish, fish, fish, fish,
fish. Dan Humphrey says,

40
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:21,880
let me check if I got that right.
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,133
You got it.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,380
And then he calls over to Ingrid who's
going to call it into the kitchen.

43
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:31,160
So he tells Ingrid Fish, fish, fish,
fish, fish, fish. Ingrid says fish, fish,

44
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:34,750
fish, fish, fish. No number. Good. No,

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,620
that's not right because she only says
a five times. But then Ernie explained,

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,600
oh, excuse me, Ingrid and Humphrey, I
have a better way for you to do this.

47
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,050
I better where you count the fish fish
one [inaudible] two [inaudible] and six

48
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:58,820
fish. They both realize Ingrid
and Humphrey, how powerful
this is. And they say,

49
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:03,100
does work for say cinnamon
rolls? Spark plugs.

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,820
Absolutely. Wow. That's
the point that what?

51
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,100
Cinnamon buns and spark plugs and fish.

52
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,910
The sets have in common is
that there are six in each.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,730
I mean if you try to say
what is six really mean,

54
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,790
it's the thing that those sets
have in common. According to Steve.

55
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,850
It's not so much the number six
that's important to hear. Yeah.

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,360
That's just the label for
this characteristic that
all these piles seem to

57
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:30,070
share. It's the pile itself, the
set that is the most basic thing.

58
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,800
So afraid to said, well this is it.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,960
Sets are the bedrock that
I've been looking for. Yeah.

60
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,830
We can build the rest of
math on top of it. Yeah.

61
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,860
And then I can make my math
machine that'll solve the universe.

62
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,300
And I think he published a book sort of
showing how this might work except that

63
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:47,900
Russell Bertrand Muscle,

64
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,270
the mathematician then found a
devastating paradox that ended up,

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,760
well annihilating what
Reagan had tried to do.

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,690
Russell's paradox has now become
known as the barber paradox.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,370
It's a little thought experiment. So
in this case, the set is a town. Yep.

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,400
A town with people. Yep. One barber
with the following rules in this town.

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,940
The Barber shaves. Everyone
who doesn't shave himself,

70
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,320
the barber sounds reasonable, right?
Everyone who doesn't shave himself.

71
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,390
So some people shave themselves,
some people go to the barber.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,381
That's the universe.

73
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,440
We're in a town where everyone who
doesn't shave himself as shave and by this

74
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,560
barber. And now the question
is who shaves the barber?

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,770
Who shaves? Remember the barber? The
Barber has the property that he shaves.

76
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,530
Everyone who doesn't shave
himself, so he can't shave himself,

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,150
but on the other hand, until
he doesn't shave himself,

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,410
then he's one of those people who doesn't
shave himself and is therefore shaven

79
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,510
by the Barbeau. Maybe the barber.
Here's two solutions for you guys.

80
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,950
The Barbara could not shave,
couldn't he just not shave? No.

81
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,970
Or maybe town shave. Maybe he could
set up some sort of mechanical device.

82
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,660
It's sort of like one of those cold
card things that you can't change your

83
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,900
answers sensibly. What happens
to the barber and no one has,

84
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,860
there's nothing to say.

85
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:07,300
He either does or doesn't shave himself
by ordinary Aristotelian logic because

86
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:11,740
the barber can't shave himself
and he can't not shave himself.

87
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,050
So, so there's something still it
ruined. That's what ruined them.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:19,890
[inaudible]

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,470
good ruin in the afternoon and you're
going to be late or you're going to have

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,090
to wait for a couple of hours like
after lunch, before you go swimming.

91
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,860
But I can't see that like overthrowing
all, all life's work. It does. It does.

92
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,450
It turns out to be very,

93
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:36,160
very problematic for the foundations of
math because what this Barbara paradox,

94
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,300
the reason it was so annoying
to mathematicians was that
math is supposed to be

95
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:44,320
this logical thing, right?
Logic is the lifeblood of math.

96
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,630
And yet here you had
this little bit of math.

97
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,430
There was bilogical a
self predicting that set.

98
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,610
But Bertrand Russell, the guy who came
up with all this, he didn't lose faith.

99
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:56,680
He felt, well, this is just
a problem with Cynthia.

100
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,410
So then spent a long time
trying to make, um, a theory,

101
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,590
I think he called it a theory of
types instead of sets. And these,

102
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,700
he had certain admission rules that he
thought would prevent paradoxes from

103
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,330
happening.

104
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,300
And for awhile it was looking pretty
good under Berkshire and Russell System.

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,470
There was no logical
problems, no paradox until

106
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,530
describing a little German guy comes
along and you say his name girdle.

107
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,290
I hear it. I hear it often pronounced
double. I don't speak German,

108
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,860
but mathematicians often say it
like the woman's piece of clothing,

109
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,910
you know from the old days

110
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,690
it sounded like a good good Yaddo.
There's, it is a kind of er or

111
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,720
this is Janna down 11 she has written a
book about goodwill and I am a professor

112
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,730
of physics and astronomy
at Burnett College.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,080
And she says the point at which could
enters our story, it's 1930s Vienna.

114
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,300
Austria. Yeah. Just recently finished his,

115
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,630
what would be equivalent to like a
doctoral degree, a phd. Smart Dude,

116
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,770
kind of a rising star.

117
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,960
It was no question that people
around him understood that,

118
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:01,270
but he was also maybe a little bit
off. He had real breaks with, you know,

119
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,120
reality. He was in the biographies,
they'd call him a paranoid schizophrenia,

120
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,740
but he seemed more a kind of
obsessive depressive, I don't know,

121
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,320
it was my say my age. Armchair
psychology terms are accurate, but,

122
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,370
but he was in and out of
Sanatoria and, and um,

123
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,950
and he had real difficulties
being sure. What was your real,

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,810
the only reality he really trusted was
math circles, shapes, prime numbers,

125
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,200
formulas, axioms. Right? And as a
certain point, he got into paradoxes.

126
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,900
Perhaps it was the barber paradox
that learned them in, we don't know.

127
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,410
But he began to think about and
actually experiment with some of these

128
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,820
paradoxical loops. So he took
something like the paradox of the liar,

129
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,510
the paradox of the liar says,
um, this statement is a lie.

130
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,910
This statement is a lie, right?
Huh? If it's true, then it's false.

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,450
And if it's false, then it's
true. This statement is a lie.

132
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,660
If you think about that too
much, you might blow it, right?

133
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,590
So Google was interested in that phrase
and for various reasons he took it,

134
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,500
tweaked it a little bit to come
up with the following statement.

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,340
This statement is unprovable.
This statement is unprovable,

136
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,040
which is very important to
notice. If it's, if it's provable,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,990
then it's unprovable. Obviously a little
bit of a word game at Google thought,

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,030
forget words. What would happen if I
converted this statement into math?

139
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,720
Because in math things are
either provable or unprovable.

140
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:25,080
They cannot be both at the same
time. It's either true or false.

141
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,310
And if it's true, we'll then damn it.
You should be able to prove it. Yeah.

142
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,620
So he said, I'm going to
assign a special number,

143
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:36,120
a unique number to make that a purely
mathematical statement by coding it in a

144
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,820
very clever way into
arithmetic. So to be honest,

145
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:41,220
we don't completely get
this part very, very clever.

146
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,620
Once he did his mathy stuff,

147
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:47,280
he had a rigorous mathematical
statement right there on the page.

148
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,030
He looked at it and he realized that
what he just said in math is it the

149
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,620
following statement? This
statement is unprovable is,

150
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,300
it's true because it's actually
unprovable meaning in math,

151
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,360
this statement actually is unprovable

152
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,510
because it is true. The logic of math
will not let you prove that it is true.

153
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,790
So it might be true.
We'll just never know.

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,800
Nothing like that is
supposed to happen in math.

155
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,920
Things are supposed to be true or not
true and you're supposed to be able to

156
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,170
prove every true things as Steve,

157
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:22,440
so if there's something
true that you can't prove,

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,150
that means that the math
is strangely ruefully

159
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,470
incomplete. It's always called is
incompleteness theorem. That's the phrase,

160
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:37,160
the girdle incompleteness Theorem is
that if you have a system of axioms that

161
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,520
are consistent, meaning they
don't contradict themselves,

162
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
they're necessarily incomplete,

163
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,370
that is there a certain statements you
can make within that system that you

164
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:50,570
can't prove or disprove and
all of math has this character.

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,420
This is the big shock that this
is not just about word games,

166
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:55,490
about logic puzzles with barbers.

167
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,620
This is as as devastating for
even just counting for one,

168
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,570
two, three, four. In other words,

169
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:07,010
math is shot through and through with
these kinds of statements that you can't

170
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:09,230
either prove or disprove seriously.

171
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:11,930
The deep thinkers at the
time were amazed at this.

172
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,900
It was recognized as one
of the great ideas of the,

173
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,490
of the 20th century for
sure. It may be of all time.

174
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,930
I mean, maybe I should make
it more concrete there.

175
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,710
There's a question that as far
as I know is still not solved.

176
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:31,210
Steve gave us this example of a problem,
something called gold box conjecture.

177
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,720
It kind of gives you a sense of
what incomplete is, feels like.

178
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,640
So gold box conjecture says that you can
always write any even number as a sum

179
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:43,570
of two prime numbers. So let me
give you some examples of that.

180
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,960
Like say 12 yeah, remember first of all,

181
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,840
prime number means you can
divide it by one and by itself,

182
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,930
like seven is a prime number. You
could divide by one and seven,

183
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,550
but nothing else. Okay. All right,

184
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:59,551
so 12 which is an even number is seven
plus five those those are both prime

185
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,030
numbers. All right, let's try another one.

186
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:06,031
How about a 24 that's 11 plus 13 right?

187
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay.

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Or I'm 36 19 plus 17 hmm.

189
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,810
Any even number. Now, this
has been checked out to, I
don't know what, billions,

190
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,640
trillions, maybe hundreds
of trillion soap.

191
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,820
No one has ever found a
counterexample to gold box conjecture.

192
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,713
And here's the thing.

193
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,070
You might think that either
it's true or it's false.

194
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,790
It might be that this statement,

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,640
every even number is
the sum of two primes.

196
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,580
It might be neither true nor false,

197
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,060
but what we today call
undecidable undecidable is a
term that comes from girdle

198
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,710
and decide, oh yeah. I mean,

199
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:49,711
suppose in some ethereal or transcendental
sense like that is suppose that

200
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,590
there's God and God knows that is true.

201
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,060
Then you know what about us here
among the world of human beings,

202
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,660
all we can do is check each even number
and every time we check it's true.

203
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,390
Would that that would never constitute
a proof because we'd never run out of

204
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,224
numbers.

205
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,000
If you then say that to
understand everything,

206
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,230
you either have to defer to God
who does understand everything.

207
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,240
If you believe in God, but
if you don't believe in God,

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,420
you then have to live with
mystery and not knowing

209
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,273
[inaudible].

210
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,530
Yeah, that's all you can say. I'm going
to say yes. I'm say, Oh huh. Well,

211
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,110
I think you've encapsulated it perfectly
and I think that girdle himself was,

212
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,920
I think a believer in all kinds
of mystical things. Like for him,

213
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,190
this was very freeing and liberating
because it meant that there were,

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,270
that we couldn't be mechanized.
There was profound mystery forever.

215
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,170
Hold, hold on.

216
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,190
I'm on your team here, but let me
just point out something. Google,

217
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,180
when he died, he was not exactly
liberated. He was a paranoid,

218
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,630
like he thought people were trying to
poison him. He starved himself to death.

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,050
He wasn't exactly liberated,
but I choose to be,

220
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,140
I believe it's somewhere
in his tortured mind,

221
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,000
and I guess his mind was pretty tortured.

222
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,360
There was a little fellow
humming a song, a song,

223
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,240
because liberation, this problem
themselves, this problems

224
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,110
[inaudible] problems,
unsolvable problems and solvable

225
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,780
problems.

226
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,030
Thanks to Steve Strogatz. He's
currently working on a new book,

227
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:31,020
which he calls the joy
of x, not sex, just text.

228
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,950
We don't even know what he's
experiencing. The joy of, and Jen 11,

229
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,420
her book about Google is called a
mad man. Dreams of touring machines.

230
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,570
Oh No, it's probably solvable problems.

231
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,700
And finally our last, a
loopy piece. This one, uh,

232
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,990
like the last one involves things
feeding back on themselves. Hm.

233
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,890
Kind of a like your classic
positive feedback loop,
which is what exactly? Well,

234
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,470
it's like when you can do it with
audio. You take a speaker and a mic,

235
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,210
you put the,

236
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,940
you feed the sound from the speaker into
the mic and the backend of the speaker

237
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,250
into the mic. The multiplies
and multiplies and then
then you get something like

238
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,780
payables with horrible,
definitely the painful,

239
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,700
but that kind of feedback loop like in
the case of our next story can also take

240
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:20,170
the pain away. Comes to us from
this lady. I'm Melanie thernstrom.

241
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:23,920
She's a writer, author of a book
on pain called the pain chronicles,

242
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,520
which is a book that began as
a chronicling of her own pain,

243
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,150
which has been suffering from
every day for the last 15 years.

244
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,010
And what sort of pain? Oh,

245
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,600
pain in my neck and right shoulder
and right side of my head.

246
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,650
And you're all at once? Yeah, yeah. It's
all mine. Did it start with something?

247
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:43,540
Did you hit it, hit it
there, or how did it start?

248
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,840
It didn't start with an injury of any
kind, but it did start at a discreet time.

249
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,690
Goes back to 1997 she was New
York at a country house on a date.

250
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,540
It was our first date and
I wanted to impress him,

251
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,920
so I swam across a pond
about a mile across.

252
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,630
Um, was this your idea or was this
his idea? It was my idea. Wow.

253
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,370
That's a different kind of first day.

254
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,780
And you made it all the way there
and back. Yes. And nothing happened,

255
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,790
but that night, what'd you got in the bed?

256
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I was kept awake by this strange burning
sensation in my shoulder and neck.

257
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,870
Um, I didn't get the, the head
pain for like four more years.

258
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,680
Um,

259
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,240
and that particular pain never
went away and got worse over time.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,630
Um, so it was like a
nerve. A nerve was being,

261
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,680
yeah. I mean,

262
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,800
eventually I got an MRI a couple of years
later and there was nerve impingement

263
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,710
in my spine. And so there was, over the
years, she says she's tried everything.

264
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,550
She tried drugs and she's tried physical
therapy. She's tried distraction.

265
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:54,150
Like I'll go to a matinee
and if it's a scary movie,

266
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,480
I just don't stay focused on that
pain. So distraction can work.

267
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,060
But then she says as soon as
she gets out of the movie,

268
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,410
it's back and it's
angry for being ignored.

269
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,590
And sometimes I'd have
the sensation like that.

270
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,360
That right side of my head was like dying.

271
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,480
Like the nerves were dying dead tree.

272
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:19,340
And that image would kind of frightened
me and that thought she'd find that that

273
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:24,341
thought would make the pain worse and
making the pain worse will inspire further

274
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,530
negative fantasies, which will make
it anymore until make the pain worse.

275
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,680
Which one spire morphing? Yes,

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,950
it's out of the loop. Positive feedback
loop. Yeah. In a negative sort of way.

277
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,500
Right. And eventually
Melanie's decided, okay,

278
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm going to write a book about
this. You do some research.

279
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,310
So I was reading a lot about self
inflicted pain and religious rights

280
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,340
and I actually went to witness a Hindi
Festival type who Sam in Kuala Lumpar and

281
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,900
when she saw it really changed
your mind about things.

282
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,050
And you can see video of
this festival on Youtube.

283
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,290
What you see is a dense crowd of
folks. Even the middle of the crowd,

284
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,060
they write these moms doing
insane acts of devotion.

285
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,350
They literally like thread needles
through their tongues, poke skewers,

286
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,800
do their cheeks weighted fished,
hugs dangled from their backs.

287
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,270
And yet she says when she would look
in their faces, they seemed relaxed.

288
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,333
Like their eyes, guys

289
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,090
don't tear up, they don't gasp
for breath. Like really relaxed.

290
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,660
Wasn't just that they
were tolerating the paint.

291
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,110
It's actually seemed like
they weren't in pain at all.

292
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,880
And I would think, okay,

293
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,980
fifth person here has a skewer in
his mouth. I'm [inaudible] pain.

294
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,720
But that stick, you know,

295
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,810
when you can't become a religious Hindi
in order to experience this analgesics

296
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,390
benefits. I, that's cheating.
But I did feel like, okay,

297
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,630
so one way to describe it, um, is faith,

298
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:05,290
but for every way that you can
describe and religious terms.

299
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:10,060
There's also a way you can describe
things in, in scientific terms. Yeah.

300
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,060
And the reality is all of our pain is in
our head, which brings us to this guy.

301
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,300
This is Sean Mackey, chief of the
Stanford Pain Management Division.

302
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,630
And he will tell you that one of the
most basic facts about pain is that it is

303
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:23,070
not purely physical.

304
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,330
We've got signals coming up from the
body that are sending us a message.

305
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,380
Like if you whack a toe,

306
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,230
the signal shoots up some nerves
in your leg into your spine,

307
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,770
and those signals can

308
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,880
virgin our brain. And before
you even feel a thing,

309
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,360
there are a multitude of what I refer
to as little amplifiers throughout our

310
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:44,361
brain that turn up and turn down
the overall pain experience.

311
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
And these amplifiers are things like your
mood, anxiety, depression, attention,

312
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,274
expectations,

313
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,100
all of these things feed back onto that
signal coming up from the body and make

314
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,080
an either boosted,

315
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,250
but bubba past a certain point
where you get a sensation of pain or

316
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,460
they can deaden it down, down, down,
down, down, down, down, down, down to,

317
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,570
or you don't feel anything at all. Huh?

318
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,980
Point is pain is a conversation
between the brain and the body.

319
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,814
And Sean thought,

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,200
what would happen if I actually
let people see that conversation?

321
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,030
Could they, you know,
take control of it? Yeah.

322
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,880
So we did a study in Melanie signed up.

323
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,310
So describe what happens
in this experiment. So you
put in this MRI machine,

324
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,920
we put somebody into a
scanner, a brain scanner,

325
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,780
and you have a screen in front of you.

326
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,680
And what you see on this
screen is something that
normally only the researchers

327
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:39,550
would see. You see your own
brain in real time. Yeah.

328
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,450
Well you're not seeing the whole thing.

329
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,750
You're just seeing one p called
the anterior singular cortex.

330
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,990
There are many parts of the brain that
respond to pain, but that's the one that,

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,920
it's an area that has been shown to
be involved with pain perception,

332
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,090
turning pain up and down. It's thought
to give pain. It's emotional valence,

333
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,260
it's negativity.

334
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,830
And do you actually see an image of this
little piece of your brain right there

335
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,270
in front of you on the screen
and we'd, you actually are,

336
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,180
you're looking at your brain. No,
no. That's confusing to everybody.

337
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,550
So instead we give a, a visual
metaphor. He see an image of, um,

338
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,540
fire claims in an ice cave. I mean,
it is kind of a cartoon flying,

339
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:18,080
but it looks realistic. So you're
flickering flame do the leap into this.

340
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,230
Do the leap. They leave.

341
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,640
And the more activation
there is in that region,

342
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,590
the higher the plane go.

343
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,810
So Melanie is lying in the scanner
watching her own pain, flames.

344
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,110
And Sean gives her a set of
instructions. We say, okay,

345
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,280
we want you to imagine that you're
sitting in a nice warm, soothing Jacuzzi.

346
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,980
You know, this branding is a warm
bath. This burning is very relaxing.

347
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:48,100
I'm relaxing into it. Yeah.
But pretty soon it was like

348
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,110
hot, Kinda hot. Skeldon
me how I get to get out.

349
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,890
And before she knew it, the flames were
rallying. So Sean said, okay. Okay.

350
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,890
So how about you're lying
on a beautiful beach?

351
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,170
Yes. You know,

352
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:08,171
this breathing is a pleasant Suntan and
the sand is nice and warm and pleasant.

353
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,470
Um,

354
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm gonna look so good in my new bathing
suit if I just keep getting burnt like

355
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,080
this

356
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,380
sunburn. Alright.

357
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,790
And then the flames
would kind of go crazy.

358
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,080
Her thoughts kept slipping
out of her control. You know,

359
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,590
if every time she would see those
flames rise, she would think, oh no,

360
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:31,290
the flames are rising. Which
would make them rise even more.

361
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,200
And then more and more until she
had this bonfire on the screen,

362
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,110
you're immediately struck by
the, they look like the flames,

363
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,720
where you're going to the flames,
where you're burned at the stake.

364
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,640
I've been reading a lot of
lives or saints at that point.

365
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,770
But then Melanie had an idea,
she said, why don't I take this,

366
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,810
this negative image and flip it?

367
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,930
And then I started trying to move into
the idea of being a saint or a martyr and

368
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,760
that I, you know,

369
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,800
believe that I would have no cane
and that I was protected by my faith

370
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,720
in his. Melanie started
thinking about this.

371
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,560
She could see the flames
dying down just a little bit,

372
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,400
which is fine cause I, this isn't,
you know, you don't know me,

373
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,300
but this isn't actually like part of
my fantasy life. But she thought, okay,

374
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,230
I'll try this. Let me keep
going in that kind of feeling.

375
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,890
So I was trying to pick one of the
few prayers I knew. I knew. Um,

376
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,080
I mean I didn't, I'm half
Jewish, half Christian,

377
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,380
I was three. I'm not settled in
onto what kind of martyr I was.

378
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,080
You know, I started thinking she's not
really be a Jewish martyr since you know,

379
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,150
if you're half Jewish mothers,
Jews, it's the right side. Really.

380
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm Jewish more than Christian.

381
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,000
And then I started thinking about Jewish
martyrs and like what prayers do they

382
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,640
say? And, and as she added and right

383
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,610
advise details that continued to
make the flames go down, okay,

384
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,270
I'm in the right brain state.
Let me do more of that.

385
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,130
So Melanie finally decided, okay,

386
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm going to be this one particular
Jewish martyrs names Akiva, Ben Joseph.

387
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,970
He was burned at the stake by the
Romans for teaching the Torah.

388
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,140
And there's a particular legend that just
as the executioner's about to set fire

389
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,760
to the logs right underneath his feet.

390
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,790
Akiva stared the execution or in the eyes
and smiled and the execution was like,

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,430
why are you smiling?

392
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,660
You're about to be burned alive and keep
us said all my life when I said those

393
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:33,110
words, you shall love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul.

394
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,810
I was sad because I thought,

395
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,410
when shall I be able to
fulfill that command and now
that I'm giving my life and

396
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:46,010
my resolution remains firm,
why shouldn't I smile?

397
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,420
By the time Melanie had this
fantasy built up in her mind,

398
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,220
she looked over at the flames and
she noticed they were almost gone.

399
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,330
Zero, zero pain for the first time.

400
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,530
She'd taken control of
it. I felt like, wow,

401
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,860
I am watching my brain
thinking my thoughts and I am

402
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,830
changing my thoughts by thinking
and watching myself do that.

403
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:19,700
So you are looking at yourself, looking
at yourself, looking at yourself,

404
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,440
looking at yourself. Yes.

405
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,880
Peering inside and seeing
the ghost in the machine.

406
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,860
I felt, you know, like someone
taking their first step on the moon.

407
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,890
Like I am watching my brain thinking my
thoughts and I am thinking my thoughts,

408
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,590
changing my thought by thinking
and watching my thoughts,

409
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,450
watching my brain,

410
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:46,430
changing my thoughts by thinking
and lodging myself do this

411
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,440
well. I needed to establish, I need
to establish this, that once you were,

412
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,270
did your two sessions and you're
in between exercises without this,

413
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,280
all these Gizmos, could you,
could you address your pain? Yeah.

414
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,360
Better? No. Like you think, well, okay,

415
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,080
can't you just get the
feedback from your own body,

416
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,260
but somehow this sensation isn't quite
direct enough that I think that you could

417
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:20,540
do it without the visual feedback.
Before that moment in that machine,

418
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,890
it was, um, power.

419
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,210
[inaudible] my name is

420
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,800
[inaudible]. I am changing
my last five words

421
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,501
before we go.

422
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:42,910
A very special thanks to our singers who
joined us this hour from the New Music

423
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,210
Ensemble at LaGuardia High School.
They are Kelly FMU, Julian Sodo.

424
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,130
You like Greenho, Juliet, Eagan,

425
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,610
Ruby from those guys wrote and performed
all the music between the pieces you

426
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:55,000
guys rock and thanks to the guy who
teaches them and who organize this.

427
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,990
Mr Robert [inaudible].
