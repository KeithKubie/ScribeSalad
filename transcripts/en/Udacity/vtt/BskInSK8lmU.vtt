00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.230
At its core, a network serves to route packets

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.760
between machines on the network. let's take a look

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.540
at how packets are moved across networks. It's more

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.670
complicated than it sounds at first, but quite fascinating.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.850
&gt;&gt; That's right. To even reach your screen, the packets that make up

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.690
this video likely traveled across at least four or five networks, if not more.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.710
&gt;&gt; You'll learn how that works in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.220
the routing videos on BGP, a routing protocol.
