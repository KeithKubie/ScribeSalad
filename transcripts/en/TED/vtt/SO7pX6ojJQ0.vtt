00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:14.261
So what I'm doing

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.574
is a thought experiment.

00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:22.578
Now you may know of or have read

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.016
this book by this guy.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.918
It's probably the first
and maybe the only bestseller

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:29.547
ever written about economics.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.092
And you probably know a bit
about what it says.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.637
It talks about how nations
all over the world will prosper

00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.647
through the individual pursuit
of individual profit.

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:48.814
Individual profit will be the mechanism
for the prosperity of the world.

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:52.110
But the funny thing about Adam Smith

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:54.632
is that he was a stay-at-home kind of guy.

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:58.308
He actually never went
further from Edinburgh

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:00.510
than France and Switzerland.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:05.843
So my thought experiment is to imagine

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.309
what would have happened
if Adam Smith had visited Africa.

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:14.862
And fortunately, there's
actually an easy answer,

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:20.925
because the Arab lawyer
and traveler Ibn Battuta

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:25.765
traveled down the east coast
of Africa in the 14th century,

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.420
and what he found when he got
to Mogadishu was a market,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:30.947
and he wrote about it.

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:34.940
And basically, merchant ships
came to the harbor,

00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:36.823
and they weren't even allowed to land.

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:38.724
They had to drop anchor in the harbor,

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:40.386
and boats came out to them,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.224
and locals picked them and said,
"You are my guest, I am now your broker."

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:49.764
And they had to do business
through the local broker,

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:53.273
and if they went around that
and didn't do business through the broker,

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:57.664
they could go to court,
and the deal would be canceled,

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:59.526
and they would be thrown out of town.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.304
And through this mechanism,
everyone prospered.

00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:06.357
And so if that was Adam Smith,
he might look like this guy

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.941
and say, "Ah! That's a mutual aid society.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:12.596
That's a share-the-wealth free market."

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.262
And when I put this question
to Christian [Benimana],

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:18.758
who had the stage
at the beginning of this session,

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:21.655
he responded that if Adam Smith
had come to Africa,

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:25.875
there would have been a sharing economy
long before Airbnb and Uber.

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.199
And that's true.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.509
So if we put this to work today,

00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:32.780
it would be very interesting.

00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.484
There would be a lot of money
flowing into the countries.

00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:40.968
These are just figures of 10 percent
of exports in these countries.

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:47.969
So the interesting thing is that
this mutual aid economy still exists,

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:51.827
and we can find examples of it
in the strangest places.

00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.305
So, this is Alaba International Market.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.936
It's the largest
electronics market in West Africa.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.338
It's 10,000 merchants,

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:03.428
they do about four billion dollars
of turnover every year.

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:06.086
And they say they are
ardent apostles of Adam Smith:

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.818
competition is great,
we're all in it individually,

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:10.454
government doesn't help us.

00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:14.104
But the interesting reality is
that when I asked further,

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:17.078
that's not what grew the market at all.

00:03:17.777 --> 00:03:20.681
There's a behind-the-scenes principle

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:24.530
that enables this market to grow.

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:28.529
And they do claim -- you know,
this is an interesting juxtaposition

00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:31.940
of the King James Bible
and "How To Sell Yourself."

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:34.628
That's what they say is their message.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:38.769
But in reality, this market
is governed by a sharing principle.

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:44.483
Every merchant, when you ask them,
"How did you get started in global trade?"

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:47.678
they say, "Well, when
my master settled me."

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:52.463
And when I finally got it into my head
to ask, "What is this 'settling?'"

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:55.161
it turns out that when you've
done your apprenticeship

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:56.704
with someone you work for,

00:03:56.728 --> 00:04:00.722
they are required -- required --
to set you up in business.

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:03.297
That means paying your rent
for two or three years

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.349
and giving you a cash infusion

00:04:05.373 --> 00:04:08.240
so you can go out in the world
and start trading.

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:12.116
That's locally generated
venture capital. Right?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.518
And I can say with almost certainty

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:20.435
that the Igbo apprenticeship system
that governs Alaba International Market

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.873
is the largest business incubator
platform in the world.

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:30.465
And there are other sharing
economies that we look for --

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:33.860
merry-go-rounds, which are found
in almost every shantytown.

00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:37.178
They have different names in
other cultures; this is the Kenyan name.

00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:38.785
It's a way of generating cash.

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.544
It's a kitty -- people throw money
into a pot once a week,

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:44.209
and once a week, one member
of the group gets the money,

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.427
and they can spend it on
whatever they need to.

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.038
And there's also something
called "acequias,"

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:53.404
and that is a Spanish word, but it
comes from the North African Arabic;

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:55.056
"saqiya" means "water wheel."

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.696
And what the acequia is
is a sharing system for scarce water.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.062
It's migrated from North Africa to Spain,

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:05.698
and from Spain to the west
of the United States,

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.150
where it still is used.

00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:11.646
And it shares water by need

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.818
rather than by who was there first.

00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:19.133
And contrary, with all due respect,
to what Llew [Claasen] said

00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:23.920
when he talked about blockchains
and cryptocurrencies yesterday,

00:05:23.944 --> 00:05:26.935
there is no tragedy of the commons.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:31.694
People in acequias have been
commonly managing scarce water resources

00:05:31.718 --> 00:05:34.943
for hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of years.

00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:41.361
So taking this thought experiment,
I wanted to go a little bit further

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:48.160
and suggest that these things
are managed communally,

00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:54.301
and they are taking care of
scarce capital, scarce cash

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:55.811
and scarce resources.

00:05:57.383 --> 00:06:02.391
And it seems to me that we have
actually two kinds of capitalism.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.516
We have the capitalism of the top up.

00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:09.345
And these are really
interesting statistics,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:15.597
because three one-thousandths
of one percent of the Nigerian population

00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:20.902
controls wealth equal to one-fourth
of the GDP of the country.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.097
One one-hundredth of one percent
of the Kenyan population

00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:30.741
controls wealth equal to 75 percent
of the GDP of the country.

00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:34.309
That's the capitalism of top up.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.927
And everyone else is with this guy,

00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:40.474
selling board games
and bodybuilding equipment

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:43.385
in a go-slow on the highway in Lagos.

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.098
And when you're selling board games
and bodybuilding equipment in a go-slow,

00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:51.665
that traffic jam is really,
really, really bad, right?

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.211
Those of us in this sphere of the economy

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:57.626
are caught in what I call
"the capitalism of decay,"

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.623
because there's no way
to rise up and get out of it,

00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:05.096
because they're lacking the resources
that we talked about

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.681
in those sharing economies.

00:07:06.705 --> 00:07:08.683
And they're tripped up

00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:13.745
by the thesis of cassava and capitalism,

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:17.527
that cassava has to be processed
in order not to be poisonous,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.275
and I would argue that, similarly,

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:26.338
the market economy needs to be processed
in order to be fair to everyone.

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:33.402
So we have to look at what I call
the "bottom down economy."

00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:37.266
These are these sharing models
that exist out there

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.635
that need to be propagated
and used and scaled.

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:42.930
OK?

00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:45.056
And if we propagate these things,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.064
we can begin to bring
infrastructure to everyone,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.633
and that will ensure that communities

00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:54.484
are leading their own development,

00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:58.264
which is, I believe, what
we need in the world,

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:00.475
and, I would suggest,
what we need in Africa.

00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:05.201
I wanted to quote Steve Biko,

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:08.002
and I thought it was really
important to quote Steve Biko,

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:12.345
because next month,
September 12 to be exact,

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:17.299
is the 40th anniversary of his murder
by the South African state.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.139
And you can read the quote.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:23.208
He basically said that
we're not here to compete.

00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:27.983
And I love this quote: "... to make us
a community of brothers and sisters

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.096
jointly involved in the quest
for a composite answer

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.960
to the varied problems of life."

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:37.016
And he also said that
"the great powers of the world

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.870
have done wonders in giving us
an industrial and military look, ..."

00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:44.593
and we don't have to copy
that military-industrialist complex,

00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:47.063
because Africa can do things differently

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:50.784
and restore the humanity of the world.

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:54.051
And so what I want to suggest here

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:56.925
is that we have an opportunity,

00:08:58.314 --> 00:09:01.816
that we are all here
in the mutual landscape

00:09:02.592 --> 00:09:04.443
to be able to do things,

00:09:05.618 --> 00:09:08.484
and that the journey starts now.

00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:10.476
Thank you very much.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.988
(Applause)
