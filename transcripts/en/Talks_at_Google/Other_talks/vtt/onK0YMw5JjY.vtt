RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.830
Thanks for coming.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.310
So this is another great
series of the Talks

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.190
at Google series where we
invite exciting [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.170
of speakers to Google to talk
about a great person's story.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.210
So I have two guests that I'm
very honored to announce today.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.140
It's Ruha.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.930
Ruha was born in
Syria in Al-Hasakah

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.520
and she had to flee
Syria during the war.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.710
And she didn't only
flee alone; she

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.040
flew with two sisters,
three cousins,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.080
and a 96-year-old grandmother
on a rubber boat to Europe.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.010
So she's going to tell
us about that story, how

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910
she managed to do that, what
did that mean for her life.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.700
And also she is now
working in a Swiss NGO

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.330
to help other refugees, and
she is a translator there.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.650
So she hears not only her own--

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.080
she not only has
her own memories,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.290
but also hears a lot
from other refugees

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.462
and has insights based on that.

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.170
And to end on a happy
note, I can already

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.410
tell you their family
was, in the end,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.880
happily reunited in Sweden.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
So it is somewhat of a happy
ending of a difficult story.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.720
So welcome to Ruha.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.350
And I have Ayesha over there--

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.640
Ayesha Keller.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
She is Scottish, so she was
born in Edinburgh in '89.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
She helped found an
NGO that takes care

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
for refugees that are
affected by the Syrian crisis.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.720
builds-- For example,
she has projects

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.750
to build better housing--
dignified housing in Greece.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.690
So that's a big part of the
story you're going to tell us--

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.090
what you did there,
and how that helps.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.310
It's an NGO called
Together for Better Days.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.880
We're going to hear about that
NGO specifically also a bit.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.300
And actually, Ayesha also spent
a year on the ground in Greece.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.600
It's a very
practical experience.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.390
So I'm going hand
it over to Ayesha

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.847
to please tell us
about your story.

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:08.680
AYESHA KELLER: Thank
you very much, Raphael.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.282
And thank you,
everyone, for coming.

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:13.230
Shall I-- thank you.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.940
So we are going to tell
you our personal story

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.092
of this experience.

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:23.550
And then at the end, we'll be
very open to taking questions

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.620
as well.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.560
So my story starts in Edinburgh,
in Scotland, where I grew up.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.920
And I had a very
happy childhood--

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580
a very protected childhood--

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.800
in a way, for many of us,
a very normal childhood.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.060
And the closest I got to knowing
about war and the atrocities

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.510
that connected to that
was in my history lessons,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.312
where I quite naively felt that
that was something in the past,

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:49.270
and we had obviously
learned from our mistakes,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.380
and I would never--

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380
I would luckily, would
never have to experience

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.020
something like that again.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.320
As my activism was occasionally
marching with some friends

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.820
to make poverty
history, or whatever

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.170
it was that was happening
in the town at the time--

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.730
but yeah, I didn't expect
to ever really have

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.780
to deal with these things.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.590
And I was very focused on
wanting to start a business.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.620
So I went to university.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.020
I studied in
Sunderland and Berlin,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.060
and I also lived in Newcastle.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870
And studied business and did
quite a lot of traveling.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.910
I also, after school,
went on a gap year

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.680
and traveled around the world.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.560
And for me, freedom
of movement was just

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.970
something that was very
intrinsic to being human.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.850
It was way before I even knew
of this expression of freedom

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.390
of movement.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.830
I've lived in seven
different countries, traveled

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.640
in over 40--

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.820
it just seems quite
a normal thing to do.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.060
So following my studies-- or
actually, during my studies,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.930
I did an internship not so
far from here at the Bodensee.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.250
Really beautiful place.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
And there was also where I,
at the time, met my boyfriend.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.810
And after finishing my studies,
we moved back to Zurich.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.500
So I actually lived here
in Zurich for two years.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.830
And my time in Switzerland
was really nice.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.090
It's a beautiful country.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.670
I had a very comfortable life.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.700
I had a good job in a very
corporate environment.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.519
And I had good career
progression opportunities.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.580
Life was good.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.290
Comfortable.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.060
Possibly, after a while, I got
the feeling I was in a bubble.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.650
And more and more, I was
hearing about the news around me

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.608
of what was happening in
the rest of the world.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.780
And I just realized that I
was in a very small percentage

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.069
of people that had
a very easy life,

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.110
and that maybe that wasn't
the case for everyone.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.260
And I just wanted to know
more about the world.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.440
So that drove me to quit my
job and leave everything behind

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.160
in Switzerland.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.576
And for the next
couple of months,

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.880
I was traveling through
Europe, interviewing

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.237
a lot of different companies,
a lot of startups all over--

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:01.320
and finding out about all
these different projects

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.236
and innovations and
things that were going on,

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.770
which were very interesting.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.342
And during that
time, in November--

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:08.550
actually it was before then--

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.860
we saw that first
picture of Alan Kurdi

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.350
washed up on the
shores of Turkey.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.860
And that's when the world media
became aware of the crisis,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.590
and so I also became
aware of the crisis.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.180
So it was in the
back of my mind,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.595
and I had been thinking
for a while, yeah,

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:24.720
I like going to Greece;
that could be interesting--

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.100
or maybe Calais or maybe--

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.710
but didn't actually
take that step.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.570
So when I saw a friend
of mine in November

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.080
had posted on Facebook
saying, I'm going to Greece.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.289
And I commented saying,
that sounds amazing.

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.330
And she was like, oh, why
don't you come with me?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.420
And five days later, I
was on a flight to Lesvos.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.780
Only for a week
just to go and see,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.310
because I felt that the
media representation must

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.500
be completely exaggerated.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.100
There's no way
that in my Europe,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.210
that respects human rights
and everything else,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.220
that this could
possibly be happening.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.120
So I just thought, might
as well go and have a look.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.930
When I got there, what I
experienced and what I saw

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.730
touched and moved
me in such a way

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.370
that one year later,
I was still there.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.680
So when we arrived in Greece, I
arrived at around the same time

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.722
as thousands of
other volunteers who

00:06:18.722 --> 00:06:21.180
were arriving from all over
the world, and at the same time

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.760
that thousands of refugees
were also arriving.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.540
So it was a big meeting of
people on a very small tourist

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.480
island.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.180
And as you can see
here in the background,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.330
those are mountains of Turkey.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.200
And on the left, we've got this
little rubber dinghy and one

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.800
of the border patrol boats.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.510
Most volunteers would arrive by
flying in on a budget airline

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.440
or getting a 10-euro
ferry from Turkey.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.820
For the refugees, they
had to risk their lives

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.440
on incredibly overcrowded boats,
costing thousands per person,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.410
depending which smuggler
they haggled with.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.730
So it was a very, very
surreal experience.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.570
And arriving there and
seeing what was going on,

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.780
it just felt unreal.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.620
And I couldn't quite
come to terms with it.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.814
And it was because of
that that, together

00:07:15.814 --> 00:07:17.230
with other independent
volunteers,

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.440
we came together
and started an NGO.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.700
It was not planned.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.930
It was very much in response
to what was happening.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.850
So in Greece, many,
many people arrived.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:35.640
And we had-- yeah, it was one
of the biggest migrations we've

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.470
had since the Second World War.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.180
And people would
arrive on the coasts,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.020
and then once they had
arrived on the coast,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.228
they would all come to Moria.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:45.740
Moria was a central
registration center,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.140
so everybody would
come through there.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.760
We had volunteers also really
coming from everywhere,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.340
like I said.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.309
So in Moria, we set
up an organization.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.350
At the time, it was called
Better Days for Moria.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.050
And we had around--

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.760
it's hard to know
the exact numbers

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.010
because we didn't start
registrations till much later,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.350
because it was really
a grassroots response.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.650
So the process and
systems grew as we grew.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.070
But we estimate probably
around 5,000 volunteers

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.850
came through our projects, and
around about the time, 200,000

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.590
refugees were arriving and went
through the project as well.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.365
So a lot of people from a
lot of different countries.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.220
While I was in
Switzerland, I lived

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.800
what one might, in many
ways, say was a normal life.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.900
But in many ways, I felt
very disconnected from life.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.380
And what I experienced in Lesvos
was so real, and so moving,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.480
and so touching.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.000
And this connection
with people was

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.970
just really beautiful and
tragic at the same time.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.970
And this way that you would
build trust and connection

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.320
with people that you never
met before was really quite--

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.130
very, very special.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.040
And so, in a way, felt more
real than anything else

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.840
I had experienced,
even though we were

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.050
in this very strange situation.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.380
Yeah.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.120
I really like this picture.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.410
It's just one of
those experiences

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.020
of one of the many,
many, many people I met.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.040
When people arrive, they often
had very wet shoes and feet.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.010
And in the middle of the winter,
it gets very cold in Greece.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.530
A lot of people don't realize
that it goes to minus degrees

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.277
and snows.

00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:35.860
So one of the main things we did
when people got off the boats

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.410
was putting emergency
foil into the shoes

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.730
and giving people new socks.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.530
So one lady I met--

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.880
never met her again.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.430
No idea where she is,
but we had millions

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.950
of these connections
going on, which I think

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.050
was very beautiful.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.250
So this is the camp.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.010
This is the camp we set up
as Better Days for Moria.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.110
It was the Olive Grove camp.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.710
So at the peak of the
arrivals in October,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.190
there were up to 10,000
people arriving per day.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.380
The Moria registration
center officially

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.090
had capacity for a few hundred,
and if you crammed it full,

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.890
you could fit about 3,000.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.264
But either way, you've
got a lot of extra people

00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:15.430
who are not going to fit in.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.010
So they're waiting on the
surrounding Olive Grove,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.909
full up to a week,
sometimes longer,

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:23.200
depending how quickly the
registrations were happening,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.115
depending--

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:25.990
we never really knew.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.240
When there was a
government visit,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.300
it all went really quickly.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.841
When there wasn't
a government visit,

00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:30.950
it could take a long time.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.260
It really depended.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.820
So we set up an
emergency response camp.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.150
When we arrived in November,
the situation wasn't nice.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.250
It was basically
full of rubbish.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.960
People were burning
rubbish to stay warm.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.930
There was no proper
accommodation.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.130
There was no medical cover.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.109
There was no food.

00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:50.900
There were a lot of
volunteers sporadically

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.316
turning up and
trying to help out,

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:54.190
but there were no
real systems in place.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.090
So we founded the
organization as a way

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.350
to bring some
structure to the chaos.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.310
So we then, over time, together
with many other partners

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.300
and many other organizations,
had 24-hour medical care,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.180
24-hour clothing
distribution, 24-hour food,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.650
24-hour information, shelter,
everything like that.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.110
So if people arrived at
2:00 AM, which was usually

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.940
the case-- people came at night.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.169
Really wet, really cold,
in the middle of winter,

00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:22.960
and there was a real
danger of hypothermia.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.020
We could get people into dry
clothes as quickly as possible,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.444
give them a warm
soup or warm chai,

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:29.860
and give them the
information they

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.800
needed as to what the next
steps were, and move people on.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.160
So that was our main focus--

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.620
was the survival.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.420
However, what underpinned that,
and always underpinned that,

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.420
was we also wanted to
make people feel welcome.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.030
So the idea was, one,
we want you to survive--

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.970
really important,
and was a major topic

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.750
that we needed to work on.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.910
But we also wanted to have
it like an oasis of warmth,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.250
in a way, in a very
difficult journey.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.572
We knew people had a
hard journey behind them.

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:01.780
We knew they would have a
hard journey ahead of them.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.690
And we wanted a time when they
could come together and just

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.570
feel human and be
recognized as a human

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.030
being with hopes and
dreams and aspirations,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.750
and not just as a statistic or
as a number on a registration

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.710
paper.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.210
So a lot of what we did as well
was creating this community.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.810
And most of our
services could not

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.790
have run if we didn't also have
the support of the refugees,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.320
especially translation.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.360
But everything-- so
clothing distribution, food

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.640
distribution-- we really
worked together as a community,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.520
and that was very beautiful.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.890
And I must say, we often got--

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.130
we had mainly single
men on our camp

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.010
because the priority
for inside the compound

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.147
was for family,
infants and children.

00:12:44.147 --> 00:12:45.730
So at night, it was
mainly single men,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.199
and they get so much bad press.

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.240
And people were like, oh
it'd be really dangerous

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.791
if you have thousands
of single men

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.290
from all over the
world in one camp.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.440
They probably
fight all the time.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.690
Absolutely not the case.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.046
We had very little conflict.

00:12:58.046 --> 00:12:59.920
Only when all the borders
closed and everyone

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.934
felt really desperate did any
kind of violence break out.

00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:05.350
And even then, it was never
towards any of the volunteers,

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.600
and always quite more
in a protest manner

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.730
rather than in aggression
towards anyone.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.780
It was a really
weirdly beautiful place

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.354
in amongst this complete chaos.

00:13:20.354 --> 00:13:22.900
Yeah, this was our tea tent
where everyone who arrived

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.770
got served warm tea.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.410
Then the borders
started closing.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.310
And, well, it already
started for some people

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.520
around Christmas when the North
Africans could no longer cross,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.790
and the Pakistanis
could no longer cross,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.530
and the Afghans could
no longer cross.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.000
I still remember the
morning I came up onto camp,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.240
and there were just so many
Afghans outside the info tent.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.884
And I was like, what's going on?

00:13:47.884 --> 00:13:50.050
And they said, oh, our
friends at the Idomeni border

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.920
have just told us that the
Afghans can no longer cross.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.086
So I called one of my friends
at the Idomeni border.

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:56.252
I was like, what's going on?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.820
They said, yeah,
they just closed it,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.195
but then they've
just reopened it

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:01.050
and let a few families through.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.860
And now they've literally
just closed it again.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.810
We're not really sure.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.040
There was no official news.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.720
So Moria was really
a place where

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.610
you could feel the crisis.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.980
We found out about it
before it hit the news.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.380
It was instant.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.350
We're really this
bottleneck where you really

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.260
felt what was happening
along the whole route.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.130
So once that happened,
then the EU-Turkey deal

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.080
came into effect
in March, which was

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.080
this agreement between
Europe and Turkey

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.720
that Turkey would try and
prevent people from coming.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.460
And in return, Europe would
give them a lot of money

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.450
and they would resettle
people legally.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.080
Unfortunately, it
doesn't really work.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.370
And even then, we were
very, very skeptical of it.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.530
The difficult thing
about the EU-Turkey deal

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.540
was it came into
effect overnight

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.790
before the papers had
even been released,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.790
so nobody actually
knew what it was.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.460
They just knew it was a
thing that had been agreed.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.940
So the lawyers were all
scratching their heads

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.140
looking very confused.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.570
The politicians were
making grand announcements

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.730
about how this was going
to solve everything.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.360
And the people who were
actually responsible,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.270
like the police and the
border controls and the army,

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.080
just didn't really know.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.792
And so almost in a
kind of let's make

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.840
sure we don't make
a mistake response,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.580
they just locked the
whole thing down.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.620
And overnight, it
became a prison.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.430
So suddenly, all the
children, the parents,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.400
the unaccompanied minors, the
families, the men-- everybody

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.110
got locked into this
detention center.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.850
It was incredibly overfilled.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.550
And suddenly, our only
way to reach these people

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.030
was through fences again.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.020
So we were having to pass
clothes and food and so

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.610
on through the fences.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.070
And it was very sad,
because we had finally

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.940
established systems that worked,
and we felt quite confident.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.050
And then overnight,
it all got destroyed.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.270
In retaliation to
that, there was a lot

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.330
of protests inside the camp.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.220
Most of the human
rights experts--

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.070
if not all of them-- plus
many of the world leader--

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.350
well, not world
leaders, but experts

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.420
in the field of human
rights and law and so on,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.000
were saying that
the law was illegal.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.860
Well, it wasn't a law;
it was an agreement.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.164
And everybody was very confused
as to what was happening next

00:16:13.164 --> 00:16:14.080
and what would happen.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.121
So there was a lot of
peaceful protests happening

00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:18.750
inside the camp for weeks.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.600
This eventually--
after over a month

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.550
of nothing changing,
and not enough

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.800
food, and a lot of other
problems-- escalated

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.920
into rioting and more
extreme protesting

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.870
where things were burnt down.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.630
Unfortunately, that's
incredibly effective.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.960
Suddenly, the press turns up.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.760
There's pressure, and
people were allowed out.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.790
So unfortunately, often
the peaceful protests

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.730
have very little effect,
and violence does.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.250
Again no one was hurt.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:52.700
It was just burning down things
and making big "notice us"

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.470
moves.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.180
Even when it was
open, it was still

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.136
kind of a detention
center because in order

00:16:58.136 --> 00:16:59.510
to go through the
asylum process,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.630
you have to wait for
your number to be called.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.630
And the numbers get called
over the loudspeaker.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.960
So if you go into town and
you missed your number being

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.140
called, you missed your chance.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.109
So even though officially
the gates were open,

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:13.339
the systems weren't in place to
actually allow people to leave.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.710
This meant we weren't
very happy either.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.980
Suddenly, I ended up
at many, many protests.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.134
Almost every day,
we were protesting,

00:17:21.134 --> 00:17:23.300
speaking to journalists,
trying to raise our voices,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.829
saying this is not OK.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.819
We're not OK with this.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.010
I never thought I was going
to end up an activist.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.550
I thought I would spend most
of my life in a business suit.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.830
And instead, suddenly, I
was there running around

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.710
with "we love you"
signs and a whistle,

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.570
trying to attract
attention to the fact

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.600
that I was not
OK, as a European,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.620
having human rights
just walked all over.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.920
During this time, I also
spent a lot of time speaking

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.080
to the press.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.470
And they really came
from all over the world--

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.440
so this was Australia,
America, Germany, UK--

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.250
really, everywhere.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.590
I did a lot of interviews.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.390
And this was really nice.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.950
And it was a very positive
experience for the refugees

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.850
as well because it felt like
they hadn't been forgotten

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.460
and there were people who cared.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.586
Unfortunately now, people have
pretty much forgotten about it.

00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:16.210
It's not in the news
very much anymore.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.410
The conditions in
Moria now are worse

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.870
than they were a year ago.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.500
And yet, you rarely
hear about it.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.180
So it's actually a
shame that the media

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:30.150
has gone on to other stories,
like whatever else is going on.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.200
So once Moria closed
and we realized

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.310
that we couldn't continue
doing anything there,

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.790
we lovingly said goodbye to
Lesvos, set up a legal program

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.847
to help the people inside Moria,
and went on to northern Greece,

00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:46.430
which is where the main things
were happening with the Idomeni

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.960
border.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.710
There, we set up a new
pilot project and refugee

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.550
accommodation.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.650
This was quite an
interesting project

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.670
because it was a
public-private partnership.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.250
So it was an official Greek camp
recognized by the government,

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:05.000
but funded by philanthropy money
from a Canadian philanthropy

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.280
organization and
run by volunteers,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.540
which was our organization.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.610
We rebranded this
Together for Better Days

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.010
because we were no longer
in Moria, and together

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.830
with the residents.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.830
So here is one of
the forums we had.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.790
And we really worked at
building dignified systems.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.900
So rather than
handing out clothes,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.664
we actually created
a clothing shop

00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:25.080
where people have
credits, so they

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.426
can come in and buy things.

00:19:27.426 --> 00:19:28.800
Actually really
recently, there's

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.320
a new development
from Techfugees,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.160
who came in and did a study.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.670
And they have set
up an IT system now

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.115
to be able to manage
all of that properly.

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:44.490
So there's a lot of innovation
and some really cool stuff

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.210
happening.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.150
Again, our focus
was wanting to make

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.310
sure the basic minimum
standards were met.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.392
We were the only camp
at the time-- possibly

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.850
still are-- in
northern Greece that

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.792
meets the basic
humanitarian standards that

00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:57.790
was set up by Sphere,
even though they're

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.900
very, very basic.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.790
And once we had that covered,
like no one is going to die,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.580
then the focus is on education,
activities, and so on.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.290
Basically, to keep
people entertained

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.630
until they get their decision,
which could be months.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.679
And nobody knows.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.970
They're literally just waiting.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.650
They get a phone call,
and then they can go.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.816
But there's no appointment,
so you're literally just

00:20:18.816 --> 00:20:19.680
waiting and waiting.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.090
And it can be a month.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.030
It can be a year.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.230
So there was lot of
frustration and boredom.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.407
So that was one of the
focuses, on what can we

00:20:27.407 --> 00:20:28.365
do while we're waiting.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.860
The food was amazing.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.430
[CHUCKLES] Really one of
the big things we had is we

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.160
realized, for people, cooking
is a very important part

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.710
of culture.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.710
So we set up, again, a
market where people could

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.420
buy their stuff with credits.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.670
And then they could cook
in the communal kitchen,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.680
and would have big
community feasts.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.040
And the really nice
thing about Elpida--

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.960
it means "hope" in Greek--

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.640
but the really nice thing was
that it was a community project

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.265
where people worked
together, and where

00:20:55.265 --> 00:21:01.020
we worked with the
community to run this camp.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.770
It worked really well.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.260
The idea was it
would be a pilot,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.750
and it would be rolled out
across many other places.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:12.090
Unfortunately, it
hasn't for many reasons,

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.570
I guess-- mainly political.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.300
So it's still there,
but it doesn't

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.300
look like it's going to
be copied at the moment.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:19.740
We'll see.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.240
We'll see.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.510
But the options are there.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.843
I think one thing that's
really important to be aware of

00:21:23.843 --> 00:21:26.710
is that most of the
problems have been solved.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.020
The solutions are there.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.790
It's always the question if you
want to implement it or not.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.780
And that's the main barriers
that we come across.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.290
And it's the main reason
why I left Greece.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.330
And I'm now going
around Europe talking

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.330
because I want to make people
aware that the solutions are

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:42.830
there.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.090
We need to have a will
to implement them.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.490
So my real wish
for the world would

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.110
be to end all war and conflict,
and all of those bad things.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.350
But I know that's very
idealistic and Utopian,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.850
and is probably not
going to happen.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.160
But in the meantime,
I think what I really

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.050
hope is that we have this
courage to look for solutions

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.240
and not to give up, and to
keep our minds open and curious

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.600
and awake to try and find
solutions to these problems,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.490
because they are there.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.430
And we just need to have
the will to implement them.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:30.462 --> 00:22:31.670
RUHA SAID: Thank you, Ayesha.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:36.360
I would like to thank everyone
to show up again, once more.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.280
My name is Ruha Said.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.490
I am from Al-Hasakah in Syria.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.350
That is in the northern
eastern corner of Syria.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.610
I grew up in a nice city--

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.880
actually a quite big city,
but the society I grew up in

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.720
was a simple society full
of many, many relatives.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.290
I had a very happy childhood.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.270
I went to private
primary school, and then

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.000
to a governmental school
secondary, and high school.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.980
And then I had to
move to Damascus

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.253
to study at the university.

00:23:19.253 --> 00:23:26.940
This is the Art and Humanitic
Science of Damascus University.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.370
This is the facility.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:35.400
And the society in Damascus
was much more different

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.490
than the society in Al-Hasakah.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.935
It was a bigger society.

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:43.410
We were students
from all over Syria,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.950
together sitting in
the same auditorium.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.900
So it was a little
bit difficult for me

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.260
to blend in among
all these students.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:00.900
But I, in some way, I
managed to get used to it.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.170
And I made some
good friends, but I

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:10.740
am in touch with very, very
few of them at the moment.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.050
And then in March 2011,
the revolution started.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.980
My only definition of war was
the one I read in history books

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.690
in school.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.850
But then I saw it happening
in front of my own eyes.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.980
All the people were
shouting at the beginning

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.320
that this was a
peaceful revolution,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.425
but this was not what the
government had in mind.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:42.734
This is a picture of a
suburb of Al-Hasakah.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.220
I was in Damascus when
it started to happen.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.230
And I realized that everything
was changing really quickly.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.100
We had soldiers and
guns all over the place.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.100
Prices of food, of
books, of transportation

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.260
were doubled and then tripled.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.220
And then we couldn't
feel secure anymore.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.750
Like, fear and insecurity
were present in every step

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.840
of my life.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.670
So I decided to quit
at the university

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.500
and then go back home.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.560
And then I went back home
to find the market looks

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.665
like this.

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:25.165
Yeah.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.050
It was not much different than
the situation in Damascus,

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.920
so we realized that we did have
to do something about this.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.400
We realized that if you
wanted a better life,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.060
then we have to move.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.630
And me and my father used
to talk very frequently

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.230
about this situation.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.460
And then we decided
to move on to Iraq,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.670
but we couldn't due
to financial problems.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.680
And then my father
traveled to Sweden.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:02.160
And that was late February 2014.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.300
And after that,
in September 2014,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.470
I moved with my whole family
to Turkey, with my family

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:15.225
and with my aunt's family also.

00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:18.960
We sold the house in order
to be able to move to Turkey.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.390
I was working in
a sewing factory.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.065
I started working right away.

00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:26.830
We sew clothes for children.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:32.640
And again, it was difficult for
me to fit in this new society,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.260
with a new language, with
so many different people.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.000
They were not similar
to where I grew up.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.520
I was paid 700 Turkish lira.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.360
That is less than 200
Swiss franc per month.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.850
After a while, after
learning the language,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:06.750
I felt myself a little
bit more or less getting

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.060
used to this new society.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.880
I made a couple
of friends there.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:19.710
And then December 2015, my
mother, my young brother,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.320
and my youngest sister
were able to move to Sweden

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320
through the family
reunification.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.020
A couple of days
later, we found out

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.780
that we were rejected-- we,
as me, my two younger sisters,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.890
and my 96-year-old grandmother.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.880
We were rejected.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.030
So we had no idea
what to do back then.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.260
It was really hard
to think what to do.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.340
And then, after
my mother leaving,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.440
it was difficult
for me to go to work

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.530
and then leaving my sisters
with my grandmother back home.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.710
And then I had to quit working.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.670
And we had to make
the journey to Greece,

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.600
and then take the Balkan
route to try to go to Sweden.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.320
This is my grandmother
on the boat.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.010
Coming to Greece
was the experience

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.410
that changed my life.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:22.570
Actually, the smuggler told us
that the boat would be a big

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.050
boat, but it wasn't.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.960
We were supposed to be
15 people on the boat,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.420
but we were 23 people.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.250
And it was supposed to
be from a point that's

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.290
called Cesme in
Turkey, but it was

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.130
from a different one, a
more difficult, faraway one,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.360
that takes much more time.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.560
And we ended up in a place
on Lesvos island, a place

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.250
that volunteers say that
no boat has ever arrived

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.402
before nor after.

00:28:54.402 --> 00:28:56.772
Yeah, so we were the
first and the last there.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.880
The trip was very scary.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.710
It was the scariest
part of my life.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.740
And it's so strange that I can
remember each and every second

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.410
of that day.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.720
When we were at the
point to take off,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.460
we found out that
everything was a lie,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.920
so we decided not to go forward.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.840
We decided to go back, but
then searching for the cars,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.200
everyone had disappeared.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.360
No one was there.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.090
They disappeared like lightning.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.800
And so we had to
step into this boat.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.040
I was the first one to go in,
And then my sisters and then

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.210
my grandmother.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.760
My grandmother was
in complete absence.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.350
She could not realize anything
of what's going around her.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.330
I had one of my sisters--

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.650
each one of them clinging
to one of my arms,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.380
screaming and crying, oh,
how we're going to die,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.490
we're going to die.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.570
As I could feel the boat
shaking and underneath my legs,

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.570
I couldn't think
or feel anything.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:07.280
I was very scared, but I had to
act very strong for my sisters

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.510
and my grandmother.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:14.540
It was really one of the
moments that I still--

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.790
I mean, talking about it,
it is still like a movie.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.180
I cannot believe that
that has happened to me.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.530
We started sailing.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.750
The trip took three
and a half hours.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.730
The engines stopped twice.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.575
Everyone was in complete panic.

00:30:31.575 --> 00:30:34.240
I tried calling the
Greek coast guards,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.010
but they put my call on wait.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.880
That was of no help.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.100
And then the only moment
that I can clearly remember

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.440
was the moment when
I lift up my head,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.560
and I could see this
huge mountain beside me.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.360
You can see this
is that mountain.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.520
This is the island.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.770
This is the place
where we landed.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.550
Yeah, we could land
safely, thank god.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:09.830
And we had to climb up
the hill and in the dark.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:14.030
And we were hearing all
the voices from animals.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.365
We were very scared.

00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:18.710
But my grandmother was really
tired and we couldn't climb up,

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.270
so we had to go back.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:25.130
And then out of nowhere,
this yellow van shows up.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.250
I had no idea that there
were volunteers at that time.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.480
I had no idea that the borders
were closed at that time.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.390
I was thinking that this
is a matter of 10 days,

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.350
and I would be home safe,
but it took me six months

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.890
to arrive at last.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.250
This van showed
up, and the woman

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.980
sitting in front,
Raquel [? Hertzel-- ?]

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.230
she was the first
person I speak to.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.690
I ran to her and
I asked for help.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.470
Please can you help us?

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:02.330
We have two old ladies with us,
and we need help right away.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.390
So everyone was
on the run, and we

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.090
were taken to the main street.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:12.530
And then we were taken by
police buses to the Moria camp,

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.190
where we registered.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.970
And then we stayed
there for a night.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.090
And finding out the
situation in Moria

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.310
was completely difficult
for my grandmother

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.560
to survive, I had
to find a better

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.370
place with the small
amount of money I had.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:32.155
We rented a room.

00:32:32.155 --> 00:32:36.870
It was more or less
a room with 10 beds.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.670
We stayed there for
a couple of nights,

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.720
and then Raquel helped
me to find an apartment.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:50.780
And then she helped
me to work with NGOs--

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.200
with the organizations there.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.730
And the only thing that I
am most thankful for is I

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.900
was able to go back to
that place in daylight.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.420
This is how it looks.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.460
This was one of the
moments that I can never

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.020
forget because this
was the time I realized

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.630
that that place was not ugly.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.670
That place was not scary.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.490
It was actually a
beautiful place.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.510
It was one of the most beautiful
places I have ever seen.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:29.860
And that's why I could feel
a little bit more safe--

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:35.640
a little bit more comfortable
about moving on and continuing

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.230
living.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.020
I was able to work
as a volunteer.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.620
We the SAO with Together for
Better Days-- oh, actually,

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.453
at that moment, it was
Together for Better--

00:33:46.453 --> 00:33:46.926
AYESHA KELLER: Better
Days for Moria.

00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:48.440
RUHA SAID: Better
Days for Moria.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.760
Yeah.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.990
I was there to--

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.050
this is one of
the boat arrivals.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.620
I really wanted to be at
one of the boat arrivals.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.260
And this was one of
the experiences that

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.860
really moved me and touched me.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.010
The boat was from Iraq.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.840
They were all Kurdish people,
and all the volunteers there

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.760
were Arabic.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.375
They were yelling at the
people in Arabic like,

00:34:14.375 --> 00:34:16.600
stop, don't put your
children in the water--

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.600
but no one seems to understand.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.600
I was shaking before
that, but then I

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.980
realized that these
people need help.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.610
So I ran to the boat as I was
screaming in Kurdish like,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.889
stop, you cannot put
your children into water.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:30.909
These are good people.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:31.980
They are volunteers.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.389
They will help you.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:34.870
They will welcome you.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:39.179
And yeah, that was one
of the moments that

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.630
made me much more stronger--
that shaped my personality more

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.940
or less.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:49.400
And then from that time on,
I did work with many NGOs,

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:55.320
with journalists, with directors
from the UK, from the US,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.180
and Raquel helped
me to find a lawyer

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.680
to appeal the rejection
decision we had,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.420
but the appeal was
rejected once more.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.870
And then, at last, I had
to take a plane to Sweden.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.140
And this was the moment me
and my grandmother arrived.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.590
My grandmother, again,
did not realize anything.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.700
She only realized the
fact that we were reunited

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.185
when she saw my mother--

00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:28.830
there, on the right of the
picture-- she started crying.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.330
And a couple days
after we arrived,

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.280
Raquel visited us in Sweden.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.998
And yeah.

00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:38.532
That was most of it.

00:35:38.532 --> 00:35:39.032
Thank you.

00:35:39.032 --> 00:35:40.976
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Thank you so much.

00:35:40.976 --> 00:35:43.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:43.607 --> 00:35:45.190
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Maybe to follow up,

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.977
Ruha, on what
you-- so I actually

00:35:46.977 --> 00:35:48.060
have two questions to you.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.768
So the one is, if I
understand correctly,

00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:51.490
you had to flee twice, right?

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.060
You fled--

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:52.600
RUHA SAID: Yeah.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.320
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
--your hometown?

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:53.770
RUHA SAID: Yeah.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.000
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: And
then you went on the boat.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.800
RUHA SAID: Yeah.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.633
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: In
each of those moments,

00:35:57.633 --> 00:36:00.910
can you talk a bit more
about what that means?

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:05.080
I mean none of us have
experienced that, right?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.090
What's the moment when you
realize, I have to do this?

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.465
RUHA SAID: None
of us knows that.

00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:13.150
And I wish none of
us would ever be

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.980
forced to go through
that experience,

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.740
because it is really
difficult that you have

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.410
to leave everything you know--

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.680
the whole places, your
studies, everything.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.800
You have to leave them behind
you and then go to a place

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.530
where you have no clue--

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.660
where you have zero
skills, language.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.480
And it's really difficult.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.810
But the situation was really
hard in Syria, and then

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.960
in Turkey.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.150
It was really hard that you
realize that you cannot take

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.720
this anymore.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.550
Like in Syria, the
war is really--

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:59.576
in my home town, there
wasn't bombing all the time.

00:36:59.576 --> 00:37:03.360
But the military was there,
present all the time.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.960
Each 10 days, we had a car
bombing, or a person bombing,

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.480
and then people dying.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.520
And then you have prices
going up like crazy.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.390
People aren't able to go study.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.680
Life literally stops.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.520
And then you realize it's
either me taking a step forward,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.300
or me accepting dying
slowly in this place.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.760
And that's why you
will say nothing

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.840
is more difficult than
staying here, then moving on,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.580
but staying here.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.530
So I chose to move
on in both times.

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:44.290
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: You
mentioned you had smugglers.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.760
You had people that helped
you or try to help you.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.560
Talk a bit about the
logistics, because I

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.510
guess it's so hard to
imagine for us, right?

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.200
How did you know what to do?

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.440
Did you always get help?

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.290
Did you get the right help?

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.600
This must be crazy logistics.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.900
RUHA SAID: I really
didn't know what to do.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.150
I had no idea what I'm doing.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.550
I had no idea that is
the right thing to do.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.190
Would this be acceptable?

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.872
Would this do good,
or would it be bad?

00:38:20.872 --> 00:38:24.370
Would it bring me
to a worse place?

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.870
But I was lucky.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.270
I was really lucky in each time.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:33.700
I was lucky in Turkey to
meet a couple of good people.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.670
And I was lucky in
Greece to meet people

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.988
like Raquel and Ayesha.

00:38:40.898 --> 00:38:43.540
Yeah, I think it's
very difficult

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.840
to define the logistics,
but they are there.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.270
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Yeah.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.120
If I can turn it to
Ayesha, and maybe

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.270
ask you a couple of questions--

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.600
So you mentioned
things have evolved

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.050
a bit since you went there.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.460
Can you maybe
summarize again, how

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.770
is the situation better or
worse or different from when

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.290
you first went there to today?

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.990
AYESHA KELLER: So it's
incredibly different.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.870
I think that one of the reasons
the news has kind of forgotten

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.910
about it is because the
arrival numbers have

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.280
dropped significantly.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.220
There still are hundreds of
people arriving every week,

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.850
so it's still quite
a lot of people,

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.730
but compared to the thousands
before, it's a huge drop.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.839
So I think it feels,
in a way, when

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:34.380
you look at it from
the outside, it's

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.240
as if it's not bad
because you don't

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360
have those scenes of so many
people and lying on the beach,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.030
and children being washed
up, and things like that.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.090
However, unfortunately, because
there's no movement forward

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.825
anymore and because a lot
of the borders are closed,

00:39:48.825 --> 00:39:50.580
the schemes aren't
really working.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.140
People are stuck.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.630
And so they're stuck
behind these fences,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.330
and they just don't know
what's going to come next.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.230
So the desperation--
the depression

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:04.260
is just getting really
quite unbearable

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.235
for many, many people.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.960
The main difference is
it's become kind of quiet.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.790
It's become the
silent, invisible pain

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.830
that people have,
which, in a way,

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.055
is a lot more dangerous because
it's a lot easier to ignore.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:26.270
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: You mentioned
you're now active in this NGO

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.830
that you co-founded, right?

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.806
Talk a bit about what
you can do from here now,

00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:31.430
since you're not on
the ground anymore.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.888
You mentioned a
few things already,

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:34.200
but what are the goals?

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.220
Where can you influence?

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:35.905
Where can you actually--

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:36.170
AYESHA KELLER: Slides--

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.840
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
--support something?

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.173
AYESHA KELLER: --going back one.

00:40:38.173 --> 00:40:39.100
There we go.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.920
There are many ways
you can get involved.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.060
Really easy, obvious
ones are donating,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.070
but it doesn't have to be that.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.930
I think one of the
most important things

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.190
is to stay informed.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.070
I think one of the main reasons
these things are happening

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.140
is because people
aren't really aware.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.600
I always think if people
really knew what was happening,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.490
it wouldn't happen.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.310
But it's quite easy to
ignore, especially if people

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.920
aren't reporting on it.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.390
I think it's really important
to meet refugees and speak

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.630
to people and realize
that they're just humans.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.470
I think, for me,
meeting Ruha in Greece

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.140
was a really amazing
experience because she

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.730
speaks so good English.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.470
And my Arabic is pretty
much non-existent,

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:26.220
so until that moment,
I hadn't really

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.320
had a chance to have a
really good conversation

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.160
with another woman
in my age, basically.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.670
And sitting down
with her made me

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.620
realize it could have been me.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.027
I was born in Scotland,
not Syria, but who knew?

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:39.610
Like, neither of us would have
known this was going to happen.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:43.140
And I think that realization
that we're just the same,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.290
actually, it really helps to
put everything into context.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.990
So I think it's
important, rather

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:50.352
than seeing some of the--

00:41:50.352 --> 00:41:51.810
I don't know how
is in Switzerland.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.130
In the UK, the media is
very afraid of refugees.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.210
All the headlines are
basically about fear,

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.530
and I think it's very easy
to be afraid of something

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.970
you don't understand.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.340
If you understand and
you know the person,

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.176
you can't be afraid of them.

00:42:07.176 --> 00:42:08.800
I don't think I could
be afraid of you.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.210
Maybe sometimes.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.735
But no, in general,
it becomes ridiculous.

00:42:14.735 --> 00:42:16.720
I mean, we're even
laughing about the idea.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.970
It's completely insane.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.100
And it is.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.445
But how would you know if I
hadn't had that interaction?

00:42:23.445 --> 00:42:25.440
So I think that's very helpful.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.140
And I think keeping an open
mind is really important,

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:28.960
and speaking up.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.190
So when people say
things about refugees

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.200
that you maybe don't agree
with, that you say, hey,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.380
I actually don't agree
with that, or even,

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.790
why exactly do you think that?

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.560
Have you actually
spoken to someone?

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.300
Where are you getting
these figures from?

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.362
Because a lot of these figures
are also vastly inflated.

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.070
I think it's really
important to be aware

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.560
that in 2015, around
850,000 people came over

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.397
from Turkey to Greece, and
that meant they were all

00:42:56.397 --> 00:42:57.480
trying to get into Europe.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.530
That meant Europe increased
its population by 0.2%.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:07.740
In Lebanon, at the moment, we've
got an increase of about 20%,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.850
25%--

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.990
depends which statistics
you're looking at.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.810
So it's a huge difference.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.020
0.2% is kind of nothing.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.680
And so, in a way, people get
so afraid of these big numbers,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.750
but when you put
it into comparison,

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.550
it suddenly isn't
that big a number.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.150
So it just needs to
be managed properly,

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.775
and then you don't
have the issues.

00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:31.150
I'm not saying there aren't
problems; there are problems.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.110
But I think the problems are to
do with the way the crisis has

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.775
been managed and
the way solutions

00:43:35.775 --> 00:43:39.240
have been implemented, and
not because of the situation.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.280
0.2% isn't a big deal.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.912
If you don't manage it properly,
it can become a big deal.

00:43:44.912 --> 00:43:47.370
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: If I may
turn it to Ruha again, and just

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.300
ask you, because you mentioned
already you were a translator.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.950
On the ground, in a sense.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.350
It sounded like you
turned from a refugee

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.655
to a supporter at some
point, isn't that right--

00:43:57.655 --> 00:43:58.780
which is, I think, amazing.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.200
And I can see why that
was important for you.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.160
How is that today?

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.920
I mean, are you actively
working with that NGO?

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.170
What is your role in that?

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.410
And what are your
connections, actually?

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:17.070
RUHA SAID: I would
have to say that it

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:23.570
had a very big part in shaping
me and in making me, me.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.670
I am much more
stronger than I was,

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:33.340
and I am still working with
SAO as a cultural advisor.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:38.490
Hopefully, we are planning to
open a women's center in Greece

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.976
and that's still planned.

00:44:41.976 --> 00:44:47.750
There is not much about
that, but hopefully.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.120
And I'm still in touch with
many of the women I knew--

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.726
with many of the women I met.

00:44:53.726 --> 00:44:55.100
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
And may I ask,

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.371
did you exchange phone
numbers or Facebook?

00:44:58.371 --> 00:44:59.870
How do you stay in
touch with people

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.110
that you meet under such
desperate conditions?

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:06.170
RUHA SAID: Yes, we did
change Facebook contact

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:10.390
because the phone numbers
were really unstable.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.053
Yeah.

00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:14.238
We changed Facebook
contact and I am still,

00:45:14.238 --> 00:45:16.723
as I said, in contact
with many of them.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.950
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Good.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.220
Then I would say, I want
to thank you really,

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.580
very, very much for sharing
your personal stories

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.410
and what you do.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.420
I want to thank you,
everybody, for coming.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.917
And want to end it with here.

00:45:31.917 --> 00:45:33.000
Thanks a lot, both of you.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.875
RUHA SAID: Thank you.

00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:36.350
[APPLAUSE]
