&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.770
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Hi, good afternoon,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.600
I'm Sally Van de Water
from the Folk Arts Program

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.900
in Pennsylvania.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.200
It's my very great
pleasure to be here

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.690
at the American Folklife
Center and introducing

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.290
to you the founder of the
Sattriya Dance Company,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.100
Madhusmita Bora and three of
the dancing monks of Assam.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.020
Thank you for being
here with us.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.870
Mandhu, I think I'd
like to start with you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.970
and ask you, what is Sattriya?

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.610
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora:
It's a dance tradition

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.250
from the remote northeast
corner of India,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.020
from the state called Assam.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.870
And it was preserved, nourished,
and created as a form of worship

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.110
in the Hindu Vishnu Monasteries.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.890
It kind of stayed within the
Monastic walls for centuries.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.110
And it was only in the
mid-20th century that y,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
it started coming
out into the open.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.920
And today, it is one of India's
eight classical dance form.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.430
And that recognition
was actually recorded

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.550
in the year 20000 And since
then it has catapulted

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.440
into the proscenium stage
and you're seeing more

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.930
and more people performing
and learning the dance.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.800
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water: How
is the dance different from,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.090
for example, Bharatanatyam, or
Kuchipudi, or do you see some

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.550
of the other dances that
people might be familiar with.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.770
Also, it's an unbroken tradition
of more than 500 years.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.360
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: It
is a living tradition.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.170
And this is the only dance form
that survived for centuries

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.700
as a form of oral
tradition was passed

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.140
on from one generation
of Hmong to the next.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.190
So, that is one major
difference.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.880
And it's a breathing,
living artform.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.910
And there are a lot
of similarities.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.510
And I will defer that
question to my teacher.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:20.110
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.040
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: So, we
have a lot of similarities,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.370
at the same times we have the
different see Hmong has the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.950
different dance [inaudible]
of India.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.720
And Sattriya, basically,
we use some elements

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.960
as what we don't see in other
dance form, the example,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.450
we used the hand
gestures as a language.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.920
And in then classical dance and
this dance we call language.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.850
So separate, these hand
gestures, we use only Sattriya,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.880
but we don't see in other
classical dance of India.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.030
So, this is specific.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.240
Likewise we have some
elements like we bouncing.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.310
But we don't see in other
dance form of India.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.750
Only we can see in
Manipuri dance.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.430
Because Manipuri is
very near to use,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.210
and it was the same
stays in the long times.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.720
But after that it was separate.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.700
So, we can see only
Manipuri dance.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.760
So, we have a lot of difference,
then also the language.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.070
And we use the Brazowvi
[phonic] language.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.010
This language composed

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.810
by our great saint [foreign
name] in 15th century.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.470
This language is what
kind of mixed language.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.900
And he used this language as
a holy language because at

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.250
that time he has to
convince to the people,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.580
if he used a normal language

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.630
like ordinary people
used common language,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.810
the people don't believe that
this is one kind of holy.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.880
So, because of that he
used a mixed language.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.120
So, this is called
Brazowvi language.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.060
So, in Sattriya, we
use this language.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.010
So, we have a lot
of differences.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.310
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora:
Also, you know,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.650
it's mostly Krishna worship,
we don't have too many,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.100
I mean goddesses, when
we're telling stories.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.870
Most of the stories
are related to Krishna.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.210
And the principle
emotion is [foreign word].

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.640
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: Yeah,
that is very important piece

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.040
in Sattriya, because Sattriya,
they take it to the devotion.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.050
So, because of that,
yes, it was the nine kind

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.770
of [foreign word],
the sentiments.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:17.390
But our ultimate
destination we have search,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.000
we have to find the [foreign
word], this devotion.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.780
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: So, yeah,
it's a very devotional artform.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.330
Because it's part
of your worship.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.280
And it's always, you know,
it ends with submission

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.180
to the lord and the universe.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.480
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
You begin with devotion

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.320
and then there's music,
and then there's dance

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.130
and then you end with devotion.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.430
That's lovely.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.830
As part of today's performance,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.190
you did your final piece was
invoking 10 the incarnations

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.490
of Krishna.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.790
Can you talk a little
bit about how you

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.800
and your dance partner portrayed
that, how you were able to make

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.040
that come alive for the
audience through dance?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.120
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: So, in our
tradition there are actually,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.940
you know, the other
Indian classical dance,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.790
there's also another difference,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.740
there are 10 primary
incarnations, in ours we say 24.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.430
But we still pick 10,
the 10 primary ones.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.790
And you know, we
talk about them.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.040
And the piece that we did, we
don't know who choreographed it,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.580
but it is very, very old.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.740
And you know [foreign
name] taught us

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.820
and that was actually
thanks to a grant

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.080
from the Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.930
So, how we did it was we
just divided our roles,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.190
the way it was choreographed.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.560
So, when, you know she's
portraying the fish,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.480
I become the water.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.210
Or when, you know,
she's a turtle head,

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.530
I'm the turtle shell, you know.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.910
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water: Because
she's portraying Krishna,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.300
and you're portraying
Krishna nemesis.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.640
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: And
then, just because you know,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.940
she's in a male costume.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.590
So, that's the other interesting
aspect of this dance form.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.920
It's very gender fluid.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.820
Because the Hmong
dress up as women.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.330
So, probably it is the
only dance form right now,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.510
where women also dress
up in a man costume.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.830
Kuchipudi, in Kuchipudi
they do it But in Kuchipudi,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.830
I don't know, do females
dress up as men, anymore?

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.350
I don't see that.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.820
I know male can dress as female,
but female dressing up as men,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.150
I think this is the only
dance form that have it?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.130
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: Yes, but
we have to think about this.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.900
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: Yeah,
so that is one of you know

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.750
so because she is
always in the turban,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.520
so she gets to play
the good guy,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.330
and I essentially
become the bad guy.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.790
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: And we don't
say that this is the dance

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.630
of Krishna, because
we only believe

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.890
that Krishna, Krishna
[inaudible].

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.330
So, we don't believe
the other goddesses.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.520
But yes, we believe we respect.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.880
But we believe this is a part of
the Krishna so, because of that.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.550
The other classical dance form,
when they dance, they dedicate

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.820
to the dance for the goddess.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.850
We dedicate it only for Krishna.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.110
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: Yeah,
Krishna is the principle deity.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.410
And that also brings

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.340
to the other difference
you're talking about.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.240
Our [foreign word] is called
[foreign word], it's very soft.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.660
It's unlike the other dance form
where it's very, very rigorous.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.780
There's the bouncing
that you see.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.640
And that almost like the flowy
movement of the river, I think,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.170
you know you're kind of
gliding on the stage,

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.910
rather than standing and making.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.210
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water: Well,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.620
it's incredibly elegant
and fluid, yes.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.920
Absolutely.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.620
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan:
Yes, because we believe

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.460
that it is the [inaudible]
to a heart for mother earth.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.070
So, because of that we bounce.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.610
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: Whereas,
the other dance form, the bow

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.540
and then they stamp on the
mother earth [laughter].

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.840
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Well, I think,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.750
you know it's really remarkable
that Sattriya has more

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.440
than 500 years of unbroken
tradition that's always been

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.490
carried on in the
monastery except

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.630
in the last, say 20 years or so.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.000
Women are now also
doing this as well.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.580
Can you talk a little
bit more about that,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.080
you're one of the
first women to do?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.380
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: No,
I'm not one of the first.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.680
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Oh, you're not.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.980
Okay, sorry.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.510
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: So,
actually probably 1960s.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:40.290
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.930
Probavly 1960, but it was not,
you know, it was not very,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.820
for the lack of a better
word, it was not very cool.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.310
There was not enough funding.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.470
And there were other dance,
classical art forms that were

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.110
so vibrant at that
time, even in Assam.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.410
Like [inaudible].

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.410
So, people were more
drawn toward that.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.100
You know,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.400
so there were like two,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.700
three practitioners,
but not very many.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.510
The access to the
artform was also hard.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:12.170
Because most of the Hmong
were not allowed to teach.

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.860
So, you know one of my
teachers [foreign name] was,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.630
I mean he nearly
got excommunicated

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.020
because he ventured out
to teach at that point.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.880
So, he also wanted to
like teach outside.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.520
But it was, you know
there was this resistance,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.930
because the older monks wanted
to preserve the tradition,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.070
and to let go was
really , really hard.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.730
But I think since
2000, it has become.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.840
You know it has become
more accessible.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.100
A lot of things have happened.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.950
Of course, India has
progressed by leaps and bounds.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.700
Transportation is easier,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.230
the island is more
accessible to go and learn.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.170
And then, you know there are
practitioners like Bhabananda

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.870
who are actually moving
out and like, you know,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.870
staying in the cities and
teaching students from all over.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.030
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: But I think,
this is my personal view,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.880
that the [inaudible] it not mean
the [inaudible] didn't allow.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.290
It means the outsiders
not interested about this.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.500
So, when the outsider
interest to know about this,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.640
that's first of most often.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.680
Because the should trust
people outside and they teach

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.860
for the women insiders.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.300
So, I think that outsider
was not interested before.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.910
So, when the outsiders
get interested about this,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:48.440
the [inaudible] people, they
wanted to give them these.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.690
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: So, yeah,
it was more like access.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.990
You know there was no access.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.530

have brought them yeah.

Absolutely.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.630
Can I ask you, Mr. [inaudible]
how has it been to work

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.630
with Madhu, you've been
her apprenticeship teacher

for a couple of years now?

of them actually I trained

under both of them
around the same time,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.510
so they can both
talk about that.

He is third.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.720
So, most of them came and
they joined the monastery

when they were five
or six years old.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.230
And so, you know he learned
the music and the arts,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.860
and he really wanted
to teach it.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.730
And teach the philosophy of
the great teacher to outsiders.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.510

had that passion for that.

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.270
So, you know he really
wanted to teach outsiders,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.940
but at that point,
they were forbidden

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.510
to teach outside the monastery.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.500
But he had, you know he believed
that he was in the right.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.990
So, he kind of you know,
overcame all sorts of obstacles.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.350
And he started teaching.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.350
Because he really believed
that you know, it was important

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.450
to spread the message,
and the philosophy

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.560
So, you know, he said
basically, so when I went there,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.860
I first went to the
[foreign word],

translate correctly.

right?

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.840
You know, and that's what I did

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.140
because I didn't
know where to go.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.640
So, I went to the
head of the monastery.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.620
And then, he kind of took
me to meet Bhabananda.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.750
But he was busy there
was a documentary filming

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.610

me you have to wait for an hour.

And then, you know after waiting
around when I finally met

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.350
with him, he said; you know,
I told him that I wanted

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.010
to learn the dance form.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.300

he was very happy

because he likes teaching

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.710
and then he knew I
had come from so far.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.510

me under his wings.

you know we started talking.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.940
And then, you know we would
always have these discussions.

And I always said I
wanted to bring them here,

and he would say, yeah can
we all go and maybe someday;

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.450
because they have never
been to the United States.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.080
And he said, you know maybe
somehow you can arrange it.

And you know we knew it
was a Herculean task.

Because bringing
a group of people

it is very expensive.

he always believed.

will happen, it will happen.

happy to be here today.

when he joined the

And they're both National
Award winners, both of them.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.570
So, you know and for 18
years he trained vigorously

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.130
in the artform because he
lived in the monastery.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.800
But this was, you know prior

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.100
to Hotchia [phonic]
becoming a classical artform.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.630
He really wanted to study
another classical dance form

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.110
to bring those rigors
into his movement.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:40.310
So, he left the monastery in
pursuit of studies and trained

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.720
in another dance
form for two years,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.210
but he doesn't perform
it or teach it.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.390
It was just for his own
understanding, and you know,

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.310
studying Hotchia as
a classical artform.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.870
And then, because he was
originally from the monastery.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.170
So, there are a lot of,

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.250
they have to live a
very disciplined life.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.550
It is hard.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.150
I don't know how.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.890
But it is very, very hard.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.980
So, when he was there, you
know he started living,

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.280
and now he's a family man.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.660
He kind of left the order.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.770
And for me, again the access

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.860
to Madgule has always been an
issue, because it is you know,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.570
you have to travel by boat.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.660
When the river is in
state, it's really,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.940
really hard to get there.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.640
So, I was also looking for
alternatives in the city.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.110
So, I would divide my time.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.620
I could only go to Madgule for
some time, and then when I'm

of lives there.

monastery connected us and said,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.090
you know when you're in
town, in your hometown,

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.390
you can study under him.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.950

It is pretty far.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:06.540
So, I was born in a
small down called Dispur

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.990
and then I was raised mostly

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.480
in my father's village it's
called Madhcal [phonic].

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.390
And it's interesting because
Madhcal is kind of a seat of art

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.110
and culture, so I
grew up like listening

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.860
to the rhythms of
you know Hotchia.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.520
My aunts and uncles
trained in it.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.960
and we have this
unbroken tradition

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.080
which is hundred-something
years old.

So, all my cousins.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.750
I mean it happened this year,
and I was supposed to perform,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.680
but I couldn't make it.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.370
My uncles, my extended
family were always involved

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.670
in [foreign word].

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.270
So, you know it was kind of
second nature almost to kind

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.730
of get immersed in the arts.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:58.930
But Madgule is pretty
far from there and then,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.430
I had to pursue my
education and at that time,

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.500
Assam was in a very
turbulent state.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.710
You know, we had a
secessionist outfit.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.880
So, it was not a very safe
place for most people.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.250
So, my parents kind of
encouraged me to leave the state

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.330
and go outside for my high
school and my college.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.080
And that's what I did.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.020
So, you know there was,
I learned under a teacher

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.010
in my hometown for
a little while,

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.580
and then that connection
was snapped because.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.430
Yeah. And that was, and I
was four or five years old,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.630
until about seven years of age.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.410
Then I left Dispur
and I left [inaudible]

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.790
and I kind of grew up in Delhi.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.790
And there was no, you
know I didn't have access

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.090
to anybody then.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:56.850
So, I went to the next best
alternative, which was Kathak.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.710
So, I trained in Kathak
for about 16 years.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.710
a living legend [inaudible].

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:16.530
And I joined her dance company.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.320
So, I was part of
the Kathak Ensemble

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.810
and Friends in New York.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.540
And it was very interesting
because in doing choreographies,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.040
or when I'm dancing, and
she would say, you're lost,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.500
she'll always say, there's
some sadness in your movement.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.380
And where did you get this from.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.400
And it was my muscle memory.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.070
So, even though I was one of
the senior most performers

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.160
in her group, you know
one day she just said,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.460
child you need to go.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.950
You need to go back, and
you know follow your heart,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.410
this is not where your heart is.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:49.570
And I think, you know
even to this day for me,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.360
like she is my ultimate
teacher, because she let go.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.930
And she said, just go, and
follow your dreams, you know

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.380
and pursue your passion.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.030
So, that's how I actually
ended up in the monastery

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.500
when I met [inaudible]
the first time.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.310
And then, you know I realized
because it's so precious

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.530
and it's of course, you know
there was this deep connection.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.440
It was very easy
to get back to it.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.390
And I let go of Kathak even
after 16 years of training,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.110
I gave away my bells,
all my costumes,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.300
because I didn't want any kind

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.630
of you know alteration
of what I'm doing.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.050
Because this is my
heritage and I would

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:41.240
like to preserve it the way, and
you know accord it the respect

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.540
and sanctity that it deserves.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.840
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
That's wonderful.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.140
I know you've got
a lot of support

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.440
from the P Foundation and.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.540
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora:
Absolutely, I've been so lucky

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.650
that you know, I
mean two PCA grants,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.330
three Levy Foundation
grants and in one of,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.250
the second Levy Foundation grant
Bhabananda was in the monastery

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.630
and that's how, I was
working on this project, yeah.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.530
So, you know so Bhabananda kind

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.860
of helped me document all the
basic grammar of the dance form.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.250
And Pew, I mean Pew
is unbelievable.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.730
You know, I just in my wildest
dreams did not think it was

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.170
going to happen.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.710
And here we are you know
after a year of like,

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.270
it feels like I have done a
PhD in the last year or two.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:32.650
But you know I'm so
grateful for the support.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:38.540
And yes Pew is you know very
generous with their grant,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.380
but leading up to it, you know

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.480
if I wouldn't have
had the support Levy,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.230
or from Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts,

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.280
I don't think I'd
be where I am today.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.990
Because it's a very lonely ride.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.500
You know, since I'm the
only one practicing it here

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.320
and that access to the teachers
and to the nerve center is

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.340
so important and without
funding and support,

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.210
you know I wouldn't
have been able

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.850
to do what I'm doing right now.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.150
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
I really want

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.450
to ask you a little
bit more about that.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.500
You are the only
practitioner here

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.830
in the United States doing this
artform, and it's usually done

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.750
in the context of a
group, a larger group

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.060
such as at the monastery.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.680
How do you negotiate that?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.770
How do you?

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.850
What's your daily practice like?

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.260
What do you do to keep
the traditional alive

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.320
in your own life?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.750
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: I feel
like, you know for most of us,

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.950
it becomes; it's the
nature of the artform.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.450
It is actually a way of life.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.750
It's a way of life.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.840
For them, of course, I mean
this is, they live, breathe

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.300
and you know this
is what they do.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.560
But even for other
practitioners,

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.130
I think it becomes
your life's philosophy.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:58.020
And it is hard like
to be the only person.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.020
But I've been very blessed
because my dance partner

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.600
and you know the cofounder

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.360
of the dance company
is my sister-in-law.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.480
Which is just, you
know was wonderful.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.960
That's very convenient.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.390
And she travels here quite
frequently whenever we have

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.400
shows, big shows.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.570
And we dance together,
even in India,

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.040
or last year we performed
in London.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.960
It is hard, because it is
essentially a community worship

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.260
which they can do.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.840
I mean we cannot
create that music,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.370
you know I mean this
is very special.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.090
So, the first time that we're
doing it with live musicians,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.480
you know, yeah, I mean here.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.550
You know, because I don't
have access to that.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.270
So, this was very, very special

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.650
because we're always
dancing to recorded music.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.840
So, even though, yes, you know
your philosophical and it's

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.020
such a spiritual artform, and
you're in it and you're in it

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.590
and you're you know, every
movement is sort of an offering

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.420
to the universe and to the Lord.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.590
But like, it's not the same when
you don't have the community.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.520
You know. So, it
is very special.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.440
But like, to keep
it going, again,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.820
it's because I think it's
the passion that drives it.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.660
It's also like you know these
are the stories and you feel

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.110
that burden to kind of carry
on these stories forward

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.430
and leave it for
the next generation.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.730
For me, it's my son.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.800
You know, that's his
connection to his roots.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.370
So, that's what drives
me, I guess.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:31.680
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Does he dance?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.230
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: No,
he doesn't [laughter].

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.870
But he's really into
all the stories.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.270
So, yeah.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.570
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Well, thank you.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.870
We're so honored
to have you here.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.990
Thank you again, thank you
for traveling such a long way.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.290
Is there anything
else that you would

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.810
like to say, or like to add?

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.940
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: So,
what we're really excited

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:55.780
about you know is the Pew
Grant is funding this project,

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.340
which is called the
Threads of History,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.930
Resurrection of the Textile.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.810
So, this is you know a part
of tapestry that I discovered

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.180
in the Philadelphia
Museum of Art,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.030
which was actually in storage.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.110
And on the trip when I met
Barbayan and [inaudible]

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.450
and we were documenting
the grammar of the artform

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:18.780
through my Levy Grant was when
he mentioned about, he said,

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.080
you know there is a possibility,

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.330
that you know this
tapestry exists.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.690
So, I was on a wild goose chase,

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.460
through because I didn't know
how to ask them what it was,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.160
because I mean if I say [foreign
word] they had no idea what

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.620
it was.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:37.340
So, it took about
almost 2, 3 years

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.720
and by then the museum
had gotten funding

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.140
to digitize their collection.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.200
So, one night I was looking
through their digital archives

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.820
and I came across it and it was
called the clothe of Vrindavan.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.540
So, immediately, I was so
excited and I kind of called him

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.710
and sent him the
pictures and I said,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.110
is this what we were
looking for.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.410
And he said, yes that's it.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.460
You know, incredible I know.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.170
So, then I wrote the curators.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:06.070
But unfortunately the south
Asia was under renovation.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.720
So, she said, you know two
months and then you can come

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.050
and see it and that's when
you can photograph it.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.940
So, it was a long two months.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.050
And I went in and
then that moment

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.440
when I first saw it was
really unbelievable, you know.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.740
We took pictures.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.500
I sent it to them, and
then you know that's

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.310
who we started working on it.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.100
And then, the Philadelphia
Folk Art Project actually,

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.830
who have also supported my
work and then they said,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.850
why don't you go and talk
to the Pew, this is totally,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.340
like it has Pew written
all over it right?

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.670
So, the next call was to Pew
and they invited me to apply.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:52.300
And so, it's finally
coming together.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.800
So, Barbayan has been
traveling to different parts.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.870
So, he has done a translation
of the textiles in London,

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.570
at the British Museum
and in Paris.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.320
So, this is his third.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.390
So, we are calling it the
Journey of [foreign word].

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:09.560
And it's happening
you know Saturday,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.530
April 21st at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.750
They're hanging the
tapestry, I'm so excited

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.850
about this, in the auditorium.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.910
And you know, I'm presenting
them, I'm not dancing,

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.340
because this is their
pilgrimage.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:27.730
And they will be basically
just bringing the cloth to life

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.030
through their movements

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.330
and telling the stories
from the cloth.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.630
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
That's wonderful.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.930
Please tell us more
about this textile.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.230
Does the textile
depict the stories

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.370
that you're also
embodying through dance?

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.350
Can you tell us more?

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.360
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan:
These textiles woven

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.500
under the guidance
of the great saint,

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.710
[foreign name] in
the 15th century.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.720
So, were depicted the
story of the Krishna.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.460
Yeah. So, we wanted to reveal
this through out artform.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.960
So, it was in 2008 when
we first visit in Paris,

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.980
the times we had first
to visit the textile.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:15.620
So, the net year 2009, that's
when I visit again in Paris

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.100
at that time some ideas come

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:25.330
out if we can do
something on that textile.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:31.270
So, after we had discussed
with professor of university.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:35.620
Then, said yes you
can do something.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:44.130
So at that time start it and in
2011 I was there in nine months

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.110
for only for the
study of the textile.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.890
Then, so I choreographed one
drama based on the textile.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.800
Then Sattriya to produce.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:01.000
So, subsequently we again,
we did afford the [inaudible]

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.190
on the basis on [inaudible]
and it was in 2016.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:17.520
But this is our third one, then
headed by her because we thanks

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.890
to Madhusmita because
she support us,

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.530
and she give confidence of dance

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:31.380
and so we are able
to do because of her.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.750
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: But I
wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.580
So, it's a wonderful circle.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:42.020
But the presentation in
the textile is you know 15

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.960
to 16th century they're
saying, we can't date it

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.630
and what's interesting was these
textiles were all mislabeled.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.230
So, there are some that appeared
from India and they were all

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.620
in Tibet and from Tibet they
went to different parts there.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.200
They're now saying
there are like 15 pieces

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.930
of these textiles, there's only
one piece available in India,

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:06.860
in a museum in [inaudible] and
the rest are dispersed all over.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.710
Ours is the third piece
that they are going

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.170
to be bringing to life.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.830
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Are they identical pieces?

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.130
Or are they all?

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.310
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: No, they all
have stories from Krishna's life

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:22.510
from the time of
his birth to death.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.660
&gt;&gt; Prerona Bhuyan: According
to the ancient scripture,

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:37.300
there's other, those textiles
that depicted only the story

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.630
of Krishna back to the
death of his maternal uncle.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:50.620
But in particular when we
see the different places what

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:57.550
discovered, there we can see
the story of [foreign word] too.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:04.900
So, the scholars,
they're going to say

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.890
that maybe it's not
original piece,

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:15.890
maybe this is not
continuation of the tradition,

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.390
that they made this
kind of piece it was

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.420
for the [foreign word].

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.890
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora:
Yeah, the scriptures,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:28.120
you know you cover,
it's like yeah.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.360
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water: How
large are the textiles?

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.920
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: The one
in the Philadelphia Museum is

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.350
about is it about 6 feet?

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:48.050
Yeah. Long and I cannot
remember the measurements.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:53.970
It's this broad, yeah and that
one has all stories of Krishna

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.560
in it and it's woven
in you know strips.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.860
And it kind of continues.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.980
Like it's the four
scenes and then the four.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.560
So, you know we kind
of decode it.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.940
So, they'll be using masks.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.250
And they'll be using masks.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:13.290
And they'll be doing it as
a dance drama tradition.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.770
And so, you saw some of it.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.130
The [inaudible] dance
that he did today,

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.590
the storyteller's dance
and he'll be doing

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:24.050
that even in the museum.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.350
Telling the story.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:30.330
Yeah. But you know the
Philadelphia Museum piece was

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:36.880
actually brought into
Philadelphia in early 1990s,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.800
and what is really amazing is
Phillis Blum [assumed spelling]

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.470
who is the creator of textiles

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.040
who purchased the
cloth is still there.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.910
So, she will be sitting
on the panel.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.580
Yeah. And she didn't
know what it was.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.780
Like, she just thought it
was this amazing fabric.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.400
And it just spoke to her, so
she bought it at an auction.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.280
And so, when I approached
them, they were like, wow.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.580
You know like they didn't know.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.780
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water: That's
so amazing that you can give

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.470
that much context to the piece.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.770
&gt;&gt; Madhusmita Bora: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.320
So, we've been able through
the Pew Fund we were able

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.460
to also create this documentary,
and this is the second

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.300
or third time that the
text will be on display

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.110
in the South Asian Gallery.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:21.850
And they're planning to have
it up for the next six months.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.840
And some of you know
the documentation I did

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.560
in the monastery will be played
along in a panel on a loop.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.060
So, that's very exciting.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.360
Thank you.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.660
&gt;&gt; Sally Van de Water:
Very exciting.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.420
Congratulations,
that's wonderful.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.720
Well thank you so much.
