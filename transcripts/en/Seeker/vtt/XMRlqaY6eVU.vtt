00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.580
How would you describe yourself in a few words?

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.810
I’m a cis-man and I like fun shirts.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.830
Our gender plays a big role in how we define
ourselves and others, but it’s not something

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.360
science fully understands.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.279
And, funnily enough, we don’t really know
why I like fun shirts, either, but no one

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.589
questions that so let’s just move on.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.270
A lot of us may never really think twice about
defining ourselves as a man or a woman, but

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.699
there are many who do think about it.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.699
A lot.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.850
In reality a lot of biological, sociological,
and psychological factors went into the definitions

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.640
of “man” or “woman,” or neither.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.760
For example, when babies are born at a hospital,
they’re assigned a sex based on primary

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.430
sex characteristics like genitalia.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.920
Someone literally looks at the baby and makes
a decision.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.320
They’re mainly going by visual inspection.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.670
And though hormones like testosterone play
a big role in developing the primary sex organs

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.060
you have at birth.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.350
Sexual differentiation continues beyond birth,
with a lot of outwardly visible changes (and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.960
awkwardness) peaking at puberty.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.900
And these processes rely on a whole host of
hormones, receptors, and other factors that

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.910
come from at LEAST 70 different genes on different
chromosomes.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.080
So really, biological sex is not black or
white because there are so many variables

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.750
going into it that are not necessarily correlated
with one another.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.900
Which is why there’s good evidence to say
there are more than 2 biological sexes.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.210
For example testosterone is important for
developing the internal genitalia, but it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.490
needs to be converted by an enzyme for the
external genitalia to be made.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.600
So someone could have testosterone, plus all
the effects that leads to during development

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.640
through puberty, and be “male” in a lot
of ways internally...

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.280
...but because they’re missing one enzyme,
things might look a little different on the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.280
outside.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.040
The thing is, most people don’t know their
genetics or what’s inside their abdomen

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
… so how come we so confidently proclaim
-- well anything!

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.380
When I say I’m a woman, I’m actually referring
to my gender identity.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.770
This might be related to or influenced by
primary or secondary sex characteristics,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.540
but knowing our gender identity comes from
our brains.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
The fascinating thing is we don’t really
know a ton about what influences this identity...

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.410
just like how I might say: I am a confident
or anxious person, but don’t really know

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.440
what EXACTLY in MY brain makes me like that.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.420
There are a few regions in the brain that
are different between sexes, including the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.280
interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus
- and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.170
which is part of the limbic system.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.240
In men, these areas are both larger and have
more neurons in them.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520
And studies to date, albeit small, show the
sizes of these areas correlate with the gender

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.450
identities of transgender men and women.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.320
Other studies have found differences in white
matter microstructures between men and women.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.730
Transgender men who have not yet received
hormone treatments had patterns more similar

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.680
to those sharing their gender identity, not
what they were assigned at birth.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.140
In other words, the sex they were assigned
at birth didn’t accurately predict their

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.530
white matter patterns.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.920
While there are so many different areas of
the brain that seem different between men

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.750
and women, some researchers argue there are
more similarities than differences and there

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020
isn’t really a typical “male” or “female”
brain.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.380
But given that, ALL of us have incomplete
information on our true biological sex, and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.540
that we don’t fully understand the neuroscience
behind gender

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.070
-- or honestly a lot of complex things like
why we like fun shirts --

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.930
...it doesn’t make sense to burden individuals
with proving how they feel.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.190
Because scientifically, NONE of us can explain
why we feel like a man, woman *indicate to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.190
each other*

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.120
And as none of us can say that, by making
a minority of people TRY to provide a burden

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.820
of proof, we’re causing a LOT of health
problems.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.800
For example, the suicide ATTEMPT rate among
transgender people ranges from 32-50% in a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.490
number of different countries, whereas the
overall population average in the US is estimated

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.599
around point-zero-four to one-point-one percent%.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.280
Both of these numbers are too high, but the
stats for transgender people particularly

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.270
so, especially when recent studies show these
numbers decrease when transgender people are

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.580
socially accepted.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.610
While there are, of course, a lot more scientific
questions to ask, we could save hundreds of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.120
thousands of lives by removing social stigma.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.090
We know science will catch up eventually,
but in the meantime… we should all recognize

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.400
this is more complicated than man, woman,
trans or non-binary.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.639
And as is the norm in science, the more we
learn, the more nuanced it gets.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.990
And that diversity in people and ideas is
what makes the world so cool.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.250
