00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.200
[John] Well, I used to say, and I'm still inclined to say occasionally,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.720
that I hate it, I hate the Game of Life.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.280
I don't really, at least I don't anymore.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.720
The reason why I felt like that was that,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.840
whenever my name was mentioned with respect to some mathematics,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.860
it was always the Game of Life.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.760
And I don't think the Game of Life is very very interesting.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.820
I don't think it was worth all that, I've done lots of other mathematical things.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.440
So I found the Game of Life was overshadowing much more important things and I did not like it.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.400
Now, well, I'm getting old,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.320
my capacity for hatred is getting less, I suppose.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.760
And it was an achievement. I'm quite proud of it.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.740
I just don't want to talk about it all the time.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.460
[Brady] I'm sorry.
[John] It's allright.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920
[Brady] I could not ask you about it.
[John] That's ok.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.160
[Brady] What is the Game of Life? This thing that you're stuck with now.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.020
[John] Well, you'll really be able to focus on this.
[Brady] Yes, I can focus on that, no problem.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.240
[John] Have I got some coins in my pocket?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.400
[John] Curses, I don't. Have you?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.600
[John] In the Game of Life, you drop a handful of nuts, counters or something.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.980
The rules are:
At any given time, you've got some of these things that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
are full, I call that alive,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.580
and some of them are empty, I call that dead.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.360
If you've got too many neighbours..

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.720
The neighbours of a cell are all the 8 things nearest to it.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.780
If you got too many neighbours, you die.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.440
If you got 4 or more (in other words, that's the exact definition of 'too many'),

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.060
you die of overcrowding.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240
Probably because there isn't enough food in that region.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.480
But if you've only got one or no live neighbours, you die of isolation.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.560
Now, let's look.
This guy is going to die of isolation.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.900
This guy only has one neighbour too.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900
They both gonna die.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.680
But the other thing is, if you're dead at the moment, but you've got exactly 3 live neighbours,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.880
you see, this guy has three live neighbours, at the 8 places next to it,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.100
And so is this guy. Can you see? We've got 3 (neighbours).

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.640
So there is going to be a happy event next time.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140
Two things are going to be born here and here.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.520
And these two are going to die.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.980
I might as well eat them.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.420
This guy is going to die.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.400
And these things now, who are babies at the moment,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.180
are gonna grow up there, they had the harder lessons there.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.100
Let's go out of slow.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.460
Next time, I'll just do it quickly.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.060
There is going to be somebody born here, because he has three live neighbours, and somebody born here.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.640
The condition for giving birth is that you have exactly three parents.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.840
That seems rather unusual, but it's not really imitating the human life, so to speak.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.960
It definitely isn't.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.780
The places I'm pointing to now are going to be born.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.000
And this one has four live neighbours. 1,2,3,4.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.580
So he's going to die.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.720
And this one only has one live neighbour, so he's going to die.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.820
This guy dies of overcrowding, and this guy, right next door, dies of isolation.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.420
So they're going to die.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.860
And the places my fingers are pointing to are going to be born.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.800
With this configuration.. This is the same shape as it was when we started two moves ago.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.800
But it's moved a little bit.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.800
And if you just follow it, it will keep on moving like this forevermore.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.460
It's what we call "The Glider".

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.560
I wish I hadn't called it "The Glider", because if you look at it,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.340
when somebody programmed the machine for you,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720
it looks more like an ant.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.380
I wish I called it an ant, it just walks across the plane.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.240
[Brady] What has been proven about the Game of Life? And since it...

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.600
[John] It's a long time ago, we've proven everything about it.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.800
Namely, we proved that it could do arbitrarily computations,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.600
it could build copies of itself,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.260
which had interesting properties, could move across the plane.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.840
It's hard to say exactly, easily to an audience that doesn't actually understand these things.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860
exactly how we proved those.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.200
I'm not entirely responsible for that.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:49.300
When I first told it to Martin Gardner, who wrote the mathematical games column in the Scientific America,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.740
I advertised really, I didn't know that it would have these properties, I hoped it would.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.720
And so, I advertised for a finite configuration which grew indefinitely.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.980
That was the simplest testable instance of this sort of ubiquity, this universality.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.020
And somebody at MIT build (Gosper and a few colleages of his),

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.180
came up with this thing called "The Glider Gun", which emmited a glider every 30 moves.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.040
And we played with that, and in the end, succeded in proving this universality thing.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.940
You know, we called it "The Game of Life", because it seemed, in a little bit ...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.520
Well, some of the ideas we had were taken from real life.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.640
If you have too many organisms of your type in a given region, you die of,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.580
because there isn't enough food for you, or something.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.740
If you've too few, well, it's nice to have a few companions.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.940
And if you don't have the companions, you might as well die, I mean, that's it.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.240
And so on. So the..

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.320
The basic rules are tremendous simplification of the rules of real life,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
for very very simple organisms.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.140
You have the unpredictability of real life too.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.560
And yes, it all comes from very very simple rules.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.560
So I think that's why people are interested.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.140
You know, who would have thought.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.460
Well, I thought, but typically, one doesn't think

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.780
that one can get a decent simulation of real living things in such a very simple way.
