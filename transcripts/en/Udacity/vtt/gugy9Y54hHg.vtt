00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.948
5+2 is equivalent to 2+5,
so this is true.

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:08.268
5+2 and 2+5 both equal 7.

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:12.744
5-2 is not equivalent to 2-5,
so this is false.

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:17.012
5-2 = 3 and 2- 5 = -3.

00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:19.056
So the expressions are not equivalent.

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:21.059
