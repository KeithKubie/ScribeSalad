00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:08.700
Have you ever heard the sound of frogs

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.120
calling at night?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.876
For hundreds of millions of years,

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:15.058
this croaking lullaby has filled the nighttime air.

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:16.645
But recent studies suggest

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:18.229
that these frogs are in danger

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:20.314
of playing their final note.

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:21.900
Over the past few decades,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.779
amphibian populations have been rapidly disappearing worldwide.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.240
Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.834
are endanger of extinction,

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.874
and over 100 species have already disappeared.

00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:35.415
But don't worry, there's still hope.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.341
Before we get into how to save the frogs,

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:38.804
let's start by taking a look

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.168
at why they're disappearing

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.680
and why it's important to keep them around.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.920
Habitat destruction is the number one problem

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.352
for frog populations around the world.

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:49.698
There are seven billion humans on the planet,

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:52.029
and we compete with frogs for habitat.

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:54.341
We build cities, suburbs, and farms

00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:55.758
on top of frog habitat

00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:57.116
and chop forests

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:58.115
and drain the wetlands

00:00:58.115 --> 00:00:59.052
that serve as home

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:01.542
for numerous amphibian populations.

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.293
Climate change alters precipitation levels,

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:07.658
drying up ponds, streams, and cloud forests.

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:10.340
As the Earth's human population continues to grow,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.168
so will the threats amphibians face.

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:14.797
There are a variety of other factors

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:17.060
contributing to the frogs' decline.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.316
Over-harvesting for the pet and food trade

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:20.756
results in millions of frogs

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:23.310
being taken out of the wild each year.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.425
Invasive species,

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.477
such as non-native trout and crawfish,

00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:28.009
eat native frogs.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.477
Humans are facilitating the spread

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:30.851
of infectious diseases

00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:32.925
by shipping over 100 million amphibians

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.701
around the world each year

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.032
for use as food, pets, bait,

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:38.487
and in laboratories and zoos,

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:41.280
with few regulations or quarantines.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.839
One of these diseases,

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:44.292
chytridiomycosis,

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:46.565
has driven stream-dwelling amphibian populations

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:47.874
to extinction

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:48.651
in Africa,

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:49.332
Australia,

00:01:49.332 --> 00:01:49.925
Europe,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.420
and North, Central, and South America.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.259
On top of all these problems,

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.133
we add hundreds of millions of kilograms of pesticides

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.143
to our ecosystems each year.

00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:00.898
And these chemicals are easily absorbed

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:02.889
through amphibians' permeable skin,

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.634
causing immunosuppression,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:05.838
or a weakened immune system,

00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:08.226
and developmental deformities.

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:10.809
Okay, so why are these little green guys

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.309
worth keeping around?

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:14.836
Frogs are important for a multitude of reasons.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.652
They're an integral part of the food web,

00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:18.840
eating flies, ticks, mosquitoes,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.208
and other disease vectors,

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.614
thus, protecting us against malaria,

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:23.649
dengue fever,

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.343
and other illnesses.

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:27.049
Tadpoles keep waterways clean

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.262
by feeding on algae,

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:29.335
reducing the demand

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.419
on our community's filtration systems

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.839
and keeping our cost of water low.

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.512
Frogs serve as a source of food

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:39.468
for birds, fish, snakes, dragonflies, and even monkeys.

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:40.843
When frogs disappear,

00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:42.425
the food web is disturbed,

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:45.059
and other animals can disappear as well.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.228
Amphibians are also extremely important

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.725
in human medicine.

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:50.756
Over ten percent of the Nobel prizes

00:02:50.756 --> 00:02:52.354
in physiology and medicine

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:53.362
have gone to researchers

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:56.169
whose work depended on amphibians.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.074
Some of the antimicrobial peptides

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.473
on frog skin can kill HIV,

00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:01.954
some act as pain killers,

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:05.063
and others serve as natural mosquito repellents.

00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:06.710
Many discoveries await us

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.160
if we can save the frogs,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.117
but when a frog species disappears,

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:11.556
so does any promise it holds

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:13.678
for improving human health.

00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:16.309
Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can help,

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.641
and the best place to start

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:19.925
is by improving your ecological footprint

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.711
and day-to-day actions.

00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:24.228
The next time you listen to that nighttime lullaby,

00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:26.854
don't think of it as just another background noise,

00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:28.390
hear it as a call for help,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.517
sung in perfect croaking harmony.
