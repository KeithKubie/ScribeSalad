I want to teach you about another tag. This one is

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.580
called the em tag. It stands for emphasis, and it makes

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.700
things italic. It looks like this. You've got the opening

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.650
em tag, contents, and then the closing em tag with the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.410
slash. Same structure as the bold tag. Nothing too nothing

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.770
too complex here. Let's try it out in the browser really

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.020
quick. Okay, so here we are in our browser again.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.450
Let's make the word learn italicized. So all I do is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.760
I put an opening em tag and then I put a closing em tag, and I hit Update.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.700
And that took the word learn and made it italicized. What

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.530
I'd like you to do is take the whole phrase below and make it italic.
