- By ratifying this
declaration, we hereby denounce

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.548 line:0%
all allegiance to
the British crown.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.083
- Here, here!

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.251
- Boo!

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Mr. Trump from New
York, you wish to speak?

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:22.521
- Oh, shut it Jefferson.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.123
You know I'm Trump now, alright.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.960
Look delegates, you know
me, you know I'm rich,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.430
and you know that I'm
wonderfully dressed

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.465 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I'm extremely
knowledgeable at business,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.202 align:start position:0%
and I gotta tell you, this
declaration deal, it's horrific.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.970
It's one of the worst
deals I've ever seen.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.605
It's a real joke job, alright?

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.574
It's messy, it's got
signature all over it

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
and if I was
president, I promise,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.247 align:start size:97% position:3%
I would make these
colonies great again, okay?

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.049
Okay, folks.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.786
You know Jefferson, you know
Adams, and you know Franklin,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.488
and frankly they're pussies.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.723 align:start size:94% position:6%
They're all pathetic, they
are some of the worst.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.626
The way that they bungled
that whole tea tax thing,

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.894
disgusting.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.296
If I was there, I'd
be getting teabagged

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.131
by every freakin'
red coat I saw.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.133
- They imposed taxes
without our consent.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.302 align:start size:94% position:6%
That is why we are
fighting this war, Trump!

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.770
- Excuse me, ugly Adams.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.504
Don't you mean that's why
we're losing this war?

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:15.141
Because we are, you lost Quebec.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.977 align:start size:84% position:16%
You lost Bunker
Hill, you're a loser.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.647
Under a Trump Administration,
I would be winning so much

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.847
you'd be sick of winning.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
You'd feel like
you had diphtheria.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.817
It would be disgusting,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.285
you'd be pooping and
peeing everywhere.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:27.653
I can promise you that.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.322
- You blusterous blow-heart.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.458 align:start size:94% position:6%
What qualifies you to lead
the continental army?!

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I am gonna make a
tremendous deal on guns.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.030
I'm friends with all the Blacks.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.700
Smiths, they love
me, I love them.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.001
We get along very well.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.836
We have a secret
handshake, okay.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.438
- Mr. Trump, with
all due respect,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.506
this congress is
perfectly capable

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.876 align:start size:84% position:16%
of providing security
for its citizens.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.543
- Oh is it, fat Franklin?

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:53.679
I don't think it is
'cause Mexico owns
half of the continent

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.181
last time I checked
and if I was elected,

00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.283
I'd build a wall around Mexico

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.820
and I'd have China pay for it.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.024 align:start size:88% position:13%
'Cause China loves walls
and China loves me.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.525
I've been to China,
they love me more

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.027
than their Chinese spaghetti.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That is racist sir,
even in this time period.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.299
- Do we really want
the man who organized

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.469
the Miss Colonies Pageant
to lead our new nation?!

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.369
- I do not!

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.638
- Oh yeah, speaking of which,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.205
have you seen my
new wife Morenca?

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:22.375
Oof, she's a real smoke show.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.577 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's got titties
like I've never seen.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:27.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
Unlike Jefferson's
wife, she's a fat pig.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.049
I heard she's so ugly that
he has sex with his slaves.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.350
I don't know, is it true?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.586
- Big words from a man
with such small hands!

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.088
- If my farm hands were small,

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.525
that means my plantation is
small and I could assure you,

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.595
I don't have any problems
in that department, okay?

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Gentlemen, I must
ask, no more quarreling.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.900
It is time that we made a
meal of this declaration.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.369 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Look, alright guys,
let me get to the point.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.738
I say instead of making
America great again,

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.441 align:start size:84% position:16%
we make America,
Great Britain again.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.343
Alright, okay, okay.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.445
Alright, look, okay.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.746
Who threw that?

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.247 align:start size:81% position:19%
Who threw that,
someone punch him.

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:04.250 align:start size:94% position:6%
I will pay your
magistrate fees, alright?

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
Look, don't come running
to me in 240 years

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.089
when you need my family to
save your country, alright?

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.591
- I assure you, Mr. Trump,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.560
the democracy will never
be in that bad of shape.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.095
(laughter)

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.130 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's what fat
Franklin's wife said.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.232
Alright, Trump 76.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.134
Vote Trump, Trump Palin.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:26.072
