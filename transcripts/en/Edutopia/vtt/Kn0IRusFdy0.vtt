00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:10.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And our goal next
year is to be the only YES campus

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.846
that has ever been
exemplary every single year.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:13.913
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: You can see it
at an end-of-year assembly

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:24.816
and on the soccer field in the
student-versus-faculty match.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:24.883
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students
of YES Prep North Central

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:31.866
and their teachers actually like
each other, and they like being here.

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:35.986
The positive energy on campus
makes fences and cameras

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:37.966
and security guards unnecessary.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.196
There are few, if any, fights.

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:46.246
This ideal environment for learning
is the product of several programs

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.726
and initiatives that
promote the school culture

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.806
and support self-discipline.

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:55.266
&gt;&gt;Student: RISE stands for "restoring
individual student excellence."

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.636
Being in RISE has made me realize
that you can't always get away

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:00.786
with the little things in life.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:04.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: By incurring five marks
in one week for infractions ranging

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.196
from chewing gum in
class to dishonesty,

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.746
the students in white T-shirts
have been placed on RISE,

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:14.766
a strict disciplinary system
that requires a daily visit

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:18.316
to the principal's office until
their transgressions are balanced

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:19.426
by good behavior.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:23.366
&gt;&gt;Alexander: Well, I got five marks
and I got it for talking, and,

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.626
yeah, so I'm not proud of it.

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:27.876
Literally it sucks, yeah.

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:32.146
It sucks. I'm going to try
harder to get off and be back

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:33.526
with my group right there.

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:34.916
&gt;&gt;Philip: Look at this thing.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.536
Does this show me that you're
trying hard to get off RISE?

00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:40.736
&gt;&gt;I just kind of go with
the way I was raised.

00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:44.526
My parents showed me a ton of love
but were also extremely direct

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:48.126
and stern when I screwed up, and
that's the way I talk to the students

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:49.946
in checking them in the morning RISE.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:52.526
&gt;&gt;This is a small example
of what's going to happen

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:53.206
for the rest of your life.

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:55.186
If you make poor decisions,
you're going to miss

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.276
out on the great opportunities.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.776
&gt;&gt;I think kind of the approach
with the RISE is, look,

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:01.156
I care about you tremendously.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:02.446
I really want you to be successful.

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:05.376
I'm not giving up on you,
but you've let me down

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:06.826
and you've let your classmates down.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.816
You've let your teachers down,
but each day is a new day

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:13.586
to hold themselves responsible
for their behaviors and that they,

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:16.666
with their actions, can
get back into the community

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.416
and be a part of the family again.

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.036
&gt;&gt;You've done a great
job, so keep it up.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:20.626
Have a good day.

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:24.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While they're on
the RISE, students are separated

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.726
from their classmates
during lunch and assemblies.

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:31.266
In class they are forbidden to speak
unless it is academically essential.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:34.626
After logging five days
of positive behavior,

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:36.266
they address their classmates

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:39.716
to explain why they are
worthy of reuniting with them.

00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:41.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Dear classmates,
I am writing this letter

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:45.126
to inform you the reason I was
in respect to RISE for so long.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:48.636
&gt;&gt;Student: How will you prove to us
that you won't get on RISE again?

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Because whenever a
teacher's talking I will slant

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.856
towards here, and whenever
a student tries to talk

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.116
to me I will just raise my hand
and tell her I need to move.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:59.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You ready
to change, Tatiana?

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:01.576
Welcome back.

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.326
&gt;&gt;Class: [claps]

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:03.746
&gt;&gt;Alexander: RISE is an
important thing here,

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:07.616
because it teaches your students
how to improve from their errors,

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:09.776
and I really believe that.

00:03:09.926 --> 00:03:13.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, highs and lows?

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:14.716
Who wants to start us?

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students
meet for one period

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:19.226
with their class adviser
several times each week.

00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:22.516
It's an opportunity for them
to be heard and supported.

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:25.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Her portfolios, I was glad
that my mom was there, because I felt

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:28.716
like she supported me, and usually
she can't, because she's working

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:31.426
and stuff, so I was really
proud of that, happy.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.776
&gt;&gt;Philip: Every student in the
school has someone that they can kind

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:37.366
of go to, who knows them well, who
maybe knows their ups and downs

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.876
and often is not their
same classroom teacher.

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:42.136
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's
important for us to be heard,

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:45.086
to let people know our feelings,
because if we keep things balled

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:48.886
up it can get worse, and
we don't want each other

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.926
to get hurt, because it can escalate.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.666
&gt;&gt;Magda: In advisory it's talking

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.706
about how do we communicate
our frustrations, our ideas?

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:57.896
How do we handle tough situations?

00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:00.666
It's talking about, what
does it mean to be Hispanic?

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.186
What does it mean to be a minority?

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:05.536
&gt;&gt;Now, I want everybody to lock
in their mind one emotional need

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:08.556
that they value, and what
happens when you don't feel

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:11.836
like that emotional need is not
being -- it's not being met?

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:15.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: History teacher Magda
Derisma did extensive research

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.406
and consulted with the school
counselor before settling

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:20.206
on a theme for her advisory.

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:23.136
&gt;&gt;Class: We have your
back and we are listening.

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:26.516
&gt;&gt;Magda: It kind of took me a
while in my head to actually figure

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.666
out what the words were actually
going to be, and I said, okay,

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:29.996
I like these set of words.

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:32.156
It's like, "We have your
back and we are listening."

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:35.026
It just shows that we're
supporting you and we are listening

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:37.906
to what you say, so that they
know that empathy is important,

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:40.266
just to sit down and listen to
what somebody else is saying

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.846
and how do we support someone else

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:44.086
and actually give them
advice in a concrete way.

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:45.656
&gt;&gt;Student: So, since
this school is supposed

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:50.826
to be a family-oriented school,
so instead of us being separated

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:53.926
into different groups of
friends, we need to mix it up

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:57.456
and have different people
instead of just one little group.

00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:02.646
&gt;&gt;Chris: The signage and the
messaging and when you walk

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:04.996
into a classroom, I mean, there's
stuff up all over the walls.

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:06.276
All that's intentional.

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:09.316
When I was a teacher, I
mean, my goal was that even

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:11.776
if the kids aren't paying
attention to me and they're looking

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:14.436
around the room or daydreaming, I
want them learning something, right?

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:18.726
There really has to be kind of
a marketing campaign every day

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.606
around why are you here,
what this is going to lead to

00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:24.166
and why college is really important.

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:26.166
So, part of it is just making sure

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.836
that kids are getting
the right messages,

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:30.966
because when they're not
here, they're bombarded

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.486
with a whole other set of them,

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:34.996
whether it's on TV
or from their peers.

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:38.826
And so, if we're not aware
of that and trying to fight

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:42.116
that with positive messaging
here, we're fooling ourselves.

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:45.126
&gt;&gt;Craig: One thing our school is
really big on is something called the

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:48.616
"Thinks and Acts," and they were
created by a group of students,

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:52.046
who said, "We want to leave YES
with something to remember us by,"

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:54.776
and basically they say, "This is
how YES students should think.

00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:59.696
This is how a YES student should
act," not just in school but outside

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.796
of school, too, and so we
really challenge our students.

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.986
We say, "Hey, are you
living the Thinks and Acts?

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.246
Are you living the blue-orange?"

00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:08.436
&gt;&gt;Chris: I feel like one of my jobs
and the jobs of the leaderships

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:12.136
across this organization is to make
sure that we're living those signs,

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.856
that we're living those values
and that we are walking,

00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:21.966
breathing examples of the kind
of people we want our kids to be.

00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:23.686
