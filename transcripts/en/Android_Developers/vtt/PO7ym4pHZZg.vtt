00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.533
- Your Google Play listing

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.466
is a vital part
of your app marketing.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.433
Ensuring your listing
is the best it can possibly be

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.000
will improve your app's
discovery in the Play store

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.900
and convert more visits
into installs.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.400
Here are ten tips for creating
a great listing.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.500
Create a unique,
eye-catching icon.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400
A high quality icon created by
a graphic designer

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.700
will make your app stand out
in Play store search results.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.466
Don't be too abstract.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.600
Reflect the purpose
and character

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
of your app or game.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.533
And remember, clean and simple
often has the most impact.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.233
Add device screenshots.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.466
Users want to know what your app
will look like on their device.

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.633
So include multiple screenshots

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.166
for every form-factor
your app runs on,

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.433
including all tablets,
wear, and TV.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.233
And include both landscape
and portrait views

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.900
for smartphones and tablets.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.666
Add a feature graphic.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.900
Sum up your app or game

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.966
in one outstanding,
captivating image,

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.500
one that illustrates
your apps key features,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.733
how it's used,

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.600
and what your users
will get from it.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.700
A great hero image will
entice users to install.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.966
Run experiments
on your graphics and text.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.400
Our store listing
experiments feature

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.533
lets you test
different graphics and text

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.133
to find out which options
perform the best.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.766
By testing different
high-quality app icons,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.166
some developers have seen
double digit improvements

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.433
in their store listing
conversion rates.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.800
This data-driven approach

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.500
let's you figure out
what converts the most users

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.166
so you can drive more installs.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.700
Add a video.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.933
A video will help visitors
to your Play store listing

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.033
decide whether
to download your app.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.333
Your video should show off

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.166
the key features
of your app or game

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.766
and explain how your app
benefits users.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.033
Show the app
actually being used.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.200
If your app
is complex or unusual,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.600
think about a how-to guide
or tutorial video.

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.700
Write a compelling
app description.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.433
Sum up your app benefit
in your short description

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.900
and keep your long description
concise.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.766
Long descriptions
might not even be read

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.333
the whole way through.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.066
Make the first sentence count.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.500
Grab the user by telling them

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.866
why they should install
your app or game

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.333
and keep the rest simple:

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.500
what your app does
and why it is valuable.

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.833
Choose your words carefully.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.933
A clear and accurate description
of your app

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:29.033
will place your app in the most
relevant user searches.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.433
A list of keywords
will be considered spam.

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.066
Make sure you review
and understand

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.033
the Google Play keyword policies

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.466
described in the policy center.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.133
Localize your listing.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.933
Add translated store listings

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:44.300
for all the languages
your app supports.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300
If you're requesting
a professional translation

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.766
of your app using
the app translation service,

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.600
you can add the text
for your store listing

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.466
to get it translated too.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.466
And be sure to also localize
your graphics and videos.

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:58.400
Show off a little.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.533
If you've won awards
and had great feedback,

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.800
let people know.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.900
List the prizes.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.000
Include examples
of your brilliant reviews.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.366
Letting people know
how great your app is

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.800
will get them excited about it.

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.166
Respond to feedback.

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:14.866
Ratings and reviews
will improve your store listing.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:18.366

will show prospective users

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.066
you're a trustworthy developer,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.533
while building loyalty
