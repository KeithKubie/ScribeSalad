00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.300
Clearly there's a lot going on here.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.850
But for the sake of simplicity what I want to do

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.880
is I want to categorize these ideas into a few buckets.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.930
For instance, ideas like how to add buttons and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.600
how to add text, they're all a very visible part of the app.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.570
Let's call this category, View.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.100
When we are going to build that app, we will also need to save some data.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.520
This, for us, will be audio file that we can play back.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.920
Let's put that in another category and call that category Data or Model.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.960
And finally, we will write some code to control the View and the Model.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.510
Here we will need the change the speed of the recorded audio.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.530
And we will also need to learn how to transition between different screens.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.580
We can call this category controller.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.060
Now a good analogy here would be from the word of theater.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.390
You can think of a View as actors.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.140
Actors are the most visible part of a play.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.490
A Controller is like a director who manages or controls things on a set.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.400
And finally, you can think of the Model as the backstage area,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.240
where they store props that are needed for the play.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.600
So, what you're seeing here,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.570
is the beginning of a design pattern called Model, View, and Controller.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.740
Or MVC for

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.050
short, that Apple wants programmers to follow when they are making apps.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.510
In fact, most apps in the app store, follow this sort of a design, and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.765
so will we.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:34.490
You will begin to see this design pattern as soon as we make our app.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.430
So let's do that next.
