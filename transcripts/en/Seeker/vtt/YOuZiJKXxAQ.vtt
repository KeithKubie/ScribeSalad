00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.080
"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
said Oppenheimer, but of course… there may

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.140
have been a metazoan who said it first.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.690
Sup Earthers, welcome back to DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.520
Ahhhh, the metazoans, those early conquerors
and destroyers of Earth.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.570
According to new research, these tiny animals
may have caused the first mass extinction

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.250
on planet Earth.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.289
What a relief!

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.410
Humans are bad, you guys -- and are likely
causing another mass extinction right now

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.490
-- but c'mon, the metazoans did it first!

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.490
We're just johnny-come-latelys!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.230
We're number six!

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.070
We're number six!!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.780
Extinction is nothing new to our planet.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.809
About 3.8 billion years ago life evolved,
but it wasn't super diverse; it was mostly

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.860
a blanket of gooey, single-celled, stationary
organisms.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.950
Then, 600 million years ago, during what's
called the Cambrian explosion or Cambrian

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.390
Radiation, life began to diversify, and a
new, multicellular species evolved that was

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.670
unlike anything ever seen on Earth before:
The Metazoans.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.480
The researchers called these, "ecosystem engineers."

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.859
They immediately began changing the environment
to suit their way of life.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.389
Of course, at the time, there had already
been life for over 3 billion years… and

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:12.900
that old life wasn't cut-out for this new
world the metazoans were building.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.759
During that Cambrian explosion, the older
animals were pushed out of the fossil record

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.459
as newer animals evolved legs, backbones,
complex eyes and the concept of predators

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.219
and prey which we still see today…

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.950
Thus, the first mass extinction began -- called
the End-Ordovician or Ordovician-Silurian

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.590
Event where 85-percent of species disappeared.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.619
But this wasn't the only extinction.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.619
Ohhh no!

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.599
Over the next 70 million years or so, these
new conquerors of the Earth enjoyed their

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.091
reign, another 70-percent would die in the
Late-Devonian extinction, about 360 million

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:45.091
years ago.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:49.169
This was mostly in the ocean, with coral,
and other shallow-sea animals.

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:53.349
Hypothetically, they were hammered by changes
in sea levels, climate change, or perhaps

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:54.850
an asteroid impact.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.349
But a major theory says modern-ish plants
may have evolved to suck more CO2 out of the

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.729
air, cooling the planet and causing an ice
age.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.899
This extinction removed the famous trilobites
from the fossil record.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.020
Stupid plants.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.510
Then, 250 million years ago, more than 96
percent of the species that had evolved up

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.549
to that point were wiped from the fossil record
in what's called the Permian extinction -- or

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.299
the Great Dying.

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.470
During the Permian, there were synapsids -- sort
of a cross between dogs and lizards; picture

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.250
the fin-backed dimetrodon.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.200
These pre-dinosaur Synapsids were one of the
first vertebrate kings of Earth.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.260
Until this 3rd extinction -- where insects,
marine animals, and synapsids were devastated,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.350
perhaps by an asteroid impact, acid rain caused
by pollution from massive volcanic activity,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.740
or a sudden drop in oxygen caused by sea-organisms
affecting the atmosphere.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.909
Again plants and animals still killing each
other.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.859
The fourth Triassic-Jurassic extinction started
200 millions years ago, and since the loss

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.590
of all that marine life after the Permian,
cephalopods exploded onto the scene to fill

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.170
the now-empty space.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.189
During this event, more marine mammals were
wiped out, the reef-building coral that had

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.160
spent hundreds of millions of years recovering
was hit again, and these Knights of Summer,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.379
the cephalopods, were hit hard.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.550
The synapsids that survived, evolved into
dinosaurs, but then were hit by the famous

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.530
K/T extinction event that wiped them out too,
65 million years ago.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.670
Though we were already in trouble with sea-level
rise and eruptions increasing around the planet,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.099
so that meteor just accelerated the fifth
extinction that was already in progress.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.209
This killed another three-quarters of the
species including: dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs,

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.569
ammonites, flowering plants, and a few others…

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.569
Damn.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.700
Today, everything that exists evolved from
the survivors of each of these events, and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.400
some scientists believe humans have kicked
off another mass extinction, the Holocene

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.209
or Anthropocene extinction event.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.159
The sea-levels are rising, atmosphere and
soil are changing, and many of the world's

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.170
species are disappearing.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.659
Knowing about these other extinctions… all
this sounds familiar, but only time will tell

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.010
if we're in a Sixth Mass Extinction.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.510
And in geologic time, we'll have a long wait.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.030
But we can rest easy knowing the metazoans
started it, right?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.959
Though I guess, we are technically multicellular
ancestors of the metazoans technically…

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.280
so *gulp*

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:38.090
Look, we don't have to freak out too much.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.060
Maybe there's a way to stop this sixth mass
extinction.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.850
Will and Julia came up with some strategies,
right here.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:05:01.930
There was a 
lot to cover in this video, should we do an

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.020
extinction week where we look at each event
on it's own?

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.110
What do you think?
