1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,260
Yeah. Just remind me to never
complain about anything ever again.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,970
You know what I mean? Yeah. Don't, don't,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,940
don't let me complain about
anything ever again. I mean,

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:16,560
I don't consider myself a big
complainer, but come on, this is just,

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,910
we have no reason to complain
about anything. Yeah, yeah man.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,610
What's crazy too is one of the heavier
parts there where I felt it was when he

7
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,490
talked about the claustrophobia heart.
Yeah. I know you have an issue with,

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,510
Dang it, it's there, but
he's not saying it's not,

9
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm not super sensitive to it, but it's
something I know. I feel that, that,

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,830
that's like a tough one to
get over, you know? Yeah.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,990
And especially going through
all that stuff first and Dayton,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,540
you got to deal with the cla. I Dunno,
man. This might be too heavy for me.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,810
Well, it was too heavy for a lot of people

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,530
and yeah, I mean it's almost like you,

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,750
you, we almost don't need to have a
discussion about this book. You know,

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,380
magnus just stopped talking about it.
Everyone go read it. I get it. You know,

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,510
and just, let's move on. You know,

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,910
because like I said, it
just makes you realize

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
just what kind of suffering there
can be and how good you've got it.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,260
How good you've got it.

21
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm going to go to bed tonight in
my bed and it's going to feel good.

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,780
You feel good to appreciate that
I'm appreciated every night. Yup.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,300
Yeah,

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,190
so cause you think about like some
little things you don't even think about,

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
but they're like a real luxury.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,870
It's just things that you really enjoy
but you don't even think about it.

27
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,740
They're just, they're just
like a whatever. Like for me,

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,840
I really like a nice cold, you know,
big a bottle of water. You know,

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,770
I have a big, just a big bottle of
water. I completely take it for granted.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,970
When I go to work out in the morning,

31
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,550
I dropped a couple of ice
cubes in there and fill it up.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,050
It's all nice and filtered and whatnot.
Oh I don't think anything about that.

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,070
You know, that would be like
Heaven, heaven. And then you get D,

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,460
You know, you go to bed at night,
you just crawl into the, to the,

35
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,400
the 500 thread sheets or I
don't know, there's some,

36
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,960
there's some kind of
sheets that are in this,

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,760
but whatever they are kind of cotton
sheets that are all nice. Yeah.

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,190
Declining to those. You
don't think about that.

39
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,050
You're not thankful for that every
night. Yeah. Pit pretty much everything.

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,180
Like I said, pretty much
everything. Even like, Oh yeah,

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
you know how you're
breathing right now. Look at,

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,920
consider that compared to that.
What you just read there? Just,

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,780
we'll just breathing. Listen,
let's just start with that.

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,610
Let's just break it down with air. Yeah.
That's the beginning. And I remember,

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,890
um, the cable guy was coming [inaudible],
which already sounds silly. I know.

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,270
And um, and he was late. He was supposed
to come this to was the cutoff, right?

47
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,800
Where he was going to cut
it. It was like, you know,

48
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,820
before the struggle is real. The
cable guy was late. Yeah. So he can't,

49
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,430
I don't know, two 15 or
something, and I had to go,

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,680
I want to see it go to
workout or something.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,630
This is getting worse and worse
than no. This the [inaudible]. Yeah.

52
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,560
For my 15 minutes later, he's,
you know, he's, he's fixing,

53
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,820
not fixing for an unannounced. Yeah.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,310
And yeah,

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,310
and that's one of the things I
thought of primarily when you said,

56
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,960
think of all the little luxuries. So
not only, I'm not only am I complaining

57
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,960
about something I don't need,

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,030
I'm complaining about
something that I'm kidding.

59
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,570
Like a supreme luxury. I'm
complaining about that,

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,890
you know, because it didn't come
out 15 minutes of all things, um,

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,180
before the time that it did.

62
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,683
Yeah.

63
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,350
I'm going to check myself to good
idea. I'm going to check myself too.
