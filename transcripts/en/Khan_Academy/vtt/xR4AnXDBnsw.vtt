00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.510
So we've got the function, f of x is equal
to x squared.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.870
And what I'm concerned with, is finding
the area under the curve,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.900
y is equal to f of x, so that's my y axis.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.630
This is my, my, x axis.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.720
Then let me draw my function.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.460
My function looks like this.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.740
At least in the, in the first quadrant.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.150
That's where I'll graph it for now.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.190
I could also graph it, obviously in the
second quadrant.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.570
But, what I care about is the area under
this curve and above the positive x axis,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.840
between, between x equals 1 and x equals
4, x equals 4.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.272
And I'm tired of approximating areas.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:50.350
I wanna find the exact area under this
curve above the x axis.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.780
And the way we denote the exact area under
the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.990
curve, this little brown shaded area, is
using the definite integral.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.170
The definite integral from 1 to 4 of f of
x, dx.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.400
And the way that, or the way I
conceptualize

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.090
where this notation comes from, is we
imagine a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.650
bunch of infinite, an infinite number of
infinitely thin

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.240
rectangles that we sum up to find this
area.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.010
Let me draw one of those infinitely thin
rectangles, maybe not so infinitely thin.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.670
So, let me draw it like this.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.590
So, that would be one of the rectangles,
that would be another rectangle.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.390
This should be reminiscent of a Riemann
sum.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.685
In fact, that's where the Riemann integral
comes from.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:30.288
Think of a Riemann sum where you have an
infinite number

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:33.411
of these rectangles, where the width of
each of the rectangles.

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:38.546
This is how I conceptualize it, is dx, and
the height of this rectangle is the

00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:43.453
function evaluated at an x that's within
this interval right over here.

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:46.210
And so, this part right over here is the
area of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.690
one of those rectangles, and we were
summing them all up.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.530
And this kind of an elongated s,
reminiscent of a sigma for summing.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.760
We're summing up the infinite number, of
those infinitely thin rectangles,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.860
or the areas of those infinitely thin
rectangles between 1 and 4.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.660
So that's where the notation of the
definite integral comes from.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.740
But we still haven't done anything.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.550
We've just written some notation that says
the exact area of the un-

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.260
Between 1 and 4, under the curve f of x,
and above the x axis.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.150
In order to actually do anything really
productive with this, we have to turn to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.140
the second fundamental theorem of
calculus, sometimes called

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.970
part two of the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.580
&gt;&gt; Which tells us, that if f has an
antiderivative, so if we

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.060
have the antiderivative of f, so f of x is
derivative,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.505
derivative of some function capital F of
x, or another way of saying it is,

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:45.824
f, capital F of x is the antiderivative,

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:51.020
antiderivative of lower case f of x.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.940
Then I can evaluate this thing, and we do

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.310
a whole video on conceptually
understanding why this makes sense.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.000
We could evaluate this, by evaluating the
antiderivative

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.220
of f, or an antiderivative of f, at 4.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.340
And from that, subtract the antiderivative
evaluated at 1.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.110
So, let's do it for this particular case
right over here.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.230
So we are taking, I'll just rewrite this
statement.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.990
Instead of writing f of x, I'll write x
squared.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.360
So, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x
squared dx.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.370
Well, we're just gonna have to figure out
what the antiderivative is.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.820
So if f of x is equal to x squared, what
is capital F of x equal to?

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.110
What is the antiderivative?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.210
Well, you might remember from your power
rule, that if you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.100
take the derivative with respect to x of x
to the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.440
third, you are going to get 3x squared,
which is pretty

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.050
darn close to x squared except for this
factor of 3.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.615
So, let's divide both sides by 3.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.580
Let's divide both sides by 3, and you get
the derivative

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.520
of x to the third divided by 3 is indeed x
squared.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.310
Or, you can say this is the same thing as
the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.830
derivative with respect to x of, x to the
third over 3.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.830
Take the derivative of this.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.430
It'll be 3 times one third.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.630
And then you'll decrement the power, it'll
just be x squared.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.730
So, this right over here, once again, is x
squared.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.200
It's just equal to, just equal to x
squared.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.240
So, in this case, our capital F of x, our
antiderivative,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.540
is x to the third, x to the third over 3.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.600
And so we just have to evaluate that at 4
and at 1, and sometimes the way we would,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.070
the, the notation we would use is, we'll
say that the antiderivative is x

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.660
to the third over 3, and we're going to
evaluate it, the one I, I always

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.090
just like to write the numbers up here,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.260
at 4 and from that subtracted, evaluated
at 1.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.430
Sometimes you'll see people write a little
line here too,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.930
we'll say we're evaluate it at 4 and then
at 1.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.910
But I'll just do it without the line.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.010
If we're gonna evaluate this thing at 4
and from

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.330
that subtract it, subtract it evaluated at
1, so this

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.740
going to be equal to 4 to the third power
is 64, so it's going to be 64 over 3.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.330
Let me color code it, this is, this right
over here, is this, right

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.320
over there and then from that, we're

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.500
going to subtract this business evaluated
at one.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.330
Well, when you evaluate it at 1, you get 1
to the third is one over 3.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.900
You get one third.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.100
So just to be clear, this is this right
over there.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.660
And then we are ready to just subtract
these fractions.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.140
64 over 3, minus one third, is equal to 63
over 3.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.850
And 3 goes into 63 exactly, exactly 21
times.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.680
So, whatever the units are, the area of
this brown area is 21 square units.
