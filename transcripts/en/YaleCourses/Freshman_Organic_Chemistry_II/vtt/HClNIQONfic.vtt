1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.620
You have the exams back,
I'll have a good answer key for you soon.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.770
That currently the answer key just has which slides of the presentation where

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.530
the subject of each uh,
question,
uh,

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.870
may be good news that we're moving onto a new topic.
Okay,

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.880
so it's spectroscopy and it start last time we started talking about IRR

6
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:29.670
spectroscopy where the general idea you remember is that molecules vibrate.

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.110
If they change their dipole moment as they vibrate,

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.470
they can interact with light.

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.290
That is the electric vector of light can,

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.230
can cause them to vibrate at a higher amplitude,

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.450
but always at the same frequency.

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.970
And it's important as in pushing a child on a swing that you push at the right

13
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.080
time.
If you just go Wang,
Wang,
Wang with some little kids do,
uh,

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.700
the person won't go on the swing.

15
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.850
You have to push just when it's when they're coming back.
So you have to,

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
the frequency of the light has to be exactly the same as the natural frequency

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.270
with which the molecule vibrates.
But the molecule can vibrate in many ways.

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.220
And these are called normal modes.

19
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.520
And we were beginning to illustrate those last time.
Uh,

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.410
we illustrated it with butane,
but show the spectrum of octane,

21
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.910
which has the same features.

22
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.930
And last time we saw that there were lots of degrees of freedom,
even in butane,

23
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.560
many more in octane there,
36 normal modes there,

24
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.580
but 72 in octane.
And we looked at what some of them were,

25
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.220
that that one was the,
um,

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.570
was the coordinated stretching of the ch bonds as indeed,

27
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.010
uh,
with the field pushing up and down.
And the next one,
that blue one,

28
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.520
there are one of those peaks is the hydrogens moving,

29
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:55.521
coordinated Lee in and out in a normal mode where all vibrate at exactly the

30
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.290
same frequency.
And that's the frequency of that light.

31
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
And that one notice the electric vector goes in and out of the board rather than

32
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:07.140
up and down.
Okay.
So those were ch stretches.

33
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.390
There are other ch stretches like this one,

34
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.980
which are a sort of a briefing of the hydrogens,

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.560
which don't change the dipole moment,
therefore,

36
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:21.420
light has no handle on it and that doesn't appear in the,
uh,
in the,
uh,

37
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.660
IRR spectrum.
Okay.

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.250
There is another kind of spectroscopy called Raman spectroscopy which can see

39
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:34.251
that kind of vibration and in fact of the 10 ch stretches that combine to give

40
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.930
10 normal modes involving ch stretching.

41
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
Half of them have no handle and you can't see them in the eye are,

42
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.230
but we can go on to other peaks now.

43
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:48.750
Those were ch stretching at very high frequency.

44
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.070
Now we're at at high low frequency,
right?

45
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.940
The high end of the low frequency peaks and that particular peak is this motion

46
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.860
of the hydrogens.
What's here?

47
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.040
If you had to give that kind of,
if you had the name,

48
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:09.360
that kind of emotion of a ch two group that you see in this one,

49
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:10.230
what would you call it?

50
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.480
<v 1>Exactly?
It scissors.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

51
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.890
Then this one,

52
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.380
oops,
I went too far.
Oops,
sorry.
There we go.

53
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.620
<v 0>Notice the motion is almost entirely in the methyl groups at the end,</v>

54
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.500
not within the chain.
It's a bending.

55
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:40.210
It's in fact much similar to the scissors motion of the ch two groups,

56
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.370
but this one is called something else.

57
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:46.030
Could you give it a fanciful name of what one methyl group is doing?

58
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.090
It's called the umbrella mode.
Okay.

59
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.490
Uh,
this little peak here turns out to be this motion.

60
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.040
See how they're wagging back and forth.
And he'd given ch two is going like this.

61
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.620
Oh,
sorry.
There we go.

62
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.540
Okay.
That's the way lag.

63
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.010
And this last beat down here is this one.

64
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.083
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.130
<v 0>So the ch are going like this.
All right?</v>

66
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:31.640
And that's the rocking mode.
So bear in mind that were,

67
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.850
that were illustrated with butane,
but showing octane,

68
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:37.070
but they have these same motions.
I've obviously,

69
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:41.780
octane has those same motions as as uh,
uh,
butane does.

70
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.170
And they're all coordinated together at the same frequency.

71
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:46.490
So what's a normal mode?

72
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.650
And obviously the ones that appear in the spectrum are,
I are active.

73
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.410
So now how about functional groups?

74
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:56.540
Here we were looking just at a saturated alkane.

75
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.280
What IRR is especially good for is identifying functional groups.

76
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.470
So that was octane.
And here's oc Tine.
Incidentally,

77
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:08.810
what does I mean is a suffix

78
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.310
means a triple bond and methyl acetylene is methyl on a triple bond,

79
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.030
not nothing.
A lot of double bonds that gave some people problems on the exam.

80
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.820
Okay.
So most of the peaks are the same fight.
In fact,
there's One p here,

81
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:30.530
that one which is almost precisely the same.
Do you remember what that one was?

82
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.030
<v 1>And octane
that one?</v>

83
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.480
<v 0>Well,
we'll see just a second.</v>

84
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:43.481
And now look at that was for AWC Tine and now if we look at one arc tine,

85
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.820
a triple bond in a different position that the last two carbons,

86
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.070
then we see exactly that same peak again,
right?
So all these things,
octane,

87
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.260
a oc for rock tied,
one oc Tine,
all have that sharp peak that's circled.

88
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960
Okay.
And it's this motion,

89
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.790
right?
It's that same umbrella motion.
Right?

90
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.070
And why is it so special?

91
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.250
Why is it occur at exactly the same place in all of these?

92
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.280
Because it has its own frequency,
a certain frequency,

93
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.220
different from the frequencies of the neighboring ch twos.

94
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.280
So it does couple with them,
right?

95
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.850
It's a bad energy match for that frequency with the neighbors.

96
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.070
So it doesn't couple very much.

97
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.190
So it stands alone and is the same at octane on October nine also octine as

98
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.970
you'll see shortly.
Uh,
okay,
so that's that one.

99
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:41.210
Now there's some other peaks here that are new,

100
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:43.340
like there's one at really high frequency,

101
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.750
33 15 right now.
What's that?
Here's,

102
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.760
here's the molecule and watch its motion.
What's mostly happening.

103
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.473
<v 1>Okay,</v>

104
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.680
<v 0>and why is it different from anything you saw in octane</v>

105
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.900
at higher frequency?
First,
what's moving mostly?

106
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.430
<v 1>Are you sure</v>

107
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.920
<v 0>the ch bond is stretching and why is the stretching of this ch bond different</v>

108
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:16.950
from the stretching of the bonds we saw in octane?

109
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.450
Why is it a different frequency so that it doesn't mix up with other things?

110
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.300
Right?
Bad Energy match.
It doesn't mix.

111
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.690
<v 1>Ayesha
can't hear very well.</v>

112
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.490
<v 0>It's true that it's in the plane.
In fact,
it's in the line.</v>

113
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.110
In this case right there,

114
00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:39.720
all those items except for three hydrogens are on a line.

115
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.670
But what's special about that ch bond is compared to others.

116
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:45.961
We've,

117
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:50.961
we've seen things special about an acetylene ch bond before in its chemistry.

118
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.090
S P hybridized.
Remember it's acidic.
It's unusually acidic.

119
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.110
25 of his,
it's PKA because it's a ch bond.

120
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:07.880
So it's much stronger than the others,
right?
So it's at higher frequency,

121
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.350
right?
As you'd expect for a stronger spring.
Okay.

122
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.940
Now at the other end of the spectrum,

123
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:18.500
there's this really strong peak at 630 and that's this motion.

124
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.530
It's bending the hydrogen up and down,
right?
Bending that ch bond.

125
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.890
And that turns out to be much easier than bending bonds that are normally

126
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:36.770
hybridized.
Okay?
So that's that bending.

127
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:39.890
So that's characteristic of having an acetylene in the molecule.

128
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.070
If it's a terminal acetylene at the end of the chain that you,
uh,

129
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.640
you'll have these,
if it's not at the end of the chain,

130
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:49.460
then you don't have this kind of ch.
Okay.

131
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.610
Now what's this peak here at 2120.

132
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.100
Give me some thoughts about what that might be.

133
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.880
What kind of peaks come at the far left of the spectrum but very high frequency?

134
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.440
Ch Ch is because the HSO light,
right?

135
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.450
And then when you get bendings of Chs or stretching's of cc,

136
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.970
those come in the right half of the spectrum.

137
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.890
So this particular peak at 2120 is in,
what's a window usually?

138
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.090
Usually there's nothing.

139
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.870
There must be something really special that vibrates at that frequency.

140
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:26.790
And the idea of what could make something,
it's not an,
it's not a ch bond.

141
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.260
It must be a CC bond,
but it's a very special cc bonds.

142
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.600
What is it that would vibrate it?
Very high frequency.

143
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.860
The triple bond is three times as strong as a single bond.

144
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.930
So it comes at an unusually high frequency for a CC bond.
And here's its motion.

145
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.893
<v 1>Oops.</v>

146
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.380
<v 0>All right,
so it's the CC bond stretching.
Okay.</v>

147
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.970
Now notice that in the spectrum of four oc Tine the blue spectrum,

148
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.170
you don't have that peak.

149
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.780
Why don't you see the triple bond stretching in for rock tine?

150
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.880
How many carbons are there in AUC time?
Right?

151
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.290
There's no change in the dipole moment because it's symmetrical as you move like

152
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:18.590
that.
If it's at the end of the chain,
it's unsymmetrical,
right?

153
00:10:18.591 --> 00:10:20.600
And you can see it.
But if it's the middle of the chain,

154
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:24.380
it doesn't change the dipole moment.
Okay?
So you can take it.
Tell the difference.

155
00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:28.700
In two ways here between a triple bond that's at the end of the chain and a

156
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:31.790
triple bond that's in the middle of the chain.
Okay,

157
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:36.620
so there's no handle for the light,
interact with that one.
So we've seen octane,

158
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:40.760
we've seen AUC tines to AWC tines,
the four and the one.

159
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.450
Now let's look at Octine,
a different functional group.
So again,

160
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:49.451
most of the peaks look exactly the same as you because they have cha long chains

161
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:53.470
of ch two but it's trans for octine.

162
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.870
So there's a carbon carbon double bond.
Okay,

163
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.160
now there's this big peak at nine 67 right?

164
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.220
Okay,
now what could that be?
Now,
here's sis that was trans for octine.

165
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.490
Here's sis for [inaudible] and now you see a peak at 1655 what do you suppose

166
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:14.834
that is?

167
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.283
<v 1>Hm?</v>

168
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.420
<v 0>It's not not involved in an age.
It's very high frequency,</v>

169
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.250
but it doesn't involve age.
Those are up around 3000 any ideas for this one?

170
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.150
The double bond stretching.
Now why do you see it insists for team,

171
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.280
but you don't see it in trans for oc team.

172
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.843
<v 1>All right.</v>

173
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.760
<v 0>So that stretching is can be symmetrical,
right?</v>

174
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.410
And if it's trans double bond like this,
then it truly is symmetrical,

175
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.420
right?
There's a center of symmetry there,
right?
But if it sits for AWC,

176
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:56.230
tead then is you stretch the double bond and change the bonds,

177
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.870
changed the bonds from carbon,
the carbon,

178
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.640
you change the dipole moment in this direction,
not in this direction,

179
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.700
right?
So if you have a system like that,

180
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.080
then the dipole change is actually in a different direction.
Of course,

181
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.580
normally you major these spectra on,
on solutions.
So the PA,

182
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.610
so there'll be some molecules that are oriented properly,

183
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.690
but if you had molecules that were or fixed like in a crystal,

184
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.470
you could tell which way the double bonds were oriented by seeing which

185
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:31.300
direction,
uh,
the electric vector could interact with it.
Okay.

186
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.260
But notice that down at the low frequency and that has a big peak at seven 10,

187
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.530
whereas the Trans isomer had nine 67.

188
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.900
Now what are the,
what was the really low frequency peak in acetylene?

189
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.770
Remember in the one oc Tine number,
the one that was really down low,

190
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.900
that was the bending of the Ch.
So these are down low.

191
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.930
They could be bending of the CH.
Okay.

192
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.210
And let's just to compare,
look at,
uh,

193
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.140
a double bond that has three carbons on it.

194
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:10.141
So just one age that could bend out of plane and it has a peak at eight 28.

195
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.130
Now,
of course,
the others that don't have that extra methyl group,
our,
uh,

196
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.370
our CIS and trans,
but have two H's,

197
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.300
two h assists or two H's trans,
right?

198
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.980
And they'll couple as they vibrate because they're near one another,
right?

199
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:31.150
So there's perfect energy match,
right,

200
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.080
of these two.
So if you have any overlap,
any coupling mechanism,

201
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:40.030
mechanical coupling,
if one can feel the other vibrating,
uh,
then you'll,

202
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.530
then you'll,
you should get to vibrations coupled vibrations.
That is,

203
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.880
if we look at it this way,
you have the eight 28,
which is a single age.

204
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.020
But if you had to have them at eight 28 and they could interact,

205
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.450
you'd get a higher peak and a lower peak,

206
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.300
which looks like what we see in a way.

207
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.260
But the higher peak comes in one compound and the lower peak comes in.

208
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:06.790
Another one.
Where is the second of those two peaks that got mixed together?

209
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.760
Okay,
we can turn it that way.
To see the analog to,
to uh,
orbital mixing.

210
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.860
Okay,
so let's look at pictures of these vibrations.
Okay?

211
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:22.270
At the top you see is the molecule that has just one hydrogen at the bottom.

212
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:26.350
On the left are too hight two hydrogens on the double bond trans.

213
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:28.420
And on the right there sister one another.

214
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.840
Now this is the vibration we're looking at out of plane vibration of the Cah.

215
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.860
Everybody see what I'm talking about?

216
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.670
It's out of played vibration to the Cah at the top.

217
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.830
Now at the bottom there to CHS and notice that in this vibration,

218
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.770
those two h is move in the same direction,

219
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.380
both up and both down at the same time,
right?

220
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.990
Why?
Why don't we,
why don't I show the one where one moves up in the other,

221
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.900
moves down.
Why isn't that relevant for our discussion?

222
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.120
Because there was no dipole moment for that one.
Right?
It cancels.
One went up,

223
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:08.450
the other went down.
Okay.
So they to be,

224
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:13.190
I are active to interact with the light.
They have to move the same direction.

225
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.440
Okay.
But notice this is interesting.
Uh,

226
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.200
so they move in the same direction to be active.
That one is at eight 28.

227
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.020
This one,
notice that when they both move up,
it twists the bond.

228
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.190
See how it twists the center of carbon bond when the two hydrogens move up,

229
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.360
but on the right,
so that reduces the pie overlap.

230
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.710
It weakens the Pi bond.
When those p orbitals don't overlap as well.

231
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.830
But on the right,
when they both move the same direction,

232
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.370
The p orbitals still points so that they overlap with one another.

233
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.380
So the one on the left is harder to do because it weakens the Pi bond.

234
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.120
It distorts the Pi Bond,

235
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.850
whereas the one on the right doesn't distort the Pi Bond.

236
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.320
So the one on the left is harder to do and it's higher frequency.

237
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.900
So folding preserves the pie overlap,

238
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.400
the harder one and the easier one,
the harder one is high frequency,

239
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.500
the easier one is low frequency.

240
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.710
So you can understand why you see only when these two vibrations mix,

241
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.820
why you see only one.
You only see the one where they move in parallel,
right?

242
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.750
And it's easier if they're like this than if they're like this where you're

243
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:25.310
twisting the bond as well.

244
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.650
So not only are those the high and low frequency peak handy because they

245
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:35.510
diagnose being assist or a trans double bond.
You can tell which one you have,

246
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.990
but also you couldn't understand what it tells you about the bonding,

247
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.490
why you have one that's high in the other low.
Okay?

248
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:48.491
But the real jewel in the crown of infrared spectroscopy is the carbon carbonyl

249
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:52.400
group.
Why should it be such a great group?

250
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.400
Why should it be so good at an infrared spectroscopy?

251
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.530
Why should it stand out and be something that you can really identify what kind

252
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:05.150
of carbon neo group you have first,
it absorbs very strongly.

253
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.130
It interacts very strongly with light.

254
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.760
What determines how strongly something interacts with light,

255
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.930
how much you can push the Adams with the electric field of light.

256
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.100
<v 1>Luke,
you got an idea,</v>

257
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.010
<v 0>not just the number of electrons,</v>

258
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.270
but how much the dipole moment changes when you stretch.

259
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.350
Right?
If the diaper,
if the electorate,
if the electrons change a lot,

260
00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:35.670
when you stretch it and it becomes much more plus minus the,

261
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.020
that the plus minus gets separated more,

262
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.280
then that's a strong interaction with light.
Okay.

263
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.950
And the CEO is a polar bond,

264
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.970
so it changes much more than a ch bond does is it vibrates.

265
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.030
So it's going to be a very strong peak,

266
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:54.210
is not going to be one of these wimpy little peaks.
Okay.

267
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.630
Now why does it stand that a particular,

268
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:02.070
why does it stay on doubt in its frequency from one molecule to the next?

269
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.330
You don't have to worry so much about the coupling in interpreting it.

270
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:07.770
A certain ketone.

271
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.640
Ketone will always be very near where another key tone is,

272
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.370
right at the same frequency.
Why?

273
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.260
Because that bond is a double bond and nearby bonds,
arts double bonds.

274
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.660
So the nearby bonds that it can couple its vibration with have very different

275
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:25.494
frequency.

276
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.630
So you have very little overlap so you don't change the frequency very much when

277
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.070
it interacts with its neighbors.

278
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.340
So it stands alone and is as characteristic of a particular kind of carbon eel

279
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.390
and it's very strong so that you can see it in the IRS spectrum easily.
Okay,

280
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.910
so that's why these are so great.
The carbon eel.
So here's a key tone or a,

281
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.780
pardon me,
an Aldehyde acid aldehyde.
Notice how very strong a peak it is,

282
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:55.140
right?
It's got its strong and it's independent.

283
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.880
It doesn't mix much with its neighbors.
Okay.

284
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.490
Now there's a Ketone,
right?
Acetone.

285
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.750
Notice it's about 12 wave numbers,
lower frequency,

286
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.770
but that's,
that's reproducible.

287
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.640
The ketones would come with a little higher frequency aldehydes come in a little

288
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.270
lower frequency,
or pardon me,
vice versa.
So you can tell which is which.

289
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.010
Okay,

290
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.010
now here's an amid where we put a nitrogen on the carbon oxygen double bond.

291
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.320
Now that went to a substantially lower frequency.

292
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:33.410
1681 why should the CEO bond double bond of an amid be weak and vibrate at lower

293
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.670
frequency a week or spring?

294
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.560
<v 1>Anybody got an idea of why the nitrogen would do well,</v>

295
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:46.450
how the nitrogen would do that to the COO?
Double bond
eat.

296
00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:47.284
How about you

297
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.731
<v 0>and Pi Star?</v>

298
00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:59.180
So you've put electrons in from the nitrogen into the anti-bonding orbital of

299
00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:03.600
the CEO weakening the COO bond and lowering its vibration frequency.

300
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.280
So there's the unshared pair,

301
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.260
we've mixed them with Pi Star and it gets to 1681 right.

302
00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:13.500
So the CEO is weakened by resonance,

303
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.950
right by occupancy of the Pi Star.
Okay.

304
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:21.951
Now suppose we put look at an ester where we have an oxygen next to the carbon

305
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:25.650
eel.
Can I get some on to predict that for me?
Pokey,
what do you think?

306
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.040
Whereas whereas the ester going to come compared to say a ketone and the amid

307
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.050
the one with nitrogen.

308
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

309
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.860
<v 0>They'll still be resonance.
It's an unshared pair on oxygen.</v>

310
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:45.350
Should it be as strong as that involving the nitrogen?

311
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.880
<v 1>No.
Why?</v>

312
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.420
<v 0>Why should,</v>

313
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.420
why should mixing of the electrons into the Pi's star be weaker for oxygen than

314
00:20:58.881 --> 00:20:59.900
it is for nitrogen.

315
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.330
Hi Star.

316
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.930
Here are the electrons on the outerwear interest in at oxygen or nitrogen.

317
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.890
But oxygen is,
you say has a higher nuclear charge.
Lower it doesn't mix as much,

318
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.930
so it shouldn't lower the frequency as much as 1,681 so I think you would

319
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:20.381
predict it.

320
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:25.030
It'd be someplace between 1715 and 1681 makes sense?

321
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.900
Yep.
Okay.
There it is.
It's higher frequency.

322
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.410
1746 so there's something different.

323
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.400
It not only is it not as good as nitrogen,
it goes the opposite direction.

324
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.810
Now how about if we put a halogen on their light?
Chlorine,
right?

325
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.570
That's higher still 1806 it's true.
It's a,

326
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.150
it's electronic payer is lower,
right?
So it won't mix as much.

327
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:51.760
It won't weaken it as much as nitrogen did.

328
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.970
But why does it strengthen it to have a halogen there?

329
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.000
Okay,
so here's a different kind of resonance.

330
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:03.460
You have an unshared pair on the,
on the right,

331
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:08.110
we used an unshared pair of the adjacent datum to interact with the carbon eel.

332
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.880
Now we're going to use it unshared pair on the oxygen or the carbon eel to mix

333
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.310
with an orbital of the CX bond.

334
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.800
What orbital could that mix with?
It could mix with sigma star.

335
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.740
Okay,
so if you mix that with sigma star,
right,

336
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.300
then you strengthen the CEO Bob,

337
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.320
you get a triple bond between oxygen and carbon and and occupy sigma star.

338
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:39.190
So the appropriate resonance structure would be one with no bond to that x

339
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:43.060
group.
Of course,
that's only a,
that's not the dominant structure,

340
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.950
but it's one that causes the bond to get to get the CEO bond to get stronger.

341
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:52.120
So it moves to high frequency.
So we can see that that interaction is important.

342
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.510
And in this case,
the mixing with the Sigma Star witness,

343
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.930
the CEO is strengthened by resonance.
So in the case of a mid,

344
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:02.620
it was weakened by residents.
In this case,
it's strengthened by resonance.

345
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.750
Then that case it was a pi at or action putting electrons in pies.
Star.

346
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.950
In this one,
it's putting electrons in Sigma Star,
right?

347
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:15.580
And making a triple bond.
Okay.
Now how about the here,

348
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.970
look at this case here where we have a carbon carbon double bond.

349
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.630
Now we don't have the low sigma star,
right?

350
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:26.590
So we're not going to get the effect we got in the acid in the s or the acid

351
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:31.450
chloride in the Ester,
right?
And we have Pi electrons.
It could do the mixing.

352
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.100
Okay,
so that looks like a case where this resonance structure could be,

353
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.390
could be significant and it would weaken the COO double bond,
right?

354
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:46.110
But the peak is in fact that higher frequency than a ketone 1720 now why is

355
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:47.901
this?

356
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:52.901
So notice that in this case you have two double bonds are separated only by one

357
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.150
single bond.
So they,
they both have,

358
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.140
they have a better energy match these double bonds than when you had a double

359
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:04.400
bond and only single bonds in the vicinity,
right?

360
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.660
So now you can mix them,
you can mix them in phase and out of phase.

361
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:09.740
Okay,

362
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.700
so then the hears noticed that one is stretching while the other is shrinking.

363
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:19.040
It's out of phase and it's mostly a vibration of the seed double Bondo.
Right?

364
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.310
And that's the one that's at high frequency.

365
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:26.720
And notice it's a double peak because you have the other one when they're in

366
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:29.200
phase as well.
Okay.

367
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.840
Now here's the one where in phase that it's mostly a vibration to the c double

368
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:37.400
bond seat rather than the c double bond o.

369
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.330
But notice they're both stretching at the same time.
Okay?

370
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:44.840
So we have this situation,
we mix them,
right?

371
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:48.830
And we get 1720 and 1683

372
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:51.820
<v 2>yeah.</v>

373
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.820
<v 0>Notice there's this peak at 1618 this is a really neat case because the doubling</v>

374
00:24:59.261 --> 00:25:02.770
that you see in that strong peak isn't what you think it is.

375
00:25:02.771 --> 00:25:04.960
It's not the end phase of the out of phase.

376
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.320
What is the 1618

377
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.410
<v 2>okay,</v>

378
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.130
<v 0>and what's the source of the doubling?
Right.
Well,</v>

379
00:25:14.131 --> 00:25:16.500
here's the spectrum of methyl vinyl,
Quito.

380
00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:21.060
And that same compound with a double bond adjacent to the carbon eel measured in

381
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:25.650
Argon at 13 Kelvin.
Right?
And you can see it's got those,

382
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.930
that those two peaks,

383
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.040
1718 1680 96 but then it's got that 1623 these aren't exactly the same

384
00:25:33.571 --> 00:25:37.350
frequencies we saw in the previous slide because that was measured in solution.

385
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.630
This is measured in an argon solid.

386
00:25:39.631 --> 00:25:43.630
So there's a little influence of the neighbors on the frequency,
okay?

387
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.890
But if you fold ally's that at 308 nanometers for two and a half hours,

388
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.560
and then look at the difference between the spectrum you have now and the

389
00:25:55.111 --> 00:25:56.580
spectrum you had before.

390
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.150
See that some peaks have gotten stronger,

391
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.710
they point up and those that have gotten weaker,
if you take the difference,

392
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.600
go down,
right?

393
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.730
So you'll see that peak at 1696 went down,
not up,
right?

394
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.920
So what does this mean?

395
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.420
It means that there are two different compounds there,
right?

396
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.370
One is becoming the other.

397
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.120
So the one that's been formed is getting stronger.

398
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.440
The one that's going away is getting weaker and appears negative when you do the

399
00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:30.690
difference.
Okay?

400
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.990
And that's 1696 so that original Dublin we looked at is not from the same

401
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:40.110
compound.
Those two peaks,
they're from two different compounds,
right?

402
00:26:40.111 --> 00:26:45.111
And but the 1696 if [inaudible] can become the 1718

403
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.813
<v 2>right?</v>

404
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.500
<v 0>So if you calculate the positions for that compound shown at the top,</v>

405
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.890
you'll see the c double bond o and the c double bond.
See,

406
00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.570
so those are the 1718 and 1623 okay,
we got that.

407
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.710
That's that compound.
So the in phase and the out of phase vibrations,

408
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.530
what's the other one?
It's this.

409
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.430
What's the difference?

410
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:12.560
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

411
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.910
<v 0>it's the con formation around that central bond.
They're both planer,</v>

412
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.380
but one is is likey clips and the other is like Auntie.

413
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.603
<v 2>Okay.</v>

414
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.750
<v 0>So,
and if you calculate the spectrum for the one where the,
where the,
Oh,</v>

415
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.460
the two double bonds or trans to one another,

416
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.410
you see a very strong peak at 60 and 96 and hardly anything at the low
frequency.

417
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.070
Why is there hardly anything at the low frequency?
Because that one,

418
00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:45.071
which is mostly a CC vibration and a little bit of coupled CIO has them.

419
00:27:45.381 --> 00:27:50.270
So that one tends to cancel the other.
The CEO doesn't move very much,

420
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.640
but it's a big dipole.
Right?

421
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.290
So it so it can cancel it and not the top.
They reinforce one another.

422
00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:58.250
So the CDC,

423
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:03.080
the mostly cc vibration is rather strong because the CEO is helping it out.

424
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.150
Okay.
So one of these is called Sin Perry Planer.

425
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.410
It's flat Perry Planar,
but uh,

426
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.910
adjacent to one another and the other is anti Perry plainer.

427
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.240
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

428
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.500
<v 0>Okay.
There's one more peek there and I don't know what that is.
That why do I,</v>

429
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.050
it might be a combination of some other free transitions.

430
00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:25.960
That's something we don't want to talk about now.
It's too complicated.

431
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.140
But anyhow,
here's the,
here's a picture of these vibrations.

432
00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:32.650
There's the where in phase where that's the low frequency,

433
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.510
both stretching at the same time,
but mostly the CC,
right?

434
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.740
The CC is stretching nine times as much as the CEO,

435
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.370
but here's the actual amplitude,
right?

436
00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:49.900
The actual amplitudes are very subtle for these things.
And in fact,

437
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.670
we talked about this a little bit last semester when we were about how when

438
00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:58.330
we're doing quantum mechanics and vibration,
how much things actually move.

439
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.160
And here's the out of phase.

440
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:04.120
Normal mode knows mostly the COO vibration,

441
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.620
a little bit of cc and as one stretches the other shrinks,

442
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.440
<v 2>right?</v>

443
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.610
<v 0>That's an exaggerated,</v>

444
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.640
so the CEO is moving six times as much as the CC and the actual amplitude is

445
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.010
like that.
And if you look at lecture eight last semester,

446
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.150
you can see where we talked about how vibrational amplitudes are.

447
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.603
<v 2>Okay.</v>

448
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.640
<v 0>So how bout I r w what we're using here,
we were talking about two things,</v>

449
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.510
identifying functional groups,
characteristic peaks,

450
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.500
strong peaks that you can identify a particular functional group and can look

451
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.550
them up in tables as I suspect you did in lab already to see what functional

452
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:49.420
group would come where.
Uh,
and that's very,
that's very valuable.

453
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.600
We used it here more to understand how,

454
00:29:51.601 --> 00:29:54.980
how strong bonds are and residents and so on.
Uh,

455
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.930
in the real world it can enter in a lot of cases.

456
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:03.280
One interesting case is a multibillion dollar pharmaceutical,
which uh,

457
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.230
which crystallizes a different crystal forms and those forms are separately

458
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:13.150
patented,
right?
The drug is called Paxil.

459
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.490
Okay.
So here's this,

460
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:22.510
these are taken from the patent for that compound,
paroxetine hydrochloride.

461
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.610
This is the anhydrous and hydrate in called form a or polymorph.

462
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:31.480
A polymorph means different shapes,
right?
Different crystals.

463
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.900
Okay.
Now what do we see in this spectrum?
We C,
C,
c,

464
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.870
c h stretching peeks over at the left and we see fingerprint regions on the

465
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:45.820
right with these all these complicated Molly,
uh,
uh,
combinations of things.

466
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.420
But is there anything that we can identify?
Well here,

467
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:54.450
this sort of big shoulder in here turns out to be characteristic of ammonium

468
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:58.000
ions and h plus.
Okay?

469
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.690
So we know it's an ammonium salt from that.
Okay.

470
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.380
Now what are these peaks that really high frequency,
right?

471
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.420
They're much higher than those that are hydrogens on a double bond.

472
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.630
Sp squared are indeed higher frequency than hydrogens on a single bond.

473
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:19.660
SPQ whooped,
but they're not as high as this,
right?

474
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.000
And what those turn out to be due to his water,
right?

475
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.030
And notice that when water is hydrogen bonded like this,

476
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.740
you have [inaudible] that are at the end of the chain that have a very high

477
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:36.550
frequency and Ooh is that are involved in hydrogen bonding,

478
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.740
which are lower frequency cause they,
cause they don't just go one way,
they,

479
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.670
it's not so bad to move toward the other oxygen.
Okay,
so we see two peaks here,

480
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.850
which is interesting because this molecule is called and the anhydrate right?

481
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:55.840
But in fact it has water in it.
So that was sort of a weird thing about it.

482
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.450
Okay,
so here's the second form,
form B,
and again,
it has ammonium,

483
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.670
there's ammonium functionality and their ch and fingerprints.
And,

484
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.310
and here's the third form.
Same deal.

485
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:14.560
Now notice incidentally that they had a lot of sample in this one.

486
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.540
So a lot of it had zero transmittance though Cah peaks,
uh,

487
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.280
didn't go all the way.
It did,

488
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.800
weren't sharp at the bottom because they just got cut off.

489
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:28.420
No light got through the sample.
Okay?
Now if we look at the fingerprint region,

490
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:29.051
there's forums.

491
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:34.051
See there's form a and here and here is their,

492
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.350
the peaks.
Here's forum B.
Now what you look for in order to,

493
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:42.050
if you're going to dispute a patent is,

494
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.910
is the guy who is violating your patent making your compound,

495
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.380
right?

496
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:53.380
So you try to find peaks in here that are characteristic of your compound and

497
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:58.130
see whether there's some of that in what the other guy's trying to sell.
Okay,

498
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.630
so you look around here and try to figure out where in this forest of things can

499
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:03.560
we find a peak,

500
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.850
even if we have no idea what the normal mode is that we'll be able to

501
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:08.690
distinguish.

502
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.980
And it turns out that those peaks listed below there in green,

503
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.370
a blue and red are ones that occur in,
in,

504
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.190
in the corresponding form and not in the others.

505
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.070
And in particular those peaks there,

506
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.100
the six 65 and the six 75 are very good for distinguishing be an AE,

507
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.550
right?

508
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.550
So there was a patent dispute that involved can one detect 5% of the B,

509
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.330
the six 75 in the presence of 95% of the unprotected one,

510
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:42.830
in which case they would be violating the patent on B if there were 5% of it

511
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:45.160
there.
So this is uh,
the,

512
00:33:45.161 --> 00:33:49.820
the legal world and I are being involved in it now.

513
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.880
So we've seen here spectroscopy used both for structure but also for dynamics,

514
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.070
how things are moving.
Right?

515
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:03.610
And we saw it first in electronic spectrum where we saw the electron slashing up

516
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:08.300
and down at a rate that had to do with the difference in energy of the two

517
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:09.650
orbitals that are involved.

518
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.210
We've just seen vibrational and we're going on to nuclear magnetic resonance,

519
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.360
which is at a much lower frequency radio frequencies and involves magnetism,

520
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.260
which we haven't discussed yet.

521
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.420
And it involves precession,
which we haven't discussed yet,

522
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:32.300
but there are problems on the chem one 20 watt five webpage that will help you

523
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:34.430
understand what's involved in procession.

524
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.030
Now here's a young Michael Farah Day.

525
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:41.930
We showed this picture last year and he was a chemist,
remember?

526
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:44.810
And he discovered benzene in illuminating gas.

527
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:48.350
We talked about that last semester,
but that's not all he discovered.

528
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:53.650
He also discovered magnetic induction and he invented the idea of magnetic and

529
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:57.080
electric fields.
He thought they were real.

530
00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.700
They were real little filaments there for these lines of force and the idea that

531
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.040
you can get magnetism from electric,

532
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:07.280
current and electricity from changing magnetism,

533
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.760
so that's generated generators and so on.

534
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.650
If you're interested in seeing things about that.

535
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.150
Here's a website at Florida State University magnet lab that tells you things

536
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:20.180
about Faraday and that and 30 years later,

537
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:22.580
then Maxwell who knew math,

538
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:27.581
which Ferriday didn't build these into the comprehensive theory of light and

539
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:28.940
electromagnetism.

540
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.400
Now precession is involved and you've seen precession before.
Here's a,

541
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.863
here's a

542
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.860
a top and remember the amazing thing about this is that if you put it on here,

543
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.650
it doesn't fall down.
Oops.
It does,
right?

544
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.890
It stay standing up and that's an amazing thing,
right?
If it,

545
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.150
if it's not spinning,

546
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.160
let me slow it down just a bit and now that's precession.

547
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:05.070
When it goes around like this,
I remember how I taught.
It goes like that.

548
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:09.840
The access goes like this,
right?
And of course if it's not spinning,

549
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.970
gravity just makes it fall down.
So why doesn't that fall down?

550
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.300
Why does it fall around rather than falling down right now?

551
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:23.430
You can see it better if we use something bigger.

552
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.440
So we'll go to a bicycle wheel here

553
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.440
and I think I've got that on the next slide.
Okay.

554
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:36.240
So we have a bicycle wheel here.
I hang it up on this thing

555
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.900
<v 1>second.
Whoa,
get it hooked.</v>

556
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.120
<v 0>Yeah,
there we go.
Okay.
Now here I'm holding it up.</v>

557
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.710
The string is pulling that way,

558
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.210
but its weight if I let go is going to make it fall.
There is no big deal there.

559
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.560
And that shown right?
There's a,
the,
the,

560
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.570
the forest down of gravity at the Red Arrow and up on the string puts a twist on

561
00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:06.970
it,
which makes it move right at the top and left on the bottom right.

562
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:11.320
No big deal there.
But it's different as you know,
if it's spinning.

563
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.530
So let me start at spinning here.

564
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.730
<v 0>And now when I let go,
obviously when I'm holding it,
there is no torque on it.</v>

566
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.870
But if I let go,
it falls around rather than falling down.

567
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.010
Now people talk about vectors and right hand rules,

568
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:38.430
but why not a left hand rule?
I wonder and so on.

569
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:43.910
But it's something else to really understand why this is doing,

570
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.400
why there's preset precession in a situation like this.

571
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.430
So normally it would just fall down.
But if it's spinning,
it falls around,
right?

572
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.290
And Feinman in his lectures said something interesting about this.
He said,

573
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:03.030
many simple things can be deduced mathematically more rapidly,

574
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.290
then they can be really understood.
And a fundamental or simple sense,

575
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.480
the procession of a top looks like some kind of miracle involving right angles

576
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:15.150
and circles and twists and right hand screws.

577
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.660
What we should do is understand it in a more physical way.

578
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.200
Why does it move around instead of falling down?
Okay?

579
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:23.520
So that's what we're gonna do here.

580
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.660
And it turns out to have to do with phase again,

581
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.920
and the difference between force and velocity.

582
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.610
So let's think about this.
Uh,

583
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.180
let's take a point on the,

584
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.600
on the rim of this and say,

585
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.990
uh,
notice that there's going to be a torque from this going,

586
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.170
wanting to go down here and being held up here,
right?

587
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.200
And that's transmitted through the spokes to the rim.

588
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.950
So everything above the center feels of force to your right and everything below

589
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:07.300
the center feels the force to your left.
When I let go,
everybody with me on that.

590
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.560
Okay,
so let's take a point on the rim here.

591
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:15.880
It feels no force at all cause it's,
it's moving neither right in there,
left,

592
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.840
right as it goes up,
it gets more and more forced to the right.

593
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.860
Everybody with me,
still more forced to the right,

594
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.340
more forced to the right now less force to the right,
less zero.

595
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.570
And now that feels the force to the left,
right as I let go.

596
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.030
Okay?
So we can make a plot of the force as a function of position on the rim.

597
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.230
So if it's in that,
in the picture on the screen here,

598
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:45.340
when it's above the forces to the right below,
it's to the left.

599
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.310
And this is what the forest should look like,

600
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:53.500
right when it's in the front or in the back,
there is no force.
One is above.

601
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.010
There's a force to the,
uh,
to the right and when it's below,

602
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:58.900
there's a force to the left.
Okay.

603
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.770
Now I'm going to ask you a different question.

604
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.780
Where is the velocity to the right fastest?

605
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.020
Where's the force to the right?
Fastest.
Largest force.

606
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.850
At what position?
On the rim.

607
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:21.640
That's the top right.
So it'll move the furthest it goes.

608
00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:25.900
The fastest one I let go.
It goes much slower here.
Okay,
that's fine.

609
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.930
Now I'm asking a different question.

610
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.770
Where is the velocity fastest to the right?

611
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.920
Well,
let's start here.
It's beginning to feel a little bit of force to the right,

612
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:40.810
but if it's rotating,

613
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.230
it's still feeling forced to the right more and more and more and more forced to

614
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:48.120
the right,
more forced to the right maximum force to the right and all.

615
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.940
Now less and less and less and less and less and less and less and less until it

616
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:54.340
gets to zero.
But all this time,

617
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.950
during this half rotation,

618
00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.400
that point that I'm holding is feeling forced to the right.

619
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.120
And what does that mean?
It's accelerating to the right.

620
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.490
Everybody with me on this.

621
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.510
So where is its velocity maximum to the right?

622
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.470
Suppose I start pushing uh,
uh,

623
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.940
somebody on a bicycle and I keep pushing and pushing his beginning.

624
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:22.540
I don't push very hard.
Then I push real hard and then I don't push very hard.

625
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.910
And finally I let go.
Where are they moving?

626
00:41:24.911 --> 00:41:29.680
Fastest assuming no friction and so on.
At the very end,

627
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:31.870
all the time I'm pushing,
I'm accelerating it.

628
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.390
So where is the velocity fastest on this?
To the right.

629
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.750
Tell me when I get there there.
And that's exactly what it does.

630
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.300
When it moves like this and then it,

631
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.520
then it's being slowed down,
right?

632
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:50.780
Cause you're pushing to the left and here it's got zero velocity.

633
00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:52.400
You've canceled it right?

634
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:56.390
And now it starts moving to the left and reaches its maximum velocity to the

635
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:57.224
left here.

636
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.480
Then it starts slowing down again and has zero velocity to the left,

637
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.170
to the right,
left or right here.
And that it has a mess.
So it moves like this.

638
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:08.383
Isn't that neat?

639
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.430
So it's the difference between force and velocity.

640
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.800
That velocity,
you have to integrate fours right over the time that's involved.

641
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.610
So if you look at the where,
where,
where is the velocity maximum?

642
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.810
It's going to be 90 degrees after the Veloce,

643
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.460
after the forces maximum.

644
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.990
So it's going to be the maximum velocity when it's in front,
right?

645
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.990
Velocity to the right.
And as it keeps going,
it's,

646
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:41.050
it then slows down and it has its maximum velocity to the left at the bottom,

647
00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:42.080
and then it comes back up.

648
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:47.081
So there's this 90 degree phase lag between the periodic force and the velocity,

649
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:52.160
and that's why it falls around.
Okay?
So the velocities look like that.

650
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.120
Okay?

651
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.900
So there's a 90 degree phase lag and it falls around rather than falling down.

652
00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.910
Now you've heard of nuclear spin.
Okay.
So these protons,

653
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:05.810
ones that have an odd atomic weight,
right?

654
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.170
Uh,
either a,
an odd number or an odd wait.
Uh,

655
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.100
we know that they spend,

656
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:17.390
and the reason we know they spin is that when they're in a magnetic field,

657
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.050
they've precess.
And how do we know that there,

658
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.370
when you put the force on them,
obviously if there's no force,

659
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.920
this doesn't precess it's when you try to twist it.

660
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.390
So if this is a magnet that spinning,
right,

661
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.840
and you put it in a magnet netic field that tries to twist it,

662
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.090
then it goes around and precesses,
right?
So that's what,

663
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.940
that's how you know that these nuclei are magnetic hydrogen,

664
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:46.730
fluorine and phosphorous.
Those are the common isotopes.

665
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:51.620
But for carbon and oxygen,
they're uncommon isotopes.
So,
and this is how,

666
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:55.600
how,
how fast they,
they precess in a,

667
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.600
in a magnetic field,
they precessed like this,
right?

668
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.870
And you could measure the frequency of their going round and round.

669
00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:04.220
And we'll mention that in just a second.

670
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.340
And if the field happens to be 23 and a half kilo gas,

671
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.450
which is not an uncommon field,
then protons go around the fastest,

672
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:14.540
100 billion times a second,
right?

673
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.610
Fluorine is almost as fast but phosphorus,
carbon,
oxygen or less fast.

674
00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.740
So that just to give you a Connecticut public radio broadcasts at 90.5

675
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:26.090
megahertz,
right?

676
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.380
And WCBS is that 0.88 Megahertz,
eight 80 Kilo Hertz,

677
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:36.030
right?
So these are radio frequencies.
Now the electron also spins,

678
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.900
but it's way off scale up at the top 66,000 megahertz.

679
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:44.490
It's a much more powerful magnet than the nuclei,

680
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.370
okay,
so a megahertz multiplied by three and times 10 to the minus fifth is wave

681
00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:55.890
numbers.
Remember in the,
in Isr,
we talked about frequencies in wave numbers,

682
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.050
right?
How many waves in a centimeter?

683
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.010
But this is that the radio frequencies are very,
very,

684
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:06.660
very slow compared to that,
right?
10 to the minus fifth slower,

685
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.060
or you can also talk about it in degrees Kelvin,
right?

686
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.440
And the 100 megahertz.

687
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:18.470
Then where the Proton resonates in this frequency is equivalent to 0.01 Kelvin.

688
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:25.370
And the thing that it's quantized so that the direction of the magnetic field is

689
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:31.461
either more or less with the applied field or more or less against the applied

690
00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:33.900
field.
But it's not like a compass.

691
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.530
It's not like it can at any angle in different energies.
For each angle,

692
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:41.040
you can either have this or that.
That's quantification of spin.

693
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.060
Actually quantum mechanics as much easier to do with spin because you can only

694
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:47.910
have two values were for position or energy.

695
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:52.500
You could in principle have any value,
right?
Okay.
So,

696
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.130
uh,
the,

697
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:59.470
the equilibrium ratio of the up to down is 1.003.

698
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.580
So that means that in it there's an x.

699
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.900
If you have 200,000 nuclei,
right?

700
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:15.650
There are three more pointing up in the favorable direction than pointing down.

701
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.560
It's really,
really wimpy the Boltzmann factor,

702
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:23.710
the energy difference between those.
Okay.
Then,
oh,

703
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.760
17 occurs at 6% in natural abundance and see 13 at 1%.

704
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:34.611
But these others like protons are 99.98% and only 0.02% deuterium.

705
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.020
Okay?
Now this is a really neat concept,
the rotating frame.

706
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.640
Uh,
and uh,
let,

707
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:47.550
let me do this and then I'll let you go because it's holiday coming up.
Okay?
So,

708
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:51.630
uh,
so there's the applied magnetic field and we remember we said that the,

709
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.790
that the nuclear field,

710
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.530
the axis about which it's spinning can either be more or less up or more or less

711
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:00.900
down,
but at a particular angle.
So suppose like it's,

712
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:06.000
it's like that and it precesses because it's spinning and the rate of precession

713
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:09.120
in that field we just talked about is a 100 megahertz,
right?

714
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.030
That's how fast it goes around.
Okay.

715
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:17.090
So that noticed that that precessing proton has a constant vertical field,

716
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.270
right?
That doesn't change.
Is it?
Presents is the vertical component,

717
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.190
but the horizontal compound component goes around like that.
Right?

718
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.240
And that looks neat because if that's going around a hundred megahertz,
right?

719
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:36.100
That's going to be like an antenna and it'll generate light that's coming out.

720
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.630
It's like the vibration of Cio,
right?
Charge going back and forth.

721
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.880
You see it going back and forth as it is like that.

722
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:47.710
So it looks like we might be able to detect that broadcasting.
Uh,

723
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.540
so will it generate a hundred megahertz radio frequency signal?
No,

724
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.030
it would if you just had one proton.
But of course you have a mole of protons,

725
00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:01.090
or at least a milimole or something of protons,
right?

726
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.510
And so some will be here,
some will be here,
some will be here,

727
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.040
someone will be here.
So we'll be here.

728
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.230
And if you look at the horizontal component,

729
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.850
although the vertical components all add the horizontal components,

730
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.320
components that are changing in time,
cancel everybody see that?

731
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.860
So you don't get any net signal coming out.
Okay?

732
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:26.220
So the horizontal fields cancel and uh,
and there's a,

733
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.640
but there's a trick that allows you to do it.
And that is,
suppose that,

734
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.820
that instead of us sitting here and watching them precess suppose we orbit

735
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:41.020
around them at a 100 megahertz,
we would certainly get dizzy,

736
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.720
right?
If we went around 100 megahertz.

737
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.900
But what would a proton look like if we were going around it at 100 megahertz

738
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:55.180
and it's going around at 100 megahertz?
It would look like it's standing still.

739
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.780
So that makes it much easier to solve the problems,

740
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.010
to work in a rotating frame so that they're not moving around from our point of

741
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:05.320
view at a hundred megahertz,
they're just standing still.

742
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.740
So we look at these and they're just standing still.
Okay.

743
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:13.930
Now in our as if there were no applied field,
okay,
now,

744
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:19.470
now we take a very weak magnetic field that we generate a radiofrequency field

745
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.620
that's horizontal in our frame.

746
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.500
It's horizontal pointing out that way.
Now,
of course,

747
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:31.000
in truth it's going around at 100 megahertz,
right?
But from our point of view,

748
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:34.000
it's just sitting there and from our point of view,

749
00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:38.680
there is no applied field because are going around canceled that.
Okay,

750
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:41.890
so what will the,
what will those protons do is we look at them,

751
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.900
they'll precess around that field,
right?

752
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.160
You see what I'm saying?
From our point of view,
they'll just be this one week,

753
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:54.190
little magnetic field,
and it'll appear in this,

754
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:59.250
in a constant position relative to us because we're whipping around so fast.

755
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.640
And so these things will precess around that.
Right?

756
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.660
But they now they make all different angles because they're not quantized with

757
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:10.270
respect to that when they're quantized with respect to the vertical field.

758
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.950
So they'll precess like that.

759
00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:15.850
That particular one would go and all the others would go processing at the same

760
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:18.240
rate.
Okay?

761
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.720
So that's about 0.1 megahertz rather than a hundred megahertz.

762
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:27.290
So this is a thousand times weaker field,
okay?
But we,

763
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:30.620
how long do we do it?
How long do we put this field on?

764
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.940
Just long enough to make them go 90 degrees

765
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.910
like that.
So now they're pointing out towards us like this,

766
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:46.490
right?
But in truth,
they're not statically pointing out toward us.

767
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:50.120
They're going around at a hundred megahertz because we're going around at 100

768
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:53.870
megahertz,
right?
And now there's a net field,

769
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.350
right?
That's oscillating in time.

770
00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:02.380
If we go back and stop and take ourselves back to the laboratory and not spin

771
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:04.970
around like that or orbit like that,
we see them,

772
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.010
this whole set going around like that.

773
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.580
So if we put in this thing called a 90 degree pulse,

774
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.650
now we can hear these things broadcasting and what will they tell us?

775
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:21.260
They'll tell us how strong the torque is.
I didn't do that here,
but let me,

776
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.123
let me do it.

777
00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

778
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.060
<v 0>Now,
if this is a magnet,</v>

779
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:33.890
I can twist it by putting a magnet field perpendicular to it.
Right now.

780
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:37.760
Suppose I made the field that's perpendicular,
stronger,

781
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.950
right?
The twist that harder.
So that's how fast it's processing.

782
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:48.590
What happens if I try to make it go put a foot,
put this wrench on.

783
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:51.590
It's going to go faster or slower if I hang it on here.

784
00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

785
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:59.170
<v 0>Faster or slower?
Let me speed it up again here.</v>

786
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

787
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.450
<v 0>Incidentally,
that's another question.
If I go faster,</v>

788
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.740
if I make it spin faster,
will it precess faster or slower?

789
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:14.440
It precesses only because it's spinning,
right?
If it weren't spinning,

790
00:52:14.441 --> 00:52:18.000
it wouldn't precess so suppose suppose I spend faster,

791
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:22.470
does it go faster or slower?
Faster should go faster.

792
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:27.210
No,
because the amount of time that's involved,

793
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.180
you in here that we're pushing is shorter if it's spinning faster.

794
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.080
So in fact it goes slower.
Isn't that neat?
And now if I twist harder,

795
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.250
it goes faster.
See how it's going faster now and then it slows down.

796
00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:41.090
If I take that off,

797
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:48.640
it's not an ideal demonstration,
I grant you,
but you know the,
the heart,
the,

798
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:54.180
the,
uh,
if in fact it goes slower.
If you,

799
00:52:54.181 --> 00:52:55.530
if you,
pardon me,

800
00:52:55.531 --> 00:52:59.700
it goes faster if you put more torque on and it's spinning at the same rate.

801
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:03.000
So that's what these problems are for you to,
to think about.

802
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.170
So just to finish in a second here,
so,
uh,

803
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.580
so we went into the rotating frame long enough to get them to 90 degrees and now

804
00:53:11.581 --> 00:53:15.780
we go back and now we see a signal coming out at a hundred megahertz.

805
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.220
So that's how you do the Nmr experiment.
They go like that,

806
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:21.930
and that's the signal,
you see?

807
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:27.590
So it's a hundred megahertz in the laboratory frame until they relax and go back

808
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:33.330
to where they started.
Right.
Then the signal goes away.
Okay.

809
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:37.200
So that's what we're going to talk about.
Some more.
Have a good break.
