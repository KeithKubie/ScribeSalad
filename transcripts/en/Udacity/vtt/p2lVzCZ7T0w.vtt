&gt;&gt; Great, so you've passed the last quiz on strings.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; And Dave, I think you've explained strings better than I've

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.070
ever seen it. I mean, I've always wondered what string theory's

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.680
all about. And, and physicists work really hard on it, and

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.830
it looks so easy. So do you know what, what [CROSSTALK].

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.910
&gt;&gt; I have no idea what the physicists are doing.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.720
They must have very long and complicated strings to deal with.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.190
&gt;&gt; I, I hear you can get a PhD

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.230
in string theory, and now you know all about strings.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we know enough about strings now to move on to the part

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.930
where we're building the web crawler by extracting links from the page.
