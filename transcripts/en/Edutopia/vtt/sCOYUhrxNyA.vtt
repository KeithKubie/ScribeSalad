00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.746
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: So here we are, right
here at Clearfield High School,

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:12.286
and you look at these
pollution plumes,

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:13.726
a lot of you guys live
in this area right here.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.386
You could possibly have the pollution
plumes underneath your homes.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Chemistry
and biology students

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.246
at Clearfield High School are
personally involved in their studies,

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.116
because they impact the
health of their community.

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:29.926
&gt;&gt;Anthony: And there's actually some
areas that are contaminated so bad,

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:34.366
that the fumes rise up into the
basements of people's houses,

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:38.966
and so they get these TCE fumes
in their house, and that can lead

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.056
to cancer and other
serious illnesses.

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The source

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:45.856
of the pollution is
nearby Hill Air Force Base,

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:47.676
on the outskirts of Salt Lake City.

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:51.506
&gt;&gt;Man: We overhaul C-130s,
that's the big planes behind you,

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:52.426
if you don't know what they are.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It is the largest
employer in the state of Utah,

00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:57.996
but it also generates
about four million pounds

00:00:57.996 --> 00:00:59.446
of hazardous waste each year.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.926
&gt;&gt;Man: This looks like it's a
perfectly separate liquid here,

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.806
but this water up here still
contains trichloroethylene compounds

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.856
that far exceed the levels
that we have to clean up to.

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:11.476
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: How do you
track the disposal

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:14.026
and make sure they didn't
disappear from the facility?

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:17.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students in Bonnie
Bourgeous' class have been studying

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:21.486
the situation and monitoring
the pollution since 2006.

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:24.036
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: Actually getting to go out
and collect the data in the field,

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.676
and getting to see some of the
sites that we were able to visit

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:29.746
on our field trip, it just makes
it so that they understand that,

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:31.456
you know, if you affect one thing,

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.556
that you do have consequences
for what you do.

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:36.216
And they get to see man's
impact on the environment.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:39.966
&gt;&gt;Man: By this stage, most of the
metals should have been removed.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:41.406
The only thing that's left

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:44.926
at this stage will be the
volatile organic compounds that--

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students follow the trail
of the toxic waste from the base

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:50.156
through various stages
of purification,

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:52.786
to a canal at the local
water treatment plant.

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:55.556
&gt;&gt;Student: We are measuring
the turbidity of the water,

00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:58.656
which basically means, how clear
it is, and how many different kinds

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:00.316
of particles are in the water.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:04.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There, they work in
teams to gauge the water quality.

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:06.606
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm kicking up the dirt,

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.386
and then Chandler is
catching everything I kick up,

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.446
so that we can identify it.

00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:17.116
&gt;&gt;Whitney: We were testing the
water for nitrogen, oxygen, the Ph,

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.186
the temperature, the light source.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:20.786
&gt;&gt;So go into the experiment.

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:23.726
&gt;&gt;Our group used the
computer the most.

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:26.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The tablet computers
came from a technology grant

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.036
that included probes and software.

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:30.106
&gt;&gt;Student: It leveled out.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:31.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Trevor, I'm going
to tell you to take it out in

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:35.486
about 20 seconds, so wait until
I tell you to take it out.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.216
&gt;&gt;Massiell: What the
computer allows us to do,

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:40.916
isn't it gain up to hundreds
of readings within seconds,

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:43.936
or even a tenth of a second,
rather than the Ph strip,

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.396
where you can just put it in
the water and have one reading.

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:48.966
So that-- the computer is
really convenient for that.

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:49.916
&gt;&gt;Student: That's the Ph?

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:53.706
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: They're able to see
immediately what the data is,

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.626
and then you can do the
statistical analysis,

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.986
and determine whether the
lab results are good or not,

00:02:57.986 --> 00:02:59.156
and what they need to change.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:02.606
And they can see and compare two
data, right next to each other.

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:05.316
And so it makes it real life.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:06.266
&gt;&gt;Student: How far down?

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Just barely in.

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.786
&gt;&gt;Student: The percentage of error
will be less with the technology,

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:12.996
and that helps with our calculations
that we'll do in our presentations

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.246
that we make, the reports
that we write.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.126
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: Remember, so there's a lot
of things you're being graded on.

00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:18.716
So we've done the planning,
and we've done the action.

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.076
Now we need to do the follow up.

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:23.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once students complete
their research, and analyze the data,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.896
they write reports that are sent
to both Hill Air Force Base,

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:28.886
and the International
Baccalaureate Program,

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:31.736
which awards them college
credit for their work.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.396
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: And I teach the same
subjects on A day and B day,

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.736
and so on A day, I did
without the technology, B day,

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:39.576
I did it with the technology.

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:43.616
And so I taught exactly the same
stuff, but their understanding

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.706
and the concepts went
up by about 20 percent

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:49.606
when they were taught
with the technology.

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:52.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Bourgeous,
the portable computer

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.606
and projector were particularly
handy when she had to hold her class

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:58.696
in the school cafeteria while
her science lab was remodeled.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.766
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: I wouldn't
have been able to survive

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.516
without the projector and the laptop.

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:05.066
The new definition of portable
classroom was on my back,

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.156
I'd carry my laptop and my backpack
and with the projector being small,

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:10.296
it made it so I could get
from classroom to classroom,

00:04:10.296 --> 00:04:12.226
and be able to have that
information for the students.

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hey, what are
some potential problems,

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.296
and some solutions for
creating a debate website?

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:20.516
&gt;&gt;John: Technology is
a great enhancing tool

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:23.396
to what the students
get in a classroom.

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:26.596
Our students can gain more
than they ever used to,

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:29.176
because there's more
information available,

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:31.526
not only because it's
accessible to them,

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.016
but it's more interesting to them.

00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:36.156
&gt;&gt;Student: The Zhou people
conquered the Shang people--

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In teacher, Paulette
Hopfenbeck's World History class,

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:42.236
students experience a wider world

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.326
with the improved access
to technology.

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:45.706
&gt;&gt;Paulette: One of my classes,

00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:49.056
I took on a virtual field
trip of a World War I trench.

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:53.946
And by showing them that, all of a
sudden, it became more real to them.

00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:58.096
They looked at that and said,
I cannot imagine living in that

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:00.646
for a couple of years in a war.

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:02.626
I couldn't have done
that another way.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.466
&gt;&gt;Does war impact environment?

00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:06.986
How so?

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:10.466
&gt;&gt;So personally, the
technology it's been wonderful,

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.426
and I know the other teachers
in the building are very excited

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:16.586
about integrating it, and
it makes it possible for us

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:18.816
to do more cross-curricular things,

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:23.106
because we have similar
equipment, and we're using it.

00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:26.656
&gt;&gt;Think about the silk road, because
it reaches all the way to Europe.

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:29.656
Is that another environmental impact?

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:33.926
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: It's been incredible to
watch the students involvement,

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:37.766
and their interest levels
increase, as they get to do--

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:40.426
it's like toys to them, but they
think they're toys at first,

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:42.316
but then they realize that
these really are tools,

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:44.776
and they do enhance our
learning and understanding,

00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:47.976
and it makes it become real
life, rather than doing 30,

00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:49.366
60, 90 triangles for trig.

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:51.146
I mean, you know, that
gets really boring,

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:54.446
and so that technology can bring
this alive for the students.

00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:58.236
&gt;&gt;Student: Whitney, can
you type in Ph Sewer One?

00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:02.056
