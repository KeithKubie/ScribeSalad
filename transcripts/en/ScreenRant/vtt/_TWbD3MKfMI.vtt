00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.570
Creating a full-length feature film is a monumental
task for any director.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.390
In the storm of actors, set designs, production
assistants and the cameras catching them all,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.250
the finished movie is just a tiny glimpse
of the actual work – and talented people

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.250
- that goes into making it.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.800
Usually, it’s the editor’s job to make
sure that what’s outside of each shot stays

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.380
there – but they’re only human.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.779
Which means some truly incredible mistakes
can make it into the final product for our

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.779
viewing pleasure.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.620
Here are Screen Rant’s Movie Mistakes That
Slipped Through Editing.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.990
The Bourne Identity

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:53.720
Matt Damon’s role as a CIA Assassin suffering
from amnesia singlehandedly re-defined modern

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.980
spy thrillers, showing Jason Bourne to possess
superhuman levels of stealth and battlefield

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.980
awareness.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.830
When he first arrives on land after being
rescued from the sea by a fishing crew, he

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.340
quite literally disappears into the surrounding
city, illustrating how effective his innate

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.570
ability to remain undetected truly is.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.719
Until viewers take a closer look at his disappearance,
and notice the pair of extras attempting – and

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.441
failing – to conceal actor Matt Damon ducking
behind the truck driving across the set, with

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:22.189
his feet and bright red jacket clearly visible.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.689
Maybe another take would have been wise.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.960
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.229
By the time the Chamber of Secrets rolled
around, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.569
already each other’s worst enemies.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.020
So it’s no surprise that when the children
of Hogwarts began their training in magical

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.520
duels, the two wound up crossing wands.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.310
As always, Harry winds up getting the better
of his foe to the delight of the students

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.310
present.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.819
The students, and the camera man who the director
either didn’t notice, or somehow assumed

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.889
audiences wouldn’t spot.

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.820
How this unplanned cameo wasn’t defeated
by some editing magic is beyond us.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.249
Back to the Future

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.840
Aside from the questions of time travel and
parallel universes, Marty McFly’s trip backwards

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
and forwards through the decades is home to
several small mistakes or inconsistencies.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.190
But it’s the most inconsequential error
that has become the most well-known – and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.300
frankly, the most unsettling.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.540
When Doc Brown returns with his family in
tow in the final scene of the trilogy, his

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
youngest son offers a gesture that once noticed,
can never be ignored.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.000
Most accept that the young actor was simply
signaling that he was in need of a washroom

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.590
break, but we’re not buying it.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.080
They don’t have toilets on time-traveling
trains?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.370
Jurassic Park

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:47.330
The fact that Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur
adventure has aged better than most other

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.150
special effects-driven films is usually credited
to Steven Spielberg’s use of real dinosaur

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.010
models along with completely CGI creatures.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.870
But that decision didn’t come without a
few drawbacks.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.790
No fan will forget when a pair of raptors
pursued the movie’s child stars through

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.760
the park’s kitchen, but it turns out the
dinosaur models were less graceful than their

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760
CG versions.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.260
Apparently needing a crew member’s hand
to help keep their balance.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.330
The Hurt Locker

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.290
It isn’t just dinosaurs that can use a hand
from an off-screen crew member.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.160
In this story of a bomb disposal team deployed
during the Iraq War, soldiers on the ground

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.750
had more to worry about than just explosives.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.341
When investigating an enemy-controlled warehouse,
someone on the film’s set decided that star

00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:40.990
Jeremy Renner needed some help moving through
a curtain of plastic sheeting, putting his

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.060
entire hand into frame.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.010
Why the shot wasn’t cut a moment sooner
is a mystery, meaning it’s entirely possible

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.440
it was missed altogether.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.850
Gladiator

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.070
In a film as massive as Ridley Scott’s Roman
epic, audiences are willing to overlook some

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.550
small mistakes.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.020
But the director put that theory to the test,
peppering the movie with too many mistakes

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.070
to count.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.510
There’s the crew member who somehow stumbled
into a shot as hero Maximus greets a Roman

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.940
horse, Barbarian extras who decide to take
a break in the midst of a fierce battle, an

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.940
exposed air canister used to flip a chariot
in the Roman Coliseum, and the downright awful

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.680
body padding used to protect one actor from
arrows and swords.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.810
But nothing beats star Russell Crowe’s famous
question, posed after he singlehandedly wiped

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.990
out multiple opponents.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.370
It’s taken as a political statement for
those watching the fight, but it was clearly

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.790
directed at the camera crew visible in a wider
shot.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.630
Jaws

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.430
When word first breaks of a man-eating shark
off the shores of Amity, everyone in possession

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.020
of a boat takes off in search of the bounty
placed on the great white’s head.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.810
The chaos that follows is a nightmare for
Police Chief Brody, but is clearly perfect

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.270
for the filmmakers.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.330
Apparently, director Steven Spielberg got
so captivated by the excitement, he assumed

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.650
audiences would be as well, leaving the entire
camera crew’s boats visible in the middle

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.990
of frame, revealing to audiences exactly how
they had captured the shots shown immediately

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.990
beforehand.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.450
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.540
Given the number of extras used in the first
Indiana Jones adventure, and how large some

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.450
of the movie’s action sequences were, a
mistake or unfortunate error is impossible

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.450
to avoid.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.760
Take, for instance, the reflection of the
entire camera crew in the cockpit of a Nazi

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.350
aircraft, or the infamous ‘gun vs. sword’
sequence starring the world’s worst butcher.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.490
But the film’s most ridiculous mistake is
also its most ironic.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.210
To make sure their Tunisian backdrop resembled
1936 Cairo, the crew famously removed over

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.210
300 TV antennas from surrounding rooftops.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.430
That level of dedication pays off in the finished
film... until a man wearing blue jeans and

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.800
a t-shirt strolls through the background just
minutes later.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.300
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:03.870
The second chapter of Peter Jackson’s fantasy
trilogy begins with three of the Fellowship

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.760
stumbling into the land of Rohan, leading
to a tense introduction with Eomer, a noble

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.949
soldier and ally in the rest of the story.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.730
An embodiment of honour and dignity, Eomer
ends the standoff by giving his new allies

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.480
horses and sending them on their way.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.540
Unfortunately, allowing his entire sword to
slide out of its sheath in the process.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.300
Clearly too embarrassed to acknowledge the
mistake, we can only assume he left as quickly

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:36.290
as possible to find a suitable replacement.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.669
Frozen

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.021
Just because animated films are created a
single frame at a time, that doesn’t mean

00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.070
mistakes won’t slip by just as easily.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.580
One of the most well-known sequences in Disney’s
smash success Frozen stars the magical Queen

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.990
Elsa, embracing her powers with a performance
of the award-winning song “Let it Go.”

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.480
In all the excitement, it seems the artists
decided to let the laws of physics go as well,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.731
allowing Elsa to let down her hair, and have
it pass from front to back, phasing through

00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.920
her left arm in the process.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.699
The ability to control ice and snow and create
an eternal winter is one thing, but we have

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.560
to draw the line somewhere.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.960
Those are some of our favourite movie mistakes
that seemed to slip by the filmmakers unnoticed.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.800
Are there any we missed?
