00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.750
Compare the expressions on both
sides of the question marks.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.180
So on the left-hand side of the
question mark, I have 7,907.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.500
So, it's 7,000 plus
900 plus 7, which

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.035
is going to be the
same thing as 7,907.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.410
Now let's compare
that to what we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.230
have on the right-hand
side of the question mark.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.530
On the right-hand side, we have
7,000 plus 970, which is 7,970.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.240
Or if we wanted
to expand it out,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.290
we could write that as
7,000 plus 900 plus 70,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.490
and then we have 0 ones.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.670
So if we compare place
value by place value,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270
we have 7,000 in either case.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.841
So the thousands
place is the same.

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:53.340
We have the same
number of hundreds.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.980
We have 9 hundreds.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.310
But here we have no
tens, and we have a 7.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.270
And here we have no
ones, and we have 70.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.610
And clearly, 70
is greater than 7.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.730
So the number on
the right is greater

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.370
than the number on the left,
or the number on the left

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.000
is less than the
number on the right.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.650
I always remember
the less than symbol

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.610
because it points to the
smaller number, or either

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.050
of these symbols point
to the smaller number.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.090
So this right over here
would mean greater than.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.400
You have the larger
number on the left.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.370
This is less than.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.330
You have the smaller
number on the left.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.210
So we would go with less than.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.820
This is less than that.
