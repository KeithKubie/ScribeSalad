SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Well welcome.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.390
I'm Scott Giambastiani.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.570
I'm the global program
chef here.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.360
Thank you for coming, lots
of familiar faces.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.830
So before she was a Food
Network star and an

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.260
internationally bestselling
cookbook author, Nigella

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.380
Lawson decided she wanted
to be Italian.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.070
At the age of 17 she spent
her gap year working as a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.450
chambermaid and learned a wealth
of hands-on knowledge

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.580
in Italian cooking.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.470
Today Nigella brings as much of
Italy as she can into her

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.800
own kitchen.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.220
And now she celebrates the
pleasures of Italian food with

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.260
us and her first Italian
cookbook, "Nigellissima: Easy

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.740
Italian-Inspired Recipes."
Nigella Lawson, food

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.190
enthusiast, television
personality and journalist, is

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.240
the author of eight bestselling
cookbooks,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.100
including "Nigella Kitchen,"
"Nigella Fresh," "Nigella

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.570
Christmas."

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.710
NIGELLA LAWSON: They all
have my name on them.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.750
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: "Nigella
Express," "Feast," "Nigella

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770
Bites," "How to Be a Domestic
Goddess." You can see Nigella

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.720
weekly as she hosts the
innovative culinary

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.470
competition series "The Taste"
with Anthony Bourdain, which

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.750
premiered January in 2013 on
the ABC Television Network.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.520
So with further ado,
please help me

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.916
welcome Nigella Lawson.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.166
NIGELLA LAWSON: Thank you.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.760
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Your book
mentions that you have instant

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.790
Italian inspiration.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.650
I'd love if you could describe
that a little bit.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.090
NIGELLA LAWSON: I will do.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.350
I'm going to answer it a bit
differently which is that I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.050
spent a year in Italy in
between high school and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.720
university.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.630
We have something called a gap
year, which I think everyone

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.510
should have, so you don't
think of college as a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.750
continuation of just being
at high school.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.440
You learn about the world and
you realize how lucky you are

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.300
to spend three or four years
studying rather than doing

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.610
what I did, which was clean
restrooms in a hotel in Italy.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.740
However, I learned about being
Italian, and I learned to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.200
speak Italian and
cook Italian.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.530
I always want access to that.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.880
Even though I'm not Italian, I
have pretended to myself for

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.910
many years that I am, even going
to the extent of giving

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.860
my children Italian names.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.130
However, as I did say that
we have to be authentic.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.170
And that's not suddenly
pretending to run some sort of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.580
Disney World Italy.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.870
It's about bringing in the
experience we have in life and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.620
accessing them at the same time
as being true to who we

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220
are, the traditions, cooking
and otherwise, that we've

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.460
inherited, that we've
lived through.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.300
And for me Italian food is
actually very contemporary,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.340
even though it's probably
one of the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.450
most ancient of cuisines.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.520
It's very direct, it's very

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.850
straightforward, it's very simple.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.490
So when I want to have instant
Italian food, I'm not taking

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.730
recipes which may be--

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640
obviously there are some
slow cook recipes--

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.450
I'm not taking some very
complicated recipe and then

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.860
trying to find some new,
contemporary twist on it,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.560
which sometimes I'm bringing
my own twist.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.730
I'm respecting the way that
Italians feel, that the real

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.100
truth of food is that it must
always taste of what it is.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.680
It's not about interfering and
trying to show your own

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.540
brilliance.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.040
And someone once said that
there's a difference between

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.890
French food and Italian food--

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.480
and if there's any French
people here I

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.900
don't mean any offense--

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.270
which is that French cooking is
about drawing attention to

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.850
the cook and Italian cooking
is about drawing

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.320
attention to the food.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.020
And I think that's
very important.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.590
Of course the two things
co-exist, but the real point

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.350
about trying to have what
I call instant Italian

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.050
inspiration is by thinking,
what do the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.390
Italians do so well?

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.980
What they do is they think,
how can I respect the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.230
ingredients in the
best way I can?

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.940
Therefore I'm interfering the
least, but having enough of

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.740
myself that I've put
my heart into this.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.100
It's not really about knowledge,
it's about passion.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.990
And it's about an attitude.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.830
And I think that's very
important, and it's more

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.029
important than any amount
of rarefied knowledge.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.100
Perhaps that sounds defensive.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.660
I'm a home cook and
not a chef.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.360
But the difficulty about being a
chef, often, is that you can

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.550
over think something.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.540
Whereas what home cooks know is
that the fastest, simplest,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.880
most straightforward way you
get food on the table

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.460
is often the best.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.360
So that for me is very much what
Italian food is about.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.130
And also that Italian food does
not rely on a huge amount

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.400
of ingredients.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.890
And so when I'm writing a recipe
I feel, since I'm a

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.250
working mother who writes food
books, I know that I do not

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.750
ever want to be sent to the
shops unnecessarily.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.990
And I never want to send other
people to the shops

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.290
unnecessarily.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.000
And because as well not being
a chef, I'm not--

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.390
my mind is slightly blown away
by the fact that I know that

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.120
Google just here creating
45,000 meals a day.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.470
Well as a home cook I'm not
going anywhere near that,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.630
despite the fact that
I have teenagers.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.630
But I will certainly
say that what

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.160
restaurant chefs often forget--

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.230
I don't mean this
disrespectfully, some of my

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.280
best friends are chefs--

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.900
but they often forget that in
a normal life, if you buy

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.200
something you're not using
a whole bottle a day.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.500
You're not using gallons of
one particular liqueur.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.930
So that I will always try and
make things instantly

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.510
accessible to my readers
and to myself.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.000
Say, for example, I ask someone
to get Marsala, I will

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.540
use it in many, many recipes.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.420
Not just because that's what
I do, but because why buy

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.310
something ever for
one ingredient?

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.880
So I'm trying as much as
possible not to be wasteful of

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.550
anyone's time, anyone's money,
or just the produce.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.390
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: That's a
great common theme that I

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.310
think a lot of cookbooks out
there make it challenging for

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.930
the home chefs.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.890
And I appreciate the simplicity
you're putting in

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.440
and the background.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.020
That's very, very helpful.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.050
That kind of leads to the next
question, which is, there's a

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.180
common theme of simplicity
with ingredients and

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.720
respecting the fact that it's
the food speaking for itself.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.110
If you're looking at the
different regions in Italy--

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.260
obviously there are dramatic
differences--

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.080
could you describe one of your
more favorite regions and why?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.500
NIGELLA LAWSON: I will do it and
I want to link that to why

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.900
I've actually not been at all
regional in this book.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.370
I first went to Florence, and I
have to say because of that

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.240
Tuscany has a particular
place in my heart.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.160
The English have long
had a love affair--

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.020
and in fact, an English writer
once dubbed that part of Italy

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.820
"Chianti-shire." That's how
we end all our counties.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.380
I actually wanted to take--

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.570
well I first wanted to do an
Italian book years and years

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.130
ago because of having
lived in Italy.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.440
And I actually have a degree
in medieval and modern

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.910
languages from Oxford.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.110
And Italian was one of the
languages I studied there.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.310
I did want to do a more
academic book.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.310
That was a long time ago when I
had the arrogance of youth.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.640
And since then also,
the Italian

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.890
food market has exploded.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.890
And I felt there was no need
for me, and non-Italian, to

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.610
contribute.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.470
And there are many books
on that subject.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.930
However, I do think that
possibly not since the Roman

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.370
Empire has Italy colonized
the world as it has now.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.500
And Italian food is incredibly
popular I think for the

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.750
reasons I said earlier.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.630
I am not from one of the regions
in Italy and this is

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.520
not a collection of recipes
that actually exist

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.100
everywhere.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.860
Some of them are traditional,
some of them are my

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.530
reinterpretations.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.770
But I was in conversation with
Mario Batali the other day.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.350
And he was saying that he
regards in many ways the food

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.730
he does as what he calls "New
Yorkchese" And he said, would

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.870
you say that your food
is "Londonese"?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.580
And I think that's true.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.960
So I feel that I go to Italy a
lot, rather interestingly,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.080
considering Italians are not
normally Anglophone.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.890
Of the non-Anglophone countries,
for example, on

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.289
Twitter the highest number of
followers I have are from

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.490
Italy, which is extraordinary.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.059
And I have grown to see that
what's happened in Italy is

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.310
they are fiercely regional
in their cooking.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.860
But of course, the world
has changed.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.240
There's the Internet, we know.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.410
That also an enormous amount
of television.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.520
People like Jamie Oliver
and I am also on

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.500
television in Italy.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.000
And they're open to that.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.900
No whereas is initially, if
you're from Tuscany you will

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.920
be very disdainful, perhaps, of
the cooking of Lazio in the

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.040
Rome region.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.530
Italians are becoming very, very
interested in the food

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.950
that hitherto has been sort
of closed to them.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.990
Through TV, through the
Internet, that exists.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:26.140
So for example, most Italians
now, they've heard of American

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.730
muffins, they cook them.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.760
And they use that word.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.480
They're very interested
particularly in the Anglo

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.200
American baking tradition.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.860
So I feel that, in a way, the
food I offer is like a new

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.760
region of Italy.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.410
It's those of us who don't come
from Italy itself but who

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.450
are so inspired by their food.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.680
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So you
mentioned technology.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.655
And I'm sure this question is
going to come up so I'm going

00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:51.550
to ask it now.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.980
Social media, how has it played
a role in your life,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.700
especially with your
career now?

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.470
NIGELLA LAWSON: Well I've
never quite come

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.250
to terms with Facebook.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.350
But I absolutely
adore Twitter.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.420
And I tweet pretty much
everything I eat, and

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.510
unfortunately that's
an awful lot.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:17.660
I find the interaction with
people who are interested in

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.610
food very inspiring.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.700
And I also feel, there's
something I feel very strongly

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.230
about life, which is that there
are certain areas which

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.660
are very important
in our lives.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.980
But somehow the amateur has
been disdained, and in the

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.660
most important areas
of it all.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:44.110
We live in an age which pays too
much respect or reveres,

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.680
sometimes inappropriately,
the expert.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.350
And the two areas I've been
thinking of are eating and

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.720
child rearing.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.180
Now if you needed to be an
expert in either, human beings

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.570
would have fallen out of the
evolutionary loop an awfully

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.220
long time ago.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.810
So I think what's very, very
interesting about social

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.170
media, about the whole way
people can access information

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.110
now, is that when I research
a recipe I

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.900
don't go to the experts.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.530
If I'm interested in a
particular recipe it could be,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:28.540
say pasta all'Amatriciana I
might go to just various

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.160
recipes, whether they're written
in English or Italian,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.830
of normal people who cook.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.750
These are the recipes that have
been passed on in their

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.000
family or how they've
adapted it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.980
So I think it's very important
for me, I like to see how

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.010
people cook in their homes.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.450
I love restaurants.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.030
The minute I know I'm going
anywhere all I do is scour the

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.030
Internet to see where
I'm going to eat.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.490
But nevertheless, for me the
story of cooking is how actual

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.140
people cook in their lives,
not how they cook

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.170
professionally.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.520
So as far as I'm concerned it
gives me a connection, and a

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.470
connection that I value.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.250
And also because if you do
what I do, which is do TV

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.330
programs and write books,
that sometimes it

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.840
could be a bit one-sided.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.440
So the same reason I like the
more old tech version of doing

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.690
a book signing, why I like
Twitter and I like any other

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.520
medium that accords me
communication with my readers.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.730
I like that because I feel food
is about communication.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.920
And that means it's a dialogue,
not a monologue.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.990
And there I shut up.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.820
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Thank you.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.700
So we're based here in Mountain
View, California.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.900
And for the American readers,
even though we have a very

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.820
diverse group here, curious
about what recipe or recipes

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.430
do you think would stand out
to the American cooks, the

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.180
American chefs, from
your book and why?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.260
NIGELLA LAWSON: Before I answer
that-- see, I'm a bit

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:53.990
of a [INAUDIBLE]--

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:59.100
before I answer that I want
to say that in Europe the

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.520
particularly it's
interesting--

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.790
it's not surprising
in America that--

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.140
the Renaissance, if you like, of
Italian cooking, the way it

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.000
took over from French, did not
come from Italy, although

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.530
those of us in England live very
near it, but came from

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.280
California.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.440
You're all too young to
remember, but the big sort of

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.020
Cal-Ital movement in the '80s
is what made Italian food

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.010
suddenly come to prominence.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.960
Now I would say that America is
a country which has so many

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.450
Italians, those of Italian
descent, that there are

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.640
certain recipes which would
stand out in particular.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.290
And I would say my quick
Calabrian lasagna would.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.240
That is actually very much
a traditional recipe.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.820
And that's quite interesting in
that the normal lasagna we

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.450
know has as a white sauce,
and cheese in

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.360
it, and a meat sauce.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.730
And there's a recipe for lasagna
in Calabria which is

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.840
entirely different.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.470
I've never found it anywhere
outside there.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.750
And that is you just make
a very quick meat sauce.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.740
In other words, you just toss
some meat in a pan with some

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.030
onion, and a bit of red
wine, and lots of--

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.170
we call it passata,
tomato passata.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.230
I don't know what
you would call.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.920
It's pureed.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.600
It's like--

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.130
NIGELLA LAWSON: Paste.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.870
No it's not paste.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.780
It's not paste.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.180
Whatever it'll be translated
into American in my book.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.640
Imagine if you had some canned
tomatoes and you put them

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.360
through a food mill.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.393
[INAUDIBLE] little better?

00:14:32.393 --> 00:14:33.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.260
NIGELLA LAWSON: Maybe it's
called puree, but I will get

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:35.800
to the bottom of this.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.310
But anyways you make your sauce
like that, and that is

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.040
your very runny sauce.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.580
And then you layer up lasagna
sheets with hard boiled eggs

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.220
chopped, mozzarella chopped, and
some cooked Italian ham,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.440
thinly sliced.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.600
And they layer that up, and then
you pour all the sauce

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.260
over it, and you just bake it.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.020
Now that, I think will speak.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.560
It's simple, it's got a
directness that will make

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.740
sense to Americans.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.070
I think most will, zucchini
pasta, I think, especially

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.910
around here where you
probably grow your

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.362
zucchini just outside.

00:15:09.362 --> 00:15:12.580
And I wanted to put that recipe
in because I feel--

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.980
and here I must take some
blame for this--

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.740
that anyone who prints recipes
either in magazines, or books,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.860
or does them on TV--

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.360
although TV is more forgiving
but certainly in print--

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.780
tends to highlight
the photogenic.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.760
And as we all know, often
the best tasting

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.390
food isn't so pretty.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.600
And the zucchini pasta, you do
cook the zucchini a long time.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.600
It goes a kind of [INAUDIBLE]
shade.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.830
And it tastes so fantastic.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.420
And I also wanted to highlight
that sort of food that's very,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.030
really there are about
three ingredients.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.720
It's very quick and simple.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.310
It's not created for
a photo opp.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.420
And I haven't really answered
your question.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.630
But you're a probably better
place to answer.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.200
Because I offer what I've done
and I offer it in the food

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.100
that all food should
be offered, to

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.690
share and with love.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.600
But I cannot then look at it
as if I were an American.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.700
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Sure,
no I think you

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.860
answered it quite well.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.860
So I want to shift to one
question about "The Taste"

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.110
because it's the new show
that you're on.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.770
And I'm sure people have
a lot of questions.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.980
And in the meantime if people
in the audience have

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.260
questions, it would be
a good time to start

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.010
thinking about that.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.520
And then as you line up
behind the podium

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.940
we'll address those.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.040
So the new show "The Taste,"
it's a huge hit.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.010
Wanted to know what specifically
you've learned

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.570
while being on the show.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.820
NIGELLA LAWSON: What
did I learn.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.800
Well funnily enough, although
when I started one of the

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.690
reasons I wanted to do it is
that I feel that, as I said,

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.740
food has been slightly taken
over by the professional.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:47.260
And I often think that, as great
as chefs can be, their

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.280
technique, and their expertise,
and their dexterity

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.580
while inspiring can sometimes
be intimidating.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.590
And so I wanted to go on to
champion the home cook and to

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.440
say look, the food that we all
like eating, even the chefs

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.670
like eating, is cooked
at home.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.210
I still feel that, but what I
learned an awful lot is that

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.920
actually those techniques
and their expertise.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.319
And I say that really actually
a lot from watching Chef Ludo

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.750
Lefebvre cook.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.630
Because we didn't actually see
the contestants cook, because

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.369
that was the whole point,
it was tasting blind.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.599
And it impressed me
an awful lot.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:31.660
And it showed me what artistry
can elevate food.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.240
Not to a higher sphere, but to
a very interesting sphere.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.620
What it also taught me is that
the one food stuff that is

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:48.100
absolutely impossible to taste
and to find blind is protein.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.570
I mean, Ludo, everyone-- we had
such great chefs like Jose

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.610
Andres, everyone came on.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.590
No one could ever tells was
it pork, was it chicken?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.220
Ludo and I had a long argument
about whether someone's beef

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.540
was seasoned properly.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.070
It was lamb.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.290
And it's very interesting
because vegetables you can

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:15.060
tell, spice you can
tell, and herbs.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.420
Protein you can't.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.340
So in a way-- and I'm
a carnivore--

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.040
I would say if I were a
vegetarian, I be jumping up

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.290
and down with glee.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.470
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Was it
challenging being the only

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.640
woman on the show as far
as the judges go?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.230
NIGELLA LAWSON: It was
challenging being the only

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.060
woman in the sense that there
were very shouty boys.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.710
Luckily I have an older brother
and so I'm used to

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.850
keeping them in order.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.160
But the difficulty
is I'm not--

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.710
they're professionals.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.910
And I've always though one of
the differences between a

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.800
professional chef and a home
cook it's that professional

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.430
chefs are very conflict
driven.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.840
And I think those of us who
cook at home tend to be--

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.750
tend, this is all
generalizations.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.800
It can be dangerous--

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.940
tend to be conflict averse.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.870
And although we often
fail, we try and use

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.590
food to create harmony.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.860
So I found it quite difficult to
be in an environment where

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.690
there was a lot of alpha
male chest beating.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.665
And how much they were going
to crush everyone else and

00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:19.670
they were going to win.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.960
Because the difficulty with
intimidation tactics is they

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.830
can intimidate.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.010
And I was often quite
intimidated.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.360
And actually although Ludo looks
like he can be really

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.550
horrible on camera, off camera
he's very nice and he always

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.610
said to me afterwards, I
didn't mean to do that.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.480
You know more about food than
I do. (FRENCH ACCENT) I just

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.210
know fancy French foufou.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.690
You know more about food.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:46.230
But actually I did find
it intimidating.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.530
And that was the plan.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.830
So that was my fault.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.810
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Well said.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.280
NIGELLA LAWSON: I also felt--

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.460
this has been reported--

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.790
slightly intimidated by the
glamorization ideal of TV.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.690
And when we did the poster I did
say, you cannot airbrush

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.650
my tummy out.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.750
Because I know that everyone
else on TV is thin, and I felt

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.040
very wary of that.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.630
I didn't think it was honest
to present an airbrushed

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.450
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.690
or this no tummy person.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:29.840
Because I eat, and you can't eat
and have a concave tummy.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.430
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
There you go.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.740
You mentioned in the beginning
of the book, you're trying to

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.630
make it easier for
the home chefs.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.130
And a question around
basic ingredients.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.310
If you had to pick five basic
ingredients to introduce chefs

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.330
to this cookbook, what
would they be?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.470
NIGELLA LAWSON: OK, I'm going
to start with alcohol.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.860
And that is simply this, is
that I'm rare among the

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.840
English, which is I don't open
and drink a bottle of wine

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.110
every night.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.030
And I find that when I follow
a recipe and it wants some

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.290
wine, I don't really want to
open a bottle just for that.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.740
So I'm a great champion
of vermouth.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.660
We call it "vermuth" but
I'm going native now.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.730
And it is cheaper than wine.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.160
I mean good vermouth is cheaper
than good wine.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.250
And you keep it in
your cupboard.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.710
I have pink, the rose, it's
rosato, I have red, and

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.670
unfortunately I think in the
States mostly you could only

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.990
get the sweet red.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.370
And white, dry white.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.240
So that if I need wine in a
recipe, that I just unscrew

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.780
the top, I use the splash that
I need, I put it back, and it

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.430
lasts like sherry lasts.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.810
So I feel that saves you
money and is useful.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.820
And particularly, when you're in
a hurry and you're cooking

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.870
fast, red wine generally takes
a long time to cook out.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.160
Whereas vermouth has already
been mellowed, so you just put

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.830
it in and you're ready to go.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.550
I feel that unwaxed organic
lemons a very important.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.050
Because when I use an
ingredient I like

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.910
to use all of it.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.630
And lemon juice is an essential
flavoring tool for

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.310
me, whether it's in something
you want sharpness or to bring

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.450
out sweetness.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.300
But I like to use the
zest and I like to

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.480
grate that in as well.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.520
But obviously if it's been waxed
as most have, you're

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.270
just putting wax in your food.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.880
So that is essential.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.860
I'm very unfashionable in that
I like salt, but I really do

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.280
feel it's important
to get good salt.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.950
Most times I travel
with my own salt.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.920
I think you call it
kosher salt here.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.290
I use malden or I use
French fleur de sel.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.440
Because otherwise I feel you go
out and you've got lovely

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.340
food in front of you, and then
someone puts some shaker with

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.560
bathroom scourer on the table.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.030
So good salt is very
important.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:50.220
I'm very fond of something that
purists hate, which is

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.840
garlic infused oil.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.050
Because on days when you crawl
home and you're so tired that

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.300
the idea of peeling garlic and
crushing it make you feel like

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.700
weeping, just having that mild
garlic is very good.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.110
Also, the Italians don't
over garlic.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.650
What Italians do-- and this is
also an important ingredient--

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.220
is use olive oil.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.670
And then you put a peeled clove
of garlic, and you cook

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.210
it until it's golden, and
then you get rid of it.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.740
They do not put huge
amounts of garlic.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.570
And the last thing I would say
is everyone has been so

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.730
brainwashed into using
extra virgin olive

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.750
oil and all the time.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.100
Italians never ever use extra
virgin olive oil to cook.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.380
It's very expensive, when it's
heated you lose the taste.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.500
Always buy regular olive
oil to cook with.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.050
Extra virgin olive oil goes
on after you've cooked.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.410
A teeny drop and you have that
fantastic fragrance, but it is

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:52.120
both wasteful and unnecessary to
use it when you're cooking.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.960
And not least as well is that
the smoking point I think of

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.360
extra virgin olive oil
is lower than of

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.820
regular olive oil.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.350
So if you're going to cook
anything at high heat it'll

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.030
burn faster.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:03.580
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So
now you have it.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.200
Five easy ingredients
to get started.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.730
NIGELLA LAWSON: I may
not have done five.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.390
I am innumerate.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.020
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I
think you got it.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.280
Think you got it.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.850
So in the beginning of your
travels through Italy, you

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.480
make some references about
eating on a budget.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.060
Any tips?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.980
NIGELLA LAWSON: Yes certainly.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.240
I have a recipe here which I
lived on when I was young and

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.460
I cook an awful lot now.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.960
And it's called Eggs
in Purgatory.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.020
And I have referred to it--

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.040
some people think there may be
some reference to Dante.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.480
I have gone into it to some
length in [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.630
which is simply, you
get a skillet.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.530
You put a bit of olive
oil what's sort.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.670
A bit of garlic, some oregano,
and some Chile flakes.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.900
And then you open a can
of diced tomatoes

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.040
which you put in.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.820
You crack open as many
eggs as you need.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.060
You then grate over some
Parmesan and you cook it for a

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.160
few minutes.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.680
It's the most fantastic--

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.040
it's great if you're hungover.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.650
I know none of you here
ever would be.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.650
It's fantastic when you want
something quick, and it

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.960
doesn't cost very much.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.980
But it's good food,
it's real food.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.310
And just a hunk of lovely bread,
such as you get a lot

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.450
around here, and you're away.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.470
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Great.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.910
If audience has questions,
please start lining up.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.780
I'm going to continue.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.930
So what would you
say, if any--

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.770
other than what you've
discussed--

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.630
are some key takeaways
from the book.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.610
And one of the key takeaways
that I had right off the bat

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.670
is you're telling people to read
through the recipe first,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.610
which I thought was great.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.600
And you're emphasizing
simplicity.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.600
Any other key takeaways from
your point of view that you'd

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.960
like to talk to the
audience about?

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.920
NIGELLA LAWSON: I started off
as a journalist, not a food

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.280
journalist at that.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.040
And for me a recipe is a bit
like a piece of journalism in

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.630
that it has to adhere to the
questions of who, what, why,

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.750
when and why now.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.360
And I think that's what
we should when

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.780
we're cooking as well.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.610
And I have tried to put each
recipe in context.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.240
And I think that's what
we all need to do.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.780
When you take a recipe
into your life it

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.200
has to become yours.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.250
So although there are many
recipes in here, I would say

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.520
just choose some you like, cook
those few over and over

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.520
again, and then change them
and make them yours.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.750
Because even though I write
cookbooks, it's very important

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.600
not to be enslaved by the
tyranny of the recipe.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.480
I know that everything works.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.460
I test everything
in my own home.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.360
I feed my children
and my friends.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.830
And the baking recipes I do a
quadruple testing by sending

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.060
out to people who use
different ovens.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.230
I know everything works, so
you can rely on that.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.750
Use them and then change it.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.300
Because cooking has to be
authentic to who we all are

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.240
personally.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.640
So I want to share what I've
got and then you add what

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.090
you've got.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.910
And if any of you want to let
me know how you've changed

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.160
things, I sometimes change
things in further additions.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.530
If readers say to me, you
know what I changed it

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.100
a bit, I did that.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.570
I will change a recipe in later
editions, because as I

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.270
say, it's about communication.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.480
And you must always remember
to put yourself in your

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.600
cooking, because that's like.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.320
And if you don't do that you're
not really part of the

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.190
recipe an of the dish
yourselves.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.620
But you can follow the
recipe as well.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.710
I'm happy if you want to cook
from it directly, and I know

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.660
it will work.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.160
But not to feel that you
can't put your stamp.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.430
And that's what I want
people to take away.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.020
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
We have a very

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.290
innovative bunch of Googlers.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.950
I think you're going to get
a lot of emails coming in.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.610
That's great.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.110
We have a first question
from the audience.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.210
AUDIENCE: My wife and I first
saw you on TV in Australia

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.970
where we're from eleven
years ago.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.420
NIGELLA LAWSON: You don't say.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.430
AUDIENCE: My wife's
up the front here.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.550
It was 11 years ago
on our honeymoon.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.660
So ever since then you've been
the other woman in our

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.580
relationship.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.385
And so there's lots of things
I'd like to ask you but I'll

00:28:05.385 --> 00:28:06.580
give you two.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.880
We've got four young children,
could you tell us of your

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.890
recipes which you think
the kids would love to

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.140
eat and help make?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.410
We love seeing that on your TV
shows with your kids helping

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:15.540
to make things.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.630
NIGELLA LAWSON: Yes.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.570
AUDIENCE: And the other
thing I'd love to

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.880
hear about your writing.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.110
To become a writer, were you
just passionate about it?

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.090
Did you study?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.020
So I'll leave you with those.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.910
NIGELLA LAWSON: OK I will
answer in the order.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.550
People often complain that
children don't eat vegetables.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.770
I think actually it really
depends on how you cook them

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.480
and how you talk about it.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.130
I've got a recipe in here
which is for tortellini

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.150
minestrone, which my children
have always loved.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.890
And a big bowl of vegetable
soup is

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.490
nourishing in every sense.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.300
It's nourishing the
body and the soul.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.620
And since my children were
little I would give then

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.420
scissors for them to chop
up green beans.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.790
I feel that--

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.850
I think your children are
probably too young to be given

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.020
knives but they can stir--

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.310
and I think that really it's
being part, even if they're

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.170
just watching in with you in the
kitchen and being part of

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.040
seeing how food is made
is very important.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.340
And if they contribute,
they will eat.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.220
Even if Brussels sprouts, which
children often don't

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.200
like, you ask them to help cook
them, they will eat them

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.600
because children want to--

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.840
we all, we need to
feel involved.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.860
And so that's what I
would say in there.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.400
And also my children
particularly like, I call it a

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.880
pasta risotto.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.970
When I was in Italy last I found
this new way where they

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.960
have a cooking pasta, which
is totally anarchic.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.800
Which is you put pasta and water
in together and you cook

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.140
until the pasta has absorbed
the water.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.310
And it's very, very creamy.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.290
And I use that orzo pasta, which
looks like rice although

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.050
orzo in fact means barley.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.120
And I cook that with pancetta or
bacon and peas, frozen peas

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.800
I'm afraid to say.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.110
I shouldn't say I'm afraid to
say because, of course, unless

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.500
you're picking the peas and
shucking them straight away,

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.740
you're just getting the starch,
you're not getting

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.980
everything.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.380
And they like that a lot.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.285
And it's very easy to make
because you're not stirring

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:20.010
like risotto.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.050
You can't have four young
children and be stirring a

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.180
risotto, that I know.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.050
As for writing, I'll tell you
how I learned to write.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.930
And that is very strangely that
when I was at college--

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.880
I don't know if it's
still done but--

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.980
if you went to either Oxford or
Cambridge, you were taught

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:45.040
in the tutorial system, which
was just one-to-one with your

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.320
tutor or sometimes two of you.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.560
And you didn't hand your essay
in, you had to read it out.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.700
I mean obviously this wouldn't
work if you were doing math.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.620
But I was doing, as I say,
medieval and modern languages.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.850
And when I did my first essay,
like many children, young

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:05.720
people who were academically
precocious, it was

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.860
embarrassingly pretentious.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.680
And I was too embarrassed
to read it out loud.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.310
So I had to edit as I read it
out so that I could say it

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.600
without brushing.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.920
And then I learned to write.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.690
Some people might say I still do
have a slight illiteration

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.950
and adjectival overload
problem.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.066
But I'm working on it.

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:32.180
I learned how to be a journalist
that way and I

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.110
learned how to write.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:38.440
Because in order to hold
someone's attention and for it

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.210
to be realistic that one should
say something, you have

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.520
to learn to write in a way
that will do that.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.420
So I would say that was the best
training for writing I

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.460
could possibly have had.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.100
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Great.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.380
So lots of great savory dishes
and in the book and also a lot

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.370
of yummy desserts.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.810
What would be one of your
favorite desserts and why?

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.970
NIGELLA LAWSON: There's two
particular desserts, can I do

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.020
two, please?

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.840
Can I be greedy?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.320
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: You
could to three.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.170
NIGELLA LAWSON: One
is my chocolate

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.350
olive oil cake, which--

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.510
this is really a bit about--

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.840
it's not Italian because it's
got olive oil I kind of gave

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.860
myself a bit of license.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.810
I created it because a very good
friend of mine has celiac

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.540
disease and he complained to
me that he never got to eat

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.010
chocolate cake anymore.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.290
So I wanted to make a cake he
could-- so it's really just--

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.710
its got ground almonds
instead of flour and

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.490
it's got olive oil.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.070
So it's gluten free and
dairy free, and

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.920
is fudgy and heavenly.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.770
And very easy to make because
you're really just stirring,

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.030
stirring some hot water into
some cocoa, and then you're

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.430
stirring some olive oil,
and sugar, and

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.560
eggs, and ground almonds.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.620
So it's very, very easy.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.650
You make it ahead,
so I love that.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.150
And I also have what I call a
one-step no-churn coffee ice

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.760
cream, which is made from
ingredients that would

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.890
probably give most

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:02.060
nutritionists a nervous breakdown.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.040
But condensed milk, heavy
cream, instant espresso

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.150
powder, and coffee liqueur.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:12.860
I have to say I'm unashamedly
kitsch.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.940
And it tastes like
Italian gelato.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.240
And all you is whisk it all
together, put it straight in

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.300
the freezer, and you don't have
to churn it or anything,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.110
because it has so much
sugar and fat.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.356
But you don't have to eat a lot
and you don't have to eat

00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:28.100
it every day.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.150
That's what I say, so those
are my two favorites.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:31.710
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Perfect.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.320
We have another question?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.440
AUDIENCE: We know that you
love Italian food.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.580
What other types of
food do you like?

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.025
NIGELLA LAWSON: All types.

00:33:39.025 --> 00:33:40.430
AUDIENCE: What would be your
favorite cuisines?

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.250
NIGELLA LAWSON: I have yet to
find a type of food I don't

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.910
like except a green pepper.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.950
I feel they're unripe and
I don't understand it.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.980
I feel if you're not Hungarian,
there's no excuse

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.670
for a green bell pepper.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.550
I love Thai food.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:01.410
And I think of all the Asian
cuisines it's the simplest to

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.610
cook at home.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:07.640
I like Indian food but I cook
that only when I've got either

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.850
a lot of time off or a
pressing deadline.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.330
Because you have to work
so hard on it.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.630
I think otherwise the only
other cuisine I have an

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.540
emotional connection
to really is

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.750
Norwegian, strangely enough.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.320
Because for some reason I spent
a lot of time in Norway

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.290
as a child and even did
once speak Norwegian.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.409
I can't anymore.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.270
So I love Scandinavian food.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.330
And I also adore regional
American food.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.790
For me it's incredibly exotic.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.940
And I collect all those--

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.739
I go around America and I
collect all those spiral bound

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:48.120
recipe books that I know
churches or communities put

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.166
together of their recipes
and I love that.

00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:52.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.889
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Are there
any areas that you maybe

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.940
haven't been to that you'd
like to explore more?

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.270
Or you've been to and you'd
like to see move

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.120
of around the world?

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.620
NIGELLA LAWSON: I'm very, very
ill traveled and I would like

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.520
to rectify that.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.400
It's partly because
I have children.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.860
They're getting older,
but as they get older

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.045
they still need you.

00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:15.040
And I very much--

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.010
I do this work and I love it.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:21.770
But I do it also so that I can
work and feed my family.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.840
I mean a bit like the
environment here is that I

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.060
want to live a life
in which I feel

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.100
completely integrated person.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.550
That I'm not a work person and
then not a work person.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.350
I'm just me.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.110
And the difficulty of that is
that it means that, much as

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.050
I'd like to travel hugely, I
want to be at home as well.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.040
So later on when I'm and old
battle axe, I'm going to--

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.390
I'm getting near there--

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.890
I am going to go around
the world.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.175
And I certainly would love
to go to the Far East.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.660
I would love to travel.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.350
I think it'd be great to just
say, for a year or so I'm just

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.360
going to travel and eat my
way around the world.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.780
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Love
it, love it, love it.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.430
So I have one final question
and it's maybe a glimpse of

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.390
the future for you.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.150
Any future projects
you can share?

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.900
NIGELLA LAWSON: I really,
really hate plans.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.120
I don't know if--

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.230
do you do Myers-Briggs
at Google?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.950
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Oh, yes.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.900
NIGELLA LAWSON: Do you
approve it or not?

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.080
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Yeah, it's used.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.120
NIGELLA LAWSON: OK I'm
ESFP, we don't plan.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.240
We do not plan.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.380
We are spontaneous
improvisers.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.190
And give me a form to fill
in or a plan to have an I

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.500
dwindle, diminish, and wilt.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.670
I have a few things in
the back burner.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.320
And I just carry on.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.120
And I see what emerges.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.910
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Brilliant.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:51.880
Thank you very much.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.410
NIGELLA LAWSON: Thank you.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.680
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's been
a pleasure, thank you.
