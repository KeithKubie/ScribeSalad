Shari 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.277
Werb director of Center for 
learning, literacy and 

00:02:37.278 --> 00:02:39.278
engagement
[Applause]

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:45.813
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm delighted to 
welcome youto 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.331
Tracy K Smith closing up in as 
our 22nd poet laureate 

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:52.332
consultant in poetry.

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.643
Tracy was the first laureate 
appointed by our current 

00:02:56.644 --> 00:02:58.644
librarian of Congress, Carla 
Hayden.

00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:03.176
And in September 2017 the 
librarians stood on this stage 

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:05.177
and welcomed her to the 
position.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.846
My introduction to Tracy came 
last fall when I began as 

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:13.012
director of the library's new 
Center for learning, literacy 

00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:15.013
and engagement.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.873
Just a few weeks into the job, I
found myself traveling to the 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.768
Black Hills of South Dakota to 
join one of our 

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:26.976
laureates seven American 
conversation project trips 

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:29.017
around the country along with 
Rob Casper, director of the 

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:31.018
poetry 

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:35.854
Center and Guy Lemelin are

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.258
olinara with the Center for the 
book, we visited the guy foolish

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.930
center and Opera center in 
Spearfish and the Sturgis public

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.931
library.

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:49.671
In each place, Tracy read poems 
from her anthology, American 

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:53.798
Journal, 50 poems for our time. 
And asked a simple question. 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.799
What did you notice?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.146
Through that unassuming yet 
powerful question and with 

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:03.147
humility, warmth and 

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:06.205
an openness to whatever 
responses she 

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:08.899
received, Tracy helped audiences
connect to one another through 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.900
poetry.

00:04:12.342 --> 00:04:14.342
American conversations as well 
as the 

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.515
slowdown, Tracy's additional 
laureate project of weekday 

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:20.516
podcasts and 

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:23.816
broadcasts have proven the 
poetry can help us, whoever we 

00:04:23.817 --> 00:04:25.817
are in our day-to-day lives.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.031
By sharing in the safe space 
that Tracy, her poems and 

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:35.147
laureate projects create, we are
encouraged to reflect, discuss 

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:37.148
and empathize.

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.260
To deepen our connection to our 
community, and even be part of a

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.261
new community.

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:47.206
This does more than prove the 
power of the art. It helps 

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.207
strengthen civic society.

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:53.482
Tracy has shown me the 
transformative 

00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:56.583
power of this work and has given
me a sense of what the Library 

00:04:56.584 --> 00:04:58.584
of Congress should aim for.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.170
Just as I am thankful she 
brought me to South Dakota, I'm 

00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:05.171
thankful she has 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.066
chosen to share the stage night 
with poets laureate representing

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:11.096
Hawaii, Indiana, Clark County 
Nevada, Brooklyn New York and 

00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:14.115
Oklahoma. All of whom have done 
their own amazing work.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.620
Tracy will begin the event with 
an 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.880
address, then welcome her fellow
poets laureate on stage.

00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:29.091
Joining them will be Jennifer 
Benka, president and executive 

00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:31.549
director of the Academy of 
American poets, who will lead a 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.550
moderated discussion.

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:38.684
I want to note that in just nine
days, for the first time, the 

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.725
Academy of American poets will 
award over $1 

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:46.598
million to 10 to 20 poets 
serving as 

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.081
laureates of states, cities, 
counties, 

00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:53.858
US territories or tribal nations
to recognize literary excellence

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:56.336
and fuel civic projects. Please 
join me in congratulating 

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:00.166
Jennifer and the Academy.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:05.035
[Applause]

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320
&gt;&gt; Before I turn the microphone 
over to 

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:17.655
Tracy, I want to take a moment 
to acknowledge our dear poet 

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.656
laureate as one of our country's
national treasures.

00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:24.168
At many American conversation 
events, 

00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:25.440
Tracy began by reading from her 
most recent collection, Wade in 

00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:27.441
the water.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.962
The found poem sequence, I will 
tell you the truth about this, I

00:06:31.963 --> 00:06:33.963
will tell 

00:06:34.982 --> 00:06:36.982
you all about it featuring 
letters from African-American 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.870
soldiers petitioning the 
government for 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.161
their pensions often elicited 
audible responses from the 

00:06:42.162 --> 00:06:44.162
audience.

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.267
Tracy called the experts from

00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:52.340
to Burks, families and freedom, 
a documentary history of 

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:54.341
African-American 

00:06:55.888 --> 00:06:56.306
kinship in the Civil War era 
drawn from the Friedman and 

00:06:56.307 --> 00:06:58.307
Southern Society 

00:07:00.398 --> 00:07:02.043
project at the University of 
Maryland, and voices of 

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:04.044
emancipation, 

00:07:06.507 --> 00:07:07.023
understanding slavery, the Civil
War and Reconstruction through 

00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:09.024
the US pension Bureau files.

00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:14.792
I can think of no better example
of promoting civic literacy and 

00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:16.793
giving 

00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:21.562
voice to a past often ignored or
forgotten while showcasing the 

00:07:22.186 --> 00:07:24.403
importance of research and 
primary source documents. And I 

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:26.404
will tell you the truth about 
this.

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:30.969
I will tell you all about it, 
Tracy models how such documents 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.970
can inspire each of us.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.674
How we too can engage with the 
library, reach in and explore 

00:07:37.675 --> 00:07:39.675
its wealth of collections and 
find our connection to the past.

00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:46.274
In the title poem from Wade in 
the water, Tracy connects the 

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:48.275
past to her own story.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.369
The poem begins, one of the 
women greeted me. I love you, 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.035
she said. She didn't know me, 
but I believed her.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.992
And a terrible new ache rolled 
over my chest like a room where 

00:08:02.993 --> 00:08:04.993
the drapes have been swept back.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.304
There's so much to unpack in 
these opening lines that shows 

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:11.305
us poetry's 

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:14.384
power, to situate us in the 
world as 

00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:18.972
well as within our fears and 
desires, to capture the 

00:08:18.973 --> 00:08:20.973
complexity of an overwhelming 
moment through simile.

00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:24.228
And to plainly and powerfully 
act with love and grace.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.039
When Tracy read this poem during
her American conversation 

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.040
events, she would also describe 
the process of writing it.

00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:40.003
The poem is dedicated to the 
Guiche 

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:42.912
Golla ring showers as you return
to the greeting as a kind of 

00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:44.913
rumination while 

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:47.588
describing their performance and
layering it in image after image

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.589
with history.

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:52.093
When she could no longer 
describe, Tracy's mind and 

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:56.814
imagination leapt. As only those
of poets can. And she arrived at

00:08:56.815 --> 00:08:58.815
these last lines.

00:09:03.592 --> 00:09:05.592
Oh Woods, a dog, a tree, oh gun,
oh girl, run.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:11.998
All miraculous mini gone, a 
Lord, Lord, Lord, is this the 

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.999
trouble you promised.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.688
This is the kind of poem we 
need.

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:22.495
A poem that gives shape to what 
we cannot otherwise say in ways 

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:27.652
we can all feel. If we are to 
get past our differences and 

00:09:27.653 --> 00:09:29.653
share our most profound, most 

00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:33.572
painful and beautiful moments of
living, poems such as Wade in 

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.573
the water show us a way.

00:09:41.673 --> 00:09:42.504
On behalf of the Library of 
Congress, I would like to say 

00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:46.170
thank you, Tracy for serving as 
the nation's poet laureate. And 

00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.171
thank you for the opportunity 
you 

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.280
have given me, the library, and 
everyone 

00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:52.807
you have met these last two 
years to connect with you 

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:55.659
through poetry. Please join me 
in welcoming Tracy K Smith.

00:10:02.316 --> 00:10:04.316
[Applause]

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:20.533
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:25.801
[Applause]

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.283
&gt;&gt; Thank you and thank you Sheri
for that wonderful and moving 

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.150
introduction.

00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:41.865
I'd like to begin these remarks 
with thanks for Dr.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.982
Carla Hayden, who changed my 
relationship both to poetry and 

00:10:46.983 --> 00:10:48.983
to America.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.002
The profound honor of being 
named poet laureate has urged me

00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:58.003
to think deeply 

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:01.734
and ongoingly about why poetry 
matters and to enter into 

00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:06.282
life-changing encounters with 
other Americans from Alaska to 

00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:08.283
Louisiana. Via poetry.

00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:14.679
I would also like to thank the 
staff of the poetry and  I would

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.680
also like to thank the staff of 
the poetry and Literature Ctr.

00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:24.174
, Anya Cratyny Rob Holmes and 
Casper

00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:26.155
for moving quickly and 
magnificently to facilitate my 

00:11:26.156 --> 00:11:28.156
poet laureate project, 

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:30.090
American conversations, 
celebrating poetry in rural 

00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:32.091
communities. Can we clap for 
them?

00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:37.349
[Applause]

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:42.559
&gt;&gt; I had an idea of what I'd 
hoped to do.

00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:46.494
But I had no idea how such a 
thing might happen and they 

00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:48.495
together with the 

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.024
guy Lemolinara from the national
Center for the book shepherded 

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.025
my wish into exhilarating 
reality.

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:01.216
I feel indescribably lucky to 
have benefited from their 

00:12:01.217 --> 00:12:04.264
vision, their know-how, their 
wisdom and enthusiasm, and if 

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.890
you know Rob, you know what I 
mean by enthusiasm.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.891
[Applause]

00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:13.505
&gt;&gt; I also owe a tremendous 
thanks to 

00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:17.424
Jeff shots and Fiona McRae at 
Grable's P Gray Wolf press and 

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:21.761
much more than thanks to my 
wonderful husband Rafael Allison

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:23.762
[Applause]

00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:29.133
&gt;&gt; Who kept our home and our 
children 

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.203
both afloat and anchored during 
these two years of nonstop 

00:12:31.204 --> 00:12:33.204
travel. So thank you.

00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:38.946
My hope for the American 
conversations project was 

00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:40.947
twofold.

00:12:42.869 --> 00:12:44.869
On one hand as a poet who 
typically 

00:12:47.916 --> 00:12:49.208
reads in university communities 
and encounters audiences at 

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:52.063
literary festivals, I was eager 
to venture beyond 

00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:57.385
campuses and urban centers in my
engagement with poetry and 

00:12:57.386 --> 00:12:59.386
poetry audiences.

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.467
I wanted to travel to places 
that 

00:13:04.528 --> 00:13:04.731
aren't typically targets for a 
great deal of literary 

00:13:04.732 --> 00:13:06.732
programming.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.538
But on the other hand, I was 
also very determined to push 

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:15.387
back against the pervasive 
narrative of America as a 

00:13:15.388 --> 00:13:17.388
divided nation.

00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:21.451
The narrative that says people 
in the 

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:25.434
rural heartland have nothing in 
common, not even a shared 

00:13:25.435 --> 00:13:27.435
language with those of us in 
urban centers.

00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:31.128
I harbored the hope that if 
anything 

00:13:34.607 --> 00:13:35.438
could defy this notion of an on 
cross of all national divide it 

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:37.439
would surely be poetry.

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:41.387
Which jostles us out of our rote
engagement with the world and 

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.388
opens us 

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:47.357
up with humility and curiosity 
to other perspectives on 

00:13:47.358 --> 00:13:49.358
experience.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.065
I believed that poetry fosters a

00:13:56.348 --> 00:13:56.562
deepening relationship with 
reality, a more conscious and 

00:13:56.563 --> 00:13:58.597
deliberate engagement with the 
lives of others, and with the 

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:02.065
inner life that each of us 
houses.

00:14:05.342 --> 00:14:07.250
I believed that reading poetry 
builds in us a reserve of 

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:09.251
perspectives and strategies for 
living.

00:14:13.965 --> 00:14:14.381
I believed that poetry reminds 
us to think of life as dynamic 

00:14:14.382 --> 00:14:16.382
rather than 

00:14:18.117 --> 00:14:20.117
static, mysterious and rich 
rather than flat or Pat.

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:25.275
And the poems open our minds to 
the realness and the usefulness 

00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:27.276
of others experiences.

00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:31.124
That they instill in us a sense 
of 

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:38.490
participation in a long and 
ongoing history of human joy, 

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.857
struggle and hope. That was my 
theory.

00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:43.374
And what I found in practice on 
each of our journeys was 

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:45.375
incredibly heartening.

00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:49.705
Together with my crew from the 
library, we'd land in a new 

00:14:49.706 --> 00:14:51.706
place, gather our 

00:14:54.573 --> 00:14:54.790
bearings in a local restaurant, 
gate in all at the power and the

00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:56.791
particular 

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.722
beauty of the particular 
landscape on what might be a two

00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:00.723
or 3 Hour Dr.

00:15:02.724 --> 00:15:05.450
and and up in a public library 
or community center or some 

00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.451
other venue full of 

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.460
strangers miraculously willing 
to read poems with 

00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:13.897
me and enter into candid on 
Goddard 

00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:16.898
conversation unguarded 
conversation.

00:15:19.255 --> 00:15:20.467
Condition by media exposure to 
expect a sense of difference or 

00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:22.468
division I felt 

00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:25.478
and feel indescribably lucky to 
have found my 

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.366
way to a counter narrative of 
thoughtful listening and mutual 

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:32.367
respect as fostered by poetry.

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.557
Reading poems with others and 
talking in ordinary rather than 

00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:39.558
critical or 

00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:42.957
analytical language about what 
poems cause us to notice, 

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958
remember, wonder 

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:48.208
and feel, has been a way of 
getting to 

00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:51.927
know one another and accessing 
vital feelings in a space of 

00:15:51.928 --> 00:15:53.928
safety.

00:15:57.808 --> 00:15:59.300
Poems have been these amazing 
tools for reminding us no matter

00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:01.301
who we are of the things we 
share. And that's not all.

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:06.179
Poems also highlight the 
differences 

00:16:07.464 --> 00:16:09.310
between us, advocating 
implicitly for the validity of 

00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:11.311
differing perspectives.

00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:15.034
I am aware of what we were able 
to impart on these trips.

00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:21.000
Some people discovered the ways 
that poems offer a means of 

00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:23.652
capturing and examining the 
strange and remarkable features 

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:25.653
of our lives.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320
Like a nine-year-old girl in New
Haven Kentucky who came by 

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:34.354
herself to a Saturday morning 
conversation at her local public

00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:37.214
library, which was her home away
from home. She sat by herself in

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:39.215
the front row.

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:42.885
And I could see her taking 
everything in carefully.

00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:46.634
When finally she raised her 
hand, she asked when did you 

00:16:46.635 --> 00:16:48.635
realize that you had stories to 
tell?

00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:53.365
I told her I was just about her 
age when I tried to write my 

00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:56.224
first poem. Do you feel like you
have stories to tell I asked 

00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:58.225
her?

00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:04.617
And she told us one that 
surprised and worried many of 

00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:02.951
us.

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:07.747
You can grow up to be a writer 
if you want to, I told her. And 

00:17:07.748 --> 00:17:09.748
after I got home I sent a box of

00:17:10.749 --> 00:17:12.435
books to that small branch, 
thinking about what might make a

00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:14.436
difference to a kid like her.

00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:18.597
Others reclaimed a long 
neglected level of poetry.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.130
After an event at old Somerton 
high school in South Carolina, a

00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.131
group of women who were members 
of the first integrated 

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.400
graduating class described how 
they had 

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:31.889
written poetry back when they 
were students and how our 

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.180
conversation had inspired them 
to return to the practice. 

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.181
Others discovered a new sense of

00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:41.324
freedom in being able to talk 
about poems using the language 

00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:43.325
they live in everyday.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.815
A man in the audience at a class
I was 

00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:50.695
invited to give in Wyoming 
raised his hand midway through a

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:52.696
conversation about a poem to say
I get it.

00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:57.436
When you read a poem you're just
kind of pouring it through your 

00:17:57.437 --> 00:17:59.437
own filter to see what gets 
caught there.

00:18:02.922 --> 00:18:03.584
My filter is different from your
filter and different things will

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:07.047
get caught in your filter at 
different times depending on who

00:18:07.048 --> 00:18:09.048
and where you are when you read 
the poem.

00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:14.415
Still others, like in a youth 
juvenile detention center near 

00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:18.293
Juneau Alaska sought out poems 
on themes deeply relevant to 

00:18:18.294 --> 00:18:20.543
their lives, but difficult to 
broach in everyday conversation.

00:18:24.424 --> 00:18:26.424
Themes like suicide, trauma and 
addiction.

00:18:29.531 --> 00:18:32.402
But I also want to emphasize 
what the people in these 

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:32.604
communities gave, what the 
people in these communities gave

00:18:32.605 --> 00:18:34.605
to 

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:38.265
us is of equal importance to 
what they might have taken away.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.801
American conversations was not 
about cityfolk going into 

00:18:42.802 --> 00:18:44.802
educate rural folk.

00:18:46.952 --> 00:18:48.952
It was about the way the poetry 
changes 

00:18:50.155 --> 00:18:50.809
everyone's view of the world and
how it changes our view of 

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.810
ourselves.

00:18:54.704 --> 00:18:56.704
Returning to cities for readings
and 

00:18:57.718 --> 00:19:00.629
events over these last two years
I have become increasingly aware

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.514
of the kinds of unwitting urban 
bias present in many of 

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:10.959
the questions,

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:12.523
well-meaning questions like so 
what is the rural experience 

00:19:12.524 --> 00:19:14.524
like, or what is rural's 
America's reaction to poetry or 

00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:19.252
did you encounter any resistance
or hostility on these trips.

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:22.812
Questions with thought 
affirmation that the many 

00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:24.813
different rural communities in 
this nation are alike.

00:19:26.904 --> 00:19:28.904
Characterized by one easily 
summarize a 

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:32.987
trait and uniformly wary or 
suspicious of outsiders.

00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:36.854
In fact, I was shocked early 
into my 

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.860
first term

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:44.504
to be asked point-blank, were 
you surprised by the 

00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:46.505
intelligence of people's 
responses in rural communities.

00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:52.831
If there is indeed a divide in 
this 

00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:54.885
nation perhaps it is perpetuated
by unthinking assumptions like 

00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:56.886
these.

00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:01.030
Assumptions rooted in the wish 
to summarize or characterize the

00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:03.031
unknown 

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.375
other as something single, 
unified, predictable, 

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:07.376
measurable.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.830
I like to believe these kinds of
other 

00:20:13.564 --> 00:20:15.564
defining questions didn't come 
up during 

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.770
in the actual

00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:20.758
American conversations tour 
because in every setting 

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:20.959
participants were engaging in a 
new configuration of momentary 

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.886
community. I was there with 
staff members from DC. People 

00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:27.887
from neighboring towns were 

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:31.233
present, sometimes creating an 
unexpected or unlikely 

00:20:31.234 --> 00:20:33.234
cross-section of community.

00:20:34.283 --> 00:20:36.283
Sometimes audience member drove 
from 

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:41.037
hours away out of an existing 
love of poetry or they thought 

00:20:41.038 --> 00:20:43.285
it was important for their kids 
to see someone speaking in an 

00:20:45.552 --> 00:20:47.552
official capacity, who, as they 
often said look like them.

00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:51.154
One Kentucky mother said the 
exact opposite, that she wanted 

00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:54.030
to expose her children to the 
viewpoint of someone who looked 

00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:56.031
nothing like them.

00:20:58.663 --> 00:21:01.828
The concept of we was different 
from gathering to gathering. 

00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:03.829
Which means there wasn't enough 
of a 

00:21:06.895 --> 00:21:07.553
certainty about who we together 
were for participants to seek a 

00:21:07.554 --> 00:21:09.554
certainty 

00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:13.882
about who we weren't, or how we 
were different from another 

00:21:13.883 --> 00:21:15.883
specific group or demographic. I
think that's important.

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:22.439
I think placing ourselves in new
configurations of community is 

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.440
something we ought to seek out 
more often.

00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.091
Because it helps to unsettle the
feelings of confidence and 

00:21:30.468 --> 00:21:33.115
authority that cause us to 
forget how much we can learn 

00:21:33.116 --> 00:21:35.116
from others who are not like 
ourselves.

00:21:36.776 --> 00:21:38.997
I will never forget the powerful
uncertainty I felt at a home for

00:21:42.007 --> 00:21:45.155
veterans and pioneers about an 
hour outside of Anchorage 

00:21:45.156 --> 00:21:48.014
Alaska., Apart from one or two 
members of the audience nobody 

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.015
volunteered to speak.

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:55.382
I would read a poem and ask a 
question, what do you notice, 

00:21:55.383 --> 00:21:59.063
and it would be followed by a 
longer than was comfortable 

00:21:59.064 --> 00:22:01.064
period of silence.

00:22:02.336 --> 00:22:03.768
Sometimes as I was reading, and 
audience member would audibly 

00:22:03.769 --> 00:22:05.769
moan.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.566
It was a reaction I wasn't used 
to and it was difficult at times

00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:13.567
to sit with the long stretches 
of unfilled silence.

00:22:15.512 --> 00:22:17.512
But afterward, staff members 
were visibly excited.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.466
It turned out that a sizable 
portion of the audience was made

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.467
up of nonverbal 

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.620
members of the facility's 
Alzheimer's wing.

00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:32.116
Those moans and the inaudible 
movements that sometimes 

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:36.609
accompanied them or palpable 
indicators of the ways poems had

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.610
spoken to or even woken up 
audience members.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.930
Without realizing it, I had been
in the presence of a remarkable 

00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:44.931
response to the 

00:22:45.993 --> 00:22:48.838
power of poetry and it was an 
unforgettable recalibration of 

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:51.904
my own sense of what it means to
engage with poetry. One thing 

00:22:51.905 --> 00:22:53.905
that stays with me from that 

00:22:55.192 --> 00:22:57.192
evening is the fact that it 
wasn't about 

00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:00.205
me performing well or hitting it
off with people in 

00:23:02.332 --> 00:23:02.548
these different places, rather 
American conversations was about

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.549
giving people 

00:23:05.556 --> 00:23:08.551
space to engage with poems in 
their own ways and in the terms 

00:23:08.552 --> 00:23:10.552
most meaningful for them.

00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:14.664
If there's anything the 
experience of this project had 

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:16.665
onemade me want to 

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.297
change about how I engage with

00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:24.276
poetry and the other spaces I 
move through, spaces like cities

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:27.121
and literary festivals and 
college campuses, it is this. I 

00:23:27.122 --> 00:23:29.122
wish we could be more 
consistently 

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.097
willing to let go of our own 
need for certainty and for the 

00:23:33.098 --> 00:23:35.098
desire to demonstrate our claims
to authority.

00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:42.834
I wish we could turn down the 
volume on 

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:46.056
our egos and get past our own 
impulse to judge, rate 

00:23:47.777 --> 00:23:49.777
and assess, and impulse fueled, 
I suspect by the 

00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:53.373
many consumer based interfaces 
we have gotten used to engaging 

00:23:53.374 --> 00:23:55.374
with.

00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:00.716
Forms that ensure us that are 
instantaneous unfiltered deeply 

00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:02.783
biased and often unfounded 
reactions are of enormous value.

00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:09.708
I wish that we could more often 
let go 

00:24:11.382 --> 00:24:13.382
of the need to be seen as 
exceptional 

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:14.843
and authoritative in our 
reactions, the need to garner 

00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:17.488
responses that demonstrate our 
exceptional and authoritative 

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.489
status.

00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:24.795
And simply submit to 
experiencing powerful and 

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.796
difficult to summarize feelings 
together with others.

00:24:30.917 --> 00:24:32.917
I wish that together in whatever

00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:34.795
versions of community we 
represent we would more often 

00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:36.796
allow ourselves to wander a wile
through the wilderness of 

00:24:39.737 --> 00:24:42.590
new feelings and the wilderness 
of old feelings in new forms 

00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:45.250
without needing to know and 
declare where we are and how we 

00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:47.251
got there.

00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:51.358
In other words, I wish we could 
muster a willingness to get lost

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:53.359
together.

00:24:55.857 --> 00:24:57.498
, which is essentially the state
poems offer their readers and 

00:24:57.499 --> 00:24:59.499
the poets who write them.

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:06.439
Poems invite us to move on 

00:25:07.442 --> 00:25:09.161
pre-meditatedly in a question or
state of our people through a 

00:25:09.162 --> 00:25:11.394
series of spontaneous 
observations and responses, some

00:25:11.395 --> 00:25:13.395
of 

00:25:15.092 --> 00:25:17.731
which are conscious, others 
unconscious. To something that 

00:25:17.732 --> 00:25:19.732
feels like revelation.

00:25:23.024 --> 00:25:25.894
Poems draw us deliberately past 
our certainties and our 

00:25:25.895 --> 00:25:27.895
assumptions and into 

00:25:30.004 --> 00:25:30.176
something startling and 
consoling or chastening and 

00:25:30.177 --> 00:25:32.177
enlarging.

00:25:36.704 --> 00:25:37.973
In order to most emphatically 
experience poems we have to 

00:25:37.974 --> 00:25:40.634
surrender authority,  pay close 
attention and let 

00:25:44.718 --> 00:25:46.718
the poem itself lead us to a 
place where 

00:25:47.935 --> 00:25:49.609
a new kind of sense prevails. I 
have long believed this was good

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.610
for the individual mind and 
spirit.

00:25:54.535 --> 00:25:56.535
Now more than ever I believe it 
is good 

00:25:58.803 --> 00:26:02.136
for the collective, the 
community, even something 

00:25:58.803 --> 00:26:00.803
resembling the nation.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.330
During my travels I have 
encountered 

00:26:07.988 --> 00:26:10.447
many regional poets laureate 
working with energy and 

00:26:10.448 --> 00:26:12.674
generosity to strengthen their 
communities with the things 

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.675
poetry offers.

00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:19.189
And so it is my great honor 
together tonight with them for 

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.190
conversation about the ongoing 
work of poets laureate and 

00:26:23.827 --> 00:26:24.889
the ongoing work of poetry so 
I'd like to welcome the poets to

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.890
the stage now.

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.989
[Applause]

00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:56.229
&gt;&gt; Okay so hopefully we can kick
this off and we will get some 

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.230
other 

00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:02.136
perspectives on what it has 
meant, what it means to be 

00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:04.779
sharing and engaging with others
via poetry, starting from the 

00:27:09.024 --> 00:27:09.540
right side of the stage Vogue 
Robinson is poet laureate of 

00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:11.541
Clark County Nevada.

00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:17.027
[Applause] 

00:27:22.278 --> 00:27:24.278
&gt;&gt; She is a dynamic community 
builder, a 

00:27:25.292 --> 00:27:26.986
galvanizing force in the Las 
Vegas literary community. When I

00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:29.833
visited, she was very clear to 
tell me, it's not the strip. 

00:27:29.834 --> 00:27:33.924
That's not Vegas. Vegas is 
people. Vegas is writers.

00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:37.241
Vegas is neighbors, Vegas is 
people who are building 

00:27:37.242 --> 00:27:40.087
something together. So she's a 
booster for the cities and 

00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:43.309
counties cultural riches.

00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:49.046
She hosts workshops, writers 
gatherings and serves the 

00:27:49.047 --> 00:27:50.691
community with poetry programs 
like the workshop she conducts 

00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:52.692
for people who are living with 
Alzheimer's.

00:27:56.865 --> 00:27:58.505
And next to her is Tina Chang 
who is poet laureate of Brooklyn

00:27:58.506 --> 00:28:00.506
New York.

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:05.686
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Tina and I grew up together.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.257
We were classmates as graduate 
students back when we were just 

00:28:11.258 --> 00:28:13.258
dreaming of maybe 

00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:18.157
making a life together as poets,
so it's 

00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:21.025
a really so very beautiful to be
here direct together and 

00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:26.166
celebrate the work that she has 
been doing in her capacity. One 

00:28:26.167 --> 00:28:27.588
of the major emphases of her 
time, and she's been poet 

00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:29.589
laureate of Brooklyn 

00:28:30.662 --> 00:28:32.902
for 10 years, has been children.
She's created a program to bring

00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:36.185
authors in the public schools, 
and she's 

00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:39.509
also led workshops with all age 
groups, from elementary school 

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.510
kids to adults and 

00:28:42.724 --> 00:28:44.724
retirement centers and 
facilities.

00:28:47.002 --> 00:28:49.889
Her laureateship has been going 
on for 10 years like I said and 

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.965
throughout the time she's found 
powerful ways to celebrate and 

00:28:51.966 --> 00:28:53.966
promote poetry as a life-saving 
tool.

00:28:57.231 --> 00:28:59.231
[Applause]

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:06.278
&gt;&gt; Next to her is Kealoha, who 
is poet laureate of Hawaii.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.279
[Applause]

00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:15.041
&gt;&gt; I have mind and envy.

00:29:18.088 --> 00:29:20.994
Kealoha holds a degree of 
nuclear engineering from MIT and

00:29:20.995 --> 00:29:22.995
one of the things he has 

00:29:24.005 --> 00:29:25.894
used the laureateship to do is 
expand the vocabulary and 

00:29:25.895 --> 00:29:27.895
methodology that we associate 
with poetry.

00:29:29.554 --> 00:29:31.554
He has epic performance poems 
that like 

00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:34.805
the story of everything, right?

00:29:37.488 --> 00:29:39.488
That explore the universe from 
the Big 

00:29:40.548 --> 00:29:40.750
Bang to the present, or native 
culture and different debates 

00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:42.751
about what that means, or 
feminism.

00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:50.760
And he uses discourse from 
science, storytelling and social

00:29:50.761 --> 00:29:52.761
justice to create these really 
dynamic pieces.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.210
[Applause]

00:30:07.521 --> 00:30:09.521
&gt;&gt; Next to Kealoha is Jeanetta 
Calhoun 

00:30:11.579 --> 00:30:13.579
Mich who is poet laureate of 
Oklahoma 

00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:19.174
her work in the world celebrates
Oklahoma history literature and 

00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:20.391
culture and has led her to 
communities and schools 

00:30:20.392 --> 00:30:22.006
throughout the state, she spends
a lot of time in rural 

00:30:22.007 --> 00:30:24.061
communities as well so I'm 
excited to hear how our 

00:30:24.062 --> 00:30:26.062
experiences match up with one 
another.

00:30:28.328 --> 00:30:29.953
She's also taken it as her 
mission to encourage Oklahomans 

00:30:29.954 --> 00:30:31.954
to write their 

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.600
states history and explore their
own stories via poetry.

00:30:36.082 --> 00:30:38.082
[Applause]

00:30:39.493 --> 00:30:41.493
&gt;&gt;

00:30:45.873 --> 00:30:47.873
And Adrian Matejka is poet 
laureate of Indiana.

00:30:48.143 --> 00:30:50.143
[Applause]

00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:54.031
&gt;&gt; In this role, he has 
tirelessly 

00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.964
traveled back and forth across 
his state, hosting workshops and

00:30:57.965 --> 00:31:02.043
readings with visiting writers, 
and I have traveled a lot, but 

00:31:02.044 --> 00:31:05.760
when I visited Indiana twice, 
and when I catch wind of what 

00:31:05.761 --> 00:31:07.761
Adrian is doing, it's really 
tireless.

00:31:10.427 --> 00:31:12.427
Like I am deeply humbled by the 
generosity and dedication.

00:31:17.298 --> 00:31:17.752
He's also building an archive of
poets with ties to the state of 

00:31:17.753 --> 00:31:19.753
Indiana, which is far-reaching.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.790
And we visited

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:26.766
a small library in Franklin 
Indiana, a school in 

00:31:26.767 --> 00:31:28.392
Shelbyville, and there's a 
really beautiful sense of 

00:31:28.393 --> 00:31:30.393
stewardship 

00:31:31.401 --> 00:31:33.401
that he brings to the world. So 
welcome, Adrian.

00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:36.751
[Applause]

00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:40.921
&gt;&gt; And we will be led in 
conversation by 

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.412
Jennifer Benka who is president 
and Executive Director of the 

00:31:44.413 --> 00:31:47.262
Academy of American poets
[Applause]

00:31:47.877 --> 00:31:49.877
&gt;&gt;...

00:31:53.593 --> 00:31:55.593
and as you heard, she is a 
powerful 

00:31:56.595 --> 00:31:58.491
advocate for Po poets, poetry 
and poetry organizations 

00:31:58.492 --> 00:32:01.976
nationwide.
[Applause]

00:32:08.088 --> 00:32:10.525
&gt;&gt; Well I want to start my 
first, Tracy, thanking you again

00:32:10.526 --> 00:32:12.526
on behalf of all of 

00:32:15.205 --> 00:32:19.471
us for your brilliant brilliant 
work serving our nation is poet 

00:32:15.205 --> 00:32:17.205
laureate.

00:32:20.245 --> 00:32:22.245
[Applause]

00:32:26.423 --> 00:32:28.423
&gt;&gt; I know very clearly that you 
have 

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:33.116
touched the lives of so many 
people on your visits.

00:32:34.124 --> 00:32:35.189
I also want you to know that you
have influenced the work of 

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.190
poetry organizations across the 
country.

00:32:38.644 --> 00:32:40.644
One of the things that I'm lucky
enough 

00:32:41.844 --> 00:32:43.844
to be able to do is work in 
partnership with 25 poetry 

00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:47.364
organizations across the US who 
are 

00:32:48.438 --> 00:32:50.502
collaborating and have formed an
alliance called the poetry 

00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:52.562
coalition and because of you and
the work that you have done we 

00:32:52.563 --> 00:32:54.563
have begun a conversation 

00:32:55.627 --> 00:32:57.627
about how we are serving rural 

00:32:58.632 --> 00:32:59.511
communities in our poetry 
programming and that is not 

00:32:59.512 --> 00:33:01.357
something we have talked about 
before. So I want to thank you 

00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:03.998
for that.
[Applause]

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.710
&gt;&gt; You have been a model and 
been such a 

00:33:13.635 --> 00:33:16.523
reminder in your work of how 
poetry can be a commons and it 

00:33:16.524 --> 00:33:18.524
can also be common ground.

00:33:21.428 --> 00:33:23.428
Your work reminds me of another 
poet 

00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:28.548
who championed poetry's social 

00:33:30.578 --> 00:33:33.296
possibilities, Muro Rukeyser who
writes in her very influential 

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.860
collection of essays the life of
poetry 

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:38.802
a number of relevant things, but
one about how civilizations, in 

00:33:38.803 --> 00:33:41.059
order to survive, draw on all 
sources of 

00:33:44.072 --> 00:33:48.237
knowledge. Any source of 
knowledge that they can find, 

00:33:48.238 --> 00:33:50.238
history, inventions, science, 
and 

00:33:52.124 --> 00:33:54.124
yet somehow throughout the ages,
poetry 

00:33:55.998 --> 00:33:56.198
sometimes has not been used as 
much as maybe it could have 

00:33:56.199 --> 00:33:58.199
been.

00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:01.457
And yet, she says that when 

00:34:04.692 --> 00:34:05.206
communication seems to break 
down, it is then that we need to

00:34:05.207 --> 00:34:07.446
tap the roots of communication 
and that is where poetry dwells.

00:34:12.348 --> 00:34:12.549
Because it is an poetry that one
source is speaking to another 

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.550
source.

00:34:17.283 --> 00:34:18.909
And that's where, and how 
personal and maybe communal 

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:20.910
transformation can be sparked.

00:34:22.817 --> 00:34:24.817
And perhaps that's why there are
in 

00:34:25.896 --> 00:34:27.896
addition to the national poet 
laureate 

00:34:29.966 --> 00:34:31.594
position, a growing number of 
states and cities who have 

00:34:31.595 --> 00:34:33.595
created poets laureate 
positions.

00:34:36.426 --> 00:34:38.426
The first state that had a poet 
laureate was Colorado in 1919.

00:34:42.758 --> 00:34:44.758
And over the decades a number of
states have created that 

00:34:46.273 --> 00:34:48.300
position. Now we have 45 states 
across the country that have 

00:34:48.301 --> 00:34:50.301
poets laureate.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.780
And interestingly, now we have 
many many cities that also do.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.850
And also US territories and 
tribal nations and that is 

00:35:00.961 --> 00:35:02.961
something that my organization 
has been following.

00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:06.714
And watching and tracking. The 
first city I believe that had a 

00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:13.840
local laureate position was 
Mattis Madison Wisconsin for 

00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:17.562
1977, for the badgers in the 
audience. There you go that was 

00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:19.563
for you, Mr. Casper.

00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:24.892
But most of the poets laureate 
positions that have launched on 

00:35:24.893 --> 00:35:29.586
the city level have been since 
2000 and 2001. Interesting, 

00:35:29.587 --> 00:35:31.587
right?

00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:36.092
There's a part of me that 
wonders if there's a connection 

00:35:36.093 --> 00:35:38.544
between what happened on 9/11 
and the need that 

00:35:42.396 --> 00:35:44.396
cities have to understand those 
tragic 

00:35:46.072 --> 00:35:48.072
events and find important and 
meaningful 

00:35:51.172 --> 00:35:51.846
ways to have conversations that 
can help heal and move forward. 

00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:53.847
So I'd like to start there.

00:35:57.446 --> 00:36:00.112
The important civic role of the 
laureate. Why does it matter 

00:36:00.113 --> 00:36:02.752
that states have poets laureate 
positions and that cities do.

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:13.225
What is it in your role that 
you're able to do in terms of 

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:11.323
sparking dialogue. I'm looking 
at you, Adrian.

00:36:17.162 --> 00:36:19.645
&gt;&gt; Okay well the great state of 
Indiana, the 19th state in the 

00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:22.052
union has a very long history of
poets laureate.

00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:26.211
We've had a 72 years of poets 
laureate, but I'm only the 

00:36:26.212 --> 00:36:28.212
second one who was not white.

00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:34.764
So the case at least in my 
laureateship one of the civic 

00:36:34.765 --> 00:36:36.765
duties is to do some of 

00:36:37.781 --> 00:36:42.120
the work that I think the woman 
from Kentucky was talking about,

00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:44.121
like getting a conversation 
going 

00:36:45.519 --> 00:36:47.827
that is not from the same 
perspective of those who've they

00:36:47.828 --> 00:36:49.483
have been speaking with. This 
has nothing to do with a really 

00:36:49.484 --> 00:36:51.484
wonderful poets who have been 
doing the 

00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:52.801
work before I got there. They 
all care deeply about the state 

00:36:52.802 --> 00:36:54.802
of 

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.152
Indiana. The state of Indiana is
a very diverse state. It's a 

00:36:59.153 --> 00:36:59.354
very problematic state in a lot 
of ways racially and 

00:36:59.355 --> 00:37:01.355
economically.

00:37:03.433 --> 00:37:05.433
So it is at least in my 
experience it 

00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:07.911
has given me an opportunity to 
expand the conversation just a 

00:37:07.912 --> 00:37:12.407
little bit, to show them that in
fact there are a lot of 

00:37:12.408 --> 00:37:14.408
different stories that need to 
be 

00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:16.913
told, not just the ones that had
been going on the last 17 years.

00:37:20.592 --> 00:37:23.064
&gt;&gt; I was thinking about the 
question because you sent it to 

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:25.065
us earlier, and 

00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:29.152
for me, poetry functions on the 
boundary between the private and

00:37:29.153 --> 00:37:31.153
the public.

00:37:32.366 --> 00:37:35.535
It functions when I'm writing it
because I'm engaging with other 

00:37:35.536 --> 00:37:37.775
things and I think it also 
functions that way for people 

00:37:38.587 --> 00:37:40.587
when they hear it, and I'm not 
sure...

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:44.753
some kinds of ritual used to do 
that and we don't have a lot of 

00:37:44.754 --> 00:37:46.754
ritual left in our communities 
anymore.

00:37:48.823 --> 00:37:50.823
And I think that two-way street 
between 

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:54.765
your internal self and your 
Celtic se civic self that is 

00:37:54.766 --> 00:37:56.766
activated in poetry 

00:37:59.041 --> 00:37:59.242
is where the magic happens and 
for me I want to share that with

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:01.714
everyone. Poetry saved my life 
in many ways.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800
I want to take that, and also I 
want to 

00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:11.488
make sure that the rural areas 
where 

00:38:12.517 --> 00:38:14.517
actually they are more diverse 
in Oklahoma, the 

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.696
rural areas are more diverse in 
then that cities, Native 

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.697
Americans, African Americans, 
Vietnamese, all kinds 

00:38:24.993 --> 00:38:27.441
of people, much more than people
think, and I want to make a way 

00:38:27.442 --> 00:38:29.698
for them to enter the civic 
conversation through the poetry 

00:38:29.699 --> 00:38:31.699
that I help them right in 
workshop.

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:40.314
&gt;&gt; In my experience, in my 
brain, the way that I see all 

00:38:40.315 --> 00:38:42.315
the different things we do with 

00:38:43.329 --> 00:38:43.639
all our outreach and the way we 
approach our poetry, it's really

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.640
what it bubbles 

00:38:47.714 --> 00:38:49.714
down to is making poetry 
accessible every day for people.

00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:53.208
And that not something that is 
intangible but something they 

00:38:53.209 --> 00:38:55.209
can interface with.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.153
And it is there for them and it 
is present and our job is to 

00:39:00.154 --> 00:39:05.449
bring not only our work out and 
share that, but also to bring up

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.450
other people throughout our 

00:39:09.478 --> 00:39:10.004
communities and make their work 
visible as well. So I think when

00:39:10.005 --> 00:39:12.005
we combine those things 

00:39:14.704 --> 00:39:15.114
then we start to have a dialogue
between different folks from 

00:39:15.115 --> 00:39:18.805
different communities and 
pockets and that way we can 

00:39:18.806 --> 00:39:20.806
further along as a society.

00:39:22.826 --> 00:39:27.183
&gt;&gt; I have so many thoughts based
on what everyone is saying. Just

00:39:27.184 --> 00:39:29.184
to go back, I'm the port 
laureate 

00:39:32.643 --> 00:39:34.327
a of Brooklyn and Brooklyn is so
already so rich in history and 

00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:37.565
culture. Poetry is a pretty easy
sell where I come from because 

00:39:37.566 --> 00:39:39.566
everybody who wants to 

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.931
be a poet or who has a very rich
artistic life seems to find 

00:39:43.932 --> 00:39:45.932
themselves there, oftentimes I 
wonder why.

00:39:50.872 --> 00:39:51.277
Of course it's physically 
beautiful but also just a kind 

00:39:51.278 --> 00:39:53.514
of go back to something Adrian 
was saying about the history of 

00:39:55.358 --> 00:39:58.202
poets laureate in Brooklyn, 
there were three poets laureate 

00:39:58.203 --> 00:40:00.203
before me and they 

00:40:01.207 --> 00:40:01.871
were all male, so I was the 
first woman and also the first 

00:40:01.872 --> 00:40:03.872
person of color.

00:40:06.623 --> 00:40:09.483
So with that comes great 
responsibility, I think. I often

00:40:09.484 --> 00:40:13.550
ask myself, because Rob Casper 
and a few others that were on 

00:40:13.551 --> 00:40:16.206
that poetry committee who I was 
really lucky enough that they 

00:40:16.207 --> 00:40:18.207
reached out to me to apply for 

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.884
this position, I often ask 
myself as I'm sure some of the 

00:40:21.885 --> 00:40:24.524
other poets laureate have asked 
themselves too, is why me?

00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:29.617
And when I think back on it I 
think about the role of how 

00:40:29.618 --> 00:40:31.618
important it is to 

00:40:34.117 --> 00:40:36.117
be a person of color and how I 
want to 

00:40:37.988 --> 00:40:38.392
address not only diversity, and 
I think we can all speak to 

00:40:38.393 --> 00:40:40.393
this, but also diversity is so 
different from integration.

00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:50.160
New York, specifically Brooklyn 
is known as a very diverse place

00:40:50.487 --> 00:40:52.181
. Often that is the first word 
that comes to mind when people 

00:40:52.182 --> 00:40:54.635
speak of Brooklyn. And I think 
in the various communities 

00:40:58.284 --> 00:41:00.284
that I have just been honored to
just be 

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.740
welcomed into, I think that one 
of the 

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:07.650
greater challenges that I feel 
is how do we find, within the US

00:41:07.651 --> 00:41:09.926
overall true integration, and 
does that truly exist?

00:41:13.446 --> 00:41:15.446
And I think poetry is really one
of 

00:41:16.454 --> 00:41:18.454
those very rare spaces, and 
maybe it goes back to some 

00:41:20.334 --> 00:41:22.638
of the things that Tracy was 
mentioning in many of her 

00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:24.639
beautiful stories, it has so 
much to do with vulnerability.

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:27.728
We are each of us so very 
vulnerable at the core and I 

00:41:27.729 --> 00:41:30.598
think many of us walk around 
trying to keep it together, 

00:41:33.593 --> 00:41:34.907
trying to have an armor because 
the armor protects us and helps 

00:41:34.908 --> 00:41:39.596
us to function. So I think in 
the civic work that we all do, 

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.597
it takes a great amount of time 

00:41:42.695 --> 00:41:44.695
and effort to be able to break 
down 

00:41:45.697 --> 00:41:49.072
those walls and I find that 
poetry has the capacity to do 

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.073
that and I think that a lot of 
it 

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:55.195
has to do with the silences that
poetry just welcomes in. I think

00:41:55.196 --> 00:41:57.196
in the state where we are right 

00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:01.700
now within the US, so much of it
is about how much noise we can 

00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:03.701
make and how much we can sort of
show what it is that we know.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.869
But I think poetry kind of lays 
out the space of how much we 

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.497
don't know and how much beauty 
there is and how much we 

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.560
want to answer to all the 
curiosities in 

00:42:18.211 --> 00:42:18.414
the world and I think that civic
engagement and that curiosity 

00:42:18.415 --> 00:42:20.415
have so much to do with each 
other.

00:42:26.761 --> 00:42:28.761
&gt;&gt; I think the role of Port 
laureate,

00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:30.916
I'm the second one to hold the 
position and it's not state or 

00:42:30.917 --> 00:42:32.917
city but the entire county so 
it's a very weird 

00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:39.548
position to hold as far as what 
area are you in charge of, if 

00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:37.415
you will.

00:42:40.282 --> 00:42:42.282
I think that it validates the 
idea of following your passion.

00:42:45.412 --> 00:42:46.647
When I go into classrooms and I 
go speak with students the idea 

00:42:46.648 --> 00:42:49.689
of being a writer is a valid 
thing. Especially when teaching,

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.690
if it is a 

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.224
workshop in the community or in 
the classroom it's also about 

00:42:55.225 --> 00:42:57.663
allowing people the space to 
express their feelings and let 

00:42:57.664 --> 00:42:59.664
them know that their story is 
valid.

00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:03.386
And I think that Las Vegas as a 
city is also building its 

00:43:03.387 --> 00:43:05.387
identity and wants to tell its 
own stories.

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:08.266
Lots of people come in, write a 
story based on one or two years 

00:43:08.267 --> 00:43:10.267
of living 

00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:12.755
there, the people who are born 
and raised in the county or city

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:17.505
or area tell you how it is 
developed, how this casino went 

00:43:17.506 --> 00:43:19.730
down and came up and got 
rebuilt. How the street is still

00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:21.731
under construction.

00:43:24.379 --> 00:43:26.379
But the changes now where like a
lot of the legislation and the 

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.985
people in power shifted and 
there are a lot of women in 

00:43:28.986 --> 00:43:30.986
power right now in Nevada and 
it's cool.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:34.085
So I think the yearning to tell 
your own story but also the 

00:43:34.086 --> 00:43:36.086
permission to 

00:43:39.753 --> 00:43:40.817
tell your city's story, your 
county's story, your states 

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.818
story and going forward with 
that and I think that 

00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:44.714
encouragement that writing is 
valid and that people still read

00:43:44.715 --> 00:43:48.193
books.
[Laughter]

00:43:51.842 --> 00:43:54.708
&gt;&gt; So, poets make excellent role
models. And all of you are 

00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:56.709
excellent role models.

00:43:59.412 --> 00:44:01.412
And hopefully as we are all 

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.948
appreciating more deeply, poetry
has this incredible capacity to 

00:44:04.949 --> 00:44:07.801
spark conversation that can help
strengthen communities.

00:44:11.898 --> 00:44:14.552
Vogue, you were talking about 
the importance of storytelling, 

00:44:14.553 --> 00:44:16.553
preserving stories.

00:44:19.294 --> 00:44:21.294
What's interesting about the 
role of 

00:44:22.305 --> 00:44:25.335
poets laureate is that it sort 
of puts a poetic twist on 

00:44:25.336 --> 00:44:27.336
Shelley's notion that poets are 
the 

00:44:28.984 --> 00:44:33.117
unacknowledged legislators of 
the world by acknowledging that 

00:44:28.984 --> 00:44:32.885
fact. You know, right?
.&gt;&gt; by legislating.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.350
[Laughter]

00:44:40.452 --> 00:44:42.272
&gt;&gt; Were there civic themes that 
you were interested in 

00:44:42.273 --> 00:44:44.273
addressing during your term?

00:44:45.935 --> 00:44:47.935
Issues that you cared about in 
addition 

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.414
to diversity and representation?
Can you talk a little bit about 

00:44:51.415 --> 00:44:54.886
that and how you went about 
addressing those issues?

00:44:59.943 --> 00:45:01.703
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean one of the major
things I have been concerned 

00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:03.704
with is the ways in which 

00:45:06.572 --> 00:45:09.439
poetry is undervalued as a 
teaching tool and as a 

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.472
historical document and is an 
opportunity for expression in 

00:45:11.473 --> 00:45:13.473
the ways we have been talking 
about.

00:45:14.935 --> 00:45:17.597
So I came into it with the 
agenda that I wanted to try to 

00:45:17.598 --> 00:45:19.598
get in front of his many young 
people as I could and in 

00:45:22.462 --> 00:45:24.462
front of as many people who 
couldn't afford a workshop as I 

00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:26.163
could, as many people who never 
thought that poetry was for them

00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:28.164
as I could.

00:45:30.447 --> 00:45:32.447
To allow them to sort of dictate
what poetry could be.

00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:39.154
Of course in the great state of 
Indiana I don't know if I'm 

00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:37.154
supposed to share this, but 
whatever...

00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:39.392
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;...

00:45:44.956 --> 00:45:45.156
it's a government position so I 
had to sign a document that said

00:45:45.157 --> 00:45:47.157
I wouldn't criticize the state 
government.

00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:50.851
And so I'm not....
[Laughter]

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.470
&gt;&gt;...

00:45:54.939 --> 00:45:56.939
especially since the governor 
went to my high school.

00:46:01.643 --> 00:46:02.298
But you know there are some ways
in which it has actually been in

00:46:02.299 --> 00:46:06.567
all seriousness very useful to 
me, the state organizations have

00:46:06.568 --> 00:46:08.620
been a great help in trying to 
get to some of the communities 

00:46:10.043 --> 00:46:12.043
that I don't have the 
wherewithal to get to.

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.749
So I don't know if that is 
exactly what you're asking but 

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.750
that is what  my plan was.

00:46:19.648 --> 00:46:21.648
&gt;&gt; I meant to say a while ago, 
Oklahoma 

00:46:22.653 --> 00:46:25.760
was the fifth state to have a 
poet laureate. Violet McDougall 

00:46:25.761 --> 00:46:27.761
was named poet laureate in 1923 
so I need to recognize her.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.686
Many of you may have seen the 
huge coverage last year of the 

00:46:32.687 --> 00:46:34.687
school teacher 

00:46:36.743 --> 00:46:39.351
strikes in Oklahoma and one of 
the things that came out of that

00:46:39.352 --> 00:46:41.352
is that their union sold them 
out.

00:46:46.016 --> 00:46:49.364
And there's still 25-year-old 
Chuck's books. I went to a 

00:46:49.365 --> 00:46:51.838
school in Eve on Oklahoma where 
you can look down the 

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.839
floorboards through the 
crumbling foundation and see 

00:46:55.257 --> 00:46:55.898
the dirt beneath the school and 
that's where they were trying to

00:46:55.899 --> 00:47:01.035
teach and work. And that was not
unusual. Ceilings falling down. 

00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.036
Flooded classrooms.

00:47:05.535 --> 00:47:06.065
The teacher's had a good reason,
and they were not just striking 

00:47:06.066 --> 00:47:08.066
for pay.

00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:15.024
The teachers list pay was on the
last even though we lost 30,000 

00:47:15.217 --> 00:47:16.866
teachers in the last five years 
because they cannot make enough 

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.867
to eat on, what 

00:47:19.915 --> 00:47:22.557
they wanted was to have decent 
buildings and money  spent on 

00:47:22.558 --> 00:47:24.558
the children.

00:47:25.818 --> 00:47:28.055
So I do a lot of work in 
schools, but when I'm at the 

00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:30.289
schools I also, if I can get 
time to have an in-service with 

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.755
the teachers and even if there's
not time 

00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:39.273
for an in-service I leave them 
handouts 

00:47:41.121 --> 00:47:43.121
or lists of resources like 
teachers and writers 

00:47:46.908 --> 00:47:48.908
collaborative, in order to do 
what I 

00:47:49.922 --> 00:47:51.922
could do to

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.070
support them in their great 
mission

00:47:58.722 --> 00:48:01.033
in educating a populace whose 
parents don't really want them 

00:48:01.034 --> 00:48:03.034
to be educated or maybe the 

00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:05.912
state doesn't want them to be 
educated. I didn't have to sign 

00:48:05.913 --> 00:48:07.913
anything.
[Laughter]

00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:10.149
&gt;&gt;...

00:48:11.612 --> 00:48:13.437
and so that's what I try to do 
by working with schools is 

00:48:13.438 --> 00:48:15.438
actually leave 

00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:18.788
more for the teachers to help to
bring poetry.

00:48:27.346 --> 00:48:27.531
&gt;&gt; I have to choose two because 
throughout poetry we have to 

00:48:27.532 --> 00:48:29.582
address all kinds of issues, but
the two that I 

00:48:32.775 --> 00:48:34.775
think have bubbled up in the 
recent years have been 

00:48:37.972 --> 00:48:38.793
particularly our science 
literacy and our ability to 

00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:41.437
address climate change. So that 
is something I've been really 

00:48:45.905 --> 00:48:47.905
focused on in my work, is laying
out the issue, defining and 

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:51.430
laying out these solutions and 
how we can move forward.

00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.516
So I think that has been like a 
serious 

00:48:58.772 --> 00:49:00.772
focal point and in addition to 
that I 

00:49:03.239 --> 00:49:03.952
have also been focusing on 
returning to source, going back 

00:49:03.953 --> 00:49:05.953
to the 

00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:09.121
indigenous stories of Hawaii and
one in particular that I just 

00:49:09.476 --> 00:49:11.934
wanted to highlight. There was 
this creation chance that was 

00:49:15.446 --> 00:49:18.307
imposed in the 1800s, so I'm 
sorry it was the 1700s, and what

00:49:18.308 --> 00:49:20.308
it said 

00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:24.001
basically was at first was born 
darkness 

00:49:25.239 --> 00:49:25.550
and then was born see slime 
which is basically bacterial and

00:49:25.551 --> 00:49:27.551
then there was 

00:49:28.741 --> 00:49:30.741
the coral ponds and starfish

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.123
as well as plans and then born 
crustaceans and insects and then

00:49:34.124 --> 00:49:34.527
the fish you know where it's 
going, then were born the 

00:49:34.528 --> 00:49:36.528
reptiles and mammals and finally
humans so it's basically 

00:49:38.827 --> 00:49:40.463
evolution theory told in the 
1700s through native Hawaiian 

00:49:40.464 --> 00:49:42.464
chant oral traditions.

00:49:45.595 --> 00:49:47.595
, Just on the note of history, 
Darwin's 

00:49:48.596 --> 00:49:49.116
origin of species was published 
in the 1800 so we are talking 

00:49:49.117 --> 00:49:50.964
about roughly 100 years before 
the Western world got a hold of 

00:49:50.965 --> 00:49:52.965
it.

00:49:54.911 --> 00:49:56.911
So, but the cool thing is when I
go 

00:49:58.875 --> 00:50:00.283
into the schools or into these 
auditoriums and I tell that 

00:50:00.284 --> 00:50:02.284
story, we 

00:50:05.142 --> 00:50:06.203
begin to realize that native 
cultures have very significant 

00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:08.834
stories to tell and they are 
very much on point with science 

00:50:08.835 --> 00:50:11.474
and mental, logical capacities. 
And so it is the celebration of 

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:13.475
all 

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.350
different kinds of stories that 
have 

00:50:18.822 --> 00:50:20.822
allowed, has been another focus 
I guess in my work.

00:50:22.263 --> 00:50:24.263
&gt;&gt; So I became a mother for the 
first 

00:50:25.726 --> 00:50:27.726
time at right around the time I 
became 

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.679
poet laureate, and so I think 
that those two worlds really, 

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.512
they had to speak to each other.
For example, the night that I 

00:50:34.513 --> 00:50:36.513
was 

00:50:37.517 --> 00:50:39.794
inducted as the poet laureate of
Brooklyn I was actually carrying

00:50:39.795 --> 00:50:41.795
my baby in a baby Bjorn.

00:50:45.924 --> 00:50:50.190
So when I looked at, I still had
another child but when I looked 

00:50:45.924 --> 00:50:48.614
at my children I really wanted 
the role that I was fulfilling 

00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:50.615
as a poet laureate to 

00:50:51.617 --> 00:50:53.617
speak to not just them, but all 
children.

00:50:55.513 --> 00:50:59.713
Because when you are raising a 
child you get to grow along with

00:50:55.513 --> 00:50:58.365
them. You get to see the joy of 
them forming and understanding 

00:50:58.366 --> 00:51:00.366
words for the first 

00:51:01.621 --> 00:51:04.096
time, and the joy that is. And 
so I started to think about what

00:51:04.097 --> 00:51:06.097
is 

00:51:09.417 --> 00:51:10.876
it that I could do for children 
in many different communities 

00:51:10.877 --> 00:51:12.877
and one of the 

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.760
things which kind of goes back 
to something which was already 

00:51:15.761 --> 00:51:17.761
stated is 

00:51:18.978 --> 00:51:19.498
that I thought about teachers, 
and I thought about their jobs 

00:51:19.499 --> 00:51:21.499
and how 

00:51:22.501 --> 00:51:24.501
often and how much they gave 
over their 

00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:28.536
resources to try to provide 
books, to try to provide 

00:51:28.537 --> 00:51:30.583
everything needed so that these 
children could fortify their 

00:51:32.206 --> 00:51:34.206
language, fortify communication.

00:51:38.537 --> 00:51:39.594
So I developed programs to be 
able to bring authors into 

00:51:39.595 --> 00:51:41.657
schools. But not only that I 
developed also 

00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:46.163
diversity funds, so that these 
teachers don't have to spend 

00:51:46.164 --> 00:51:48.606
money out of their own pockets 
to be able to get students books

00:51:48.607 --> 00:51:50.854
that they felt that they needed 
that would diversify what they 

00:51:50.855 --> 00:51:52.855
were reading.

00:51:54.363 --> 00:51:56.630
And those authors also tried to 
diversify as well.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.169
There is one author called Kelly
Starling Lyons who also is a 

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.170
founding member of the Brown 

00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:07.921
bookshelf, which really promotes
the work of African-American 

00:52:07.922 --> 00:52:09.922
writers and 

00:52:12.002 --> 00:52:12.408
African-American stories, and 
she had this wonderful story 

00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:17.472
which she shared with the 
children that when she was eight

00:52:17.473 --> 00:52:19.547
years old she read a book for 
the first time called roll of 

00:52:19.548 --> 00:52:21.548
thunder hear 

00:52:23.005 --> 00:52:25.005
my cry and she said, it was the 
first 

00:52:26.259 --> 00:52:28.259
time that she saw an 
African-American 

00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:29.600
child on the cover of a book and
it convinced her that she too 

00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:32.252
could be an author. And so I 
think just hearing those 

00:52:36.135 --> 00:52:38.370
stories in many communities I 
think helps to really promote 

00:52:38.371 --> 00:52:43.082
this idea that these children 
can live this kind of life, that

00:52:43.083 --> 00:52:45.083
it is not outside of their 
reach.

00:52:47.757 --> 00:52:49.394
So I think in the work that I do
I'm also thinking about the 

00:52:49.395 --> 00:52:51.615
children and providing books for
them as well, and a 

00:52:54.868 --> 00:52:55.096
lot of that has to do, as 
everyone knows here, has to do 

00:52:55.097 --> 00:53:00.800
with fundraising. So much of the
arts now, as it always did, I 

00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:02.801
think suffers from not having 
enough funding.

00:53:05.063 --> 00:53:07.720
So a large part of the work that
I do, and which I think actually

00:53:07.721 --> 00:53:09.721
that you have addressed at the 
Academy of American 

00:53:13.019 --> 00:53:15.019
poets is really trying to find 
funding 

00:53:16.034 --> 00:53:18.110
in all corners and talking to 
people and I think that we 

00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.111
haven't really gotten to that 
yet, but that's also a 

00:53:22.389 --> 00:53:22.781
large part of our job, is not 
being only a speaker for an 

00:53:22.782 --> 00:53:24.847
toward the community but also 
how are we going to 

00:53:29.116 --> 00:53:31.351
realistically envision a project
and put it into actual being and

00:53:31.352 --> 00:53:33.352
push it forth into the world.

00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:40.882
&gt;&gt; To piggyback off of that, a 
lot of my internal missions

00:53:44.998 --> 00:53:49.264
were finish Bruce's work, which 
is the previous poet laureate of

00:53:44.998 --> 00:53:50.042
Clark County, finish what Bruce 
started, one of them is bringing

00:53:50.043 --> 00:53:52.969
the California schools program 
to Nevada in it was how are we 

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:54.970
going to get the 

00:53:56.044 --> 00:53:56.436
funding for this where we are 
making it so that poets can 

00:53:56.437 --> 00:53:58.437
live, can have a 

00:53:59.647 --> 00:54:00.350
sustainable lifestyle in which 
they are going to classrooms, 

00:54:00.351 --> 00:54:03.054
teaching poetry, being paid for 
their time and the lesson plans 

00:54:03.055 --> 00:54:05.288
they are creating and also 
living their lives and writing 

00:54:05.289 --> 00:54:08.138
books as well. And so it was the
one thing that Bruce 

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.915
didn't fully finish but all the 
proposals were there and I was 

00:54:13.916 --> 00:54:15.916
like I'm 

00:54:17.183 --> 00:54:17.588
going to take in and figure out 
where to submit it and get 

00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:19.589
funding for this particular 
program.

00:54:24.449 --> 00:54:26.449
And I thought about the proverb

00:54:30.153 --> 00:54:32.153
of lifting [inaudible] climb 
that I'm able to go in different

00:54:34.635 --> 00:54:35.923
places as a result of the 
position, this title, people 

00:54:35.924 --> 00:54:40.057
either know what it is or they 
cannot pronounce the word. One 

00:54:35.924 --> 00:54:37.924
of the other.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:44.363
So the places where they know 
what it is then more doors open 

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:42.230
for me.

00:54:46.374 --> 00:54:46.777
Cool, you let me in. If you want
me to speak at this I think we 

00:54:46.778 --> 00:54:48.778
should also bring this poet.

00:54:50.231 --> 00:54:50.435
Can we bring another poet in 
who's going to do this and it's 

00:54:50.436 --> 00:54:52.436
going to be 

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:54.986
this much, and being unafraid to
request funds and being unafraid

00:54:54.987 --> 00:55:00.130
to say no, this person spent 
time prepping before, during and

00:55:00.322 --> 00:55:01.945
after, we are having meetings 
and discussing how these lessons

00:55:01.946 --> 00:55:03.946
will play out.

00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:07.844
And I thought about my 
grandmother and 

00:55:09.057 --> 00:55:10.785
my grandmother at the time was 
living in California still and 

00:55:10.786 --> 00:55:12.786
we cannot convince her to move.

00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:16.899
And I was like well I need to 
get my grandma fix. So I'm going

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.139
to take poetry into nursing 
homes. And I found a project 

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.140
that was founded 

00:55:23.788 --> 00:55:25.788
by Gary Gleason, Glassner,

00:55:27.306 --> 00:55:29.306
so Gary already had a program in
place 

00:55:30.383 --> 00:55:32.224
funded by the NEA that brought 
poetry into nursing homes and 

00:55:32.225 --> 00:55:35.101
retirement homes, and they had 
research there about 

00:55:38.105 --> 00:55:38.805
nonverbal communication, about 
how sometimes people aren't able

00:55:38.806 --> 00:55:41.853
to speak but they are still able
to listen, about how a person 

00:55:41.854 --> 00:55:43.854
can hear a poem that 

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.604
they had to remember if they 
don't remember the street they 

00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:49.605
grew up on or their 

00:55:52.235 --> 00:55:53.312
daughter's name or a poem of 
their daughters if they hear it 

00:55:53.313 --> 00:55:55.313
will come back and that moment 
you know, is a 

00:55:59.069 --> 00:56:00.498
priceless moment and my poetry 
staff, that's really I don't 

00:56:00.499 --> 00:56:02.499
know, like the 

00:56:04.374 --> 00:56:06.374
building of community and 
creating this 

00:56:08.204 --> 00:56:10.098
close-knit community where we 
are all cheering for each other 

00:56:10.099 --> 00:56:12.560
I can name you 10 authors in the
past two years who have 

00:56:12.561 --> 00:56:15.237
published books in my community.
That had the guts to go forward 

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:17.238
and 

00:56:18.801 --> 00:56:20.637
said okay I'm going to put a 
book out but everyone was 

00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:23.883
editing everyone else. Did you 
read Rodney's book, did you read

00:56:23.884 --> 00:56:26.538
the first book, did you see 
Angela's cover. What? everyone 

00:56:26.539 --> 00:56:29.207
was cheering for each other and 
these poets came into my home 

00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:31.208
and 

00:56:33.083 --> 00:56:35.083
read poets to my grandmother and
my 

00:56:36.087 --> 00:56:38.431
grandmother moved into a home 
and she made one of my friends 

00:56:38.432 --> 00:56:40.432
read his poem again. She said it
was too short, read it again.

00:56:43.699 --> 00:56:44.976
And it was after a really rough 
day and she came back, she was 

00:56:44.977 --> 00:56:46.977
back that day.

00:56:49.246 --> 00:56:51.246
So that integration of family, 

00:56:52.267 --> 00:56:53.124
community and working artists 
creating something more for 

00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:55.125
ourselves and connecting.

00:56:57.424 --> 00:56:59.424
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to follow up on

00:57:00.718 --> 00:57:02.718
something that Vogue said, first
of all 

00:57:03.804 --> 00:57:04.006
that is so great what you were 
saying but I was thinking about 

00:57:04.007 --> 00:57:06.007
this idea of creating access, 
right?

00:57:08.097 --> 00:57:10.097
Like the way that one of the 

00:57:13.147 --> 00:57:15.147
opportunities that we are given 
is

00:57:17.269 --> 00:57:17.462
to open up doors around us I was
talking about these various 

00:57:17.463 --> 00:57:19.463
organizations that are kind 
enough to 

00:57:21.908 --> 00:57:23.908
support me, and they don't know 
the performance community in 

00:57:24.848 --> 00:57:26.848
Indianapolis necessarily but 
they do now.

00:57:28.953 --> 00:57:29.345
They don't know of these various
different community groups that 

00:57:29.346 --> 00:57:31.420
are doing writing at the library
on Tuesdays but they are 

00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:34.951
starting to learn about them 
now. So one of the things that 

00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:36.952
we are able 

00:57:39.361 --> 00:57:40.701
to do as we get wired in this to
bring everybody, rising tides. 

00:57:40.702 --> 00:57:42.702
I'm so glad that you mentioned 
that.

00:57:47.162 --> 00:57:48.432
&gt;&gt; I want to underscore 
something Tina, you said, but 

00:57:48.433 --> 00:57:50.433
also first 

00:57:51.929 --> 00:57:53.929
appreciate what we are hearing 
about 

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.930
poets in civic positions making 
a difference in the 

00:57:58.268 --> 00:58:00.268
lives of teachers, making a 
difference in the 

00:58:03.561 --> 00:58:06.275
lives of seniors who are in 
institutional settings, making a

00:58:06.478 --> 00:58:07.695
difference in the lives of 
people trying to understand 

00:58:07.696 --> 00:58:09.696
environmental devastation.

00:58:11.601 --> 00:58:14.257
The work that laureates are 
doing, poets laureate are doing 

00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:17.723
on the state and local level is 
largely unfunded. I'm just 

00:58:17.724 --> 00:58:19.724
curious.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.805
How many of you have a stipend 
supporting the work that you are

00:58:21.806 --> 00:58:23.806
doing?

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:29.122
And I'm guessing Tracy not 
included that it is around five 

00:58:29.123 --> 00:58:34.473
to $10,000. No?
&gt;&gt; It's 250 per month.

00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:40.703
&gt;&gt; It is now 2500...

00:58:43.797 --> 00:58:45.797
2500 is your personal stipend 
and 7500 is for programming.

00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:52.990
&gt;&gt; Most of the positions across 
the US don't have an honorarium 

00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:54.805
attached, as you have seen, and 
if they do it is externally 

00:58:54.806 --> 00:58:56.806
modest.

00:58:59.653 --> 00:59:00.516
Nonetheless again as you are 
hearing folks are traveling 

00:59:00.517 --> 00:59:03.160
around the state. They are doing
outreach. They are buying books,

00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:05.161
they are supporting teachers.

00:59:06.466 --> 00:59:08.466
Just a public service 
announcement...

00:59:09.123 --> 00:59:11.123
[Laughter]

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.515
&gt;&gt; These positions are run 
through the 

00:59:16.281 --> 00:59:16.496
governor's office, the mayor's 
office, the state humanities 

00:59:16.497 --> 00:59:18.497
Council.

00:59:20.361 --> 00:59:22.786
I encourage you to reach out, 
find out who is running the 

00:59:22.787 --> 00:59:24.787
poets laureate 

00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:29.727
positions near you where your 
family members might live, get 

00:59:29.728 --> 00:59:32.610
involved, support them. They 
need it. But now to some good 

00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:34.611
news.

00:59:36.496 --> 00:59:39.171
I'm sure, and I hope that you 
may have heard that poetry is 

00:59:39.172 --> 00:59:41.172
booming.

00:59:44.286 --> 00:59:45.945
I think we have some friends 
from the national endowment for 

00:59:45.946 --> 00:59:48.410
the arts in the house
[Applause]

00:59:49.845 --> 00:59:51.845
&gt;&gt; There they are.

00:59:55.123 --> 00:59:57.123
[Applause]

01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:04.619
&gt;&gt; I know in the work that I do 
that in the past five years the 

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.480
interest in poetry has been 
growing year over year. We run a

01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:09.481
website poets.

01:00:13.338 --> 01:00:15.424
org and have a daily poetry 
series and a day that Tracy is 

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:15.629
curating this month for us. 
Double digit growth year after 

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:17.630
year.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:19.553
And yet, we would still see 
these bleak headlines about 

01:00:19.554 --> 01:00:22.215
poetry. No one cares. Poetry is 
dead.

01:00:25.936 --> 01:00:27.958
And we are thinking... not from 
what we can see.

01:00:32.657 --> 01:00:32.860
Well, thanks to the national 
endowment for the arts, no one 

01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:34.861
has to believe me.

01:00:37.381 --> 01:00:39.412
We actually have a study, and 
arts participation study that 

01:00:39.413 --> 01:00:41.413
was released in 

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.699
the fall that demonstrated in 
the past five years poetry 

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.755
readership in the US has 
doubled. Doubled.

01:00:50.406 --> 01:00:52.406
[Applause]

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:57.937
&gt;&gt; And what's very exciting 
about this is that the largest 

01:00:57.938 --> 01:01:00.174
growth is with young people, 
particularly young people of 

01:01:03.628 --> 01:01:05.628
color, and I should note, the 
growth in 

01:01:08.086 --> 01:01:10.641
readership is the same in urban 
and rural communities. Can I be 

01:01:10.642 --> 01:01:14.527
fact checked on that. Jessica? 
Yeah.

01:01:20.588 --> 01:01:20.913
So to Tracy's point, when people
are asking questions, well do 

01:01:20.914 --> 01:01:23.374
people really read poetry? 
People are reading poetry 

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:25.375
everywhere.

01:01:28.802 --> 01:01:29.865
I wonder in your roles, if you 
are feeling the swell of 

01:01:29.866 --> 01:01:31.866
excitement, 

01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:33.930
and if you feel like your work 
has contributed to this over the

01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:35.931
past couple years?

01:01:37.601 --> 01:01:40.441
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's funny about that
question that poetry is still 

01:01:40.442 --> 01:01:42.442
working or still alive, they 
never ask poets that.

01:01:45.562 --> 01:01:47.562
It's sort of thrown out to 
somebody else kind of thing.

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:56.601
One thing that I actually think 
is true and in Indiana certainly

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:54.971
I would love to take credit for 
the work that is happening but 

01:01:54.972 --> 01:01:56.972
it's already happening when I 
get there.

01:01:58.237 --> 01:02:00.237
There are already people waiting
to 

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:01.985
write poems, already people 
interested in reading poems and 

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:04.971
have just been creating

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.721
spaces to help them do that. You
know how quickly somebody will 

01:02:08.722 --> 01:02:10.957
snatch the mic when they have 
something they want to say. It's

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:13.600
like the under 30 crowd or 
something. They found poetry and

01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:18.266
they have invested in it in this
really beautiful way. So like I 

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.267
said, I will take all the 

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:22.539
credit I can get but it was 
sitting there in Franklin 

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.033
already. It was in Bloomington 
already. It was in Indianapolis 

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:29.034
already waiting for an outlet.

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:33.952
&gt;&gt; I have to say the Oklahoma 
poetry community has been strong

01:02:33.953 --> 01:02:35.953
since about 1972.

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.691
And that's not just in the urban
areas. There's always writers 

01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:42.692
groups, there 

01:02:44.157 --> 01:02:46.157
are five or six monthly open 
mics with 

01:02:47.419 --> 01:02:50.071
featured readers in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma City, Shawnee, Lawton, 

01:02:50.072 --> 01:02:52.072
all around the state and we all 
know each other. We are family.

01:02:56.203 --> 01:02:58.452
Tracy just attended our family 
reunion at the creative writing 

01:02:58.453 --> 01:03:00.453
conference in Oklahoma.

01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:03.762
And so I had that to build from.

01:03:08.713 --> 01:03:10.328
But I have seen something 
different, is I don't have to 

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:13.195
start by convincing people they 
don't have to be afraid of 

01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:17.314
poetry anymore. That used to be 
the opening part of my thing. 

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:19.315
Well I can't...

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.435
they would show up for some 
reason, they are curious but my 

01:03:23.436 --> 01:03:25.876
whole thing is you don't have to
be afraid of poetry. So I think 

01:03:25.877 --> 01:03:27.877
it is being taught better.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.005
But I'm also going to give a 
huge amount of props to 

01:03:34.006 --> 01:03:36.006
librarians.

01:03:39.046 --> 01:03:41.046
I think a lot of the comeback of
poetry is from librarians and I 

01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:45.697
wouldn't even be a poet if I 
hadn't fallen in love with a 

01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:47.698
librarian.

01:03:48.717 --> 01:03:50.717
I see them

01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:52.243
they are not just putting out 
fiction anymore, they put it out

01:03:52.244 --> 01:03:56.738
front, they put kids poetry out 
front and hand it out. So thank 

01:03:56.739 --> 01:03:58.988
you librarians, all of you.
[Applause]

01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:04.225
&gt;&gt; I absolutely feel the same 
energy.

01:04:05.917 --> 01:04:07.917
And for a number, all these 
different 

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:09.190
programs out there whether it is
poetry out loud, whether it is 

01:04:09.191 --> 01:04:11.191
the slam poetry 

01:04:12.194 --> 01:04:14.194
scene

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:19.352
, whether it's poets in the 
schools, artists in the schools 

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.352
and teachers 

01:04:18.436 --> 01:04:18.639
taking it into their own hands 
when they know that there are 

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.283
like standards they have to 
adhere to, did I miss any 

01:04:22.906 --> 01:04:24.906
programs okay...

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:28.163
teachers taking it into their 
own 

01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:30.457
hands, when poetry isn't really 
like a standard that is 

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:33.296
highlighted in what they have to
teach they go ahead and take the

01:04:33.297 --> 01:04:36.564
opportunity, they really take it
upon themselves to teach this 

01:04:36.565 --> 01:04:38.195
stuff and when we get brought 
into the schools it's like an 

01:04:38.196 --> 01:04:41.107
extra special thing for the kids
because they 

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:44.778
have been already immersed in it
and we can take them even 

01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:47.419
deeper. So I have noticed just 
the spirit of 

01:04:51.504 --> 01:04:53.504
poetry is very much alive and we
are 

01:04:54.521 --> 01:04:56.632
very much a part of it and like 
you were saying though, we are 

01:04:56.633 --> 01:04:58.633
just writing the wave.

01:05:01.961 --> 01:05:02.150
I mean, the energy is already 
there and it's breaking, where 

01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:04.807
do you want to be on the wave. 
You want to carve it up, do you 

01:05:04.808 --> 01:05:06.808
want to 

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.872
be in front or on the back in 
the barrel, what pose are you 

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.295
making, so for me it's like I do
this poetry show every month, 

01:05:15.296 --> 01:05:19.576
it's like a poetry slam and I 
rarely perform at it. Maybe like

01:05:19.577 --> 01:05:21.577
three times out of the year.

01:05:23.733 --> 01:05:26.379
And everybody always asks me how
come you don't really perform 

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.442
all that much and I'm like did 
you see the sign-up sheet? there

01:05:28.443 --> 01:05:30.443
isfor me.

01:05:34.317 --> 01:05:36.191
I want other people to get the 
chance to be at the mic because 

01:05:36.192 --> 01:05:37.425
it's about them. It's about the 
voices of our community and 

01:05:37.426 --> 01:05:39.426
highlighting that.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.105
And so that is how strong the 
scene is of poetry.

01:05:46.624 --> 01:05:50.557
Don't listen to those other 
folks who are saying poetry is 

01:05:46.624 --> 01:05:51.500
dead. You know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I completely 

01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:53.501
agree.

01:05:55.166 --> 01:05:57.385
I feel if anybody hasn't been to
the Apollo theater yet in 

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.386
Harlem, you really 

01:06:00.386 --> 01:06:03.292
have to go because I think the 
ways in which I grew up 

01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:08.691
with poetry

01:06:16.078 --> 01:06:18.078
as like a typical sort of

01:06:20.463 --> 01:06:22.463
studious person you know, 
pouring over 

01:06:23.472 --> 01:06:25.472
my books, writing it in a 
notebook and I think when I 

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.762
started becoming very active in 
this role I was invited to so 

01:06:30.763 --> 01:06:34.011
many different spaces so when I 
went to the Apollo theater ISA 

01:06:34.012 --> 01:06:36.288
poetry lifted up in a way I 
haven't seen before even 

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:38.985
sometimes in the most 
established situations where 

01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:41.610
established poets were appearing
we would see like 50 or 60 and 

01:06:41.611 --> 01:06:43.672
consider it packed. When I went 
to the Apollo theater there 

01:06:46.674 --> 01:06:47.360
were hundreds of people and 
everybody was dancing. This was 

01:06:47.361 --> 01:06:50.248
before the show started. 
Everybody was dancing in the 

01:06:50.249 --> 01:06:52.077
aisles and everybody was in 
these choreographed dances and I

01:06:52.078 --> 01:06:54.078
had never seen that before, and 
then since that time I have seen

01:06:55.138 --> 01:06:57.174
more and more working with 
organizations such as urban Word

01:06:57.175 --> 01:06:59.205
NYC and the community word 
project. There are so many 

01:06:59.206 --> 01:07:01.206
organizations that when I go 
back to your question was how 

01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:02.912
much of it really has to do with
the poet laureate and their 

01:07:02.913 --> 01:07:04.913
role, so much of 

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:10.257
it, as everybody seems to be 
saying it all kind of  existed 

01:07:10.258 --> 01:07:12.258
before I was there.

01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:13.793
I'm really just witnessing all 
of it and absorbing it and 

01:07:13.794 --> 01:07:16.244
hoping to take that kind of 
energy and bring it somewhere as

01:07:16.245 --> 01:07:18.245
they are sharing their story.

01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:23.363
But I go back to this, I don't 
know why this s

01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:27.540
story has stuck with me I went 
to visit China a while back on a

01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:29.541
literary trip to 

01:07:30.634 --> 01:07:33.525
visit different communities in 
China and we were talking about 

01:07:33.526 --> 01:07:35.776
memorization and reciting poems 
and one person said every 

01:07:39.042 --> 01:07:41.042
Chinese person really has a poem
in their head.

01:07:43.136 --> 01:07:43.337
And I wouldn't say that that, I 
would not say that was the case 

01:07:43.338 --> 01:07:45.789
wherever I traveled but she felt
that in China that it was the 

01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.790
case.

01:07:50.485 --> 01:07:52.485
And I said why do you think, why
do you think that is the case?

01:07:56.657 --> 01:07:56.859
Is it because in any place where
we experience hardship really 

01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.124
one of the only things that we 
have to keep us going is the 

01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:02.370
written word? Is the word?

01:08:06.031 --> 01:08:06.450
That is the thing even beyond 
money and resources we have that

01:08:06.451 --> 01:08:08.451
one thing.

01:08:10.478 --> 01:08:12.478
So I think about that now in 
terms of the 

01:08:14.978 --> 01:08:16.681
question, why is there a surge, 
especially in the last few years

01:08:16.682 --> 01:08:18.682
we are experiencing a 
particularly 

01:08:20.558 --> 01:08:23.433
challenging time in our history,
and eyewitness, and I work with 

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:25.434
so many 

01:08:27.663 --> 01:08:28.523
young people who feel no shame. 
No holds barred. Just want to 

01:08:28.524 --> 01:08:30.977
express themselves now. They 
feel that it's the time and they

01:08:33.415 --> 01:08:35.882
feel really emboldened to be 
able to push back and be able to

01:08:35.883 --> 01:08:40.607
open up about what they are 
feeling right now and I think it

01:08:40.608 --> 01:08:42.608
has everything to do with the 
moment we are living in now.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.700
&gt;&gt; There's also the magic of 
social media.

01:08:50.413 --> 01:08:52.413
So you know, right now if you 
walk into 

01:08:55.893 --> 01:08:57.893
a Barnes and Noble Ruby is on 
the end.

01:08:59.366 --> 01:09:02.727
You have to walk past her to get
her books. And I had students 

01:09:02.728 --> 01:09:04.728
who are like you 

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:07.043
know who Ruby core is and I was 
like what are you talking about.

01:09:07.044 --> 01:09:09.044
This is a couple years ago.

01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:11.959
So my students put me onto these
writers who had major 

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960
followings, who were extremely 
secretive.

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:18.667
I still have not seen a picture 
of [inaudible] Heed.

01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:23.071
I want to know what she looks 
like. I want her to have a 

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:25.072
Wikipedia page that has more 
information on it.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.195
But she exists. So these small 
bites, these micro poems are 

01:09:29.196 --> 01:09:31.196
saying what people need for the 

01:09:32.405 --> 01:09:34.405
quick moment and

01:09:36.317 --> 01:09:36.519
the fact that these baby commute
computers that we walk around 

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.148
all day in our pockets and your 
scrolling through but at a 

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:40.149
certain moment you catch a line 
that speaks to you.

01:09:42.025 --> 01:09:44.299
And I think actually it's 
technically make people do close

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.575
reading because if you only have
this line that is the only 

01:09:49.578 --> 01:09:51.578
line you can look at

01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:56.618
and you're like yeah, this is 
deep, okay why I'm going to send

01:09:56.619 --> 01:09:56.823
this to, you show it to your 
friend, but it's one line. The 

01:09:56.824 --> 01:09:58.824
poem is probably longer. But you
know, you got that one line.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:07.269
So I think about that and that 
the world of publishing has 

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.928
changed, soapself-publishing has
become a more respected thing. 

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:11.929
The audiobook.

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:15.449
I have friends who are recording
books right now like you want to

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:18.300
read one of my poems and I'm 
like yeah I will read a poem for

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.592
your audiobook. Cool. But we can
do with our phones.

01:10:25.025 --> 01:10:25.709
Or you can buy materials, like 
poetry has already been a really

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:27.710
accessible artform.

01:10:33.265 --> 01:10:33.873
Pen and paper. It's not the same
way as painting or other things 

01:10:33.874 --> 01:10:35.874
like I scribbled my poem that 
I'm going to read tonight on my 

01:10:36.326 --> 01:10:38.766
paper because my phone was 
dying. Because of poetry. And 

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.767
it's always there.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:47.746
And it's in the dialect and the 
conversations we had and the 

01:10:47.747 --> 01:10:49.747
metaphors we use every day. Your
grandma's language, your great 

01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:52.804
grandma's language and Oklahoma,
even 

01:10:54.257 --> 01:10:56.257
the simple phrases of longtailed
cat over a rocking chair.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:01.255
These are all images that live 
in so I think, yeah, publishing 

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:04.120
has changed, accessibility, the 
magic of social media and poems 

01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:06.121
are everywhere. Everywhere.

01:11:08.843 --> 01:11:10.843
It's so great.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:16.602
&gt;&gt; Before we close out, we'd 
love for each of you to  share a

01:11:16.603 --> 01:11:18.603
poem if you would.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.560
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Whatever you feel like.

01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:33.581
&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm not going 
to share one of my poems.

01:11:36.842 --> 01:11:39.486
I want to share a poem by an 
Indiana poet named Etheridge 

01:11:39.487 --> 01:11:41.487
Knight that I think is really 
important.

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:45.395
And if you don't know, Mr. 
Knight, I brought his book, one 

01:11:45.396 --> 01:11:47.396
of his 

01:11:48.496 --> 01:11:50.496
books so you could get a prop, 
it's called haiku.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:52.439
And there are nine of them but 
I'm not going to read the 

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440
numbers.

01:11:58.182 --> 01:11:59.792
Haiku. Eastern guard tower 
glints in sunset, convex rest 

01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:01.793
like lizards on rocks.

01:12:05.095 --> 01:12:07.784
The piano man is stingy at 3 AM,
his songs drop like plum. 

01:12:07.785 --> 01:12:09.785
Morning sun slants sell.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.333
Drunks stagger like cripple 
flies on jailhouse floor.

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:19.042
To write a blues song is to 
regiment riots and pluck gems 

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.043
from Graves.

01:12:25.866 --> 01:12:29.599
Hebert pecan trees slips a 
pencil shadow down a moonlit 

01:12:25.866 --> 01:12:27.866
snow slope.

01:12:31.162 --> 01:12:33.424
The falling snowflakes cannot 
blunt the heart aches nor match 

01:12:33.425 --> 01:12:35.425
the steel stillness.

01:12:38.712 --> 01:12:40.712
Under moon shadows a tall 
boy/his knife 

01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:44.167
and slice Starbright ice.

01:12:45.216 --> 01:12:47.216
In the August grass struck by 
the last 

01:12:50.456 --> 01:12:52.456
rays of sun the cracked teacup 
screams

01:12:55.063 --> 01:12:58.929
. Making jazz swing in 17 
syllables ain't no Square poets 

01:12:55.063 --> 01:12:57.732
job. Thank you.

01:13:02.387 --> 01:13:04.387
[Applause]

01:13:16.243 --> 01:13:19.334
&gt;&gt; I was a actually asked to 
write a civic poem upon my 

01:13:19.335 --> 01:13:22.203
appointment as poet laureate. 
That's what I brought to read. 

01:13:22.204 --> 01:13:24.204
You may need to know only one 
thing.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:28.912
There is a word in here, wewoka 
from the Muscogee Creek language

01:13:28.913 --> 01:13:30.913
from 

01:13:31.969 --> 01:13:33.969
my hometown and it means barking
water.

01:13:38.578 --> 01:13:40.650
Directive, you birth me land of 
arrow and home, your red wrought

01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:42.651
fossilized deep in my bones.

01:13:44.355 --> 01:13:46.355
Near a roll mailbox a young or 
whatever 

01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:51.051
calls sweethearts kiss under 
mistletoe, 

01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:57.658
a tire swing spins in a shadowed
Grove searching horizon for a 

01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:55.525
child long gone.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:14:00.041
Down a trail on the Prairie worn
by 

01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:03.951
Buffalo glimpse of a gray fox at
the 

01:14:06.858 --> 01:14:08.858
bottom of a slope Hunter sets 
his sights 

01:14:10.076 --> 01:14:12.076
on a white tail dough, venison's
better than poverty's half 

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:17.853
loaf scissor tail things on a 
branch of black willow, coyote 

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:19.854
yips in the hills, a comical 
robe.

01:14:23.571 --> 01:14:26.013
Alone in sere pastor under skies
blue bowl crow call a code that 

01:14:26.014 --> 01:14:28.014
catches in my throat.

01:14:30.097 --> 01:14:32.097
Under a flat Yellowstone up a 
dusty red 

01:14:35.825 --> 01:14:37.825
road plant my ashes near Wewoka 
on a dusty plateau

01:14:41.486 --> 01:14:43.486
[Applause]

01:14:51.849 --> 01:14:53.849
&gt;&gt; So this was inspired by the 
movement 

01:14:56.781 --> 01:14:58.001
toward planting food in our 
gardens and also the 

01:14:58.002 --> 01:15:01.910
sustainability movement.
&gt;&gt; We've been growing a garden 

01:15:01.911 --> 01:15:03.911
around our place.

01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:07.622
We don't have much space but 
we've been working the soil 

01:15:07.623 --> 01:15:09.623
beneath our feet watching the 
green sprout over the 

01:15:12.158 --> 01:15:12.340
concrete watching the vines 
rewrite the graffiti on the 

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.341
walls.

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:19.296
And we know that this garden is 
a simple symbol that there is so

01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:22.291
much more to be done in this 
world

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:30.945
and sometimes it gets 
overwhelming but we're taking 

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:27.683
responsibility for what we can 
control and so we are starting 

01:15:27.684 --> 01:15:30.727
by planting seeds and 
caretaking, making the ecosystem

01:15:30.728 --> 01:15:33.363
thrive, watching the earth come 
alive, reflecting on the way we 

01:15:33.364 --> 01:15:35.364
are living our daily lives.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:39.072
See we've been growing a garden 
overtime so when we step outside

01:15:39.073 --> 01:15:41.514
we can visualize what green 
energy looks like to remind 

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:43.515
ourselves that we know different
from the trees.

01:15:46.603 --> 01:15:46.807
That all the energy we need can 
come from the sun, the wind, the

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.808
sea and the 

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.811
infinite

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.183
warmth of geothermal heat. And 
we know another world is 

01:15:54.184 --> 01:15:56.184
possible and no matter how 
hopeless anyone of us 

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:57.649
feels this movement is real that
our convictions lead to 

01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:59.650
legislation, lead to 

01:16:00.661 --> 01:16:02.661
conservation

01:16:10.176 --> 01:16:10.377
that technology must serve 
ecology and so this garden is 

01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:10.581
how we redefine the boundary 
lines between us and the global 

01:16:10.582 --> 01:16:11.176
community. We have come to learn
that there's no separation that 

01:16:11.177 --> 01:16:13.853
every nation on this blue planet
is symbiotically fused that 

01:16:14.056 --> 01:16:14.256
everything we do affect some 
part of you so we have been 

01:16:14.257 --> 01:16:16.914
inspired to limit our impact, to
leave our surroundings, sorry 

01:16:18.947 --> 01:16:21.622
about that, leave our 
surroundings better off then 

01:16:21.623 --> 01:16:24.085
when we arrived. We have vowed 
to reverse the destructive tide 

01:16:24.086 --> 01:16:26.943
before we die. See we've been 
growing a garden for our 

01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:31.957
children, leaving a better world
for them to 

01:16:33.485 --> 01:16:34.389
live in, teaching them to care 
take what they have been given. 

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.390
Show them to take a stand for 

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.685
sustainability how to find the 
balance between progress and 

01:16:39.686 --> 01:16:41.573
preservation, guide the way to 
self reliant revolution you see 

01:16:41.574 --> 01:16:44.233
this garden is for our children,
this garden is our pledge to 

01:16:44.234 --> 01:16:46.234
them.

01:16:49.306 --> 01:16:51.306
[Applause]

01:17:01.262 --> 01:17:03.262
&gt;&gt; So, this poem is also by 
another 

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.252
poet, named Eileen Mylesfor the 
work that she does and I found  

01:17:09.253 --> 01:17:11.253
and I wanted to thank Jenna had 
of time 

01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:15.391
this poem actually on the 
Academy of American poets site 

01:17:15.392 --> 01:17:16.657
and ever since I found it it's 
been on my desktop and I read it

01:17:16.658 --> 01:17:18.694
every day. Notebook, 1981.

01:17:22.172 --> 01:17:24.172
I was so willing to pull a page 
out of 

01:17:25.647 --> 01:17:27.647
my notebook, a day, several 
bright days 

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.380
and live in them as if I was 
only alive, 

01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:35.975
thirsty, timeless, young enough 
to do this one more time, to 

01:17:35.976 --> 01:17:37.976
dare to have nothing so much to 

01:17:39.232 --> 01:17:41.249
lose and to feel that potential 
dying of the self in the light 

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.250
as the only thing 

01:17:46.099 --> 01:17:47.639
I thought that was spiritual  
possible and because I had no 

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.322
other way to call that mind, I 
called it poetry, 

01:17:53.578 --> 01:17:55.578
but it was/and time and bread 
and 

01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:59.487
friends frightened and free 
enough to want to have another 

01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:02.163
day that way, tear another page.
Thank you.

01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:09.209
[Applause]

01:18:17.296 --> 01:18:19.296
&gt;&gt; 

01:18:22.429 --> 01:18:24.429
It's how you get funding.

01:18:26.492 --> 01:18:29.134
This poem is called when the 
poem is done. When the poem is 

01:18:29.135 --> 01:18:31.575
done. Never. When you say so.

01:18:34.665 --> 01:18:36.665
When a stranger calls it can.

01:18:38.598 --> 01:18:40.215
When it's inspiration lives 
behind its eyelids, under its 

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.216
tongue.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:45.501
When the poem is lifted by a 
self-made 

01:18:46.776 --> 01:18:49.423
breeze becomes aspiration in a 
room of your peers when it 

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:52.065
illuminates you, midline, when 
the poem is rooted in 

01:18:55.077 --> 01:18:58.633
itself, fruit bearing, Apple 
Blossom filling the wind 

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:00.634
beckoning hello and its leaves 

01:19:01.944 --> 01:19:03.944
all live as midday Boons

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.580
[Applause]

01:19:21.948 --> 01:19:23.974
&gt;&gt; So thinking about the notion 
of how we might choose to get 

01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:25.975
lost together and 

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:29.353
thi listening to us I realized 
maybe I will rephrase that. We 

01:19:29.354 --> 01:19:31.354
are lost.

01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:34.376
We are lost and I think poetry 
is a way of 

01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:39.002
acknowledging that and working 
together. So this is a poem I 

01:19:39.003 --> 01:19:41.003
think that comes out of that 
realization. An old story.

01:19:48.398 --> 01:19:50.604
We were made to understand it 
would be terrible.

01:19:53.609 --> 01:19:55.609
Every small want

01:19:57.833 --> 01:19:59.833
, every niggling urge, every 
hate, 

01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:07.490
swollen to a kind of epic wind, 
livid, the land and ravaged like

01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.491
a rageful 

01:20:14.029 --> 01:20:16.029
dream, the worst in us having 
taken over 

01:20:19.512 --> 01:20:21.512
and broken the rest utterly down

01:20:25.567 --> 01:20:27.567
along age pastsed, when at last 
we know 

01:20:31.412 --> 01:20:34.242
how little would survive us, how
little we had mended or built 

01:20:34.243 --> 01:20:36.243
that 

01:20:37.247 --> 01:20:39.247
was not now lost

01:20:43.042 --> 01:20:45.691
, something large and old awoke 
and then our singing brought on 

01:20:45.692 --> 01:20:47.692
a different manner of weather.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:55.265
Then animals long believed gone 
crept 

01:20:58.548 --> 01:21:01.224
down from trees, we took new 
stock of one another. We wept.

01:21:05.526 --> 01:21:07.787
To be reminded of such color. 
Thank you.

01:21:13.031 --> 01:21:15.031
[Applause]

01:21:54.988 --> 01:21:56.988
[Cheers and applause]

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:09.589
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you to all of our
poets laureate and of course to 

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:11.590

Benka.

You can leave them on your 
chairs, you can leave them on 

01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:27.621
the tables in the back.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:31.383
Speaking of the back, as you 
walk out to your left you can go

01:22:31.384 --> 01:22:33.384

01:22:36.884 --> 01:22:39.771
some books, have them sign them,

01:22:39.772 --> 01:22:42.639
them and loved tonight. We hope 
to see you back here in 

01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:46.673
