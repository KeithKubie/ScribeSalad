00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.480
In the last video we learned
a little bit about

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.130
photosynthesis.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.800
And we know in very general
terms, it's the process where

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.580
we start off with photons and
water and carbon dioxide, and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.219
we use that energy in the
photons to fix the carbon.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.680
And now, this idea of carbon
fixation is essentially taking

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.390
carbon in the gaseous form, in
this case carbon dioxide, and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.530
fixing it into a solid
structure.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.200
And that solid structure we fix
it into is a carbohydrate.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.390
The first end-product of
photosynthesis was this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.830
3-carbon chain, this
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.880
But then you can use that to
build up glucose or any other

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.040
carbohydrate.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.630
So, with that said, let's try to
dig a little bit deeper and

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.710
understand what's actually going
on in these stages of

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.430
photosynthesis.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.920
Remember, we said there's
two stages.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.020
The light-dependent reactions
and then you have the light

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.160
independent reactions.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.370
I don't like using the word
dark reaction because it

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.600
actually occurs while
the sun is outside.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100
It's actually occurring
simultaneously

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.300
with the light reactions.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.160
It just doesn't need the
photons from the sun.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.270
But let's focus first on the
light-dependent reactions.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.660
The part that actually uses
photons from the sun.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.900
Or actually, I guess, even
photons from the heat lamp

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.100
that you might have in
your greenhouse.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.500
And uses those photons in
conjunction with water to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:35.360
produce ATP and reduce
NADP plus to NADPH.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.070
Remember, reduction is gaining
electrons or hydrogen atoms.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.030
And it's the same thing,
because when you gain a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.270
hydrogen atom, including its
electron, since hydrogen is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.170
not too electronegative, you
get to hog its electron.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.820
So this is both gaining a
hydrogen and gaining electron.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.800
But let's study it a
little bit more.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.660
So before we dig a little
deeper, I think it's good to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.750
know a little bit about the
anatomy of a plant.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.510
So let me draw some
plant cells.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.530
So plant cells actually have
cell walls, so I can draw them

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.310
a little bit rigid.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.830
So let's say that these are
plant cells right here.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.290
Each of these squares, each of
these quadrilaterals is a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.280
plant cell.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.890
And then in these plant cells
you have these organelles

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.880
called chloroplasts.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.973
Remember organelles are
like organs of a cell.

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:24.230
They are subunits,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.000
membrane-bound subunits of cells.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.300
And of course, these cells have
nucleuses and DNA and all

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.440
of the other things you normally
associate with cells.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
But I'm not going to
draw them here.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.800
I'm just going to draw
the chloroplasts.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.970
And your average plant cell--
and there are other types of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.680
living organisms that perform
photosynthesis, but we'll

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.590
focus on plants.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.950
Because that's what we tend
to associate it with.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.530
Each plant cell will contain
10 to 50 chloroplasts.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.370
I make them green on purpose
because the chloroplasts

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.700
contain chlorophyll.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.560
Which to our eyes,
appear green.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.730
But remember, they're green
because they reflect green

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.090
light and they absorb red
and blue and other

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.040
wavelengths of light.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.860
That's why it looks green.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.600
Because it's reflecting.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.480
But it's absorbing all the
other wavelengths.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.590
But anyway, we'll talk more
about that in detail.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.090
But you'll have 10 to 50 of
these chloroplasts right here.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.930
And then let's zoom in on one
chloroplast. So if we zoom in

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.320
on one chloroplast. So
let me be very clear.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.330
This thing right here
is a plant cell.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.880
That is a plant cell.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.420
And then each of these green
things right here is an

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.540
organelle called the
chloroplast. And let's zoom in

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.990
on the chloroplast itself.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.200
If we zoom in on one
chloroplast, it has a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.580
membrane like that.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.170
And then the fluid inside of the
chloroplast, inside of its

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.610
membrane, so this fluid
right here.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.360
All of this fluid.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.430
That's called the stroma.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.000
The stroma of the chloroplast.
And then within the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.520
chloroplast itself, you have
these little stacks of these

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.530
folded membranes, These
little folded stacks.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.459
Let me see if I can
do justice here.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.510
So maybe that's one, two,
doing these stacks.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.070
Each of these membrane-bound--
you can almost view them as

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.570
pancakes-- let me draw
a couple more.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.970
Maybe we have some over here,
just so you-- maybe you have

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.650
some over here, maybe
some over here.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.790
So each of these flattish
looking pancakes right here,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.220
these are called thylakoids.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.320
So this right here
is a thylakoid.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.570
That is a thylakoid.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.090
The thylakoid has a membrane.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.660
And this membrane is especially
important.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.460
We're going to zoom in
on that in a second.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.540
So it has a membrane, I'll color
that in a little bit.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.720
The inside of the thylakoid, so
the space, the fluid inside

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.620
of the thylakoid, right
there that area.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.220
This light green color
right there.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.360
That's called the thylakoid
space or the thylakoid lumen.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.530
And just to get all of our
terminology out of the way, a

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.090
stack of several thylakoids
just like that,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.630
that is called a grana.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.020
That's a stack of thylakoids.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.840
That is a grana.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.190
And this is an organelle.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.170
And evolutionary biologists,
they believe that organelles

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.250
were once independent
organisms that then,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.090
essentially, teamed up with
other organisms and started

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.350
living inside of their cells.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.450
So there's actually, they
have their own DNA.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.460
So mitochondria is another
example of an organelle that

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.480
people believe that one time
mitochondria, or the ancestors

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.960
of mitochondria, were
independent organisms. That

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.320
then teamed up with other cells
and said, hey, if I

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.230
produce your energy maybe
you'll give me

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.510
some food or whatnot.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.150
And so they started
evolving together.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.740
And they turned into
one organism.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.460
Which makes you wonder what we
might evolve-- well anyway,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.330
that's a separate thing.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.510
So there's actually ribosomes
out here.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.450
That's good to think about.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.280
Just realize that at one point
in the evolutionary past, this

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.510
organelle's ancestor
might have been

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.370
an independent organism.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.690
But anyway, enough about
that speculation.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.760
Let's zoom in again on one of
these thylakoid membranes.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.010
So I'm going to zoom in.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.260
Let me make a box.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.070
Let me zoom in right there.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.990
So that's going to be
my zoom-in box.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.770
So let me make it really big.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.340
Just like this.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.560
So this is my zoom-in box.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.190
So that little box is the same
thing as this whole box.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.180
So we're zoomed in on the
thylakoid membrane.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.510
So this is the thylakoid
membrane right there.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.810
That's actually a phospho-bilipd
layer.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.020
It has your hydrophilic,
hydrophobic tails.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.660
I mean, I could draw it
like that if you like.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.810
The important thing from the
photosynthesis point of view

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.550
is that it's this membrane.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.290
And on the outside of the
membrane, right here on the

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.940
outside, you have the fluid
that fills up the entire

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.540
chloroplast. So here you
have the stroma.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.210
And then this space right here,
this is the inside of

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.620
your thylakoid.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.780
So this is the lumen.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.880
So if I were to color it
pink, right there.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.020
This is your lumen.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.780
Your thylakoid space.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.390
And in this membrane, and this
might look a little bit

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.190
familiar if you think about
mitochondria and the electron

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.040
transport chain.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.940
What I'm going to describe in
this video actually is an

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.770
electron transport chain.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.260
Many people might not consider
it the electron transport

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.610
chain, but it's the same idea.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.660
Same general idea.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.280
So on this membrane you have
these proteins and these

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.235
complexes of proteins
and molecules

00:07:53.235 --> 00:07:55.470
that span this membrane.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.140
So let me draw a
couple of them.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.596
So maybe I'll call this
one, photosystem II.

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:04.500
And I'm calling it that because
that's what it is.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.820
Photosystem II.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.310
You have maybe another
complex.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.570
And these are hugely
complicated.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.040
I'll do a sneak peek of
what photosystem II

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.670
actually looks like.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.180
This is actually what
photosystem II looks like.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.890
So, as you can see, it
truly is a complex.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.460
These cylindrical things,
these are proteins.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.580
These green things are
chlorophyll molecules.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.020
I mean, there's all sorts
of things going here.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.090
And they're all jumbled
together.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.300
I think a complex probably
is the best word.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.320
It's a bunch of proteins, a
bunch of molecules just

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.460
jumbled together to perform a
very particular function.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.440
We're going to describe
that in a few seconds.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.580
So that's what photosystem
II looks like.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.850
Then you also have
photosystem I.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.510
And then you have other
molecules, other complexes.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.130
You have the cytochrome B6F
complex and I'll draw this in

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.120
a different color right here.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.340
I don't want to get too
much into the weeds.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.030
Because the most important thing
is just to understand.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.790
So you have other protein
complexes, protein molecular

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.150
complexes here that also
span the membrane.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.840
But the general idea-- I'll tell
you the general idea and

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.850
then we'll go into the
specifics-- of what happens

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:23.360
during the light reaction, or
the light dependent reaction,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.950
is you have some photons.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.150
Photons from the sun.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.470
They've traveled 93
million miles.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.320
so you have some photons that
go here and they excite

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.950
electrons in a chlorophyll
molecule, in a

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.770
chlorophyll A molecule.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.920
And actually in photosystem II--
well, I won't go into the

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.720
details just yet-- but they
excite a chlorophyll molecule

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.060
so those electrons enter into
a high energy state.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.160
Maybe I shouldn't draw
it like that.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.690
They enter into a high
energy state.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.080
And then as they go from
molecule to molecule they keep

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.760
going down in energy state.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.780
But as they go down in energy
state, you have hydrogen

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.470
atoms, or actually I should say
hydrogen protons without

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.070
the electrons.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.380
So you have all of these
hydrogen protons.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.580
Hydrogen protons get pumped
into the lumen.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.730
They get pumped into the lumen
and so you might remember this

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.210
from the electron
transport chain.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.570
In the electron transport chain,
as electrons went from

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.160
a high potential, a high energy
state, to a low energy

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.110
state, that energy
was used to pump

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.240
hydrogens through a membrane.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.290
And in that case it was in the
mitochondria, here the

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.750
membrane is the thylakoid
membrane.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.750
But either case, you're creating
this gradient where--

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.650
because of the energy from,
essentially the photons-- the

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.330
electrons enter a high energy
state, they keep going into a

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.370
lower energy state.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.870
And then they actually go to
photosystem I and they get hit

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.910
by another photon.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.640
Well, that's a simplification,
but that's how you

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.190
can think of it.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.350
Enter another high energy
state, then they go to a

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.905
lower, lower and lower
energy state.

00:10:56.905 --> 00:10:59.540
But the whole time, that energy
from the electrons

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.760
going from a high energy state
to a low energy state is used

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.120
to pump hydrogen protons
into the lumen.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.400
So you have this huge

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.440
concentration of hydrogen protons.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.680
And just like what we saw in the
electron transport chain,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.980
that concentration is then-- of
hydrogen protons-- is then

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.970
used to drive ATP synthase.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.320
So the exact same-- let me see
if I can draw that ATP

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.310
synthase here.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.880
You might remember ATP
synthase looks

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.160
something like this.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.500
Where literally, so here you
have a huge concentration of

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.850
hydrogen protons.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.010
So they'll want to
go back into the

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.230
stroma from the lumen.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.900
And they do.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.670
And they go through
the ATP synthase.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.200
Let me do it in a new color.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.820
So these hydrogen protons are
going to make their way back.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.210
Go back down the gradient.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.900
And as they go down the
gradient, they literally--

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.710
it's like an engine.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.710
And I go into detail on this
when I talk about respiration.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.020
And that turns, literally
mechanically turns, this top

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.850
part-- the way I drew it--
of the ATP synthase.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.760
And it puts ADP and phosphate
groups together.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.560
It puts ADP plus phosphate
groups

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.260
together to produce ATP.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.740
So that's the general,
very high overview.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.110
And I'm going to go into more
detail in a second.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.500
But this process that I just
described is called

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.200
photophosphorylation.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.450
Let me do it in a nice color.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.850
Why is it called that?

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.390
Well, because we're
using photons.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.460
That's the photo part.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.270
We're using light.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.190
We're using photons to excite
electrons in chlorophyll.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.430
As those electrons get passed
from one molecule, from one

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.960
electron acceptor to another,
they enter into lower and

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.480
lower energy states.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.170
As they go into lower energy
states, that's used to drive,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.270
literally, pumps that allow
hydrogen protons to go from

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.240
the stroma to the lumen.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.900
Then the hydrogen protons
want to go back.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.100
They want to-- I guess you could
call it-- chemiosmosis.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.770
They want to go back into the
stroma and then that drives

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.180
ATP synthase.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.940
Right here, this is
ATP synthase.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.270
ATP synthase to essentially
jam together ADPs and

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.810
phosphate groups
to produce ATP.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.450
Now, when I originally talked
about the light reactions and

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.010
dark reactions I said, well the
light reactions have two

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.050
byproducts.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:42.770
It has ATP and it also has--
actually it has three.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.620
It has ATP, and it
also has NADPH.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.340
NADP is reduced.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.800
It gains these electrons
and these hydrogens.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.060
So where does that show up?

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.670
Well, if we're talking about
non-cyclic oxidative

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.300
photophosphorylation, or
non-cyclic light reactions,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.960
the final electron acceptor.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.330
So after that electron keeps
entering lower and lower

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.445
energy states, the
final electron

00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:12.090
acceptor is NADP plus.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.340
So once it accepts the electrons
and a hydrogen

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.450
proton with it, it
becomes NADPH.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.590
Now, I also said that part of
this process, water-- and this

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.010
is actually a very interesting
thing-- water gets oxidized to

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.270
molecular oxygen.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.980
So where does that happen?

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.060
So when I said, up here in
photosystem I, that we have a

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:43.220
chlorophyll molecule that has
an electron excited, and it

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.510
goes into a higher
energy state.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.410
And then that electron
essentially gets passed from

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.470
one guy to the next, that begs
the question, what can we use

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.550
to replace that electron?

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.340
And it turns out that we use,
we literally use, the

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.690
electrons in water.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.870
So over here you literally
have H2O.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.000
And H2O donates the hydrogens
and the electrons with it.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.860
So you can kind of imagine it
donates two hydrogen protons

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.930
and two electrons to replace the
electron that got excited

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.860
by the photons.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.780
Because that electron got passed
all the way over to

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.010
photosystem I and eventually
ends up in NADPH.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.630
So, you're literally stripping
electrons off of water.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.650
And when you strip off the
electrons and the hydrogens,

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.470
you're just left with
molecular oxygen.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.300
Now, the reason why I want to
really focus on this is that

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.970
there's something profound
happening here.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.500
Or at least on a chemistry
level,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.600
something profound is happening.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.510
You're oxidizing water.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.480
And in the entire biological
kingdom, the only place where

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.290
we know something that is strong
enough of an oxidizing

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.400
agent to oxidize water, to
literally take away electrons

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.210
from water.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.640
Which means you're
really taking

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.680
electrons away from oxygen.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.830
So you're oxidizing oxygen.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.120
The only place that we know
that an oxidation agent is

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.560
strong enough to do this
is in photosystem II.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.560
So it's a very profound idea,
that normally electrons are

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.960
very happy in water.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.660
They're very happy circulating
around oxygens.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.310
Oxygen is a very electronegative
atom.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.830
That's why we even call it
oxidizing, because oxygen is

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.230
very good at oxidizing things.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.360
But all of a sudden we've
found something that can

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.480
oxidize oxygen, that can strip
electrons off of oxygen and

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.680
then give those electrons
to the chlorophyll.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.140
The electron gets excited
by photons.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.980
Then those photons enter
lower and lower and

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.940
lower energy states.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.245
Get excited again in photosystem
I by another set

00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:42.870
of photons and then enter lower
and lower and lower

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.750
energy states.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.500
And then finally,
end up at NADPH.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.140
And the whole time it entered
lower and lower energy states,

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.170
that energy was being used to
pump hydrogen across this

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.350
membrane from the
stroma to lumen.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.250
And then that gradient is used
to actually produce ATP.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.500
So in the next video I'm going
to give a little bit more

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.050
context about what this means
in terms of energy states of

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.040
electrons and what's at a higher
or lower energy state.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.200
But this is essentially
all that's happening.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.450
Electrons get excited.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.859
Those electrons eventually
end up at NADPH.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.650
And as the electron gets excited
and goes into lower

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.160
and lower energy states,
it pumps

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.290
hydrogen across the gradient.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.900
And then that gradient is used
to drive ATP synthase, to

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.110
generate ATP.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.270
And then that original electron
that got excited, it

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.480
had to be replaced.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.200
And that replaced electron is
actually stripped off of H2O.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.680
So the hydrogen protons and
the electrons of H2O are

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.300
stripped away and you're just
left with molecular oxygen.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.070
And just to get a nice
appreciation of the complexity

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.970
of all of this-- I showed you
this earlier in the video--

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.250
but this is literally a-- I mean
this isn't a picture of

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.010
photosystem II.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.830
You actually don't have
cylinders like this.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.110
But these cylinders represent
proteins.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:07.490
Right here, these green kind
of scaffold-like molecules,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.390
that's chlorophyll A.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.390
And what literally happens, is
you have photons hitting--

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.535
actually it doesn't always have
to hit chlorophyll A.

00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:20.290
It can also hit what's called
antenna molecules.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.550
So antenna molecules are other
types of chlorophyll, and

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.980
actually other types
of molecules.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.510
And so a photon, or a set of
photons, comes here and maybe

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.440
it excites some electrons,
it doesn't have to be in

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.870
chlorophyll A.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.220
It could be in some of these
other types of chlorophyll.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.200
Or in some of these other I
guess you could call them,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.670
pigment molecules that will
absorb these photons.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.500
And then their electrons
get excited.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.690
And you can almost imagine
it as a vibration.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.870
But when you're talking about
things on the quantum level,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.230
vibrations really don't
make sense.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.410
But it's a good analogy.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.970
They kind of vibrate their
way to chlorophyll A.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.535
And this is called
resonance energy.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.440
They vibrate their way,
eventually, to chlorophyll A.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.950
And then in chlorophyll A, you
have the electron get excited.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.620
The primary electron acceptor
is actually this molecule

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.460
right here.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.470
Pheophytin.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.100
Some people call it pheo.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.380
And then from there, it keeps
getting passed on from one

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.200
molecule to another.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.690
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in the next video.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.730
But this is fascinating.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.390
Look how complicated this is.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.210
In order to essentially excite
electrons and then use those

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.060
electrons to start the
process of pumping

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.200
hydrogens across a membrane.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.300
And this is an interesting
place right here.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.950
This is the water
oxidation site.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.370
So I got very excited about the
idea of oxidizing water.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.140
And so this is actually where
it occurs in the photosystem

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.240
II complex.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.220
And you actually have this very
complicated mechanism.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.880
Because it's no joke to actually
strip away electrons

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.110
and hydrogens from an actual
water molecule.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.010
I'll leave you there.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.870
And in the next video I'll talk
a little bit more about

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.890
these energy states.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.380
And I'll fill in a little bit of
the gaps about what some of

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.990
these other molecules that act
as hydrogen acceptors.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.470
Or you can also view
them as electron

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.350
acceptors along the way.
