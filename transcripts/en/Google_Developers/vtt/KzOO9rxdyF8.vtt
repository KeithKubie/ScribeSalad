MATT TOON: You're
going to take a number

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.360
of different
components and create

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.155
a mapping application that
stores its data in the cloud.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:45.035

ED PARSONS: Geo
technology is everywhere,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.460
and increasingly, it's
talking about everything.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.065
MARTIN KLEPPE: Load this
kind of data on a map

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:01.740
and interact with this data.

SPEAKER 1: I really enjoyed it.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:15.650
I learned a lot.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.090
People were moving along
in a way that was--

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.440
people didn't get left behind.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.000
SPEAKER 2: Usually, you need a
team to believe in a prototype.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.790
