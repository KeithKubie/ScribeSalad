00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.060
Sometimes in science, the story of HOW we learned 
something is just as cool as what we learned.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.160
In the case of gamma-ray bursts, it’s kinda
hard to beat the awesomeness of what they are.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.500
But of all the plotlines in astronomy,
their origin story comes the closest.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.300
It begins, quite literally, in the grip of
Cold War paranoia, and ends…well, it doesn’t

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.220
end. What true story ever does? But it does lead 
to us discovering the single most violent events

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.600
occurring in the Universe, events which, paradoxically
and ironically, are almost entirely hidden from our view.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.020
After World War II, the allies that were the
United States of America and the United Soviet

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.180
Socialist Republic had gone their separate
ways. They had fought together against a common

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.949
enemy, but that war was done, and a newer,
colder one forged. The US and USSR became

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.490
sworn enemies themselves, each determined
to bring the downfall of the other.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.460
Both sides had nuclear weapons, so this downfall
was not as impossible as it might seem. It

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.670
was a terrifying likelihood, taken very seriously
by everyone involved.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.299
Both sides were testing nukes at every available
opportunity, pushing them for ever-greater

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.290
explosive yield. At the same time, both factions
were becoming more adept at space travel,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.770
using satellites to spy on each other. And
both were looking at the idea of orbiting

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.950
platforms from which to launch nuclear weapons;
you could lob bombs on the enemy within minutes,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.110
instead of needing the better part of an hour
using ballistic missiles.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
Fear of this, as much as anything else, drove
the writing of the Outer Space Test Ban Treaty

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.960
in 1963, forbidding the testing or use of
nuclear weapons in space. Among the signatories

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.369
were the Soviet Union and the United States.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.060
Of course, neither side trusted the other.
Fearful the Soviets might try to test anyway

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.719
— perhaps blowing up nukes on the far side
of the Moon, where they couldn’t be detected

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.250
— the US launched a series of satellites
called Vela. Nuclear detonations produce a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.899
flash of gamma rays, the highest energy form
of light. The Vela satellites were designed

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900
to detect that high-energy pulse.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.450
Two scientists, Roy Olsen and Ray Klebesadel,
were assigned the task of analyzing the data.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
They laboriously combed through the observations,
checking them for anything that looked like

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.730
a nuke. Signal after signal turned out to
be false. But finally, in 1969, they found

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.410
their first hit: a flash of gamma rays seen
by several of the satellites on July 2, 1967.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.750
But there was one problem — whatever caused
the gamma-ray event didn’t look like a nuclear

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.760
blast. The amount of gamma radiation and how
it fades with time are very distinctive for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.140
a nuclear weapon, and the July 2 event looked
completely different than that. There was

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.900
a strong, sharp peak of emission lasting less
than a second, followed by a longer, weaker

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.030
pulse lasting for several more seconds. A
quick look at solar flare data revealed no

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.500
activity that day that could generate gamma
rays, either. Weird.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.110
Over time, more and more of these mysterious
bursts of gamma-rays were found. As analysis

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.720
techniques got better, it was found that they
were not coming from the surface of the Earth,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.510
nor from nearby space; that is, Earth orbit.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.260
Whatever these bursts were, they were originating
randomly in the sky, and were happening IN

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.410
DEEP SPACE. Dun dun dunnn.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.420
In 1973 Olsen and Klebasadel went public,
publishing a paper with their results. Astronomers

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.980
were intrigued. What could cause these gamma-ray
bursts? Generating gamma rays is hard, and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.540
takes incredibly violent events: Exploding
stars, massive solar flares, and the like.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.330
But these bursts weren’t obviously associated
with any of these events.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.020
Making it worse, gamma-ray bursts — let’s
call them GRBs for short, OK? — fade rapidly,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.850
lasting mere seconds or minutes, making it
impossible to follow up with optical telescopes.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.050
It took weeks or months after the event to
get a position in the sky for them, and even

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.180
then the uncertainties were huge. At the time,
gamma ray telescopes had very fuzzy vision,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.640
and couldn’t pinpoint directions well at
all. That meant thousands of stars, galaxies,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.060
and other objects nearby were candidate progenitors of
the detected bursts. It didn’t narrow things down at all.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.420
It’s like telling someone you dropped a
quarter and you want help finding it. When

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.729
they ask you where you dropped it, you reply,
“Wyoming.”

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.860
As more of these objects were found, it was
seen that they really were occurring on random

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.920
points in the sky, and that itself was a problem.
If they were coming from, say, comet impacts

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.230
on neutron stars (which was one possible hypothesis)
then we should see more bursts along the plane

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.390
of the Milky Way than above it. Pretty much
the only place you find neutron stars is in

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.780
the plane of the galaxy, where all the massive
star formation takes place. If GRBs were from

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.220
neutron stars, then that’s where we’d
see ‘em. But we see them all over the sky.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.770
That meant GRBs were either VERY nearby - no
more than a few hundred light years - or that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.060
they were coming from INCREDIBLY far away,
so far that even nearby galaxies weren’t

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.270
affecting the distribution! We didn’t see
a surplus toward the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.060
for example, so they’d have to be coming
from even more distant galaxies, clear across

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.470
the Universe! Neither explanation made sense,
since astronomers couldn’t think of anything

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.590
that could generate bursts that were close
by, and obviously the energies involved in

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.950
creating a burst of gamma rays from billions
of light years away were impossibly huge.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.180
It was the single most enduring mystery in astronomy
for decades. The only hope was to have a faster

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.260
response time, so that any fading “afterglow” from
an event might be caught before it became invisible.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.460
In 1997, that hope became reality. The Dutch-Italian
satellite Beppo-Sax had launched the year

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.200
before, designed in part to look for transient
flashes of high-energy light and nail down

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.390
their positions. In ’97, it detected a gamma-ray
burst and was able to get a reasonably decent

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.910
location for it on the sky. Within hours,
ground-based telescopes pinpointed the position,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.830
and for the first time saw the fading afterglow
of a GRB.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.580
Astronomers were stunned: The burst was clearly
and obviously sitting right on top of a faint

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.880
galaxy. Another, different GRB was detected
just months later, also in a faint galaxy.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.860
When the distance to that galaxy was found,
astronomers were shocked again: it was a truly

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.060
staggering SIX BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.670
The mystery was over, but it was replaced
by a bigger one: These things were happening

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.130
INCREDIBLY far away. But that meant they must
be unbelievably powerful. What could cause

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.340
such a catastrophic explosion?

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.770
When you need raw power, a good place to look
is a black hole. Those are created when the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.810
cores of massive stars collapse and the stars
explode, but there was still a problem. Given

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.050
their distance and brightness, even a supernova
couldn’t power a GRB!

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.220
Think about THAT for a second: The most violent
known events in the Universe at the time were

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.720
inadequate to explain the ferocity of a gamma-ray
burst.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.700
Unless…

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.420
Astronomers came up with an idea: What if
the energy blasting outward from a supernova

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.040
were focused somehow?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.070
In a supernova, the energy gets flung out
in all directions, expanding as a sphere.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:04.020
If instead, that energy could be collected and
sent out as a beam, that COULD explain the bursts.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.480
We now understand this to indeed be the case.
When the core of a VERY massive star collapses,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.350
forming a black hole, the material just outSIDE
the core falls down, forming an incredibly

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.860
hot swirling maelstrom called an accretion
disk. The magnetic field of that material

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.530
(and from the black hole) coil around, wound
up by the rapidly spinning disk, pointing

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.500
up and down out of the disk and away from
the black hole. The details still aren’t

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.540
entirely clear, but this launches twin beams of
matter and energy up and away from the black hole.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.960
The amount of energy in the beams is mind-crushing,
equal to the total energy of the supernova

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.290
event itself! They scream away from the black
hole at very nearly the speed of light, burning

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.120
through the star, blasting away across space.
These death rays are so phenomenally bright

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.110
that we can detect them from BILLIONS of light
years away.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.830
The supernova explosion is no small thing
either; the star is so massive it explodes

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.490
with more energy than a normal supernova. They’re
so powerful that astronomers call them hypernovae.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.420
Coooooool.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.900
And you don’t always need fancy equipment
to see them, either. On March 19th, 2008,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:14.080
a GRB erupted into view, and its distance
quickly determined to be 7.5 billion light

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.580
years from Earth. Despite that ridiculous
distance, it got so bright that if you had

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.880
happened to be looking at that part of the
sky, you would’ve seen it with your naked eye.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.080
Aaaah! It’s thought that in this case, the
beam was aimed almost precisely at us, which

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.580
is why it got so bright. Good thing it was
so far away.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.110
And that explains gamma-ray bursts… well,
one kind of burst, at least. It turns out

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.849
there are two kinds. When you look at the
duration of all the bursts detected, they

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:44.960
divide pretty well into two groups: Ones that
last longer than two seconds, and come from

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.280
hypernovae, and ones that are much more rapid.
Sometimes these short bursts last literally for

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.520
milliseconds: Way too fast to be from core collapse
supernovae. Something else must be behind them.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.980
But what else could be as soul-crushingly
energetic as the explosion of a hypernova?

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:05.020
Turns out, it’s two neutron stars crashing
together and exploding!

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.560
Imagine two massive stars born together as
a binary star. Eventually one goes supernova,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.730
as does the other, leaving two neutron stars
orbiting each other. They’d stay in orbit

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.080
like this forever if it weren’t for a subtle
aspect of gravity predicted by Einstein’s

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.760
Theory of Relativity: Massive objects revolving
around each other very slowly lose orbital

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.460
energy by radiating away gravitational waves,
essentially ripples in the fabric of space

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.370
itself. I know, it’s weird -- relativity
is like that -- but think of it as a slow

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.610
leak in the orbits, very gradually dropping
the neutron stars together.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.570
Over billions of years, the two stars draw
ever closer, getting so close they spin madly

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.690
around each other. Finally, they merge in
a flash -- literally. If their combined mass

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.339
is more than 2.8 times that of the Sun they’ll
collapse to form a black hole.

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:59.029
What happens next is as bizarre as it is awesome.
For a very brief moment, the system becomes

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:05.000
a black hole orbited by ultra-dense debris
from the merger, a huge amount of neutronium,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.290
neutron-star-stuff. This then mimics what
happens in a hypernova; it becomes an accretion

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.790
disk, heated to ridiculous temperatures, blasting
out those beams of matter and energy. Because

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.350
the material is more compact, the gamma ray
flash is much shorter.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.930
In case you’re wondering, yes, this is precisely
what my nightmares are made of. Which brings

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.620
me to this week’s Focus On.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.240
If GRBs are so explosive we can see them
from halfway across the Universe,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.960
what would happen if one were nearby?

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.820
Well, not good things. I already talked about
the dangers from a nearby supernova, and the

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:41.330
dangers from GRBs are about the same. However,
because the energy is beamed, GRBs are dangerous

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.070
from much farther away: A supernova has to
be only a few hundred light years away to

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:51.960
hurt us, but a GRB can be over 7000 light
years away and do the same amount of damage!

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.700
But there’s an upside to those beams:
Because they’re so narrow, we can only see a burst

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:03.040
if the beam is aimed right at us. That significantly
lowers the chances of getting hit by a nearby one.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.339
As it happens, there ARE two stars that could
one day explode as gamma-ray bursts that are

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:13.600
within that danger zone: Eta Carinae, and
WR104. The good news is that both are at the

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.420
edge of that distance limit, so they
probably can’t hurt us. Even better,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.540
it doesn’t look like either of them is aimed at us.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:25.279
As far as we know, we’re safe from hypernova-induced
GRBs. We don’t know of any about-to-merge

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:30.170
neutron stars, either. It’s possible they’d
be dark and difficult to detect, but they’re

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:35.860
SO rare that it’s incredibly unlikely that any are nearby.
Because of this, I’m not really worried about them.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.360
Over the years, more space observatories have
been launched to detect bursts. Probably the

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.870
most important observatory is NASA’s Swift,
designed to detect the flash of gamma-rays

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.350
from a burst, then swing rapidly into action
to point its ultraviolet and optical telescopes

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.850
at the area, precisely locating the burst.
It then sends the coordinates down to Earth,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.260
so that more telescopes on the ground can
join in on the fun. As of 2015, Swift has

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.140
detected over 900 GRBs. The rapid response
time is critically important in getting follow-up

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.880
data of the bursts, and since the launch of
Swift our understanding of these phenomena

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.060
has grown by leaps and bounds.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.310
Now, with our fleet of satellites scanning
the skies, we see a GRB pretty much every

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.110
day. And remember - we only see them when
they’re aimed at us! That means we miss

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.040
most of them, so the actual rate of GRBs is
much higher in the Universe. There may be

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.740
hundreds happening every day, somewhere in
the cosmos.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.320
Gamma-ray bursts are truly one of nature’s
most incredible events, the most violent and

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.410
energetic explosions the Universe is capable
of. Everything about them is amazing, from

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.130
their discovery to what actually powers them
and what they create.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.360
In fact, when you think about it, here’s
the MOST astonishing thing about them: Every

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.399
time we see one, we’re witnessing a black
hole being born.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:53.290
Gamma-ray bursts are the birth cries of black
holes.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.589
Today you learned that gamma-ray bursts were
discovered during the Cold War, when both

00:12:56.589 --> 00:13:02.229
the US and USSR were worried about the other
group detonating nuclear weapons in space.

00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:08.200
Bursts come in two rough varieties: Long and
short. Long ones are from hypernovae, massive

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:12.660
stars exploding, sending out twin beams of
matter and energy. Short ones are from merging

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:18.100
neutron stars. Both kinds are so energetic
they’re visible for billions of light years,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.209
and both are also the birth announcements
of black holes.

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:25.440
