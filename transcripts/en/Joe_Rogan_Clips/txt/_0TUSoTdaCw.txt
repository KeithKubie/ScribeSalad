Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. That's good stuff. That's what I mean. I feel like that is the pinnacle of where this medium can take us. Watching. Like can say he was in an extreme state. What about when you could go by be comfortable, capable. You become comfortable and creases are listened to that podcast. Like I go on runs, I'd listen to this and I thought fucking hell man. Where else are you going to get this content? Whereas that got you into this. There's no one would ever agree to it anywhere else. That's the thing that you'd never get a group of people whose jobs depended upon keeping the show on the air, whether they're producers or executives. They would never agree to that. They'd be like, you can't have that crazy fucker on, you can't have this on can of Eddie Bravo on all the time. He thinks dump world is flat.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Stop this cause you traveling between such a loaded, diverse and unusual ideas and, and sort of the theme of Alex Jones is as well is that he's lucky. He demonstrates to a point that there's voracity in what he's saying some things. Yeah, he's right about a lot of things. You know, we were just talking about animals, human hybrids. We started pulling up these studies where they actually have done studies where they've tried to create animal human hybrids, non-viable, an animal, human embryos to trying to grow human organs in different animals. And there's all sorts of weird scientific shit that we're doing. Imagine what they're doing in China behind walls. Look at this. China's latest cloned monkey experiment is an ethical mets.

They're trying to create super soldiers. Someone is trying to create some super soldier, some half champ, half human super intelligent, murderous thing that's powered by remote control passing and all could objective. No, I don't see a good outcome for the superintelligent murderous remote control [inaudible] being what? If you could send those superintelligent murders chimps to go kill Isis now. Now we've got a reason to get them out there. Now we need, and we look, we've got a nice contract with the defense contractor and they're gonna tell us how we lubricate the passage to the murderous monkeys is isis. That's the function of Isis in the cultural conversation is to justify it. The monkey sell watches.
