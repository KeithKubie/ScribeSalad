00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.800
From playing ping pong with water droplets,
to lighting things on fire in microgravity

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.730
to growing space salad… astronauts on the
International Space Station get to experiment

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:27.060
in one of the most unique laboratories known
to man.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.250
Hovering 240 miles about us, the ISS hosts
scientific investigations that not only benefit

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.600
us here on Earth, but will hopefully bust
us out of orbit one day.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.840
But how do these experiments get designed
and prepped for microgravity?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.899
We’re here at the Kennedy Space Center to
find out.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:54.620
CRS-15 is a joint SpaceX, NASA, and CASIS
cargo resupply mission, carrying over 5,900

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.499
pounds of gear and scientific research to
the ISS.Aboard this SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.230
will be 20 moustramauts, an artificial intelligence
assist named CIMON, and over 20 scientific

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.230
payloads.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.060
At the Space Life Sciences Lab, researchers
are busy prepping an experiment on space algae,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090
a potential food source for deep space missions.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.789
“Algae is really versatile.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.780
They’re very rich in protein, and have a
bit of starch, and a fair amount of oil in

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.780
them.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.700
It’s very photosynthetically efficient,
so you don’t need a lot of light.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.490
You need much, much less light than you would
need for growing say lettuce.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.140
The way that people are producing algae for
say biofuels… they grow them in liquid because

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.039
you can get much higher yield, much faster
growth.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.090
That was the goal… to figure out how can
we grow algae in liquid, in a microgravity

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.090
environment.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.729
We’re using those gas permeable bags to
then be able to grow liquid cultures.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.970
Then we put a large amount of those cells
into a starter culture.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.299
That culture sits in the dark for about a
week before it then gets installed into the

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.550
veggie unit for light.”

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
Scientists like Dr. Settles work closely with
CASIS payload analysts to make sure their

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.250
experiments are ready for launch.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.871
“Part of my job as a payload developer is
to try and take the experiment that the researcher

00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:25.659
wants to do and make it as simple as possible
for the crew.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.629
When the crew is up there working, after a
long day, you don’t want very complicated

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.629
procedures.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.629
You don’t want complicated hardware.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.930
You want to make it clean and simple.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.760
We load that up and get it ready for flight.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.960
We package it in a flight approved foam container
and then we’ll take that over to the Kennedy

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.290
Space Center to hand it over to the NASA group.”

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.459
NASA’s Space Station Processing Facility
is a three story, 457,000 square foot building

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.430
where ISS modules and flight hardware are
manufactured.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.470
It’s also the next checkpoint for science
experiments en route to the ISS.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.970
The space algae payload, which looks a bit
like a pizza delivery, is handed off and vetted

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.830
by NASA employees before being loaded onto
the spacecraft, ready for lift-off the next

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:25.230
morning.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.890
At about nine minutes and thirty seconds after
liftoff, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft separated

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.530
from the Falcon 9 rocket, heading towards
the ISS.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:43.340
Three days later, the ISS’s Canad-arm2 played
a careful game of robotic catch with the Dragon.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.900
“Capture complete… looking forward to
really exciting weeks ahead and getting started

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.080
on some great experiments.”

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:03.049
“Our payload is scheduled to be installed
in the hardware on space station within 24

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.180
hours of docking on ISS.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.800
So the samples that we’re working with are
live organisms, so they can’t stay in stowage

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
for too long.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.459
Once our hardware is installed in veggie,
our experiment will run for one month.”

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.150
The hope with this investigation is to see
how microgravity stimulates changes in different

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.639
algae strains.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.300
By identifying genes associated with faster
growth, Settles and his team can hopefully

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.639
better engineer algae for space food and fuel.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.139
“The nice thing about algae is that it grows
relatively fast.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.370
In three, six days you’re already producing
something as opposed to waiting three months

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.110
if you’re growing a large terrestrial plant…
it would help capture the carbon that the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.460
astronauts are breathing out and then turn
it back into biomass.”

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.960
Technologies used for this space algae experiments
are already being used to help us grow crops

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.000
more efficiently, like the LED lights, watering
system, and the small compartments.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And with its high protein count, we could
be seeing algae-based snacks and meals in

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.639
our diet one day.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.560
That’s all thanks in part to experiments
like this one, which are just one of over

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.150
250 active scientific investigations happening
aboard that can benefit us here on Earth.
