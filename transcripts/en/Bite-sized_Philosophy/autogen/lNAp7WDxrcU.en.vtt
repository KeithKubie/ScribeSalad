say the practical implications of
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.150
say the practical implications of
scientific research both at a personal

from for me given that I know that the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
from for me given that I know that the
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340
from for me given that I know that the
people vary in their cognitive abilities

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
people vary in their cognitive abilities
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.899
people vary in their cognitive abilities
tremendously and that that's actually an

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
tremendously and that that's actually an
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.250
tremendously and that that's actually an
important determinant of their life

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
important determinant of their life
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.350

outcome it seems to me so let's say

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
outcome it seems to me so let's say
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109
outcome it seems to me so let's say
someone tests out in an IQ of around 115

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
someone tests out in an IQ of around 115
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539
someone tests out in an IQ of around 115
and so you could say look you know

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
and so you could say look you know
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.490
and so you could say look you know

your luck to to really master that but
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.090
your luck to to really master that but
you know you could be here's a here's a

you could really be in the top 10

have an IQ of a hundred and fifteen like

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
have an IQ of a hundred and fifteen like
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729
have an IQ of a hundred and fifteen like
you might make one bang-up plumber and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
you might make one bang-up plumber and
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.750
you might make one bang-up plumber and
you can have a spectacular

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
you can have a spectacular
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.429
you can have a spectacular
successful career as a plumber and maybe

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439
successful career as a plumber and maybe
 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.470
successful career as a plumber and maybe
as a manager of other plumbers and all

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
as a manager of other plumbers and all
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240
as a manager of other plumbers and all
of that and you know and I mean I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
of that and you know and I mean I
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.190
of that and you know and I mean I
actually happen to be a real aficionado

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200
actually happen to be a real aficionado
 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.960
actually happen to be a real aficionado
of the trade so I certainly don't think

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
of the trade so I certainly don't think
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.640
of the trade so I certainly don't think
of that as something that's a that's a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650
of that as something that's a that's a
 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.069
of that as something that's a that's a
low quality or low status occupation in

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079
low quality or low status occupation in
 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.589
low quality or low status occupation in
the least but we would we would like to

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599
the least but we would we would like to
 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.050
the least but we would we would like to
tell people okay here's here's here's a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
tell people okay here's here's here's a
 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.240
tell people okay here's here's here's a
here's an intellectual domain that's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
here's an intellectual domain that's
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.339
here's an intellectual domain that's
probably too high for you to be

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349
probably too high for you to be
 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.830
probably too high for you to be
successful without working insane hours

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840
successful without working insane hours
 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.289
successful without working insane hours
to to to to close the gap because you

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299
to to to to close the gap because you
 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.180
to to to to close the gap because you
can do that with insane work up to some

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
can do that with insane work up to some
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.610
can do that with insane work up to some
some limited degree but it seems to me

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620
some limited degree but it seems to me
 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440
some limited degree but it seems to me
that the logical thing to do at least in

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
that the logical thing to do at least in
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660
that the logical thing to do at least in
part is to give people a sense of what

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
part is to give people a sense of what
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.479
part is to give people a sense of what
their advantages and limitations are and

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
their advantages and limitations are and
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.250
their advantages and limitations are and
then say to them okay well given that

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260
then say to them okay well given that
 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.710
then say to them okay well given that
here is a place that you could go where

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
here is a place that you could go where
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.039
here is a place that you could go where
you could be optimally successful and so

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049
you could be optimally successful and so
 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.869
you could be optimally successful and so
you know that's kind of my take from a

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879
you know that's kind of my take from a
 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.149
you know that's kind of my take from a
policy perspective let's say but like

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159
policy perspective let's say but like
 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.220
policy perspective let's say but like
what have you thought about you know the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230
what have you thought about you know the
 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.229
what have you thought about you know the
massive diversity and intellectual

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
massive diversity and intellectual
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.699
massive diversity and intellectual
ability I mean what are the implications

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709
ability I mean what are the implications
 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.979
ability I mean what are the implications
from a policy perspective as far as

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989
from a policy perspective as far as
 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.020
from a policy perspective as far as
you're concerned well I think vocational

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
you're concerned well I think vocational
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.180
you're concerned well I think vocational
guidance is clearly one I actually did

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
guidance is clearly one I actually did
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.339
guidance is clearly one I actually did

and testing they're not that big on G

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989
and testing they're not that big on G
 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.960
and testing they're not that big on G
but they have the only battery of tests

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970
but they have the only battery of tests
 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.339
but they have the only battery of tests
they bring someone in and do a fun day

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349
they bring someone in and do a fun day
 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.580
they bring someone in and do a fun day
of cognitive tests and from that they

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
of cognitive tests and from that they
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.430
of cognitive tests and from that they
give some advice about what kinds of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440
give some advice about what kinds of
 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.430
give some advice about what kinds of
professions match their cognitive

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
professions match their cognitive
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.860
professions match their cognitive
strengths and weaknesses and I actually

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
strengths and weaknesses and I actually
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.949
strengths and weaknesses and I actually
did some brain imaging on their tests

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959
did some brain imaging on their tests
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.159
did some brain imaging on their tests
and was very interesting stuff you think

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169
and was very interesting stuff you think
 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.030
and was very interesting stuff you think
because it's hard to do the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
because it's hard to do the
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.039
because it's hard to do the
psychometrics properly with regards to

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049
psychometrics properly with regards to
 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.189
psychometrics properly with regards to
vocational guidance because we don't

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199
vocational guidance because we don't
 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.140
vocational guidance because we don't
really know we don't have a good handle

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150
really know we don't have a good handle
 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.390
really know we don't have a good handle
on how to classify jobs into their

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
on how to classify jobs into their
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.339
on how to classify jobs into their
various subtypes like John Holland has

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349
various subtypes like John Holland has
 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.439
various subtypes like John Holland has
done some good work doing that but but

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449
done some good work doing that but but
 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.390
done some good work doing that but but
there's so many jobs and it's hard to

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400
there's so many jobs and it's hard to
 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.089
there's so many jobs and it's hard to
figure out what makes two jobs the same

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099
figure out what makes two jobs the same
 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.729
figure out what makes two jobs the same
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.409
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins
when Holland was there and some of my

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419
when Holland was there and some of my
 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.580
when Holland was there and some of my
friends were graduate students

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590
friends were graduate students
 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.070
friends were graduate students
for him and I learned all about that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
for him and I learned all about that
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.870
for him and I learned all about that
vocational testing it's very powerful

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880
vocational testing it's very powerful
 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.500
vocational testing it's very powerful
and as you know it's that's more of his

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510
and as you know it's that's more of his
 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.920
and as you know it's that's more of his
scales that kind of morphed into more

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
scales that kind of morphed into more
 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.790
scales that kind of morphed into more
personality like dementia yeah that's

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800
personality like dementia yeah that's
 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.500
personality like dementia yeah that's
exactly the Nexus that we want to play

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510
exactly the Nexus that we want to play
 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.750
exactly the Nexus that we want to play
out it's like okay because there is a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760
out it's like okay because there is a
 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.430
out it's like okay because there is a
reason I know people have been mapping

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
reason I know people have been mapping

Holland's Hallman's job categories on to

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290
Holland's Hallman's job categories on to
 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.110
Holland's Hallman's job categories on to
the big five and with a fair bit of

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120
the big five and with a fair bit of
 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.909
the big five and with a fair bit of
success you know and we're hoping that

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919
success you know and we're hoping that
 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.310
success you know and we're hoping that
the differentiation down to the two ten

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
the differentiation down to the two ten
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.140
the differentiation down to the two ten
levels of personality will provide even

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150
levels of personality will provide even
 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.409
levels of personality will provide even
more precision but but with more general

more precision but but with more general
 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.230

vocational counseling that's a good idea

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729
vocational counseling that's a good idea
 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.690
vocational counseling that's a good idea
when does it start to start in junior

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700
when does it start to start in junior
 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.820
when does it start to start in junior
high like do you do what the Europeans

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830
high like do you do what the Europeans
 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.740
high like do you do what the Europeans
do and start to track people into trades

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750
do and start to track people into trades
 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.680
do and start to track people into trades
and and and higher education at that

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690
and and and higher education at that
 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.170
and and and higher education at that
kind of early age the Europeans seem to

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180
kind of early age the Europeans seem to
 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.510
kind of early age the Europeans seem to
have had great success with that

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
have had great success with that
 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.190
have had great success with that
so it's certainly Germans in particular

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200
so it's certainly Germans in particular
 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.950
so it's certainly Germans in particular
yeah so it's reasonable to look at but

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960
yeah so it's reasonable to look at but
 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.990
yeah so it's reasonable to look at but
the problem in the United States there

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000
the problem in the United States there
 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.520

in Canada but in the United States this

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900
in Canada but in the United States this
 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.080
in Canada but in the United States this
idea of tracking has a very negative

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090
idea of tracking has a very negative
 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.810

balance to it you know segregating the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820
balance to it you know segregating the
 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.920
balance to it you know segregating the
smart kids into one one set of classes

was a couple of things he could do like

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490
was a couple of things he could do like
 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.130
was a couple of things he could do like
one of the things he could have done I

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140
one of the things he could have done I
 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.470
one of the things he could have done I
think he could have been encouraged

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480
think he could have been encouraged
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.820
think he could have been encouraged
let's say to to collect trash in the

let's say to to collect trash in the
 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.470
let's say to to collect trash in the
downtown areas like he could have been

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.480
downtown areas like he could have been
 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.680
downtown areas like he could have been
assigned a city block and and it could

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690
assigned a city block and and it could
 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.450
assigned a city block and and it could
have been said to him look your job is

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460
have been said to him look your job is
 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.350

projects that people of that level of

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599
projects that people of that level of
 

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:45.720
projects that people of that level of
abstract capacity could actually perform

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:45.730
abstract capacity could actually perform
 

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.030
abstract capacity could actually perform
but I don't think we have the maturity

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040
but I don't think we have the maturity
 

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.400
but I don't think we have the maturity
to have that conversation we don't have

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.410
to have that conversation we don't have
 

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.690

the economics

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:51.700
the economics
 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.520
the economics
so I I would go even a little to the

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:53.530
so I I would go even a little to the
 

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.930
so I I would go even a little to the
left of you and I would say there's

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:54.940
left of you and I would say there's
 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.830
left of you and I would say there's
nothing wrong with making work programs

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:57.840
nothing wrong with making work programs
 

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.920
nothing wrong with making work programs
you know to allow people I mean you have

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:01.930
you know to allow people I mean you have
 

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.440
you know to allow people I mean you have
you know to work with dignity so you

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.450
you know to work with dignity so you
 

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.660
you know to work with dignity so you
have that option but you also have this

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.670
have that option but you also have this
 

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.840
have that option but you also have this
interesting experiment being proposed of

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:09.850
interesting experiment being proposed of
 

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.810
interesting experiment being proposed of
the minimum annual income yeah well that

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:12.820
the minimum annual income yeah well that
 

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.370
the minimum annual income yeah well that
one worries me because see if there's a

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:14.380
one worries me because see if there's a
 

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.810
one worries me because see if there's a
couple of things about that one that

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:15.820
couple of things about that one that
 

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.540
couple of things about that one that
concerns me because you know so we're

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.550
concerns me because you know so we're
 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.220
concerns me because you know so we're
having a conversation here where we're

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.230
having a conversation here where we're
 

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.210
having a conversation here where we're
taking differences in IQ seriously but

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.220
taking differences in IQ seriously but
 

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.190
taking differences in IQ seriously but
the problem with the guaranteed annual

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200
the problem with the guaranteed annual
 

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.490
the problem with the guaranteed annual
income issue I think one of the problems

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.500
income issue I think one of the problems
 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.920
income issue I think one of the problems
and I'm not denying its potential

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:31.930
and I'm not denying its potential
 

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.660
and I'm not denying its potential
utility it's something I think that

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:33.670
utility it's something I think that
 

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.740
utility it's something I think that
would have to be experimentally

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:34.750
would have to be experimentally
 

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.990
would have to be experimentally
determined you know and all of that and

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
determined you know and all of that and
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.450
determined you know and all of that and
maybe it could replace a plethora of

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:39.460
maybe it could replace a plethora of
 

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.210
maybe it could replace a plethora of
less efficient social welfare programs

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.220
less efficient social welfare programs
 

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.640
less efficient social welfare programs
but you know it isn't obvious to me

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:47.650
but you know it isn't obvious to me
 

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.470
but you know it isn't obvious to me
it's obvious to me that there's a

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480
it's obvious to me that there's a
 

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.150
it's obvious to me that there's a
substantial proportion of the population

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160
substantial proportion of the population
 

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.800
substantial proportion of the population
and I would say it's probably five

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:52.810
and I would say it's probably five
 

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.380
and I would say it's probably five
percent that would destroy themselves

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.390
percent that would destroy themselves
 

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.570
percent that would destroy themselves
instantly if you gave them a guaranteed

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.580
instantly if you gave them a guaranteed
 

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.180
instantly if you gave them a guaranteed
annual income and they would do it

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.190
annual income and they would do it
 

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.960
annual income and they would do it
because they're very low in

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:00.970
because they're very low in
 

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.960
because they're very low in
conscientiousness for example and very

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:03.970
conscientiousness for example and very
 

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.000
conscientiousness for example and very
impulsive and AGG I've worked with many

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.010
impulsive and AGG I've worked with many
 

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.060
impulsive and AGG I've worked with many
guys often X cocaine addicts who were

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.070
guys often X cocaine addicts who were
 

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.280
guys often X cocaine addicts who were
often not all that high on the end of

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.290
often not all that high on the end of
 

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.960
often not all that high on the end of
the cognitive distribution but very very

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:12.970
the cognitive distribution but very very
 

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.730
the cognitive distribution but very very
low in conscientiousness high in

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:14.740
low in conscientiousness high in
 

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.530
low in conscientiousness high in
impulsivity and those guys were

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:16.540
impulsivity and those guys were
 

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.240
impulsivity and those guys were
absolutely fine as long as they were

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.250
absolutely fine as long as they were
 

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.480
absolutely fine as long as they were
flat broke but man I tell you as soon as

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.490
flat broke but man I tell you as soon as
 

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.820
flat broke but man I tell you as soon as
they had money they were done it was

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:23.830
they had money they were done it was
 

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.310
they had money they were done it was
like three days in the bar cocaine binge

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320
like three days in the bar cocaine binge
 

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.440
like three days in the bar cocaine binge
facedown in a ditch and then they were

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:28.450
facedown in a ditch and then they were
 

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.460
facedown in a ditch and then they were
fine until they got money again and so I

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.470
fine until they got money again and so I
 

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.110
fine until they got money again and so I
don't the problem with the guaranteed

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120
don't the problem with the guaranteed
 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.650
don't the problem with the guaranteed
annual income solution is that you know

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:37.660
annual income solution is that you know
 

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.930
annual income solution is that you know
man does not live by bread alone let's

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:39.940
man does not live by bread alone let's
 

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.140
man does not live by bread alone let's
say and the if you have money and you

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.150
say and the if you have money and you
 

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.450
say and the if you have money and you
have things to do then you have a life

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:45.460
have things to do then you have a life
 

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.180
have things to do then you have a life
