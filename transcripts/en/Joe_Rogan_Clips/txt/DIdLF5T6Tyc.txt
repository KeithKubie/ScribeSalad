Speaker 1:          00:00          Not been the easiest weekend in my life or my careers last week, but hanging in there to make this a standalone so that people don't have to go figuring this out on their own. And I'm sure many, many fans are tuning in already know that the gist of the details, let's lay this out from the beginning. John Jones initial failed test. Yeah. So that was July of 2017 he tested positive for approximately 20, anywhere from 20 to 60 Pega grams of a longterm metabolite known as the three metabolite of a substance called dihydro chloral methyl testosterone, D, H, C M, T, also known as oral to rentable. And this was over a year ago. Um, what was determined to be the source of this stuff, never determined what the source was. So John went through a full arbitration hearing, um, was never able to determine where it came from, tested all the supplements he was using, you know, went through many, uh, interviews with USADA, had a full on arbitration hearing.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Uh, the source was never determined where it came from. Why was his suspension so low or so short? Well, I mean, he wasn't determined. So I mean there's many factors that go into what that suspension was. I w I would argue in the total totality of the evidence that was presented in that arbitration, that it, that it wasn't a short suspension. Um, because really one key thing came out at arbitration. So John went to arbitration before an individual by the name of Richard McLaren. Richard McLaren has an arbitration group up in Canada and McLaren is probably worldwide known as one of the most credible guys in anti-doping. I know you had the Icarus producer director on the McLaren report was the report that came from all that. He basically investigated the Russian state being involved in doping and Sochi games and put out actually a series of reports on it, detailing that up to 1000 Russian athletes.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Um, you know, we're breaking the rules and the Russian laboratory was helping them get around it. So he's a very, very respected guy. He's independent of obviously the UFC. He's independent of USADA. Um, he acts on his own and his determination was his determination. Um, and I'll read you kind of what he said. He said, I find that all evidence available to me leads me to conclude that the violation was not intended, nor could it have enhanced the athlete's performance. So a non-intentional, so non-intentional ingestion. I mean there's no argument that it was in his system, but he found the evidence to show non-intentional use. And then he went further saying that based on the numbers of what he saw in the evidence that was not even a performance enhancing benefit afforded to John for having this longterm metabolite in his system. And I think that's significant when you talk about Hey 15 was that, that's, you know, kind of light being that this is the second time through.

Speaker 1:          03:02          I would argue that if there was an argument that maybe it's on the higher end and certainly, you know, we'll talk about the California commission. Andy foster took that position, uh, in John's recent California hearing, he was a little bit critical of USADA. Um, he thought, you know, he's intimately familiar with his evidence both in the previous case and this occurrence that, and he also saw that there was no evidence that an independent arbitrator, you know, made this, uh, statement and decision of John intentionally cheating. Um, so if anything, you know, I'd say that potentially there could be an argument that, that it was, you know, on the higher end versus the lower end because of the fact that it was an unintentional ingestion. Exactly. What is John's excuse? What is, what is John said how he got this into his system. We'll look, you know, it's detailed in the arbitration hearing at all.

Speaker 1:          03:53          John John fully admits that, you know, some of the lifetime lifestyle decisions he was making, you know, the partying and things, you know, probably did not lead to, to making smart decisions and making smart choices in terms of what was being ingested in the body. But certainly his testimony was under oath that I have never intentionally cheated and did not intentionally put this substance in my body. And not only this case, but as we talk about the subsequent case here, I think you'll see that based on the numbers, you know, coming out of his tests and based on some studies that have been done on some of these substances, it would tend to support that. Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't John test negative then test positive for extremely low numbers? This is the initial test before we get into the most recent field test.

Speaker 1:          04:40          He did test negative then test positive very shortly after with a very small trace amount. Correct. So you had two negative tests on July 7th and July 8th, I believe, of 2017 and then way in day, I think it was July 28th, he was positive for a very low level of the [inaudible] metabolite. And we might as well start here. So again, going back to Icarus, remember, remember the doctor, I mean he's the main character in that were Cenk of in 2011 he put out a study on oral Toronto ball. Um, he actually, my understanding is dosed himself and then studied the excretion of his urine. And what was coming out of it over the weeks and months after and determined that there was multiple, maybe up to 50 metabolites, that once this DH CMT was ingested into the body, the body converted into other substances and these metabolites stayed around. He identified some short term metabolites, some medium term metabolites, and some longterm metabolites, specifically the M three that John's tested positive for it.

Speaker 1:          05:49          So these longterm metabolites would indicate that it was taken a long time ago. They would stay around for the longest. Why? Why was testing negative and then testing positive for these extremely. So yeah, that numbers, that's a good question. And that's, that's basically the question and point. But what was not occurring and what has never occurred in any of John's samples is any presence of the short and medium term metabolites. And if you look at a rich Dankoff study, he identifies a couple of these medium term metabolites, Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two and he says these metabolites based on his study will stay in the body at least 22 days. W, well, let's look back to the July 7th and eighth you know, positive tests. He's negative on July 7th and eighth for everything. For the parent compound, for the short term, medium term term metabolites and the longterm metabolites go 2021 days later.

Speaker 1:          06:48          So within that 22 day window, which is study shows the short and medium term metabolites would still be showing up and there's no presence whatsoever of the short or medium term metabolites. Now again, we'll get into this a little bit more, but I think the science, what it's showing is a pulsing effect for this longterm metabolite. Meaning once you ingest, whether intentionally or not unintentionally oral torrented ball into the body, the body breaks it down, produces short term and medium term, which is you know, visible for a short and medium amount of time. And then this [inaudible] which is produced for a long period of time, I think with the issue appears to be, and we'll get into this, the UFC program is not the only program that seen this. There's another professional sports league that has seen it very frequently. You saw it as also seen this on the Olympic side, but we're seeing this strange action with the longterm and three metabolite.

Speaker 1:          07:45          And the theory is it may be hiding, um, in the fat tissues surrounding organs and maybe have a pulsing effect where it's released at certain times and other times you can't detect it. And this is not the actual substance itself, but it's a metabolite correct. Which indicates a reaction to this substance indicates the body breaking down. Okay. The parent compound the oral terenna ball and turning it into these other things which are stored in the body. So those metabolites are not performance enhancing drugs that are the result of the breakdown of the parent drug in the body. How much time is it detectable, the actual drug itself? So pretty quick, uh, it's a pretty quick clearance time. I think we're chunk off study says, you know, maybe a week. Uh, so it's not around for very long and that's why he conducted the study ironically enough.

Speaker 1:          08:33          And I was going to go watch bickers here last night and I just, I've had too much going on in the last week to kind of refresh my mind. But, um, apparently he, he knew this was part of his protocol for Russian athletes. He knew a coach that was still giving the oral Taranto ball to Russian athletes and he had a falling out with the coach. So he goes off on the side and Hey the parent compounds going to get in and out of the body pretty quick. It's going to be difficult to detect that. Let's try to figure out what stays around and leaves markers in the body for a long time. And so he developed these short and longterm metabolite tests and was able to catch some of this coaches athletes for using the oral to rentable. Interesting. So the actual drug itself has gone from the system, but the metabolite remains now what is the window that the, this metabolite is supposed to be detectable in the body?

Speaker 1:          09:23          Cause we're talking now, what do we at like 18 months? So here's the, here's the problem. Was that initial ingestion? Yep. Cause my question is these same longterm metabolites, these existed a year plus ago. It was more than a year. How long ago that that's so July, 2017 was your initial test. So with all the experts, and we'll get through this with all the experts are telling us is that there is no evidence of re ingestion and most likely this is still remnants from the July, 2017 tests. However it was to enter into a system. And we'll go through some of these testing numbers that have shown negatives followed by very low level Peka Peka gram quantities. You know, was that the ingestion that happened that he tested positive for in July of 2017 indicated a longterm effect rate. It was a longterm term metabolite, correct. So meaning it had already been assistant for a year or so.

Speaker 1:          10:19          It absolutely could have predated, you know, the theory the first time through was something had to have entered his system between July 7th and July 8th those negatives and this low peak gram reading on July 28th over this last year, there's been a lot of study into this longterm metabolite. As I mentioned, this isn't just a UFC issue. There's another major professional sports league that for the time being wants to keep their, their testing confidential, but they've shared that information with scientists, with USADA, with myself. They saw it on multiple occasions as pulsing effect over a year where you'd see, but this is positive. Tell over a year. We're talking two and a half years now, right. If it's a year, if it's a, if in July he had July, 2017 you were talking a year and a half, right? July, 2017 correct. July 17 but it could have been in his system a year prior. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Yeah, it could have been a couple of months a year. I don't know. He'd never showed up for that N three metabolite four you'd been tested for it. He had been tested multiple times in the programming from wrong isn't the same level, isn't it? Approximately the same Pika grams that exists today in 2018 that were there in 2017 generally if you look and we can go over these numbers, it, it fluctuates, you know, from single digits and never gets into triple digits to mid double digit. So there is some as low as nine peak grams over that time. Um, there was some at 60 Pika grams, however, a peak of gram to someone because it's a preposterously small. It's insane. And you know the, the analogy that I heard early on was, and I think John uses throw a pinch of salt in Olympic swimming pool and I'm like, okay, well that's kind of wrap your head around.

Speaker 1:          11:59          Now let's go the other side. Let's talk about something really small that we know of and how many times you have to break down that small particle to get to a peak of gram. So one grain of salt. I mean, we all know what that looks like, right? You put that in front of you and you split that. And I had mentioned this week, 50 million, it's actually 58 million. If you split that 58 million times the grain installed each one as a Pika gram. I mean it's in comprehensible, the detection level and how small that is. It really is. It's crazy. And how many Pico grams did they find in his system? So he's gone from, and I'll, I'll read through it here. So here's, here's since the initial appearance of the N three metabolite, here's what John's tests look like and those Pico gram readings. So the first one was collection date was July 28th, 2017.

Speaker 1:          12:50          He had a concentration of 80 Pika grams. However, let me caution, and I'll read something from, from an expert. When you get down to these picogram levels, um, the science is somewhat in exact because it's such a small amount. So the variable, the plus or minus, you know, can be anywhere from 2030. I've seen in some instances 50 or 60. So what this scientist's name? His name is Larry Bowers. Um, he was formerly the, the USADA science director. He's currently retired and independently consults. Before that he ran an Olympic, uh, Olympic committee, uh, accredited laboratory at the university of Indiana. The guy who's got 20 to 25 years of anti-doping experience. Here's what he, he told me about, uh, you know, when you're, when you're analyzing small picogram levels, although the two lab, uh, respective laboratories report a concentration, I would caution against becoming too fixated on the numbers.

Speaker 1:          13:52          First, the numbers are really estimates of concentration and probably should be considered a range of about plus or minus 20 picograms per ML. And he said that December 9th result would be in the range of John's a. We'll get to that between 60 and a hundred second while the adjustment of concentration by specific gravity attempts to deal with the variability of urinary excretion rates, it is an exact, it is inexact and adds variability to the estimates. Finally, most importantly, science has no clear understanding of the variance of urinary excretion of drugs that alter trace concentration. So basically saying, look, I mean we have a general idea how this works in science, but, and I think this instance comes to play, be real careful if you're going to be the guy with the pseudoscience out there saying, wait a second, John jumped from 20 to 60 from September to December and that means he re ingested it.

Speaker 1:          14:45          What he is saying here is slow your roll on that. That that it's such a small in comprehensible level that we don't really know what those variances are going to look like. Now, I think if we saw jumps and John from single single-digit eight or nine Pika gram to multiple hundred digit Pika grams, there would be a concern and maybe some [inaudible] administration, but the experts I've speaking to, when you're talking variability of 10 2030 40 it's not that significant at the peak of gram level. What is the window where this longterm metabolites starts to express itself? Like what you said, there's short term and there's medium term. This is the longterm. How long does it take before the launch? That's a good question. I don't have the answer to that. It may be in [inaudible] report here and I would encourage those that are home, you know, playing playing scientist at, at their computer.

Speaker 1:          15:36          Uh, the journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology, uh, raw chink OV writes report detection and mass spec spectrometric characterization of novel longterm dehydro chloro method, testosterone metabolites and human urine. I'm not sure when that longterm metabolite, how long it takes to to show up. Here's the problem though with this substance. He did a real brief study. My understanding is administered it to himself. That's the only study that exists. Oral Taranto ball, D, H C M T to my understanding is not approved for use for human consumption consumption anywhere, anywhere in any country. So you can't have clinical trials ethically in the medical world because it's just not legal to give this to human beings. So, you know, we're, we're already kind of behind the eight ball here and that, you know, as compared to other substances where you can do clinical trials cause they're readily available via prescription or whatever, this substance is not, the substance was created by the East Germans in the seventies and eighties and was part of their state sponsored doping program where they were doping their athletes.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Can you correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe what I've read is that this is particularly effective when people are cutting weight. Yeah. I mean is that true or is this just more, I don't know about that. I think some may be confusing. Torrential with oral Toronto ball, two completely different substances actually very important. Yeah. There's, there's very different effects on the body. There's very different windows in terms of detection time ex explain that. Yeah. You gotta be really careful in this world of performance enhancing drugs. There's names that are interchangeable. There's different, you know, chemical names where you change a little bit of that chemical name. It could mean me in a completely different substance. There's instances where the chemical name is different, but the substance is actually the same. So when trying to compare two substances, you know, make sure if you're at home doing that analysis, you're comparing the right ones straight to rent a ball is different than oral to rentable.

Speaker 1:          17:40          What is the difference? Uh, yeah, I can't tell you, I'm not as familiar with Toronto ball other than it's not oral to rentable. So, but there is a difference in terms the detection window. Yeah, there would be, I mean different substances create and throw out different metabolites. Um, and different substances have different detection windows. So I haven't done my study in research on straight to rent a ball other than knowing it's different than the substance here. So, uh, Gregory Richie Dankoff that's how you say his last name, right? He was the only guy to do an actual verified study. Correct. Know? Is this study been, is it been peer reviewed? Yeah, I mean it will. It's, it's published in the journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology. So in order to get something published, it needs to be peer reviewed. So th it's, has it been replicated anywhere?

Speaker 1:          18:27          Not that I'm aware of. No. So it's just so we have one study which is really fascinating, right? So we know that first of all, we know this is an effect of steroids. We know it works. Yeah. They use Germans I think showed that they wouldn't be a, had been using it. Um, it, it's not a difficult, it's not a easy, easy substance to get ahold of. Look, when it's not approved for use anywhere in the world, um, it's only available on the black market. Um, so you probably have to go to China to get it manufactured or, you know, research chemical supply company. It's not supposed to be provided to, to humans. Now, I'm certainly not attributing this to you, but there were rumors, this was one discussion. Was that one of the possible ways he could have ingested this, um, and this be very kind, John likes to party.

Speaker 1:          19:13          Okay. One of the things about partying is people do cocaine. One of the things about cocaine is sometimes cocaine is cut with Creotine. One of the things about creatine is oftentimes you're buying cheap. Creatine. I spent a little, one of the things that we've had with on it on, it's our, our products are all third party verified, but in the initial goings, when we tried different, uh, manufacturers, especially for alpha brain, we found there were other trace elements that were in alpha brain that weren't supposed to be in there. And it's because of the vats that they mix these things up with. And one of the things that we had heard was that creatine oftentimes is made in the same place where they might be making oral terenna ball. They might be making antibodies, they might be making a bunch of different things and trace amounts of this stuff can get into the creatine.

Speaker 1:          19:58          They use creatine to cut cocaine with, is this, is this possible or am I just, yeah, it's, it's absolutely a theory. I don't, you know, I, I can't sit here and said that happen, but I will have heard similar things. I have heard similar things. I know for a fact, based on my previous career, I worked closely with the DEA. I was with the FDA. I worked cases involving street distribution of recreational drugs, including cocaine. I know for a fact that 10 is one of the most common substances that cocaine is cut with because of the more little look. Yeah, some more color, some more feel. So getting back to McLaren's arbitration decision, I mean this, this is publicly available records, so I'm not saying anything new, but McLaren addresses at least John's lifestyle around this time. And he says the athlete openly admitted to USADA that prior to and for period of time after the reporting of his second adverse analytical finding on July 28 2017, the athlete used elicit so-called street drugs, including cocaine.

Speaker 1:          20:57          Now for me to sit here and say, Hey, that's where it came from. I don't know that that's the time period he's talking about the, the athlete admitted, um, that prior to and for a period of time after the reporting of his second adverse analytical finding on July 27, 2017 admitted. So before that test and sometime after. Okay. So does that make sense though? If it's cut, if that's what, where the source of it is, does it make sense that that would show up as a longterm metabolite? Doesn't it need a long time in the body to digest or do we not know enough about the window of time? Yeah. I don't know if we know enough about the window of time, you know, my, my theory and looking at it is even if there's a small amount of the oral terenna ball in that it's going to for a period of time show that parent compound at a small peak of gram amount and the short and midterm metabolites in the small Pika gram amount.

Speaker 1:          21:57          We have never seen those in the history of John's testing. It's only this longterm metabolite. So that may be indication that it occurred. Maybe even prior to what we're talking about here. Is it something that could be accentuated in some way by the weight cutting process? I absolutely think that could be a factor. Um, there is studies not necessarily with this, but, uh, another substance clomiphene and look, I want that while I'm cautioning people to be careful about comparing different substances. The commonality between clomiphene, which there are multiple clinical studies on cause it is approved for use to be distributed to humans and oral terenna ball is they're both chlorinated. So they both contain a chlorine atom on the molecule. And there is a recently published study on clomiphene and its excretion rates. Um, again for those at home that want to look it up.

Speaker 1:          22:55          The study was published in the endocrine society publication. It's pure reviewed. The name of it is HPT access effects and urinary detection following clomiphene administration and males. So what they did is they basically, you know, got a group of males, um, gave them, uh, a one month, um, cycle of clomiphene, you know, I think 25 milligrams a day and then had them get off and then continue to look at their urine up to 261 days after. And what you saw and what you see in this study is that pulsing effect. So, you know, I'm looking at some of the study subjects here. Um, subject one on day one 21 still showed a 147 Pika grams of clomiphene. Day one 28 showed a 174 Pika grams. Day one 35 shows nothing. He's below the minimum coating reporting limit. And then day one 49 he's back up to two 36 there are one, two, three, four, five, six out of I think 12 subjects in that study that showed this pulsing effect of this chlorinated substance coming and going again.

Speaker 1:          24:09          You know, it's, it's different than oral torrented ball, but it has that common factor of being chlorinated in this study. They do talk about, I'm a fat tissue called the, let me look this up and make sure I got this right. Adipose tissue, this is fat that surrounds the internal organs. It's one of the last things that the body burns when it's going, you know, starving itself and going to fat. It protects those organs. But yeah, you look at these, you know, extreme weight gains and cuts that the UFC athlete goes through. I don't think you're going to find possibly another human subject anywhere that goes through putting weight on other than cutting wrestling, maybe. I don't think Olympic wrestling matches with an MMA fighter. Um, goes through at least, you know, in my experience over these three or four years talking to those in the Olympic world.

Speaker 1:          24:57          I think we're at the extreme and it's, it's something obviously we've talked about before, we're trying to curtail, but you know, there's, there's clearly never been a study for anybody who dehydrates and ReadWrite hydrates themselves to the extent that some of our athletes do. You can never find that would never be anybody with any ethics that would support a study because some of that dehydration exceeds world health organization standards. So there's no studies out there, you know, on this stuff. But clearly, you know, looking from afar I, I'd say that it likely has some impact over what's being released by this adipose tissue. We should certainly talk about that in the future, about the, the weight cutting aspect of it. So th but this adipose tissue loss at extreme weight cuts could potentially be the reason why this stuff is excluding itself. It's definitely a theory out there.

Speaker 1:          25:47          What about micro-dosing? So here's the thing with micro-dosing micro-dosing is done with endogenous substances. So only test it. Well, I mean, someone could try it with something else, but the reason you microdose with endogenous substances is they're already produced in the body. Right? So the theory of, okay, I'm going to microdose oral terenna ball, will oral Toronto balls still producing the short term and longterm metabolites in theory, whether you're taking a hundred milligrams or one milligram of oral torrented ball, those excretion rates of those metabolites are still going to be consistent. They're going to be in a much smaller level, a way to bypass those excretion rates. Is there a way to mask that in some way? I'm not aware of any IPOs. Go ahead. I'm sorry. The only study we have is Gregory. Correct? That's it. Correct. But you know, just taking it from a common sense approach, it's, you know, those that know about micro grossing know that you microdose with endogenous substances, things that are already appearing in the body so your body knows what to do with them, knows what to do and you're fooling, you know, not only are these metabolizing and there's no metabolites of them, but you could also be fooling the biological passport.

Speaker 1:          27:00          That's the concern I think and why people microdose. So you saw it as looking not only testing for specific substances, but our testosterone epitestosterone ratios going up. They're looking at at blood values, how many young red blood cells, how many mature red blood cells. So microdosing in those two areas wouldn't set off alarms in the biological passport world. Um, I'd never heard personally of microdosing of exotic substances that are not found in the body. Microdosing in my understanding has done with things that are indogenous body for people that are not familiar with this terminology, we're just talking about microdosing performance enhancing drugs because a microdosing in today's world is a very common thing with mushrooms and LSD and a lot of right. I mean I saw a ton of microdosing in the cycling world that was testicles, testosterone, EPO, H HGH, H, all those natural occurring in the body.

Speaker 1:          27:56          And so they don't produce any really a red flag metabolites. If you do them at very, very small levels, they'll, the parent will clear quickly not produce any metabolites and will not throw off the biological passport analysis. Um, is there a what you mean when Victor Kanye came out with a clear and all that stuff with BALCO, they were fooling people. Is it, is it, I mean one of the things that we've talked about before is that it's a constant race to try to keep up with more advanced cheaters. It is. And you know, what's interesting in this, I mean without a talk to you and maybe the first time we did talk a couple of years ago, um, it, it's come a long way from them, but clearly if I would have talked to you 15, 16, 17 years ago when I got my start in the anti-doping world, I would have told you definitively the testing is way behind, you know, what's being used out there.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Um, they were testing, able to test to multiple nanogram, um, limits. That's as far down as we can go. Now they can go down to single digit Pika gram. There's another professional sports league out there that recently had a one Pika gram and three metabolite case. I mean do the math coming down from you know, four or five nanograms, which used to be the lower limit now to one peak of gram ten thousand twenty thousand times. I am almost under the theory that the pendulum has swung maybe a little bit too far in the other direction and that that certainly is part of my job to the UFC. Look, I want to catch every intentional cheater that's out there. I want to make sure we have a rock solid program, use all the latest and greatest, you know, um, techniques to do it. But I also want to keep an eye on it to make sure it's being administrated fairly.

Speaker 1:          29:40          And when you're getting down to detection of one, you know, single digit Pika grams, I have a concern that what kind of level of sensitivity we're talking about. Are we going to talk about environmental contamination where you walk, you know, through a room and somebody has just opened a container of something and there's, you know, minuscule powders in the air. There are documented cases that some of the regularly prescribed prescription drugs, specifically diuretics, are getting in water supplies in some areas. You know, you get a lot of old people on them that flushed their old, um, pills down the toilet. There's documented cases of it getting into the water supply and being detectable at that peak and gram level. So you've gotta be really, really careful about that. And I think, you know, this case exemplifies that you Sada and, and really the world anti-doping agency world and community are aware of that. Um, you know, with greater sensitivity and testing, in my opinion, because you know, makes greater responsibility to be objective and look fairly at what really we're doing here when we're detecting in that small amount.
