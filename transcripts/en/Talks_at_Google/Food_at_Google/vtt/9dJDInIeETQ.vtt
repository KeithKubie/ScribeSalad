SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN:
Welcome, everybody,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.870
to our panel discussion on the
evolution of Asian cuisine.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.080
I'm really happy to welcome
our guest chefs here

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.100
from the Asian Food Mafia, which
is a coalition of Asian chefs

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.010
and restaurateurs
based in New York City,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.020
throughout the boroughs.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.750
They kind of created this group
to help advance Asian cuisine

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.990
in the city, to
help each other out,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.900
and also really to drive the
conversation on how Asian

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.600
cuisine will be evolving
in the city and beyond.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.609
So I'll let the chefs
introduce themselves.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:38.400
CHRIS CHEUNG: Sure.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.230
I'm Chris Cheung, and I'm the
chef-owner of East Wind Snack

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.080
Shop in Brooklyn,
one in SoHo, and then

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.020
I also have Tansuo in
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.350
DORON WONG: My
name is Doron Wong.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.310
I own Rivers and Hill
Hospitality Group.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.740
We own and operate
Northern Tiger.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.480
We have a farm in upstate
New York that does chickens,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.150
USDA slaughterhouse.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.894
We also have a project
in Austin, Texas,

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:05.019
called the General Tso'Boy.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.900
EDWARD LIN: My name is Edward
Lin, along with my wife,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.740
Lien Lin.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.950
We're the chef-owners
of Bricolage,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.670
modern Vietnamese gastropub
in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.880
MEDWIN PANG: Hi.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.730
Medwin Pang, chef and
owner of Hunger Pang

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.380
in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.470
New American,
Asian-influenced, with a focus

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.628
on fresh and
seasonal ingredients.

00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:34.900
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Cool.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.550
So let's start with an easy
question for all of you,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.050
or maybe not.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.345
What-- kind of tell us--

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.470
walk us through quickly
what your story is, kind of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.860
what brought you to the Asian
food scene in New York City,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.072
and what brought you
to Asian Food Mafia.

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:48.780
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.030
So for me, I grew up in
Chinatown in Manhattan a long,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.420
long time ago, and grew up as
an Asian-American eating lots

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.030
of Chinese food in
Chinatown, grew up on that,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.000
with my grandmother and my
mother and the whole family.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.979
And you know, we lived
that immigrant experience.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.890
My grandmother and
grandfather came in to America

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.720
in the 1920s, and they settled
in a tenement in Chinatown,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.740
and they had six kids, one
of them being my mother.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.680
And we all grew up in that one
very small two-bedroom tenement

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.470
house on Mott
Street in Chinatown.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.310
And my mother,
later on, moved out.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.300
We moved to Brooklyn.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.720
So I had kind of had the
American experience living

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.430
in Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn, at the time.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.100
And if you can
tell, this accent,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.170
I grew up with a lot of Italian
and Irish Americans out there.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.876
And you know, I went
to school there.

00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:48.500
But we'd always come
back to Chinatown.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.310
That was always home,
coming back to Chinatown,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.020
going out to eat
with the family.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.060
And I grew up from
there, and became a chef

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.310
a little later on, and
used a lot of those

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.090
experiences I had to
influence my food.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.200
Shooting all the way up to
kind of the present day,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.240
last year I formed
the Asian Food Mafia.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.204
I had opened up East
Wind Snack Shop.

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:15.620
And I made a lot
of friends when I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.950
did that, so everybody included
here became a very good friend.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.330
We're chef-owners of
Asian restaurants.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.370
And I thought,
what a great idea.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.560
You know, a lot of
us are out there now.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.770
Asian food is a big deal now.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.620
It's mainstream.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.850
But we're all independent.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.020
We're all solo.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.250
We're all kind of
out there on our own.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.080
And I thought we'd have a
bigger voice banding together,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.830
you know, to do a
whole bunch of things.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.740
Influencing the way Asian
food is doing right now

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.900
in New York City, that
was an important thing.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.330
Another important
thing was to have

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.960
a voice about what it is
to be an Asian-American

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.130
and run a restaurant
in this city.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.540
And then also just to hang out
with a bunch of chef friends,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.970
and talk shop, and be able
to kind of get together

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.390
once a month and rant and rave
about what drives you crazy,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.800
and to have some
support with that.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.300
And these guys-- and we also
have a longer membership

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.709
of some guys that weren't
able to make it here today,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.210
but we have a nice group of
about seven or eight chefs

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.930
that we get together, we
hang out once a month,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.490
we plan events like this.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.350
And you know, we
let off some steam.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.020
So all cool stuff.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.340
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Your story?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.506
DORON WONG: Well, my story's
a little bit different.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.220
I started in Boston.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.590
I'm from Boston.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.100
And I started when I was 14,
just for fun, just, you know,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.560
when you're kids, you
just kind of figure

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.090
that you just want
to do something

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.630
to just get out of the house.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.530
And I ended up getting a job
in this California bistro,

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.900
and I was making pizzas,
answering phones.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.500
And it just kind
of created a lot

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.530
of curiosity of like, oh,
OK, how do you make that?

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.130
And you know, I was working
straight through high school.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.560
Then I went-- you
know, I kind of

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.020
thought that that was
going to be my calling.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.780
And I went to culinary
school, and right

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.200
after culinary school,
went to New York City,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.615
because if you're going to
go anywhere in the world,

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.490
you're going to have to
come to New York City

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.900
and work with the best.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.050
And I spent some time
with David Burke.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.500
This is kind of like his
earlier years at Park Ave Cafe.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.540
I don't know if you guys
know what Park Ave Cafe is.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.770
And then I was there.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.720
You know, being the
Chinese in the kitchen,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.970
you're always being picked on.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.230
Like, you know,
oh, he's Chinese.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.646
Why isn't he cooking
Chinese food?

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:44.450
You know?

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.910
And it just kind
of made me think,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.570
maybe I should actually
kind of learn my roots,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.620
and I should go back
and cook Chinese food.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.870
So I actually packed my
bags and went to Hong Kong.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.380
I was like 18 years old.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.830
And I went to Hong
Kong, spent time

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.520
in the kitchen in Hong
Kong, Singapore, you know,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.860
got beaten down.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.100
You know, even in the United
States, we're Chinese,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.637
and then when we're
in Asia, we're--

00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:20.470
they called me-- this
is funny, because they

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.230
called me "banana," because
I was literally white,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.000
but I'm yellow.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.720
You know?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.180
So you know, it's
trying to fit in.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.860
Came back to New York, worked
at a bunch of places, you know,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.310
United Nations.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.050
And then I was like,
you know, I think

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.260
I really need to really
concentrate on one thing

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.960
that I feel very
passionate about.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.110
And that's how I
actually started

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.740
to do very regional
Chinese cooking.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.790
And that's kind of
what really drove me

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.290
into what we do right now.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.230
Especially with the
support group, you know,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.325
it's a lot easier.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.680
LIEN LIN: Well, I'm--

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.850
my parents are refugees.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.700
I'm a refugee from Vietnam.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.010
My parents fled to Hong
Kong, where I was born,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.350
and then we were sponsored
to the United States

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.180
by a Catholic church.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.020
And my parents ended up
doing restaurant work here,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.210
because, you know,
they were uneducated,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.240
came from a really
small town in Vietnam.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.170
And so I grew up in the
restaurant industry.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.130
And all my memories,
fondest memories,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.300
was surrounded by
food and family.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.050
That's where I was most happy.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.692
And both my parents
cook, so I decided

00:07:36.692 --> 00:07:38.650
to follow in their
footsteps, which, of course,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.610
they were not happy about
when I was a teenager.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.412
And I'm just very
passionate about food.

00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:46.870
I want to stay
close to my culture,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.370
because I've already
lost the language.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.203
My parents coming here
to the United States,

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.850
they wanted to learn
English, and so

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.010
they didn't speak
to us in Chinese,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.980
so we would learn the language.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.800
And this is the way I
connect to who I am,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.050
and I don't want to lose that.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.500
And so then I went into
the restaurant industry,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.820
worked with Charles Phan at the
Slanted Door for over 10 years.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.460
And then my husband and
I made our way over here

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.990
and we opened our first
restaurant in Brooklyn.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.330
And we're very happy to
be a part of this group.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.810
And I think, yeah, all our
voices banding together really

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.660
help propel, or change
what we're trying to do

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.220
with Asian food culture here.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.220
EDWARD LIN: I grew up in kind of
like Santa Cruz and Palo Alto,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.630
in California, where your
other part of Google is.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.410
But I actually grew up--

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.050
it wasn't so connected
with food and everything.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:04.450
It was an academic science
background from my dad.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.594
And I went through college,
and at some point, something

00:09:10.594 --> 00:09:12.760
kind of clicked in my head,
and said, you know what?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.250
I don't know if I
want to work in a lab

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.572
or work on a computer
for the near future.

00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:21.530
LIEN LIN: It was fate
that brought us together.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.630
We met in culinary school.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.129
Yeah.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.986
EDWARD LIN: I went
to culinary school.

00:09:24.986 --> 00:09:27.110
I saw her there the first
day, and I was like, aah!

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.235
LIEN LIN: We fell in love,
and the rest is history.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.052
A restaurant and two
kids later, here we are.

00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:36.340
EDWARD LIN: But I worked
in some of the best fine

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.020
French kitchens,
even with Daniel Humm

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.740
when he was over
in San Francisco.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.370
And at some point,
I met Charles,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.310
and started working at
Slanted Door as well.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.290
Learning about Asian
cuisine, learning

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.820
about a different way of
kind of looking and thinking

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.960
about how cuisine--

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.200
how food fits with the culture
and the history of the culture

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.870
is like, a lot of the
history of a culture

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.990
is really based on its food.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:20.970
And definitely it's been an
evolution of thought there.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.980
MEDWIN PANG: Right on.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.480
OK, well, I'm going to take
it back before my time.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.730
My father is from Hong Kong.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.910
We have a little village
there, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.960
in the Fanling area in
the New Territories.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.690
My father had to flee Hong
Kong for whatever reasons.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.860
I don't know.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.350
Being a British colony, UK
passport, ends up in the UK,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.060
where he meets my mom.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.430
They do a few things there.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.260
He had a couple of restaurants.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.590
And then one was blown
up by the IRA, which

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.010
we took the insurance money
and then moved to Brooklyn

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.190
when I was just a month old.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.890
And then my father was, like,
a purveyor to restaurants.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.810
He supplied restaurants
with, you know,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.790
all their wares and
goods and everything.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.990
And my mother worked in
the hospitality industry,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.930
like in hotels, like the
Plaza, Waldorf Astoria.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.420
So I'm coming from two
different sides, right?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.360
Like, there was the food
side and then there was the,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.630
I guess, the upscale
world of hospitality.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.370
And being super fortunate
to be in New York,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.130
I got my start when I was 17.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.810
And I worked in a few kitchens.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.750
And then I was looking for a
job, and just by dumb luck--

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.560
I didn't even know what
three-star food was--

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.102
I walked into Park Avenue Cafe
and dropped off my resume,

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.060
and they brought me in.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.960
I thought I was going
in for an interview.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.043
So I was wearing, you know,
like a button-up shirt

00:11:48.043 --> 00:11:49.110
and everything.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.860
And they're like, no,
you're here to cook.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.985
And so they threw me whites
and I was like, oh, OK.

00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:54.770
And got in, got
the job, and then

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.680
that was my entrance
into fine dining.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.560
Hopped around from
different restaurants.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.890
And starting so young, working
14 hours a day for years,

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.710
and not having any
holidays-- like,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.170
Thanksgiving didn't exist,
Christmas didn't exist,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.610
New Year's didn't exist.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.200
Like, you're kind
of like a myth.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.640
You don't really exist.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.100
You only exist in
your work, right?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.480
And so when I was 27, I was
kind of a little bit burnt out.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.980
And so I left the restaurant.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.250
So I was doing graphic
design as a hobby,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.590
and the timing was perfect,
because a buddy of mine

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.100
just took over the art
director's position

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.980
at this startup, at the
time called Vitamin Water.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.070
So he asked me if I
wanted to come on board,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.020
and I did, and I was
doing print production.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.310
I was doing all packaging,
labels, and all of that.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.610
And then Coca-Cola
came in, took us on,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.090
and so I stuck with them for
a number of years, you know,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.194
for obvious reasons.

00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:58.610
They take care of
their employees,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.730
like I'm sure you guys are
well taken care of now.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.080
And then layoffs happened.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.350
I got hit by a round.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.035
And where we live, my wife
and I, she was like, well,

00:13:12.035 --> 00:13:13.160
you know, you have an idea.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.960
You're only happy when you're
talking about food-- eating

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.140
food, cooking food.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.280
And this neighborhood
needs something.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.510
We have a concept.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.010
Let's see if we
can make it happen.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:26.180
Stars align, shop becomes
available, and then next thing

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.130
you know, Hunger Pang exists.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.570
And here we are, three
years in, and yeah.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.080
I mean, it was really--

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.410
it was stressful,
because I mean,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.180
I'm completely independent.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.680
It's only me and my wife.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.410
We don't have any
investors, no partners

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.140
to share the responsibility.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.120
So everything falls on me.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.460
So when Chris came
up with this idea,

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.917
and thought of this
group, like, it was.

00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:54.000
Like, for me, at first, I
was like, wait a second.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.041
There's other people that
are going to understand

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:58.070
exactly what I'm dealing with?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.870
And that first
night that we met,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.940
we all just clicked
immediately, because it is.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.200
It's really-- it's
special to have--

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.740
I mean, because what we do is
so unique, and it takes so much

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.700
of your time, and
there's not a lot

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.190
of people that
understand what we do

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.800
and the amount that
it requires from you.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.020
So to have people that know
what you're going through really

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.230
is wonderful.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.412
So yeah, that's my story, and
that's how I ended up here.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.870
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Thank you
all for sharing your stories.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.100
Sounds like quite a
diverse group, and quite

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.980
a diverse number of
backgrounds and reasons

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.340
for jumping into the
restaurant industry.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.150
I think a common
thread that I'm hearing

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.159
is you all kind of stumbled
into AFM, Asian Food Mafia,

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:48.200
and found that it was just
really helpful to you.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.575
Can you tell me
a little bit more

00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:52.250
about what the group has done
for you, as a restaurateur,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.440
as a chef?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.830
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well, as Medwin
was kind of just alluding to,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.600
as anybody who has ambitions
to be great in the restaurant

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.270
business, at some
point in your career,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.610
you find yourself alone.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.520
You know, your family is
there, but they don't really

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.620
understand what you go through--

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.320
the long hours, the
dedication to cooking.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.560
There's many facets to
the restaurant business

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.670
that you have to put your hands
into when you start to become--

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.960
and run your own place.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.234
So you do find yourself out
there by yourself, alone,

00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:29.150
and having to deal with
a lot of the stresses.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.680
And you're talking money stress.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.990
You're talking about the
everyday stress of what

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.970
happens in a restaurant.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.940
You know, a water pipe busts.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.560
The garbage didn't
get picked up.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.640
One of the cooks
doesn't show up.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.610
And this happens
on a daily basis.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:50.120
So you find yourself looking
for ways to kind of relieve

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.050
some of these things.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.880
And you know, life
is life, right?

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.784
So you find yourself
really-- kind of you

00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:56.450
take it as it comes,
and you keep going,

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.080
and you just keep going forward.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.670
But I think what
Asian Food Mafia has

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.460
done, in an intangible way--

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.790
you know, there's tangible
things that we've done.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.565
We do events, and we've done
some things for charities.

00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:13.190
And we'll get to that
in a few minutes.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.950
But intangibly, what it's
done for each one of us

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.880
is let us have an avenue
to figure some things out

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.240
with like minds.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.310
And when you put on top of
that that we're also kind of--

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.820
we share the same
origins of culture,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.500
and we've kind of gone through
the same things as Asians

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:40.320
in this business that are kind
of unique to our own problems,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.840
it definitely is a good
thing to kind of be

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.769
able to pick up the phone,
or send a text or a message

00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:47.560
and be like, can you
help me out with this?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.050
Or can you help
me out with that?

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:54.030
And everybody in the group
will respond with the way

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.990
that they think that
they can help you.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.860
And when you do find yourself
alone in this business

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.480
and know that you can rely on
some really good friends that

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.400
know exactly what
you're going through,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.319
it makes for a really,
really cool thing.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.525
So that's, you know.

00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:10.650
LIEN LIN: Yeah, I think
definitely the support part

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.609
of it-- emotionally,
mentally, and physically--

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.484
has helped all of us make
it through a day or two.

00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:20.609
Even if it's like, oh, can
I borrow your dishwasher

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.089
who's off today, because
mine didn't show up.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.510
Or, words of advice, sharing
purveyors and contact

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.980
information, has
been very invaluable.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.110
And just sharing our stories
and our love and passion

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.695
for food, because opening a
restaurant is not about, oh,

00:17:36.695 --> 00:17:37.320
I love to cook!

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.590
Let me open a restaurant!

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.325
It is nothing like
that, let me tell you.

00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:43.575
DORON WONG: You're the
bookkeeper, you're the plumber,

00:17:43.575 --> 00:17:45.014
you're the electrician.

00:17:45.014 --> 00:17:46.930
LIEN LIN: When you're
knee-deep in the sewers,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.550
scooping out because of the
flooding in the basement.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.890
EDWARD LIN: I mean, it's
kind of entrepreneurship--

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.860
well, it is absolutely
entrepreneurship.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.150
But a restaurant
encompasses, I think,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:05.520
every aspect of a
business, and usually

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.950
in such a small capacity
that you kind of

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.040
have to wear all these hats.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.580
And that was something that
kind of drew me to the business,

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.250
is you're not just
focused on one thing.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.950
You're focused on-- or
you're wearing every hat.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:28.800
You're doing HR, PR,
finances, cooking,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.925
mechanical,
electrical, plumbing.

00:18:30.925 --> 00:18:31.800
LIEN LIN: Counseling.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.758
EDWARD LIN: Counseling.

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:34.870
A lot of counseling nowadays.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.110
Let me tell you, it's-- yeah.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.110
LIEN LIN: Millennials.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:44.190
EDWARD LIN: Hand-holding
cooks, and babysitting,

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:52.110
and getting everyone into a good
mental morale, a nice morale

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.930
space.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:59.160
That really is such a key
part of running the business.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.070
LIEN LIN: Or trying to
run a successful business.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.310
EDWARD LIN: And then finding
a way to get your message out

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.090
there so that people
come, because especially

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.970
in New York, that's
the hardest part.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.120
MEDWIN PANG: And aside from
the challenges that we can all

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.270
help each other with, and being
part of that support group, one

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.630
of the, I guess,
more enjoyable things

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.660
that we get to do together
is, during our meetings,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.612
every so often, we'll do it in
each one of our restaurants.

00:19:28.612 --> 00:19:30.320
And I think the last
one was at my place.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.830
Was it at my place?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.090
Yeah?

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.940
So when I'm thinking of
new dishes, I'm like, well,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.279
you know, I ask my customers.

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:38.820
Like, I put out a
plate and I'm like,

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.903
what do you think of this?

00:19:39.903 --> 00:19:41.880
And 90% of the
time, they're going

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.000
to tell you, oh, it's great,
without any real, critical

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.960
feedback.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.340
But being surrounded
by your peers,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.220
if I put a dish
in front of them,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.690
I remember each of
their critiques on it.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.500
So you get great
feedback from things

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.510
that you're trying to
work on and develop.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.670
And also, when you
go to other houses,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.660
you can be inspired by things
that the rest of the group

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.650
are doing.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.880
So yeah.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.080
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, we've
gotten close, very close,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.100
over the last couple
of years, where

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.220
as a chef, when you're the
chef of your own restaurant,

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.620
you have people under
you that are great cooks.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.410
But to kind of band together
with a group of really talented

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.350
chefs that are on
your level and we're

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.740
all kind of rising up together,
that's a really, really

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.510
cool thing to have.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.110
Everybody kind of likens it,
you know, when we were kids,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.210
you wanted to join a band.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.420
And you listen to
the great musicians,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.310
and they all kind of come
together and they play.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.190
When we do events,
it's kind of like that,

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.150
when you kind of look over
and you see five or six really

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.650
good chefs that
are on your level,

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.460
and you're all cooking together,
and you all kind of have

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.210
the same thing going
forward, the same goals.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.170
And then the same
goals long-term

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.860
for your restaurant,
but the same goals

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.520
for the instantaneous moment
of how food comes out.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.541
And when you're
cooking together,

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:14.040
it's one of those things that
kind of really gets you going,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.150
gives you a rush.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.824
And you kind of hold onto
that rush for a while.

00:21:17.824 --> 00:21:19.740
DORON WONG: It's funny
because a lot of people

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.245
would think we're supposed
to be competition, you know?

00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:26.370
Especially these guys are
in the same neighborhood,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.450
but shouldn't you
guys be competitive?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.710
CHRIS CHEUNG: We
have customers, I

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.685
have customers, that come in
and rave about his restaurant,

00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:37.170
and say he's one of the
favorites that they go to.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.480
And I'm glad.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.840
I'm really happy that we can
share a customer base that's

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.150
happy with both our spaces.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.080
DORON WONG: Yeah, I'm also very
glad that it's not about doing

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.580
better than the other person.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.760
It's about-- because
I feel like we're

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.040
a little bit behind in the Asian
food, that we're able to kind

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.870
of elevate it together.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.820
I think a lot of people
really do understand

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.390
that Chinese food and--

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.725
I can say "Chinese food," right?

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:11.225
Yeah.

00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:11.940
Chinese food.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.249
People don't pay for
Chinese food, right?

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:16.790
Especially, I had this problem
when I had a restaurant called

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.060
Yunnan Kitchen.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.000
And everyone's like, aw,
man, your place is so small.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.640
And why is this
different than Chinatown?

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.410
How can Chinatown--
you actually have

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.430
a plate of noodles
that's, like, $5,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.520
and it's four times your size?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.580
And for us, I think
we're all trying

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.910
to kind of elevate what we do.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.090
We're using clean food.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.100
I think a lot of it is clean.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.990
I know they push a lot of
clean, sustainable food as well.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.330
And we're doing that
together, as a group.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.970
It's very hard to change
people's perception

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.540
of what Chinese food is,
especially Chinese food.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.690
You know, everyone thinks ghetto
Chinese food is General Tso

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.649
chicken with this yellow
fried rice, and it's--

00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:07.231
MEDWIN PANG: In a
Styrofoam container.

00:23:07.231 --> 00:23:10.380
DORON WONG: Yeah, and it's got
to have a can of Coke for $5.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.640
LIEN LIN: Vietnamese
food is banh mi and pho.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.120
But there's so much
more to Vietnamese food.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.330
There are so many dishes
and different regions

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.160
of the cuisine that people
haven't explored yet.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.400
And to be able to serve it in
the kind of setting that we

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.010
serve it in, and the beverage
program that we offer

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.195
alongside with the food, is
just a different experience

00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:35.310
that I wanted to bring
to the neighborhood.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.340
EDWARD LIN: I mean, it's
definitely one thing.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.530
You know, you can go to a
pizza-by-the-slice joint

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.400
and get a slice for $1.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.730
You can go to Roberta's and
buy a pie for $20-something.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.490
And one is not the
same as the other.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.065
And the same thing
with Asian food.

00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:04.710
A take-out Asian place versus
one of our restaurants,

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.360
or other restaurants
that are really

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.460
trying to push good
quality food, good service,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.190
good atmosphere and
decor and everything,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.610
they're two completely
different things.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.680
And while a lot of
people might say

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.530
that this dish is
expensive, but if you

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.170
take that same amount of--

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.600
like, a pork chop, right?

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.410
You take a pork
chop, same amount

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.860
of meat, same cut, same
purveyor, same farm, and you

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:40.110
go to a New American place and
you say, OK, $27, no problem.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.270
You go to an Asian
place, wow, $27.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.980
That's like-- you know, I can
get it for $12 at Chinatown.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.800
Yeah, but they're
buying commodity meat.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.250
They're giving you
a thin, crappy pork

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.200
chop, or whatever it is.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.690
It's a completely
different item,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.180
and it should be
compared with cuisine

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.680
from any culture that's doing
at the same kind of level.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.230
Same thing with
atmosphere and decor.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.560
And a lot of what you actually
pay for in a restaurant

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.460
is an experience, is service,
is decor, music, lighting,

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:24.420
and just being able to go
there, have a good time, relax.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.720
And that's worth
something, versus going

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.890
into a fluorescent-lit--

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.640
LIEN LIN: Which is a
great experience too.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.480
EDWARD LIN: Which can
also be a lot of fun.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.160
LIEN LIN: It is.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.870
It depends on the
mood and the day.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.980
Like, I love going there
and eating that food too.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.530
But I think that to get
together as Asian Food Mafia,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.930
we are trying to
elevate that experience

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.747
at an Asian restaurant.

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.580
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: So
I mean, definitely it

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.690
sounds like one
of the challenges

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.910
with Asian food in New
York, and I think elsewhere,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.310
is kind of the stigma
associated with Asian food.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.620
It makes it more
difficult to open and have

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.330
a successful Asian restaurant.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.310
What are some of the
ways in which, I think,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:07.522
being in the Asian cuisine space
has helped or inspired or kind

00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:09.230
of changed how you've
run your restaurant

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.920
and how you've set the goals
for yourself as a chef?

00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:15.690
LIEN LIN: That's still working.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.520
I mean, I always--

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.470
when it comes down to
it, I always look deep

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.700
inside my heart
and feel like this

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.210
is the story I want to share.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.460
This is something that's
near and dear to my heart,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.070
because this is my
culture and my family.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.600
And I want to be able to
share it with the world,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.832
or that's what I'm trying to do.

00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:39.040
EDWARD LIN: I mean, I think--

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.050
while we did choose to
open Asian restaurants,

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.660
I think that really
they chose us,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.090
because of our
culture and heritage.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.960
I mean, we've all worked
in Western restaurants.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.130
I worked for years in fine
French and Park Ave Cafe,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:06.800
and you've worked in
Jean-Georges and everything.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.710
So we've seen the American
side, the French side.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:17.110
And we've done that
and are perfectly

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:21.720
capable of opening a French
bistro or an Italian place or--

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.920
we're all talented
chefs, and we're all

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.990
perfectly capable of doing it.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.590
But this is a culture that
in one way or another,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.800
we came up in.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.890
And so it kind of chooses
you, almost as a way.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.530
But it's something
that you definitely

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:45.760
want to turn around and be
able to share and expand

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.230
people's understanding of
the food and the culture,

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.000
and kind of also
help evolve it, too.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.160
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, I
think as Asian food goes--

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:03.040
whether it's Chinese,
Vietnamese, a mix--

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.510
it's mainstream now.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.400
There's a lot of interest in it.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.860
But I don't like what
you were talking about as

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.110
far as price points.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.510
I don't think it's hit
its sweet spot yet,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.940
in terms of point of views.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.380
So while somebody can
have a dollar slice

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.370
and still appreciate
paying $30 for a Di Fara's

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.600
pizza or a wood-fired-oven
pizza, some of that

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.240
hasn't translated over to
Asian food yet as well.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.750
And there is-- no
matter how well

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.260
you cook, no matter what kitchen
you've been brought up in

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.100
and how much you stick to
that discipline of using

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:48.280
great ingredients, using
technique that is, I guess,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.640
kind of connected to
going the extra mile

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.890
in the kitchen,
some of that doesn't

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:55.660
get appreciated as well.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.300
And people just kind
of stick to what

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.500
they've known for
food in Chinatown,

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.180
food on the lower-end scale.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.570
So you know, [INAUDIBLE]
still hasn't been told.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.830
And that's why we're here.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.970
And we're doing our best to
try to make that a thing,

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:20.200
and to stand out and say,
hey, it's the 21st century.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.260
There's lots of Asian
people in America.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.980
There's lots of Asian
people in New York City.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.240
And we can make this food in
the image that we want to,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.280
and the way we were
brought up with it,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.780
and it doesn't always just have
to be $3 orders in Chinatown.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.510
It can be something else.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:45.730
I'm not kind of comparing it in
terms of better, because when

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.680
I'm getting off of
work, I go to Chinatown,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.910
and I love eating in Chinatown.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.490
I love eating in Koreatown.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.064
I love that food.

00:29:54.064 --> 00:29:55.480
But when you have
your restaurant,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.450
and you want to make
the food you want to,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.160
but you want to incorporate
the things you grew up

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.430
loving to eat and grew
up loving to cook,

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.620
but you have all these other
things in front of you,

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.040
like great sustainable
responsible ingredients,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.120
like a brigade of cooks that
have an ambition to cook things

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.741
with the higher
technical skill, you

00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:16.240
want to bring those
things together.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.448
I mean, that's a great thing.

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.550
You want to show that off.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.656
And there are certain stigmas
in the culture of this city

00:30:22.656 --> 00:30:24.280
and in the culture
of this country that

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.960
are kind of not letting
that happen quick enough.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.880
So that's one of our goals,
is to kind of speed up

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.970
that evolution of food,
in terms of Asian cuisine.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.992
So, you know, and I think
we're getting there.

00:30:36.992 --> 00:30:39.200
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: What
are the changing-- or, yeah.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.700
Go ahead.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.533
DORON WONG: Well, there's
little exceptions.

00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:50.270
Like, people will pay $300 a
head for sushi, no problem.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.880
But they won't pay $300
a head for Chinese food.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.772
And that's really what
we're trying to do.

00:30:57.772 --> 00:30:58.480
EDWARD LIN: Yeah.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.540
And we've discussed
this as a group.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.090
We've really thought about it.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.280
We've had some
articles and reporters

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.390
talk to us about, like, what
do you think about these--

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.770
why that is?

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.690
And you know, it
does come back to--

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.640
we've thought about it.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.560
It kind of comes
back to the culture

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.310
of how a certain
culture was brought

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.100
to America, how a certain--

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.460
like, whether it was
refugees that came across

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.070
or whether it was--

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.700
like, in the case
of Japanese cuisine,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.880
a lot of American
soldiers went to Japan

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.870
and experienced Japanese
cuisine at its finest,

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.150
and then came back
with a taste for sushi

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.620
and an understanding
of the quality,

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:58.380
whereas with a lot of Chinese
and South Asian cultures,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.370
it's refugees that came across.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.190
It was-- like, in
the case of Chinese,

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.480
it was workers that came
across and worked on railways.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.490
And they brought what they
could of their cuisine,

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:18.940
but had to change it for local
reasons, for local tastes.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.520
And that's really
where the birth

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.140
of American Chinese
cuisine is from.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.220
You go to China, there's
no Kung Pao chicken.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.390
There's no-- I mean,
General Tso's chicken.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.489
Have you seen "Searching
for General Tso?"

00:32:36.489 --> 00:32:38.280
There is no General
Tso's chicken in China.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.250
Just none.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.860
There's no fortune
cookies in China.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.359
None.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.150
LIEN LIN: I love General Tso's.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.510
EDWARD LIN: These
are things that are--

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.150
and sweet and sour pork is
a completely different dish,

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.390
completely 100% different.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.790
And that's because the food
that is in the Chinese take-out

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.890
places, that's an American food.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:07.725
It's sweet, it's fast, it's
kind of a guilty pleasure.

00:33:07.725 --> 00:33:08.350
LIEN LIN: Yeah.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.225
When my parents-- growing
up in a restaurant,

00:33:10.225 --> 00:33:14.270
we had that Asian restaurant
in upstate New York.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.110
And what they cooked
for the customers

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.640
and what we ate for family meal
was completely different food.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.786
And I considered it two
different types of food.

00:33:23.786 --> 00:33:25.910
And now that my-- and we
grew up in the restaurant.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.880
And now my uncle--

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.730
my cousin makes sushi now.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.480
And he's laughing all
the way to the bank.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.479
He's like, I don't even
have to cook this stuff!

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.100
I just cut it and put
it on a piece of rice.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.170
Way less work for him.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:43.570
EDWARD LIN: But it's kind
of how the cultures got

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.040
introduced to the country.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:54.880
And so when the initial
point of exposure

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.500
is cheap Chinese
food from a take-out,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.950
then all Chinese food
becomes generalized,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.680
and it becomes cheap.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.739
When the initial
point of contact

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.380
is a high-end sushi
restaurant, then you

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.420
just expect sushi
to be expensive,

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.510
and you're OK with paying it.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.820
Korean is kind of
halfway in between.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.110
It can be expensive,
it can be cheap.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:30.639
But definitely, Chinese,
South Asian, even Indian,

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.570
for the most part, it's
considered cheaper.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.560
I mean, if you think
about Western cultures,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.370
like, Mexican food has the same
kind of connotation, right?

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.090
There are some amazing Mexican
cuisines, or [INAUDIBLE],,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.672
Central American
cuisines, but you

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:51.130
don't pay for it,
because you know,

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.350
tacos, burritos,
those are cheap.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:00.000
And whereas like French,
yeah, you pay for it.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.910
Italian, sure, you
pay for Italian.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.190
But Italian's kind of halfway
there as well in Europe,

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.990
because you have
some cheap Italian,

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.770
you have some good Italian.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.870
So really thinking
about cultures

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:16.360
and how they fit into the
economic structure of America

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.240
and all that, it's in the
back of your head kind of,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.120
and you try to find
a way, all right,

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.389
how do we make this
more acceptable, more--

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.680
like, how do we make it better?

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.290
How do we make it something
that not just Asians in New York

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.460
appreciate, but everyone?

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.940
And you do that.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.840
MEDWIN PANG: So obviously,
it's a pain point for our group

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.390
that Asian food,
Chinese food, is

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:48.640
expected to be less expensive
than any other food out there.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.800
I have a 10-ounce grass-fed New
York strip steak on my menu.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.600
But I only charge $30 for it.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.450
That's because of where I am.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.720
Where I am in Flatbush,
four blocks away, there's

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.970
Chinese take-out joints
that have, like, still

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.530
bulletproof glass
in them, you know,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.430
where you can get a
lunch special for $4.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.610
And you could feed two
or three people from it.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.720
So yeah, I guess what
we're trying to do

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.670
is to erase what's been
ingrained in people's

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.940
head about what the
expectation is of Chinese food.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.050
One being quality
of ingredients,

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.950
and second being price point,
and then another being service.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.260
So it's like, OK,
if you step into--

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.470
and it's not only any
of our restaurants.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.830
It's just like, if you step
into a new, modern place,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.020
you have to approach
it with an open mind.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.140
You can't carry any of
those stigmas with you.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.870
Otherwise, you're
closing yourself

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.162
off from the experience.

00:36:50.162 --> 00:36:52.620
So if you walk into a new place
that you haven't tried yet,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.089
you don't know
anything about, you

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:56.130
have to have an open mind,
because if you already

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.500
have these
preconceptions of them,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.340
then you're missing out
on the possibilities

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.459
that a place could do for you.

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:09.750
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Speaking
of preconceptions, I mean,

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.656
one of the things that kind
of was brought up repeatedly

00:37:12.656 --> 00:37:14.280
is kind of the Chinese
food that people

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.404
are used to might not even
be the Chinese food that

00:37:16.404 --> 00:37:18.070
kind of Chinese
people eat at home,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.840
or kind of the immigrants
who came here actually

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.896
still eat at home.

00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:24.270
So can you talk
a little bit more

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:28.270
about how you guys as, I think,
restaurant owners and chefs

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.630
kind of walk that line
between authenticity,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.470
kind of innovation, and
also just cooking the food

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.180
that you're used to eating?

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.300
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well,
for me, actually, it

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:45.540
takes a different spin, because
I'm actually now grieving

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.970
over the loss of a
lot of restaurants

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.070
that I used to go to
that are now closed,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.770
and a lot of [INAUDIBLE]
restaurants in Chinatown.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.870
And so those type
of restaurants,

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.470
to go back to when I
grew up, in Chinatown,

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.160
my parents and my grandparents,
that whole community

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.950
came over in the early 1900s.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.514
By the 1930s, '40s, '50s,
they all started businesses

00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:12.930
in Chinatown, and
they all started

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.480
restaurants, some of
which became iconic

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.220
through the community
in Chinatown,

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.990
places that we always
would go to just to make

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.430
us happy with food.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:28.260
And you go to today, and
most of those restaurants

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.040
are gone, because the
owners of those restaurants

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.540
lived the American dream.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.160
So they worked hard.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.360
They had children.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.320
They worked really hard to put
those children into college.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.150
Those children went
to college, grew up,

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.350
and now they're doctors
and lawyers and engineers

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:51.600
and professionals like that,
and the restaurant now is old.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.455
The owner, who's the father
and the mother, are now old,

00:38:55.455 --> 00:38:57.210
and they can't do the
restaurant anymore.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.710
Who do they give
this restaurant to?

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.750
The kids don't want it.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.583
Right, the kids are now
doctors and lawyers.

00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.820
They do not want to
go back to Chinatown

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.590
and run and operate
a restaurant.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:12.000
And so those restaurants
close and a new guard

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.410
comes into Chinatown.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.520
You have this new stuff.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.550
But I'm not ready to
let go of the old stuff

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.760
yet and move on
to the new stuff.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.540
I still love those restaurants,
and I still really kind

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.040
of long to eat that food.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:33.060
And so as a chef, I'm trying
to, in certain dishes that I do,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.870
try to recreate that
experience for my customers,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.740
just like it made me
happy as a kid growing up

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.330
eating that food in Chinatown.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.190
So you know, it doesn't even--

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.190
you guys don't even notice
it, but you're saying

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:49.330
goodbye to an era in New York.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.840
And this is happening in
the Chinese community.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.240
It's happening in the Polish
community and the Eastern

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.120
European, in the Italian
community as well.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.100
So it's happening to
all those immigrants

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.530
that kind of came up in
America at the same time.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.470
But you know, and the
good news for some of us

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.880
is you're seeing a new
influx of food and cuisine

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.810
that's taking over.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.260
So in Chinatown you have
the Fujianese, right?

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.280
So there's a new
couple of styles

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:20.310
of food, a lot of more northern,
Beijing, Shanghainese food.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.880
If you go up to Flushing,
it's almost all northern food.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.860
And then you have also
a new guard like us,

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.550
who have been here
and grew up American,

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:38.790
and are trying to incorporate
the Chinese and Asian food

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.930
that we grew up in, but
attaching it to our skills

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.440
as we've learned, climbing up
the ladder in the New York City

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.520
restaurant market.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.640
So there's lots of cool
stuff going on too, but yeah.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.140
When I go down to
Chinatown and I

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.760
see seven or eight
of the restaurants

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.160
that I used to go
all the time, you

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.320
know, I kind of
get a little tear,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.120
because those days are gone.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.430
LIEN LIN: Yeah, it's the
evolution of cuisine,

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.580
which is inevitable.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.180
It's going to happen.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.180
For example, because I
know Vietnamese cuisine,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.360
the French colonized Vietnam
for many, many years.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.160
So a lot of the food that--

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.650
a lot of the classical,
traditional dishes

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.580
actually have a lot of
French influence on them.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.340
And then same with
my growing up too.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.610
My parents were ethnically
Chinese, but they--

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.812
many, many generations
in Vietnam.

00:41:27.812 --> 00:41:29.270
So when I was
growing up, I thought

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.674
I was eating Chinese food
because we identify as Chinese,

00:41:31.674 --> 00:41:34.090
then come to realize when I'd
become a teenager, I'm like,

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.960
oh, well, this
isn't Chinese food!

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.244
This is a weird mash-up of
Vietnamese-Chinese food.

00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:41.160
And so this is what I
serve at the restaurant,

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.950
because it doesn't exist.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.702
EDWARD LIN: Well, it
exists in your family.

00:41:45.702 --> 00:41:47.660
MEDWIN PANG: And like Ed
said before, we've all

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.760
worked in Western kitchens.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:56.010
So there's no way that that
can't influence what we do.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.930
No matter how hard you're trying
to be traditional or authentic,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.732
there's always going to be
some kind of integration or--

00:42:02.732 --> 00:42:04.940
CHRIS CHEUNG: And I think
all the Western restaurants

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.850
that we kind of came
up the ladder were

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.910
the old-school
restaurants, militaristic.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.330
They broke you down.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.932
So you'd get yelled
at, food thrown at you.

00:42:13.932 --> 00:42:15.140
LIEN LIN: Like Gordon Ramsay.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.870
CHRIS CHEUNG: Basically
you're abused.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.820
But it does break
you down, and then it

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.040
becomes ingrained
in you what you

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.370
have to do to survive and
to do well in the kitchen.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.640
So it's ingrained in
all of us from chefs

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.130
that were way better
than us at the time, that

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.905
just stood over you and just
knocked the crap out of you.

00:42:33.905 --> 00:42:35.280
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN:
Beat you down

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.790
so you could build yourself
back up again, right?

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.456
MEDWIN PANG: Doesn't
happen now, though.

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:40.081
You'd get sued.

00:42:40.081 --> 00:42:41.455
LIEN LIN: It's a
different world.

00:42:41.455 --> 00:42:42.860
EDWARD LIN:
Completely different.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.720
LIEN LIN: I think all of us
are struggling with that, too.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.860
This isn't the world
that we grew up with,

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.170
with the staff that
we're seeing these days,

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.940
and the cooks, the shortage of
cooks, especially in New York,

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.374
we have noticed.

00:42:58.374 --> 00:43:00.540
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: And on
that really intense note,

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.210
I do want to leave some
time for audience Q&amp;A.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.610
So if you have a question,
feel free to raise your hand.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.851
And we don't have any mics,
but I can repeat your question.

00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:10.350
Go ahead.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.433
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it seemed
like you guys have a lot

00:43:12.433 --> 00:43:14.187
of relatively high-end food.

00:43:14.187 --> 00:43:16.610
And I've found-- I'm
pretty into Asian food,

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.142
and I've found so many--

00:43:18.142 --> 00:43:20.600
even though it is, like you're
saying, it's mainstream now.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.420
But at the same
time, so many people,

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.800
they don't have a clue
what Szechuan food is,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.487
or what a good
Chinese noodle is.

00:43:28.487 --> 00:43:30.070
An amazing number
of people don't even

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.724
know what a banh mi is.

00:43:31.724 --> 00:43:33.140
So I was just kind
of curious, you

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.920
didn't mention it that much,
how you're getting-- people just

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.950
don't try the food.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.294
Besides just expecting
a cheap price,

00:43:40.294 --> 00:43:42.800
I think people don't even
know what the food is.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.647
Like, something
that tastes amazing,

00:43:44.647 --> 00:43:45.980
they're not even willing to try.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.290
So I don't know if
you guys as a group,

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.370
have you thought
about strategies

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:51.955
to get more people to try it?

00:43:51.955 --> 00:43:53.330
CHRIS CHEUNG:
Well, one thing is,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.490
you got to have a big bullhorn.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.297
You have to have a voice
in these sort of things.

00:43:58.297 --> 00:43:59.880
And so that's what
we're trying to do.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.080
And we're speaking here
in places like this,

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.760
and hopefully we've touched on
a couple of buttons that maybe

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.550
drive you guys to want to
explore different avenues

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:11.630
of Chinese food.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.127
And then, of course, you
know, the ultimate equalizer

00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:15.710
is you have to back
it up with talent.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.610
You got to make good food.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.410
You got to make people
that want to try it.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:22.100
This town is highly
competitive, and you

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.510
have to get your
voice out there,

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.840
because you have to kind
of put yourself apart

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.780
from everybody else.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.540
And that's when they come try.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.700
And then when they do
try, it has to be good.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:37.670
So it's really simplistic for
us, and for me, as a chef,

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:38.930
to get that word out.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.970
And it starts organically.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.800
And then sometimes
you get some breaks,

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.820
and you get some good
things happening to you.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.630
And that word spreads,
and the more the merrier.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.270
So the more people
that have that voice

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.460
and are speaking out and saying,
come check out this food,

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.120
and come check out
what we're doing,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.496
then the ball starts rolling
from there, at least for me.

00:44:57.496 --> 00:44:59.203
LIEN LIN: Yeah, and
I think in New York--

00:44:59.203 --> 00:44:59.920
I'm sorry.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.060
In New York is a great
platform for this, too,

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.190
because it's just
so diverse here.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.570
And there's so many cultures
that are coming together.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.170
And I think people are excited
to learn about someone else's

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.280
culture through the food.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.363
That's how I experience
other people's culture, is

00:45:15.363 --> 00:45:18.950
the first time, it's
always through the food.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.380
And that makes me excited.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.120
MEDWIN PANG: I think
the question was,

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.350
people haven't been to China.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.320
So how do they know
what authentic food is?

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.290
And how do we
plan, or do we have

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.170
a plan, to educate
people on what, say,

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.630
authentic Szechuan
food is, right?

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.180
AUDIENCE: No, or just to
get people to even try it.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.060
I mean, I've been
to Yunnan Kitchen.

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.740
A lot of places,
they might be good,

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.850
and no one even steps foot in
it, regardless of the price.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.130
MEDWIN PANG: Right,
because they don't

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.360
know what "Yunnan" is, right?

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.940
Like, what does that mean,
and why should I come in here

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.980
and try this?

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.370
Is that what you're asking?

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.010
Well, I mean, that's what
this group is all about.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.790
I mean, we're trying to
raise our voice as one.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.210
And we promote each other.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:04.710
And that's pretty much
the whole plan, aside

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.410
from opening doors
and using social media

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:11.081
and doing events like this.

00:46:11.081 --> 00:46:16.160
EDWARD LIN: I mean, this is the
thing about doing a restaurant

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.600
kind of in a modern--

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.440
like, for lack of a better
term, a Western way,

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.460
versus an old-school,
old Asian way.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.210
You know, all those restaurants
that Chris was talking about,

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.550
the old-school
Asian restaurants,

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.770
or Chinese restaurants,
in Chinatown,

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.060
they didn't have social media.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:42.110
They didn't have-- they had
a base of Chinatown residents

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.230
that came, and that was
their bread and butter.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:50.390
Nowadays, you have to
market to everyone.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:55.659
You have to do Twitter,
Facebook, Instagram.

00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:57.950
LIEN LIN: Yeah, the Facebook
marketing is changing too.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.116
EDWARD LIN: That's changing.

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.550
LIEN LIN: A learning
curve for all of us.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:05.150
EDWARD LIN: And then just
the way that it's presented

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.840
is changing.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.070
And that's kind of what--

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.140
we're not just a
Vietnamese restaurant.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:16.040
We're not just a
Chinese restaurant.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.960
We're part of-- we're showing
that we're doing everything

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.560
just as good as everyone else.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.330
Actually, you walk
by most of our places

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.710
and it could be something else.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.760
It could be a
Western restaurant.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.800
You don't know.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.760
And as soon as you go up to the
window and you read the menu,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.760
you're like, oh, OK,
this is something

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.990
I haven't tried before.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.730
Now, getting people
to try things

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:49.110
that they haven't tried before,
that's always difficult,

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.240
depending on the person.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.400
I ask our six-year-old
if he wants to try this,

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.800
and sometimes he will,
and sometimes he won't.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.050
And he's quite adventurous,
and so he'll eat fish eyeballs.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.970
But you turn around
to someone else,

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.450
and they're like, no, I'm
not going to eat that.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:14.750
But the more exposure,
I think, that people

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.690
get of the culture,
of the cuisine,

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.090
they become interested.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:25.100
And I mean, I think
it's with anything,

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.950
once you try it a few times,
you're like, all right.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.300
That was interesting.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.370
I see where that's going, and
I want to try something more.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.770
It's kind of like, the
first time you tried coffee,

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.900
it was horrifically
bitter and terrible,

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.750
and you loaded it up
with sugar and milk.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:49.460
And then now, you can't live
without your $8 coffee--

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.190
shade-grown, organic,
and single-source--

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:58.860
because you've grown to
appreciate what is nice,

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.190
what is good about
certain things.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:08.310
And with food, any good
chef will tell you,

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.970
there's a balance.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:15.620
There's a balance of the basic
flavors, sweet, salty, sour,

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.420
and bitter.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.610
And beyond that, texture and
umami and all those things.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.410
But you can tell a good
dish when you try it.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.550
You can tell, all right,
this noodle, it's got bounce,

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:32.030
it's got spring, and
it's lively in my mouth,

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.700
versus a noodle
that's like mush,

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.810
and this tastes like oatmeal.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.430
That's not a good noodle.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:43.790
But you know, the more you
try it, the more you're

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.340
going to find, all right,
this is actually good.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.320
I like this more
and more and more.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.840
And I'm going to find
better and better and better

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.680
versions of it.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.325
And it just takes
experimentation.

00:49:53.325 --> 00:49:57.200
And I think that's
part of, hopefully,

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.180
what this world
is growing to, is

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.000
that people look
at other cultures

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.760
and are interested in other
cultures beyond their own.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.460
And then they start to learn
and accept other cultures,

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:18.107
and people get along better,
and the world's a better place.

00:50:18.107 --> 00:50:19.940
CHRIS CHEUNG: By the
way, if anybody has not

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.770
tried any of our
restaurants, you guys

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.372
are totally invited to come
and check us out, for sure.

00:50:24.372 --> 00:50:26.080
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN:
We have time for one,

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.375
or maybe we can
try to fit in two.

00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:30.452
It's you first?

00:50:30.452 --> 00:50:32.140
AUDIENCE: So I think
[INAUDIBLE] seem

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.390
to be some of the high-end
restaurants in China opened

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:38.116
their franchise [INAUDIBLE],,
you can go se [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:38.116 --> 00:50:41.350
and which was popular in
China, but [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.440
open a franchise
in Times Square.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.011
So they also have very
good service and decor,

00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:48.241
and also pretty
authentic food, I think.

00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:50.532
But unlike you guys, they
have a really good connection

00:50:50.532 --> 00:50:54.920
to the local culture and local--
well, their manager, owner,

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.080
or the chef, they just
everybody come from China.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.400
So what do you think--
what's your opinion

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.706
on those kind of franchise?

00:51:00.706 --> 00:51:02.080
Where do you think
they will have

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.226
impact on the ecosystem
of Asian restaurant

00:51:05.226 --> 00:51:06.480
here in New York City?

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.465
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Just
to repeat the question,

00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:09.120
since it was a bit quiet.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.930
So the question was about
restaurant franchises

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:15.954
that were high-end in China, but
are actually opening branches

00:51:15.954 --> 00:51:16.620
here in America.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.480
How does that impact
how you guys are

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.480
running your restaurants,
and how the Asian food

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.560
scene is in general?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.000
DORON WONG: I think it's great.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.260
You know, Chef Dong
has a Michelin star.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:34.050
He's reached out to us to help
him with the local market.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.530
We do-- I do wish him a lot
of luck, because it helps us.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.270
It helps a franchise like
that, a Michelin star chef,

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.690
to come in here and say,
this is what Peking duck is.

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:49.099
And we're going to
charge you $100 a person.

00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:50.640
And this is what
you're going to pay.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.760
And this is the quality and
the standard that it is.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.709
And it helps us,
it helps us a lot.

00:51:58.709 --> 00:52:00.000
LIEN LIN: The louder the voice.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.460
DORON WONG: Because of his
credibility, and credibility

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.450
that comes with it.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:04.241
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:06.120
I'm not sure 10,
15 years ago, he

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.890
would come with
that much bravado,

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.070
and be set up to
at least be set up

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.490
to be successful like what
looks like what's coming.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:17.310
10, 15 years ago, it may
not have been a big thing,

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.862
or not even newsworthy.

00:52:20.862 --> 00:52:22.820
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: Let's
do one more question.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.980
You?

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.970
AUDIENCE: I was--

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:33.385
I feel like one significant
exception to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:33.385 --> 00:52:38.340
market is the sort
of fusion cuisine.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.402
It appears now you're mostly,
at least not intentionally,

00:52:41.402 --> 00:52:43.370
marketing yourselves
as that, and you

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.814
mentioned some of the
influence was unavoidable.

00:52:46.814 --> 00:52:48.452
And I was kind of
curious how you

00:52:48.452 --> 00:52:50.618
felt about that space, which
on the one hand kind of

00:52:50.618 --> 00:52:53.053
has been really successful,
and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:53.053 --> 00:52:55.001
experimentation, but
on the other hand,

00:52:55.001 --> 00:52:57.930
does seem to be closely
targeting white people.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.675
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: So this
question about fusion cuisine

00:53:00.675 --> 00:53:02.940
and how generally
it seems like it's

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.740
targeted at a
higher-end audience

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.220
and has been fairly successful.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:11.000
And kind of how your
restaurant sits in that space.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.470
MEDWIN PANG: Everybody
looking at me?

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.080
Yeah, well, the
whole fusion movement

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.150
was great, because if
it weren't for that,

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.870
then every Asian restaurant,
or any other fusion restaurant,

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:29.930
would just be whatever
the region that it's from.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.590
Right, being that
it's fusion, it

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:37.980
makes it more
approachable to anybody.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:43.410
So if they add flavors that
are familiar to the locals,

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.290
then they're going to
be more apt to try it.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.080
So yeah, the fusion
thing was great,

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.060
though I hate the
term "fusion" myself,

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.100
because that came about
for lack of better words

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.390
to describe something.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.487
And it was from Nobu, where
he does Peruvian and Japanese.

00:54:01.487 --> 00:54:03.570
And it was in the review
that he was, like, oh, he

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:04.560
does this fusion thing.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.770
So that term caught on.

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.610
But yeah, it's great,
just high-end chefs

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:14.250
from other parts of
the world, regardless

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.200
of where they're from,
coming here to New York

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.700
to elevate their cuisine.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:29.880
Anything that builds
awareness is a good thing.

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.244
And without having
to cheapen yourself

00:54:33.244 --> 00:54:35.160
by saying, oh, you know,
I'm not so authentic,

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.450
or I'm not so traditional,
because I add other influences,

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.200
doesn't take away.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.380
It just makes it
more approachable for

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.100
the average Joe to understand.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.260
EDWARD LIN: The one caveat is
to successfully fuse cuisines,

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.830
you have to understand both,
or whatever you're mixing.

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.980
And that's where, I
think, a lot of really--

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.650
where fusion got a kind
of a bad rap, in the '90s,

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:08.790
they were just fusing
kung pao macaroni

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.850
or something like that.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:19.320
And if you really understand
the essence of whatever you're

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.150
putting together, then you can
pick out the best parts of it

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:30.360
and make it work on a palate
level, on a texture level,

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.970
and even on a
conceptual level, where

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:39.720
you have a history of the
dish, and it kind of gives more

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.650
reason for being.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:45.490
I mean, Vietnamese itself
is a fusion cuisine.

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.910
It's a fusion of South
Asian and French,

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.365
like, naturally,
though, because--

00:55:50.365 --> 00:55:51.490
LIEN LIN: And it took time.

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:52.531
EDWARD LIN: It took time.

00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:57.630
It took generations
of French influence

00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.434
and Asian influence
coming together.

00:56:00.434 --> 00:56:03.100
CHRIS CHEUNG: That's such a cool
thing though, right, to happen?

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.933
EDWARD LIN: Yeah, that
is such a cool thing,

00:56:04.933 --> 00:56:05.940
when it does happen.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.398
LIEN LIN: But now
it's considered--

00:56:07.398 --> 00:56:09.970
like, banh mis are considered
a traditional Vietnamese food.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:10.678
EDWARD LIN: Yeah.

00:56:10.678 --> 00:56:16.030
So fusion and innovation
isn't a bad thing.

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:21.090
It's only when it's
done wrong, when

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.620
it's done thoughtlessly
and carelessly,

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.956
that it becomes bad.

00:56:24.956 --> 00:56:27.330
SUCHANAN AKSORNNAN: That's
actually all the time we have.

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:30.810
But thank you so much for
joining us and telling us

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:32.760
your stories.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.260
If you have any
further questions,

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.510
I mean, all these chefs
are at their restaurants,

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.870
and you should definitely visit.

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.057
And I think that'll be it.

00:56:41.057 --> 00:56:42.390
So thank you all for joining us.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:44.390
LIEN LIN: Thank you so
much for having us today.

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:46.940
