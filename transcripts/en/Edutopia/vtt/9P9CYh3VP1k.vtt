00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.926
&gt;&gt;I was instructor at the
South Marks High School.

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:16.426
And we did everything from
backpacking trips to ropes courses

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:18.786
in the riggings of tall
ships in the harbor.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:21.316
Then began to do urban exploration.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:24.886
It was an attempt to bring
the methodology and philosophy

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.786
of Outward Bound into the inner city,

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:29.006
and into classrooms
for the first time.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.376
So it really is out
of the work that kind

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:35.416
of Expeditionary Learning was
designed, and came to life.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.646
&gt;&gt;Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:40.396
&gt;&gt;Susan: So we designed
this expedition where teams

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:42.796
of students interviewed
people who have struggled

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:43.696
with housing and homelessness.

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.706
Because the work that we
do, it has to be compelling,

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:48.126
and it has to be looking
at the real world.

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:50.256
We're called Expeditionary
Learning for a reason.

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:52.146
You know, the classic
expedition, you're out with a group

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.926
of people trying to climb a mountain.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:54.956
And the goal is real.

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:56.726
And you're driven towards it.

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.806
You all want to get there, because
you know that there will be a sense

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:00.356
of accomplishment in the end.

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:02.886
And all of the consequences
along the way are real.

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:04.146
[laughs] It starts to rain.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.556
Like that happens.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.136
Your computer dies!

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:08.436
That happens, you know,
these things go on.

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:09.156
You know, these things go on.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.806
But you're committed to
this end objective together.

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:13.836
So the relationships
become important,

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:15.926
and the connections become important.

00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:21.046
And when you offer someone
the opportunity to engage

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:25.236
in something real, and push
them and challenge them

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:28.176
to do things they never
thought they could possibly do,

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.566
there is nothing more exhilarating.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.046
&gt;&gt;Okay, how long have
you each been homeless?

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:38.266
&gt;&gt;I've been in and out of the
shelters on and off like 22 years.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.236
&gt;&gt;So how did that affect you?

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.286
&gt;&gt;Because of the way
you have to live,

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:45.006
and the fact that you
may not be proud of it,

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:48.516
wears on your self-esteem, no
matter how good your self-esteem is.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.876
It's going to be--
it's very draining.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:56.176
&gt;&gt;I want my students to walk out of
my classroom skilled, knowledgeable,

00:01:56.426 --> 00:02:00.296
capable, and ready to tackle the
problems of their lives in the world.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:05.446
But I believe that in
order to achieve that,

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:07.966
you have to feel like you belong.

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:11.126
And you have to feel comfortable
enough to be who you are.

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:13.786
Because none of us are
capable of learning

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.546
when we're closed off,
and when we're fearful.

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:17.286
&gt;&gt;Thank you so much.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:17.886
&gt;&gt;Woman: Thank you.

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:18.916
&gt;&gt;Susan: I think that's
one of the reasons

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:20.916
that we have the dropout
rates that we have in schools,

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.506
is that we have these large
monolithic places where people walk

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:25.016
through the halls anonymously.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.716
And no one notices whether
they're there or not.

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:31.236
Why would you go someplace where you
don't know whether someone's going

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:32.526
to notice whether you're
there or not?

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.016
But I get up in the
morning and show up,

00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:36.356
because I know my friends
are going to be there.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:37.786
My colleagues are my friends.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:39.536
And I'm going to get to say, "Hello!"

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:42.886
Right? I'm going to talk about the
weekend before we get into the work.

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.996
&gt;&gt;So I've got groups
arranged around the laptops.

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:47.056
You'll be meeting those groups
and presenting these things.

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:47.666
So they must ...

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.456
&gt;&gt;Susan: So we've got to build
a community in our classroom.

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:52.216
We have to build a
community in our school.

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:55.276
We have to create a space where
students feel like their whole self,

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.206
and everything about them matters.

00:02:57.206 --> 00:03:01.996
I challenge my students far more
than I would if I were in a place

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:03.596
where we didn't know each other.

00:03:03.676 --> 00:03:06.256
&gt;&gt;Writing process standard, and
quality of writing standard.

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:09.966
I need to see your revisions and
all those drafts stapled together.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.676
&gt;&gt;Derek: Susan is an
intellectual, but she brings

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:14.966
as much heart as head to her game.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.976
And she convinces kids
that if their--

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:20.636
if they're not passionate about
what they're doing, then they need

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:23.076
to dig deeper and find what
they are passionate about.

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:25.256
Because once they're passionate,

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:27.966
she knows that intellectual
engine is going to be catalyzed,

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:30.456
and they're doing to do great things
that they didn't think they could do,

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:32.466
and which will motivate
them to do the next thing.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.256
&gt;&gt;I want you guys to see
something, because it's going

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.416
to give you a taste, and
it's going to inspire us,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.156
and then you're going
to work so hard!

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:42.776
&gt;&gt;She gets the adrenaline rush out
of kids that is typically only gotten

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:45.676
from the football coach
or the drama teacher.

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:48.866
Because they're fired up
about what they're studying,

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:51.486
and what they're going to
present and share with the world.

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.206
&gt;&gt;So you got to make
some of those decisions.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:54.156
Okay.

00:03:54.516 --> 00:03:55.326
&gt;&gt;Ms. McCray?

00:03:55.606 --> 00:04:00.006
I love her, quite -- just aside
from being a great English teacher,

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.386
it's just she's the kind of teacher
that you go to with whatever.

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:04.406
She's always there for you.

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:06.446
Always full of life.

00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:08.466
If you're going to teach
Expeditionary Learning,

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.246
you have to have a
certain spark in you.

00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:11.896
And she just has so much of that.

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:12.056
So.

00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:13.456
&gt;&gt;Go to "Share."

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:14.296
Try "Share."

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:17.806
No? Huh. Are you in
the slideshow part?

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:19.166
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.226
&gt;&gt;It's really hard work.

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:24.506
It's grueling, and it's
demoralizing, because you see the kid

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:25.626
that you're not reaching.

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.406
And you see there's
several young people

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:30.926
that are slipping through the cracks.

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:33.216
Or you feel like it's not happening.

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:35.486
The curriculum that you
spent hours planning,

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.046
the lesson that you designed,

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:39.496
and you spent all this
time around falls flat.

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:43.446
You know? It happens to
all of us, all the time.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:48.856
And I think the key to sustaining
yourself in teaching is to be able

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.746
to know that that is a reality.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:53.596
And that's a fact of the profession.

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:58.346
And to know you got to get up
the next morning and try again.

00:04:58.346 --> 00:04:58.796
[laughs]
