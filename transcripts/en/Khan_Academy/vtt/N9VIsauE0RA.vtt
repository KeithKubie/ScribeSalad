00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.480
What I want to do in this
video is compare investment

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.297
to consumption.

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.380
And we're going to think
about it in two contexts.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.690
One I would call the everyday
conventional context.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.190
And then the other
one would be how

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.680
we would think about it
in an economics context.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.290
Because these words
mean something

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.007
very particular to an economist.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.340
And that's important that it
means something particular,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.430
because we're going
to start using

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.860
these words, or
this terminology,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.570
or these classifications,
to understand

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.260
where GDP is coming from.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.960
So in everyday-- let me
draw a line over here.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.410
This is going to be
everyday or, conversational,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.780
versions of this term.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.570
And down here, we'll
put the economics,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.540
the economic versions
of this term,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.730
especially when we think of it
in the context of accounting

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.782
for GDP.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.740
And they're not necessarily
all that different.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.430
But they are different
in important ways.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.890
So in investment,
really in both cases,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.710
you can generally
view it as something

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.190
that you do to get
some future gain.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.660
So for example, if I today build
a house-- so I build a house.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.536
So that is the house.

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:07.243
I built it today.

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:08.540
And this will be the timeline.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.210
The house will keep lasting.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.710
And it's an investment,
because it's

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.784
going to be giving
me future gain.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:16.200
A year from now, I'll still
be able to live in that house.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.850
So I will have the saved rent.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.370
That's a future gain, a future
gain two years from now.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.900
It'll keep giving
some type of gain.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.670
You could have a financial
instrument, maybe

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.930
some type of debt instrument.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.670
You're lending money
to someone else.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.880
So maybe you buy a bond,
which is essentially you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.730
lending money to someone else.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.720
That is an investment in
the everyday sense of it.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.680
Because when have that asset,
when you've bought that asset,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.710
it's going to pay off
something in the future.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.182
It's going to pay off some
interest or some profits.

00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:50.390
And in the everyday sense,
I would consider something

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.630
like-- hopefully
it would be-- going

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.490
to college would
be an investment.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.100
So education, I'll
say education,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.650
because you invest that time
and energy and education, it's

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.490
going to keep paying off.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.480
Hopefully by doing
that, you're going

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.240
to get better employment
and higher wages

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.300
the rest of your life.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.360
It will keep paying off.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.880
So this is the everyday
notion of investment.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.790
The everyday notion
of consumption,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.920
the way I think about it,
is you are buying something

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.670
or you're doing something
that you're just

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.510
going to use up
in the short-term.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.370
And just by using it up,
whatever that object is,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.500
if you just use it up-- and it's
just going to hopefully benefit

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.270
you in some way, but it's
more of a short-term thing--

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.950
I would consider
that consumption

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.570
in the everyday sense.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.320
So if you go buy a
candy bar and eat it,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.020
you have consumed the candy bar.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.010
You have not made an investment.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.059
If you go to a movie,
that is consumption.

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.600
And I'm not making
any value judgment

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.220
that one is better
than the other.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.870
Investment, at the
end of the day,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.970
you're investing so that you
can get future benefit that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.260
could lead to consumption.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.550
Because at the end of
the day, consumption

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.900
is one of the things that might
make your life a little bit

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.450
better off.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.220
So I'm not saying that one
is better than the other.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.560
But watching a movie, that
would also be consumption.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.816
Spending time buying
a book, well, you

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.690
could debate whether
that's education or not.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.670
But let's say you buy a book
that is not educational,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.582
that is consumption.

00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:17.790
But it is making you happier.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.420
Hopefully, it's making your
life better in some way.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.140
Now, the economic
definitions are

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.290
related to these
everyday definitions,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.010
but they're a little
bit more precise.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.593
And they make the
definitions in a way

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:32.140
that they're easier to account
for if you are a nation.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.330
They're easier to keep track of.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.570
So the way an economist
would define it,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.400
they would define
economic investment

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.200
as spending on
capital equipment.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.050
Capital equipment are things
like, if you are a factory,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.080
you will buy the equipment
to run your factory.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.100
You buy the robots.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.350
And you buy the assembly line.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.589
And you buy the wheelbarrows
or whatever else,

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.380
the things that have
to cart things around.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.049
That is capital equipment.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.465
It would be things
like inventory.

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:04.600
So for example, the
inventory-- and this

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.683
is still not so different.

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:07.410
Both of these things
are being used

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.380
to produce things in the future,
to produce future benefit.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.420
You're buying that inventory,
sometimes raw material,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.110
you're going to add value to it.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.485
And then they're
going to be used

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.310
to produce something
in the future.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.825
It includes things like even
the structures, the buildings.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:27.900
And so for all of this, in
the economic sense, and this

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.880
is why it's easier to account
for, this, for the most part,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.870
is being done by the firms.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.810
And it also includes the one
thing that households do,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.550
which is construction
of new homes.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.855
This is from the households.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.720
Actually, the buying
of a house does not

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.440
show up in consumption
or investment,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.000
because nothing
new was produced.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.774
Something just exchanged hands.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:57.690
So whenever we talk about
any of these things,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.273
especially when we're
talking about it

00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:01.410
in precise economic
terms, it's the production

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.520
of new capital equipment, new
inventory, new structures,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.440
new homes.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.740
If I just buy a factory
from someone else,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.150
that does not add to GDP.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.757
It would not be considered
investment or consumption,

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.340
because I'm just
transferring an asset

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.600
from one person to another.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.050
It would only be added to
GDP when it is first created.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.620
And on the consumption
side, from an economic point

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.320
of view-- let me draw a little
bit of a line right over here--

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.690
consumption is considered to
be any spending on final goods

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.575
by households except
for new homes.

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:45.170
And let me make
this even clearer.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.295
Because remember, if we're
just transferring goods,

00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:48.770
that shouldn't count.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.700
So let me put it on newly
produced final goods.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.850
Now, what's unintuitive
a little bit over here

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.010
is, according to the way we
account for GDP, the tuition

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.620
that you spend on a
college education,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.210
that is new spending
on final goods.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.310
And here are the final
goods or services.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.290
The service you're
getting is your education.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.070
That would be consumption.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.670
So education would fall
here in the economic sense.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.590
While in the every day sense, I
would consider education right

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.720
over here.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.930
Maybe you are buying a car.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.971
And you're not buying a
car for leisure purposes.

00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:25.612
You're buying a car because you
need your car to go to work.

00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:27.070
There's an argument
that that would

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.620
be an investment in
the everyday sense.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.390
By having that car,
you have something

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.186
that can take you
to work every day.

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:35.560
So you're getting
future benefit.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.970
So there's an argument
that maybe that's

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.640
an investment in
the everyday sense.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.110
But in the accounting sense,
that car would sit right here.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.170
You bought a new car.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.880
But that is considered
consumption.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.830
You did not buy a new house.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.180
And the whole reason, at
least as far as I understand,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.910
why it's set up this way is this
is this easier to account for.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.860
You look at all of
the spending by firms,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.000
that's easy to account for.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.370
You essentially call
that investment.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.440
Because at the end of
the day, all the spending

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.830
that firms are making
is they're doing

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.070
it to produce some
good or service.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.070
So we call this investment any
spending that the firms do.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.190
And on top of that, when
households purchase new homes,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.850
we also call that investment.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.000
And that's just easier
for the accounting offices

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.490
of governments to keep track of.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.370
And everything else
that households do,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.020
we consider consumption.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.700
And we'll see in
the next few videos,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.408
there are a few other
categories in terms

00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:27.830
of things that
the government do.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.250
And then we'll have to think
about imports and exports.
