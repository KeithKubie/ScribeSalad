I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.680
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.940
Also, this episode is the
answer to the ultimate question

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.630
of life, the universe,
and everything.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.280
So we've got that going for us.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.370
Tango-enabled apps,
like WayfairView,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.530
make it easy to
visualize and rearrange

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.090
new furniture in your home.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.660

their app and see

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.720
how Tango apps help power
new AR shopping experiences,

has graduated out
of beta and is now

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.790
available on the
Daydream developer site.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.200
The updated SDK simplifies
common VR development tasks

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.460
and supports integrated
asynchronous reprojections,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.780
high fidelity spacialized
audio, and interactions

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.700
using the Daydream controller.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.090

The latest version of our
image captioning system

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.380
is now available as an open
source model in TensorFlow.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.420
This release contains
significant improvements

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.480
to the computer vision component
of the captioning system,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.750
is much faster to
train, and produces

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.580
more detailed and accurate
descriptions compared

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.630
to the original
system, which actually

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.870
tied for first place in a 2015
image captioning challenge.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.040

to set up and monetize your
Native Ads effectively.

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.150
Take a look at the post
where three developers share

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.590
their success stories
of switching to Native

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.760
and growing both their
revenue and their business.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.430
With the new direct
integration between Particle,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.880
and IoT cloud platform and
hardware provider, and Google

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270
Cloud Platform, you can now
easily bring your IoT data

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.800
to big data tools,
such as Google Cloud

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.940
Dataflow and Google BigQuery.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.650
One of the coolest
cloud integrations

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.840
with the new Firebase
platform is the ability

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.090
to export raw data
from Firebase Analytics

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.905
to Google BigQuery
for custom analysis.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.780
To see what you can do
with this combination,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
along with some code,
check out the post.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.280
Speaking of big data,
historical daily weather

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.500
from the global
historical climate network

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.385
is now available
in Google BigQuery.

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:33.400
The data comes from
over 80,000 stations

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.770
in 180 countries,
spans several decades,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.280
and has been quality checked
to ensure that it's temporally

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.930
and spatially consistent.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.970
Take a look at the post for some
code and graphs to get started.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.080
Cross-platform map
styling is here.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.540
You can change the color
palette of your maps,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.270
hide labels, vary road density,
and toggle points of interest.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.320
Which means your maps can now
match your brand and style

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.440
across your website
and your apps,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.100
using the same
JSON style object.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.870
Oh, and there's a video.
