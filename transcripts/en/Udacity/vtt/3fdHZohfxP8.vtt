00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.020
Here is a visualization of the agent
based simulation of the Center for

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.530
Health Discovery and Well-being.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.870
A special clinic established
to explore the potential for

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.710
preventing the development
of chronic disease.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.250
Here you can see physical areas,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.750
such as the education room Where
trained coaches interact with patients.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.740
When the simulation is actually run, all
the clinic personnel and the patients

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.110
being served move along these pathways
governed by the time it takes to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.349
do each element of the clinics work, the
available resources and other factors.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.990
The simulation was constructed to help
the clinic identify a set of processes

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.640
and a revenue model that would
make it both self-sustaining and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.570
of value to its parent organization.
