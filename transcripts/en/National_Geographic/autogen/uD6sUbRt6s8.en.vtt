it do the same thing give it a try look

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670
it do the same thing give it a try look
 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.480
it do the same thing give it a try look
at that and that was it that's enough

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490
at that and that was it that's enough

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.230
 
firstly they put a seam in a large

firstly they put a seam in a large
 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.820
firstly they put a seam in a large
plastic container and then we seal it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830
plastic container and then we seal it
 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.289
plastic container and then we seal it
then they fill the container with water

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299
then they fill the container with water
 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.800
then they fill the container with water
and apply some pressure explosive

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810
and apply some pressure explosive
 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.160
and apply some pressure explosive

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.630
 
it went bang Wow let's have a look so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
it went bang Wow let's have a look so
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.130
it went bang Wow let's have a look so
what are we looking for where and why

what are we looking for where and why
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.890
what are we looking for where and why
well you observe that there is a large

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900
well you observe that there is a large
 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.400
well you observe that there is a large
gash yes structure it's broken the flaw

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410
gash yes structure it's broken the flaw
 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.710
gash yes structure it's broken the flaw
that we manufactured we exposed it to a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720
that we manufactured we exposed it to a
 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.370
that we manufactured we exposed it to a
large force and we see failure so that

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
large force and we see failure so that
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.710
large force and we see failure so that
small floor that join is compromised the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720
small floor that join is compromised the
 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.330
small floor that join is compromised the
entire strike that's right and this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
entire strike that's right and this
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.620
entire strike that's right and this
could happen as well in a concrete

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630
could happen as well in a concrete
 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.330
could happen as well in a concrete
structure any type of structure really

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340
structure any type of structure really
 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.810
structure any type of structure really
and that's what we're trying to avoid

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
and that's what we're trying to avoid
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.090
and that's what we're trying to avoid
judging by that just a small weakness in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
judging by that just a small weakness in
 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.259
judging by that just a small weakness in
a concrete would be lethal for the troll

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269
 
 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.089
 
but grant also wants to show me the

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099
but grant also wants to show me the
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.449
but grant also wants to show me the
solution simply avoid defects or

solution simply avoid defects or
 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.940
solution simply avoid defects or
weaknesses so round two will the exact

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950
weaknesses so round two will the exact
 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.520
weaknesses so round two will the exact

you're right it survived it it did

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840
you're right it survived it it did
 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.830
you're right it survived it it did
survive and this is same conditions same
