00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.970
Okay, so, how man do you want to look at?

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.190
&gt;&gt; Well in this case it, you know, I feel like I could draw a, a

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.620
kind of extended city block zone and capture

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.990
maybe, I don't know, five of the points.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.350
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do it. So let's find our

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.680
five, our five nearest neighbors. So let's see. This is

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.040
clearly close, that's one over here. I'd

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.540
say this is close. I'll say this one is close. This one's close.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.830
None of the other blue ones are actually that close. And I'd

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.400
say that's the next closest one, so here are my little five points.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.090
That all seem relative near. So what does that tell you?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.360
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, it's, it feels like it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.090
suggests that red is not a bad choice here.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.110
&gt;&gt; Mm

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.830
&gt;&gt; It's in a reddish part of town.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get that. So, so you think it's a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.820
pretty, fair thing to bet that this should be red then?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean I think that if you were really asking me seriously

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.980
I would wonder about that blue point to the right of the highway and whether

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.620
that had any influence.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.320
&gt;&gt; That's pretty far away.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not that far away.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.470
&gt;&gt; Well in Atlanta, once you cross highways

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.070
you might as well be an infinite distance away.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.360
&gt;&gt; Well so, okay, but. That's a good point then.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.610
So, I guess I was interpreting your notion of distance as

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.830
being, you know, like straight line distance on the map. But

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.510
maybe that doesn't make sense for this kind of neighborhood example.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.660
&gt;&gt; Hm, no, that's a good point. So,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.600
we've been talking about distance sort of implicitly.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.785
But this notion of distance. It's actually quite important. So maybe distance is

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.820
straight-line distance, maybe it's as the crow

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.460
flies. Maybe it's driving distance. Maybe it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.180
has to take into account the fact that, when you cross highways in

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.080
Atlanta, you're typically moving into a completely

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.390
different universe. These sorts of things matter.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I could imagine I don't know, like Google Maps distance.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.820
&gt;&gt; Right. Or how many paths can you get there

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730
and which is the shortest one given the traffic? There's all

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.900
kinds of things like that you could do. So. So that's

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.410
fair, that's fair. But that just says that this, this distant, we

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.320
have to be very careful what we mean by distance and

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.600
that's okay. But let's just say for the sake of this discussion

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.410
that these are the closest points by some reasonable measure of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.860
distance. So, in that world, would you be happy if you had

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.600
to pick a single example? a single output, a single label

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.340
of red ,uh, blue or green. Would you be happy picking red?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.220
mean you know, not ecstatic, but okay.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.910
&gt;&gt; That's fair. So, I like this. So, we, we

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.460
went from just picking our nearest neighbor to picking our nearest

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.220
neighbors. And ,what's a good value you think we should,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.590
we should stick to with neighbors? We started with one and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.410
that clearly wasn't good. You picked, at least not in

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.370
all cases and you came up with five. So what do

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.150
you think? What, what, if I'm going to call this algorithm something,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.550
what do you think five nearest neighbors? What do you think?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.050
What should I call it?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.570
&gt;&gt; Five seems good. I mean I feel like that, that's gotta be universal.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.660
&gt;&gt; The number five?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.430
&gt;&gt; Well it is in Atlanta but it might

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.290
not be univeral in wherever it is you are.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.760
&gt;&gt; We'll call it the Georgia Tech nearest neighbors.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.330
&gt;&gt; That doesn't seem like an algorithm that's going to to be used very much.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.730
&gt;&gt; Fair enough. All right. So what about,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.590
we could do as many nearest neighbors as

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.570
is appropriate. Or maybe we should just make it a free parameter and call it K.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.380
&gt;&gt; Ok, I like that. K nearest neighbors, so we'll have K

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.320
nearest neighbors. And we'll pick our K numbers. Oh, and you said

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.880
something fancy there, by the way. You said free parameter. I like

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880
that. We should, we should come back to that again. So we

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.890
have an algorithm, k nearest neighbors. Which takes K nearest neighbors as

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.930
a way of deciding how you're going to label some query point here.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.240
And we've identified two parameters to the algorithm so far. K Which

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.810
is the number of neighbors we're going to use. And some notion of distance.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.310
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.610
&gt;&gt; Which

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.770
here we were kind of using in the sort of obvious way,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.530
but there might be other ways we might want to use distance here.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I could imagine if the houses, if,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.500
had additional features like how many Square footages they had.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.510
&gt;&gt; Right, stuff like that. That would make perfect sense.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.720
So, so really distance, we're using distance here in a kind

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.520
of in an over loaded sense, because this is something

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.100
on a map. But really distance is a standard for similarity.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.940
&gt;&gt; Similarity, good. It's kind of standard

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.210
for the opposite of similarity.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.210
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well distance is just a kind of similarity, right?

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.760
But in case of, you know, points on the map. Similarity,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.930
it sort of makes sense because as you said when we

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.270
were talking about real estate, location,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.660
location, location matters. So, there, similarity

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.760
really is kind of the inverse of distance. But in other

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.649
ways, things like the number of veterans you have, whether you're

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.100
one on side of the highway or the other, the school

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.089
district you're in, things like that, are other things you might add

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.940
as features or dimensions when you talk about similarity or distance.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.870
Okay, so I like this. I think we have a general algorithm

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.580
now and I think it does a pretty good job of

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.200
addressing the points you brought up. We no longer have to worry

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.490
about overfitting as much, at least it seems that way to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.880
me. And we have a way of being a little bit more

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.830
robust to this, you know, not having an exact data point

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.830
in the database. So ,maybe we should turn this into an algorithm.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.250
let's go for it.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.
