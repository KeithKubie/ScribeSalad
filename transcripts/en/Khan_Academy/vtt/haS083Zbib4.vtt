00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.533
- [Voiceover] The term escrow.

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.923
That E looked funny.

00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:08.369
The term escrow is used
a lot in real estate.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:09.904
It's actually used in a lot of

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:11.700
just financial transactions in general,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.366
but real estate is the
place that most of us

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.123
will see it most frequently.

00:00:16.123 --> 00:00:18.984
And even in the context of
residential real estate,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.133
it tends to be use in two different ways

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.479
which can only make it more confusing.

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.300
Now one way in which he word escrow is use

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.742
is when you're actually buying the house.

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:32.135
So what happens is, you
make an offer on the house.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:34.727
Let's say that the
seller accepts the offer,

00:00:34.727 --> 00:00:36.927
then you have an opening of escrow.

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:40.015
And what an escrow is,
it's a third party account,

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:43.643
so it's managed by a trusted third party.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:48.100
So this right over here is escrow, escrow,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.200
and it's managed by a trusted,
a trusted third party.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.804
And what happen is, is that the buyer,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.592
we'll do the buyer in another color.

00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:02.200
The buyer places all of their
obligations into escrow,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.400
so it might be the deposit

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.333
that was part of the offer contract.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.681
It could be the actual,

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.156
the remainder of the down payment,

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:12.294
usually the deposit goes
towards the down payment.

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:15.533
It could be, it could be
getting the financing,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.786
so let's, this is the down payment,

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.953
the down payment and the deposit.

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:24.546
It could be getting, actually
securing the financing

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:27.573
which would mean the
remainder of the house.

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:30.723
And the seller fulfills
all of their obligations.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:35.723
So, this right over here is the seller,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.796
and they allow the house to be inspected,

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:41.665
and let's say that the
house passes inspection,

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.700
passes inspection.

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:48.300
Let's say that the title company is able

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.524
to do a title search,
and it's a clear title.

00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:54.679
Clear title, clear title.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.300
So then on the closing day,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.104
and that day is actually
the closing of escrow,

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:01.209
so you go to the closing day,

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.435
so closing, on the closing day.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.800
This third party says,
"Okay, everybody has met

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.633
"their obligations, I'm
going to give the seller

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.532
"the money, I'm going to
give the seller the money,

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.433
"and I'm going to give the buyer,

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.166
"I'm going to give the buyer the house."

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.700
Or we could say the title,
the title to the house.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.966
And we go into a lot
more of depth into this

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:21.750
in other videos.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.271
So this is one form of escrow.

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:24.956
It's the third party where all of the

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:27.407
the things from either
party are put into place

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:29.043
so that you could have closing,

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:32.500
and then actually, and actually transact

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.266
the house and the money

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.873
and the house actually changes hands.

00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:39.066
Now the other way that
the word escrow is use

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.327
in residential real estate,

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.442
it's a related idea, it
still involves having

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.066
a trusted third party.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.033
And that's what this term generally means,

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:47.833
is using a trusted third party,

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.604
having a trusted third party account

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.366
where the different
parties to a transaction

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.833
they can use it, so
that they can facilitate

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.433
the transaction itself.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.935
So the other place you might see this

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:58.533
is actually when you are making

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.104
your mortgage payments.

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:02.467
So when we typically talk
about mortgage payments,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.733
let's say that your monthly mortgage is,

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:06.194
let's just say for the sake of simplicity

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:09.786
it's a $1000, it's $1000.

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:14.212
So this is your mortgage payment, $1000.

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:16.400
And let's say your very
first mortgage payment

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.830
is going to have, some amount of it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.486
is going to be paying for interest.

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:20.871
So when you start paying it's only

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:22.675
going to be mainly interest.

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:26.994
And some of it is to pay
down principle, principle.

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:28.533
And then we've seen this a lot of time,

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:30.825
the next payment of a $1000

00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:33.332
if you have a fix mortgage.

00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:36.171
So the next payment of $1000,

00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:38.000
more of it is going to be principle,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.338
and less of it is going to be interest.

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.833
But when you actually write
your check to the bank

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.312
you might find out that you're paying

00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:47.266
more than a thousand dollars.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.566
And you say, "Why am I
paying more than a $1000?"

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:50.600
And if you call your bank

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.733
and you would ask them that,

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.357
they'll say "Okay, well you know what,

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:54.987
"If you're not able to pay this mortgage

00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:56.333
"this house comes to us,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.234
"and we want to make sure that this house

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:00.124
"is properly insured,
and we want to make sure

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:01.633
"that the taxes are paid on it."

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:03.369
Why do they care that
the house is insured?

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.500
Well, if the house isn't insured,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.133
and there's a hurricane or a tornado

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.425
and it destroys the house,

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:09.700
then you might want to walk away

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.800
from that mortgage and all the bank

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.494
is going to be left with is a house

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:15.866
that was destroyed by a
hurricane or a tornado.

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.363
So they want it to be insured,

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:19.066
and they also want the taxes to be paid,

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.333
because once again if
there's a bunch of back taxes

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:22.966
you might just want to
walk away from the house,

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:24.333
and then the bank is going to be left

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.204
paying those back taxes.

00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.613
And so what the bank might do is say,

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:30.000
"Okay, you know what?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.400
"You, your house--"

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.766
And I'm just going to fix the numbers

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.894
so that they work out well.

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:38.842
"For your house, you
have to pay 1200, 1200

00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:43.842
"a year in insurance, and you have to pay,

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:49.466
"and you have to pay
1200 a year, 1200 a year

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:52.799
"in property taxes, in taxes."

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:56.161
So that comes to a total of 2400 a year,

00:04:56.161 --> 00:05:01.161
whoops, that comes to a
total of 2400, 2400 a year.

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:05.896
And so, and we could write this for,

00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:07.333
this is for taxes and insurance,

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.630
and sometimes they'll
even short handed T and I.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.878
So there's a $2400 of tax and insurance,

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:15.366
the way that we're going to
make sure that you pay it,

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:16.632
is that every month you're going to pay

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:17.745
one twelfth of this.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.650
So you're going to pay $200,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.760
so every month you're going to pay $200

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.533
for taxes and insurance

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:28.409
and this is going to go
into an escrow account.

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:33.346
So that $200 every month goes into

00:05:33.346 --> 00:05:36.527
an escrow account for taxes and insurance.

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.827
It goes to an escrow account.

00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:41.266
And then the escrow, the escrow account

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.619
in this situation, whoever is managing it,

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:45.400
well every time that they get a bill

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.867
for the taxes or insurance,

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:50.314
they will pay it out
of the escrow account.

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.273
And so once again, it's kind of a safe

00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:54.850
third party account for a stated purpose,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.838
and then in this case the stated purpose

00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:58.933
is to pay the insurance and taxes

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:00.966
to you want that to go into the account,

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.500
to make sure that the bank
just doesn't pocket it,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.092
and the bank wants to go to that account

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:05.787
so make sure that there's money around

00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:08.556
to pay for the insurance and taxes.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.433
So these are the two primary ways

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:12.876
that you might encounter the term escrow.

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:16.142
They both are representing the same idea

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.311
of kind of putting money into an account

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.884
that can be used for a stated purpose,

00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:23.800
but they are usually using
two different contacts here,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.166
this is to facilitate
the closing of a house,

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.640
and literally the closing of escrow

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.129
the transaction of the house.

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.771
This is to make sure that
other cost are being paid.
