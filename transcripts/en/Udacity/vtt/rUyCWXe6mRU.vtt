00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
That's kind of wonderful, but we keep talking about the customer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let me remind you what it looks like from their side and we'll be talking about customers in more detail

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the next lecture, but why don't I just give you preview.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In customer segments, we are also also looking for three things--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
one is we are still trying to understand from this side what are the gains, what are the pains,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but also what are jobs that customers want you to do.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What are the functional or social jobs, what are the emotional jobs, what are the basic needs

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that you're going to be solving or problems.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And the goal of all these is not just to understand this but to understand it in enough detail

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that you could actually draw the persona or archetype of those customers

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and put them on the wall of your engineering department because now they could stare at faces

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that you'll clip out and specs of how old they are, where they were,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what job they're trying to get done, and what pains and gains

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
your value proposition is trying to solve for them.

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And until you do that, you're just going to be making products in the dark.
