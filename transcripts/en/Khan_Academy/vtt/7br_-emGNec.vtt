00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.510
- [Instructor] So right
here we have a classic

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.443
geometric random variable.

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:07.971
We're defining it as the
number of independent trials

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:11.623
we need to get a success where
the probability of success

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:14.040
for each trial is lowercase p

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.433
and we have seen this before
when we introduced ourselves

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.227
to geometric random variables.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.099
Now, the goal of this
video is to think about

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.433
well what is the expected value

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.388
of a geometric random variable like this

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:28.769
and I'll tell you the answer,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.621
in future videos we
will apply this formula,

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.000
but in this video we're actually going to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.216
prove it to ourselves mathematically.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:38.384
But the expected value of
a geometric random variable

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.652
is gonna be one over the
probability of success

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:43.941
on any given trial.

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.903
So now let's prove it to ourselves.

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:49.570
So the expected value
of any random variable

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:54.252
is just going to be the
probability weighted outcomes

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:55.448
that you could have.

00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:59.101
So you could say it is the probability...

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.094
The probability that our
random variable is equal to one

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.198
times one plus the probability

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:07.560
that our random variable
is equal to two times two

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.900
plus and you get the general idea.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.387
It goes on and on and on

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:14.494
and a geometric random
variable it can only take on

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:17.482
values one, two, three,
four, so forth and so on.

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.198
It will not take on the value zero

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:20.791
because you cannot have a success

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.347
if you have not had a trial yet.

00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:25.583
But what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:27.613
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:29.658
what's the probability
that we have a success

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:31.180
on our first trial?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.890
And actually let me
just write it over here.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.973
So this is going to be P.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.788
What is this going to be?

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.726
What is the probability
that we don't have a success

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:42.335
on our first trial, but we
have one on our second trial?

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.751
Well, this is going to be one minus p,

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.167
that's the first trial where
we don't have a success,

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:50.834
times a success on the second trial

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:53.092
and actually let me do
a few more terms here.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:56.726
So let me erase this a little
bit, do a few more terms.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:02:00.773
So this is going to be the
probability that X equals two.

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:05.692
Sorry, the probability that
X equals three times three

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.493
and we're gonna keep
going on and on and on.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.227
Well, what's this going to be?

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:11.449
Well, the probability that X equals three

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.616
is we're gonna have to get
two unsuccessful trials

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.003
and so the probability of
two unsuccessful trials

00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.072
is one minus P squared

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:24.740
and then one successful
trial just like that.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.593
So you get the general idea.

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.160
If I wanted to rewrite this
and I'm just gonna rewrite it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.033
to make it a little bit simpler.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.974
So the expected, at least for
the purposes of this proof,

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:38.780
so the expected value of X is equal to,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.697
I'll write this as 1p
plus 2p times one minus p

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:49.285
plus 3p times one minus p squared

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.073
and we're gonna keep
going on and on and on

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:54.345
forever like that.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:56.388
So how do we figure out this sum?

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:58.872
And now I'm going to do a little bit of

00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:02.993
mathematical trickery or
gymnastics, but it's all valid

00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:04.394
and if any of ya'll have seen the proof

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:07.402
of taking an infinite geometric series,

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:10.047
then we're gonna do a
very similar technique.

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.026
What I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna think about

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.041
well what is one minus p
times this expected value?

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.381
So let's do that.

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:20.548
So if I say one minus p times
the expected value of X,

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.490
what is that going to be equal to?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.573
Well, I would multiply
every one of these terms

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:26.591
times one minus p.

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.942
So one p times one minus p

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.442
would be 1p times one minus p.

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:35.416
You would get that right over there.

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:37.175
What about 2p times one minus p?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.764
What would that be equal to?

00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:42.084
Well, that would be 2p times one minus p

00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:44.814
and now we're gonna multiply
it by one minus p again.

00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:47.412
So you're gonna get one minus p squared

00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:49.763
and so I think you see where this is going

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.762
and we're just gonna
keep adding and adding

00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:53.059
and adding from there.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.457
Now we're gonna do something
really fun and interesting,

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:58.169
at least from a
mathematical point of view.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.618
If this is equal to that,

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:01.504
if the left-hand side is
equal to the right-hand side,

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:04.392
let's just subtract this
value from both sides.

00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:06.771
So on the left-hand side I would have

00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:09.740
the expected value of X, that's that,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.157
minus this, minus one minus p

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.019
times the expected value of X.

00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:19.951
So I'm just subtracting
this from that side,

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:22.301
but let me subtract this from that side.

00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:24.189
Well, I could subtract
this expression from that,

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.022
but this is equivalent,

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:27.952
so I'm just gonna subtract this from that

00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:29.526
and so what do I get?

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:30.516
Well, let's see.

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:33.063
I'm gonna have one minus p

00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:35.908
and then if I subtract
1p times one minus p

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.023
from 2p times one minus p,

00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:41.606
well I'm just going to
be left with plus 1p

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.965
times one minus p

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.830
and then if I subtract this from that,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.997
I'm gonna be left with 1p
times one minus p squared

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:57.152
and we're just gonna keep
going on and on and on

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:59.380
and so let me simplify this a little bit.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.012
If I distribute this negative,

00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:05.142
this could be plus and then
this would be p minus one

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:07.823
and then if we distribute
this expected value of X,

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:10.249
we get on the left-hand side the,

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.868
and let me scroll up a little bit.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:14.195
I don't want to scrunch it too much.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:17.536
So let's see, we have
the expected value of X

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:21.693
and then plus p times
the expected value of X.

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:23.799
P times the expected value of X

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.577
minus the expected value of X,

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:28.106
these cancel out,

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:32.273
is going to be equal to p
plus p times one minus p

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:37.083
plus p times one minus p squared

00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:40.768
and it's gonna keep
going on and on and on.

00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:42.573
Well, on the left-hand side all I have

00:05:42.573 --> 00:05:44.176
is a p times expected value of X.

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.923
If I want to solve for
the expected value of X,

00:05:45.923 --> 00:05:48.056
I just divide both sides by p.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.998
So I get and this is kind of neat

00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:51.986
through this mathematical gymnastics,

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:55.341
I now have, I'm just dividing
everything by p, both sides,

00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:57.890
on the left-hand side I just
have the expected value of X.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.913
If I divide all of these terms by p,

00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:01.225
this first term becomes one,

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:04.225
the second term becomes one minus p,

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:07.392
this third term, if I divide by p,

00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:11.559
becomes plus one minus p
squared, so forth and so on.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:14.466
Now what's cool about this,

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:17.350
this is a classic geometric series

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.017
with a common ratio of one minus p

00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:22.407
and if that term is
completely unfamiliar to you,

00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:24.216
I encourage you and this
is why it's actually called

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:25.686
a geometric, one of the reasons,

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:28.232
arguments for why it's called
a geometric random variable,

00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:31.031
but I encourage you to review
what a geometric series is

00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.631
on Khan Academy if this
looks completely unfamiliar,

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:35.520
but in other places we proved

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.067
using actually a very similar
technique that we did up here

00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:40.467
that this sum is going to be equal to

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:43.969
one over one minus our common ratio

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.748
and our common ratio is one minus p.

00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:49.638
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:52.643
And we are really in the
home stretch right over here.

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:56.810
This is going to be equal to
one over one minus one plus p.

00:06:58.048 --> 00:07:00.440
One minus one plus p.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.692
Which is indeed equal to one over p.

00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:06.309
So there you have it, we
have proven to ourselves

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:10.116
that the expected value of
a geometric random variable

00:07:10.116 --> 00:07:13.562
using some, I think, cool mathematics

00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:16.062
is indeed equal to one over p.
