00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
 , 

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
 In this demo I will solve a set of examples to find 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.170
 Equations of lines in the form of the intersection of inclination 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.610
 With a little revision, this means line equations 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:17.050
 Y = mx + b where m is the inclination 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.200
 And b is the intersection of y 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.870
 Let us solve a set of these issues. So here 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.900
 We gave that line a mi-5, that's m 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.740
 = -5 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.290
 The y intersection is 6 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.300
 Ie b = 6 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.985
 It's direct 

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.530
 The equation of this line is y = 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 5x + 6- 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 It was not bad 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 Let us move on to the following equation 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 The line inclination is -1 and contains 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 Point 4 / 5.0 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 We gave that inclination, the tilt is -1 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.230
 If we know that m = -1, we would not 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.190
 100% sure about the location of the y intersection 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.510
 We know that this equation will take the form of y 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.300
 = Tilt 1x + b, where b is 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.460
 Intersection y 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.650
 Now, we can use this coordinate information 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.870
 Where they contain this point, we can use those 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.590
 Information to find b 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.530
 Since the font contains this point it means that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 The x value is equal to 4/5, and y = 0 must be achieved 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.265
 This equation 

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:43.120
 Let us compensate them in the equation, y = 0 when x 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.090
 = 4/5 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.170
 If 0 = -1 × 4/5 + b 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.810
 I will go down a little 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 Let's see, we get 0 = -4.5 + b 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.040
 We can add 4/5 to both ends of the equation 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.250
 We can add 4/5 here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.320
 We can add 4/5 to this aspect as well 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100
 This is why I have done so until we delete this 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 We get b = 4/5 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.250
 b = 4/5 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.180
 Now we have the line equation 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.040
 y = -1 × x, where you can write -x 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.500
 + b, ie 4/5, so 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.480
 Now we have these 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.580
 The line contains point 2.6 and 5.0 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.540
 We were not given the inclination or the intersection of y 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.030
 clearly 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.350
 But we can find them out of this 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.650
 Coordinates 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.270
 The first thing we can do is find a tilt 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.750
 We know that the slope m = change in y / 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.100
 The change in x, and equal - what is the change in y? 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.490
 Let's start this now 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.985
 6 - 0 

00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:04.210
 6 - 0 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.070
 Let me do it that way 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.410
 If this is 6 - you want to color it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.340
 6 - 0, this is the change in y 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:24.190
 The change in x is 2 - 2 -5 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.320
 The reason I am his color is that I want to see you 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.890
 When I use the phrase y this first, I have used 6 here, where 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.380
 Use this x phrase first as well 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.730
 I want to show you that this coordinates 2.6 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.590
 This coordinates is 5.0 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.650
 I can not replace 2 and 5 after that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.030
 Then I get the negative image of the answer 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.080
 But what did we get here? 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.210
 This equals 6 - 0 = 6 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.770
 2 - 5 = -3 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.910
 If it becomes 6/3, the equivalent 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.310
 2 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.250
 If this is the inclination 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.920
 We know that the line must be, y = 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.580
 Tilt - Write this in orange - -2x x 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.160
 + Intersection y 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.779
 Now we can do exactly what we did in the last question 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.579
 We can use one of these tee points we find b 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.029
 We can use any one 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.920
 They are all on the line, if they all have to be achieved 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.900
 This equation 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.800
 I will use 5.0 because it is always good when 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.020
 We have 0 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.820
 The calculation is a bit simpler 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.510
 So let's put 5.0 here 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.900
 y = 0 when x = 5 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.820
 If y = 0 when we have -2 × 5, when 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.700
 x = 5 + b 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.650
 We get 0 = -10 + b 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.820
 If we add 10 to the sides of the equation, let's add 10 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.680
 For both parties, delete these 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.970
 We get b = 10 + 0, ie 10 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.420
 If we get b = 10 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.935
 Now we know the line equation 

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:14.110
 The equation is y - let me write it in another color - y = 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.280
 -2x + b + 10 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.470
 We're done 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 Let's solve one another 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.180
 Let's solve one another 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.270
 Well, the line contains 3.5 points and 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.890
 3.0- 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.380
 As in another issue, we begin to find 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.380
 Inclination, or as we call m 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.830
 It is equivalent to height / dimension, ie 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.190
 Equivalent to change in y / change in x 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.070
 If you want to apply this to your homework, do not 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.870
 You have to write all this 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.920
 I want to make sure that you understand this 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.150
 All are equal 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.520
 Then what is the change in y / change in x? 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.280
 That's worth it, let's start this side first 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.980
 So I'll show you that I can pick any of these points 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:14.050
 Let's say it's 0-5 like this 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.000
 I use this coordinate first. I will consider it 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.770
 Completion point 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.420
 Remember that when I learned this for the first time, I always wanted to 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.160
 Place the x in the numerator 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.990
 No, put y in the rugs 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.470
 This is the second of the coordinates 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:38.435
 Will be / -3-3 

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:41.250
 - 3 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.370
 This coordinates 3,0- 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.420
 This coordinates 3.5 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.980
 We ask that 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.310
 What will we get? 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.570
 That's worth - I'll write 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.210
 Another color - this is worth, in our rugs 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.010
 -5 / -3 - 3 = -6 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.650
 If the negative signal is deleted 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.930
 And we get 5/6 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.700
 We know that the equation will be y 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.560
 = 5 / 6x + b 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.600
 Now we can make up for one of these coordinates 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.440
 Let's do it 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.310
 Always use the best coordinate that contains 0 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:33.270
 If y = 0 when x = -3 + b 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.810
 All I did was I compensated -3 place x, 0 place y 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.860
 I know I can do it because it is on line 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.040
 This must achieve the line equation 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.600
 Let us find b 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.990
 If we get 0 =, if we divide 3 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.830
 3 3, the result is 1 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.890
 If we divide 6 3 3 it equals 2 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:02.380
 Becomes 5/2 + b 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.280
 We can add 5/2 to both ends of the equation 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.630
 + 5/2, + 5/2 

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.850
 I like to change the icon up 

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.520
 You are familiar with both pictures 

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.800
 If equation 5/2 = - this is 0-- 

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.600
 = b 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.090
 b = 5/2 

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:31.940
 If the line equation is y = 5 / 6x + b 

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:37.820
 As we have created 5/2, if + 5/2 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.710
 We're done 

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.280
 Let's solve one another 

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.500
 We have a chart here 

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.300
 Let us find the equation of this graph 

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.900
 In fact it is, to some extent, a little easier 

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.740
 What is the tendency? 

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.250
 The slope is the change in y / change in x 

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.310
 Let's see what happens 

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.900
 When we move on x, when the change in x is 1, if this is 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.940
 Change in x 

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.850
 The change in x is 1 

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.130
 I decided to change the x by 1 

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.900
 What is the change in y? 

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.390
 It seems that y is changing by 4 

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.980
 It seems that delta y, or change in y = 4 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.690
 When delta is x = 1 

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.340
 If the change in y / change in x, the change in y is 4 when 

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.220
 The change in x = 1 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.380
 If tilt = 4 

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.190
 And the intersection of y? 

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.720
 Well, here we can look at the chart 

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.260
 It appears to intersect with y axis on y = 

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.600
 -6, or on point 0, -6 

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.180
 We know that b = -6 

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.950
 b = -6 

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.875
 If we know the equation of the line 

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:56.630
 The equation of this line is y = x x 

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.030
 + Intersection y 

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.850
 I have to write this 

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.840
 - 6, this + -6. If these are 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.800
 Line equation 

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.980
 Let's solve one another 

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.170
 We gave that f (1.5) = -3, and 

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.750
 f (-1) = 2 

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.970
 What is that? 

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.830
 Well, this is a way of telling you that 

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:30.530
 Point when x = 1.5 in pairing 

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.490
 The pairing evaluates by -3 

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.750
 This shows that the coordinates 1.5, -3 are located 

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.270
 On-line 

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.960
 Then tell us that when x = -1, the 

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.420
 f (x) = 2 

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.540
 It's an excellent way to illustrate both 

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.400
 The two dots are on the line, there is nothing strange 

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.380
 I think the idea of ​​this matter is to become 

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.870
 The pairing code is familiar to you, so do not worry if 

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.970
 I saw something like that 

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.540
 If you set the pairing to 1.5, you get -3 

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.440
 If this is a coordinate if you imagine that y 

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.020
 = (f (x 

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.950
 This will be the y coordinate 

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.250
 And equals -3 when x = 1.5 

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.840
 Anyway, I've said this several times 

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.280
 Let us find the inclination of this line 

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.020
 The slope is the change in y / change in x = 

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:27.460
 Let 's start with 2 - this, ie - 3 - these are 

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.880
 Values ​​y-- /, all this 

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:40.140
 1. This 

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.330
 Let's write this way, -1 - 

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.440
 This, ie 1.5 

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.340
 I use colors because I want to show you that 

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.060
 -1 and 2 both came from this, and that's why I used it 

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.500
 Each of them first, if I use these first, will be on me 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.495
 Use both x and y oa. If you use 2 first 

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:02.080
 I would have to use the first one. That's why you 

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.390
 Coloring 

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.360
 It becomes our 2 - 3 

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.370
 This is equivalent to 2 + 3 

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.620
 IE5 

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.480
 1 - or 

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.040
 -1 - 1.5 = -2.5 

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.830
 2.5 

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.770
 5 2.5 2.5 = 2 

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.250
 If the slope of this line is -2 

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.130
 In fact I'll take it aside until you make it clear that it is not 

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.480
 It matters what arrangement I put 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.180
 If you use this coordinate first, then I should use it 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.140
 First coordinate. Let us do it another way 

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:54.180
 If you put a 3 - 2 / 1.5 - 

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.810
 -1, this should be 2 / 1.5- - 

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.060
 -1 

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.300
 - 1 

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.780
 It should give me the same answer 

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.130
 How much is this? 

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:12.860
 -3 - 2 = -5, / 1.5 - -1 

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.520
 This is equivalent to 1.5 + 1 

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.610
 / 2.5 

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.840
 Again, this equals -2 

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.340
 I just wanted to show you that it does not matter which one 

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.090
 We choose as a beginning or end point, as long as 

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.980
 Fixed 

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.650
 If this is the beginning, this is the x-chord 

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.370
 If this is the end, this is x 

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.500
 x End 

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.100
 But anyway, we know that the tilt is -2 

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.540
 If we know that the equation is y = -2x 

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.170
 + Intersection y 

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.720
 Let us use one of these coordinates 

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.430
 I will use this since it does not contain a decimal point 

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.450
 We know that y = 2 

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.630
 If y = 2 when x = -1 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.140
 When x = -1 

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.290
 Of course we have a positive b 

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.710
 If 2 = -2 × -1 = 2 + b 

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.390
 If we subtract 2 from both ends of the equation 

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.370
 -2, -2, from both ends 

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.480
 Equation, we get 0 on the left side 

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.520
 = b 

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.670
 If b = 0 

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.430
 If the line equation is y 

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.680
 = -2x 

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.040
 y = -2x 

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.870
 In fact if you want to write it in a coupling 

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.190
 It will be f (x) = -2x 

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.810
 I have assumed that y = f (x 

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.420
 But this equation 

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.990
 Y is not mentioned here 

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.890
 If you can write f (x) = 2x here 

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.190
 Each of these coordinates is coordinates 

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.610
 For x and f (x) 

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.960
 For x and f (x) 

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.960
 You may also consider defining the tilt as change 

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.320
 In the (f) x / change in x 

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.090
 These are all ways to review the same thing 

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.466
 .
