00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:05.081
- As my stakeout for a
young vandal continued,

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.019
I was starting to get frustrated.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.747
I had been monitoring the
poster for over four hours,

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.582
and no one had defaced it.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:14.371
For a moment, I thought
this wasn't going to work.

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.666
But I was quickly proven wrong.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.666
Oh, he's taking the pen.

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:24.235
Oh my God, he's actually doing it.

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:25.068
On camera.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:27.739
Let's go, let's go.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.760
Hey man.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.593
- Hey.

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:32.426
- Hey, how's it going?

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:33.259
- It's going.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.092
- Cool, what are you doing there?

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.767
Oh, that's so funny, you drew a (bleep).

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:36.600
- [Man] Yeah.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.573
- Yeah, that's really funny.

00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:40.018
We're doing a show
about teens, cool teens,

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:41.440
called Teen Street.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.511
Is it cool if we ask you a
few questions for the show?

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.564
- Sure, no problem.

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:46.277
- All right, cool, that's really funny.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:47.829
That's mega funny.
- Yeah, it is.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.525
- [Nathan] This teen was no good,

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:52.003
and his parents needed
to know what he did.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.722
So to earn his trust, I told him

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:57.226
we wanted to make an entire
Teen Street episode about him.

00:00:57.226 --> 00:00:58.766
So he spent the rest of his afternoon

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.599
shooting segments for a fake show.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:06.003
- What up, I'm Kyle, 19 years
old, and this is Teen Street.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.294
If you don't like it, (bleep) you.

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:10.739
I do whatever the I want and
I can do whatever I want.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.008
The thing I'm most proud of is

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:13.656
I make a (bleep) load of money.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:14.572
No regrets.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:16.081
(cheering)
- Listen to that.

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.914
- Bam.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.461
Yeah, I skated for six years,

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:20.793
played the drums for six years,

00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:22.602
and in more time, Brazilian jiu jitsu.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:23.435
You have to love your mom.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:24.896
If you don't, go (bleep) yourself.

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.613
- This show is about the
coolest teens in town.

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.113
- [Both] Teen Street, bitches.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.845
- First tattoo when I was 13.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:38.367
This is the only girl that
never complains to me.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:39.917
Alright, so now I'm gonna
show you where I live.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:41.708
Let's do this.

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.526
- [Nathan] For the final
part of the segment,

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:46.124
I said we had to do a tour of his house.

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:48.007
He didn't know it, but
he was leading me right

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.926
to his parents, and I was going to

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:51.859
tell them what he did to my poster.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:52.954
- What up, this is my pad.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:54.973
This is where I spend
my time making trouble.

00:01:54.973 --> 00:01:57.944
I'm going to show you a tour real quick.

00:01:57.944 --> 00:01:59.935
- So who's this lovely lady?

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:00.984
- [Kyle] Oh, well this is my mom, Sherry.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:02.395
- Awesome, man.
- [Sherry] Nice to meet you.

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:03.529
- Best teens have moms.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.362
- Right?

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:05.856
- Yeah.

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:08.709
Alright, but we need to
stop laughing for a moment,

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.935
because we have to sit down.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.639
I have something to talk about.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.472
- Okay.

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:17.205
- He's drawn two penises right there,

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.862
and you can see I'm holding them as if

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:23.458
I'm masturbating these two men.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:24.307
(laughing)

00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:25.188
You're laughing.

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:26.521
- [Sherry] I don't--

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.604
- [Nathan] Is that funny to you?

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.287
- No, this is not funny.

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:31.749
- The penises, do you like
that, being held like that?

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.207
(laughing)

00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:34.375
So this is, okay.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:37.958
So this is funny to you.
- That's not funny.
