00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.950
Mary's rectangular poster
is 36 inches by 20 inches.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.900
Susan's rectangular poster
is 26 inches by 30 inches.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.325
Which poster has a larger area
and by how many square inches?

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:16.450
So let's think about these.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.120
So this is Mary's poster.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.050
Mary's poster is 36
inches by 20 inches.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.010
So it's 36 inches by 20 inches.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.930
So it might look
something like that.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.500
So the area is going to be
36 times 20 square inches.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.430
36 times 2 is 72.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.950
So 36 times 20 is going
to be 720 square inches.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.280
Now let's think about
Susan's situation.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.710
So let's draw Susan's poster.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.350
Susan's poster is 26
inches by 30 inches,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.860
so 26 inches by 30 inches.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.516
So Susan's poster might
look something like that.

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:13.280
That's Susan's poster, my best
attempt to draw a rectangle.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.000
What's the area here?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.210
The area is 26 times
30 square inches,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.640
which is equal
to-- let's actually

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.360
multiply this one
out-- 26 times 30.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.500
We could do 26 times 3 and
essentially add a 0 there.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.650
So 3 times 6 is 18.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.546
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 78.

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:41.920
And actually, I could have
probably done that in my head.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.060
3 times 20 is 60, plus 3
times 6 is 18, gets us 78.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.630
But this isn't 3 times 26.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.820
3 times 26 would be 78.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.620
30 times 26 is 780.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.510
So it's 780 square inches.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.340
So whose poster, which
poster has a larger area?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.650
Susan's.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.810
Susan's poster
has a larger area.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.060
And by how many square inches?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.889
Well, hers is 780 square
inches while Mary's is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.200
720 square inches.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.070
So it's by 60 square inches.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.725
780 minus 720 would be 60.
