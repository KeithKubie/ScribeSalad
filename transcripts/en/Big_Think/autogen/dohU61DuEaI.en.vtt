so I he certainly scientifically

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
so I he certainly scientifically
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250
so I he certainly scientifically

Foundation and NASA I think he has some

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
Foundation and NASA I think he has some
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350
Foundation and NASA I think he has some
sense of that and I and he's been

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
sense of that and I and he's been
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.320
sense of that and I and he's been
appointing reliable advisors in those

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330
appointing reliable advisors in those
 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.740
appointing reliable advisors in those
circles we look at who we appointed for

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750
circles we look at who we appointed for
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.350
circles we look at who we appointed for
Secretary of Energy and his science

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
Secretary of Energy and his science
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.250
Secretary of Energy and his science
advisor these are talented smart

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260
advisor these are talented smart
 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.100
advisor these are talented smart
accomplished scientist so I have high

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
accomplished scientist so I have high
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.289
accomplished scientist so I have high
expectations for where it can go but we

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299
expectations for where it can go but we
 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.910
expectations for where it can go but we
know the country is in a serious

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
know the country is in a serious
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.610
know the country is in a serious
economic straight right now so the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
economic straight right now so the
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.140
economic straight right now so the
challenge will be to see what is the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150
challenge will be to see what is the
 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.539
challenge will be to see what is the
balance between the band-aid you will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
balance between the band-aid you will
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.190
balance between the band-aid you will
put on the problem that you can sort of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
put on the problem that you can sort of
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840
put on the problem that you can sort of
stop the hemorrhaging at this moment and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
stop the hemorrhaging at this moment and
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.440
stop the hemorrhaging at this moment and
the investments that you then insert

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
the investments that you then insert
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.020
the investments that you then insert
that will return on that investment

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
that will return on that investment
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.139
that will return on that investment
later you need the combination of both

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149
later you need the combination of both
 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.260
later you need the combination of both
without the longer-term investment then

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
without the longer-term investment then
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.670
without the longer-term investment then
you just putting band-aids on as you go

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
you just putting band-aids on as you go
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.779
you just putting band-aids on as you go
forward and nothing ever gets

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789
forward and nothing ever gets
 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.330
forward and nothing ever gets
permanently solved it gives the illusion

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
permanently solved it gives the illusion
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429
permanently solved it gives the illusion
of a solution but it doesn't actually

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
of a solution but it doesn't actually
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.480

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060
and okay yeah yeah he wasn't good for
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.090
and okay yeah yeah he wasn't good for
these there was there was a regression

what's on its plate the fact the NIH

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380
what's on its plate the fact the NIH
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.390
what's on its plate the fact the NIH
budget nearly tripled over that time the

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400
budget nearly tripled over that time the
 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.800
