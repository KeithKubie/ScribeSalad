00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.690
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.040
Thank you so much for coming to this Tech
Talk on "The Delancey Underground."

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.420
In case any of you guys are lost, no, this
is not free food for Eleven Madison Park.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.730
My name is Julia Ramsey, otherwise known as
the girl who is spamming your inboxes this

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.530
morning.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
And this is James Ramsey.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.490
He's an architect and owns RAAD Studio, an
architecture firm on the Lower East Side.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.100
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: By the way, we're related.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.590
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: If anyone was wondering.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.820
And this is Dan Barasch.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.960
He's actually a former Googler and is currently
the Vice President of PopTech.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.100
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yes.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.359
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: With no further ado--.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:37.500
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yeah.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.409
So, I mean, first of all, thanks so much for
having us and thanks, Julia, for--.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.260
I heard you were posting flyers all night.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.289
So, we're super appreciative for that.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.610
And thanks for some friends in the audience.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.090
It's good to see you guys.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.749
I guess we're really excited about sharing
this with you.

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.100
So, I guess we'll just kind of kick it off.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: OK.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.270
We'll look at some pictures and speak generally
about the idea we're proposing here.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.080
But in a nutshell, and if you've seen, maybe
come across this in the media, it's oftentimes

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.800
been called the Low Line for some fairly obvious
reasons which you'll probably see in a second.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.900
But at the heart of it is a concept that we're
working on to build an underground park underneath

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.830
the Lower East Side in an abandoned trolley
terminal.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.380
And it uses it innovative solar technology
to actually accomplish this.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.890
And we'd like to do is just walk through the
genesis of the idea, talk a little bit about

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.640
how it works, talk about some of the design
issues, talk about the technology, too.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.470
And then, generally speak about the process
and maybe even have a very light Q and A,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.950
where you guys can just talk to us about it.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.650
All right.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.690
So, let's start here.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.070
All right.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.710
Does anyone here know who this guy is?

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.270
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Oh, come on.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.510
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Shigeru Miyamoto.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.470
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: You're awesome.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.240
Shigeru Miyamoto, for those of you who do
not recognize this man, is an amazing fellow.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.030
He is the guy that invented Super Mario Brothers.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.540
And I'll explain why this is significant in
a second, but a couple years ago, the New

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.990
Yorker wrote an article about Shigeru Miyamoto
and why it was that he designed such amazing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.220
video games.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.740
And if you think about it, Super Mario Brothers
is really simple, right?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.060
It's just a 2-D world and you're a plumber
running around jumping on mushrooms and turtles.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.390
But it's laid out in such a way that what
seems like a very simple map that you're running

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.130
around in actually has all these levels and
layers of complexity.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.960
It has all these secrets for you to discover.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.319
Like for example, in this screen right here
I think, somewhere over on the left side of

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.140
the screen, you can jump up, you hit a secret
brick and a beanstalk pops out or something

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.330
like that.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.400
But anyway, throughout this game and also
another famous game that he created called

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.690
"Legend of Zelda," they're sort of peppered
with all these tiny little details that make

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.040
exploring it something that never quite feels
finished and gives it a level of complexity

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.620
that make these things endlessly interesting
and something you want to play again and again

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.250
and again.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.020
Quite literally in this picture, you can jump,
obviously, in the pipe over here.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.840
And you go down into this secret underworld.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.710
So, the reason I'm talking about this is that
well, for one thing, this is New York, by

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.750
the way.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.099
New York City is an amazing, amazing town.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.440
And I think that there is a similarity of
level of complexity in New York and also a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.260
lot of other cities of course.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.010
But this is the city I know best and the city
I love the most.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.810
And every once in a while, New York City will,
like Super Mario Brothers, just peel back

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.620
a layer of the onion and just give you a tiny
little glimpse into how amazingly complex

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.860
it actually is and how many secrets it's still
hiding from you.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.680
And that's one of the most compelling things,
to me anyway, about urbanism in New York.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.090
It makes me wanna live here.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.130
It makes me endlessly fascinated with the
city.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.959
And I think it's an extremely powerful quality.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:31.080
Now, I think recently we've had this age in
which they've knocked down a lot of stuff--and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.590
no offense if this is your apartment building
or the Starbuck's that you really enjoy frequenting--I'm

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.780
just using it as an example.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.840
But recently, they've knocked down a lot of
stuff.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.240
They've taken away a lot of our historical
legacy--all these little, quirky things.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.880
And actually, now that I think of it, you
guys have enabled Maps functions and Search

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.230
functions that have really taken away a lot
of surprises out of the world and a lot of

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.790
the mystery out of our cities.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.000
I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.510
It's just a reality.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.180
However, you can have this landscape still
co-exist with some of these secrets I'm referring

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180
to.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.280
For example, just down the street from my
apartment.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.020
I live on Renwick Street, which by the way
in and of itself, is kind of a secret.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.340
No one knows where Renwick Street is.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.030
But it's over near the Holland Tunnel.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.750
And if you are walking down the sidewalk and
staring at your feet, which one day I was,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.770
you will notice that there's this little sign
there.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.220
And I'm not gonna read it, but effectively
it says, hear ye, hear ye, here was ye olde

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.930
waterfront of New York City.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.660
And this is where the sailboats and all these
masted ships used to pull up.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.820
And actually embedded in the sidewalk right
there, are these wooden piles just right there

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.820
in the sidewalk.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.560
And you would never really notice this unless
you happened to have glanced at it or if you

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.270
happened to know it was there.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.330
But I guess the point of all this is that
it's still there.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.990
And you have to know where to look.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.500
But New York will still find a way to surprise
you with its hidden complexities.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.830
And New York is not so much like other East
Coast older cities, like Boston or Philadelphia

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.960
for example, where they're really wearing
their history on their sleeve.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.530
You actually have to seek it out a little
but in New York because we are so market-driven

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.530
and forward-looking.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:37.640
But every once in a while, again, there's
certain places if you know where to look.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.580
And this is quite literally one of them.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.410
I don't know if anyone had the good fortune
to have done this.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.710
But this is Atlantic Avenue in front of Trader
Joe's in downtown Brooklyn.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.190
And underneath, inside one manhole cover,
you can go down it and that's what's in there.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.910
So, this is actually down there.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.470
It was a secret abandoned railroad tunnel
built in the 1840s.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.180
And some guy--just some random guy--it was
this self-trained history buff, right?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.520
Went down a manhole cover one day in the late-80s.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.330
I think it was the day after Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom came out.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.110
And he went down in here and he was like,
"Oh, my God.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.110
Look what I found."

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.650
And lo and behold, there it is.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.650
It's huge.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.430
It goes all the way from Trader Joe's all
the way to the water.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.840
But I guess this is to illustrate a point
that it's down there.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.500
And in general, we have this vast underworld
lurking underneath the service of New York.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.740
I mean, other cities of course as well, especially
European cities.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.100
But we have this vast underworld lurking down
there.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.919
We have something like, and I don't think
it's all cataloged, but we have something

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.840
like 13 acres of unused underground space
underneath New York.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.930
That's a lot in New York, by the way.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:59.080
So, here is maybe a less impressive one that's
over on, I think, Worth Street or something

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080
like that.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.900
And of course, this is the beautiful City
Hall Station.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:11.479
If anyone has snoozed on the 6 train or been
reading a book and forgot to get off at the

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:15.700
last stop, at the Brooklyn Bridge stop, the
train will then circle around and loop around

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.320
to go back uptown.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.490
And if you wake up for just that instant in
a panic from being stuck on the train, this

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.160
is probably what you'll see.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.750
So, I'm not sure whether you're allowed to
be doing that, but if you have the chance,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.920
it's pretty cool.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.610
And I guess more specifically, this is the
space that we're looking at today.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:44.010
Actually, I'll hand the clicker over to Dan,
but this is the Williamsburg Trolley Terminal,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.420
built in 1903 and abandoned in 1948.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.360
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yeah.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.620
And James and in his work as an architect
and designer came across this site by befriending

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.770
a former MTA engineer, who got him interested
in this particular location, which is just

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.520
a couple blocks away from his office on the
Lower East Side.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.860
And James and I, just by way of introduction,
started talking about this particular project

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.520
because of my personal love and interest of
the subway and the city in general, but also

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.380
I was separately thinking about an idea of
how we would potentially bring art into the

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.890
underground subway.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.080
James had an entirely different angle, which
we'll get to actually, and is at the heart

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.300
of the actual project.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.570
But this actual location, as you can see here,
there's a couple of fun details in this picture.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.300
If you look--I think it's blown up enough--you
can see all the way in the back there some

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.870
people in topcoats and they sort of look old-timey.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.410
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: They're probably mustachioed
as well.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.470
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Mustachioed.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.610
So, this is from the 1930s.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:50.100
And essentially what you're looking at is,
this is the trolley turnaround back in the

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.680
days when the city used street cars primarily
to get around the city before the subways

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.720
were really the main way that people got around
the city.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.580
And so, the trolleys would come over the Williamsburg
Bridge--and for those of you who are familiar

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.130
with this part of town, they would go underground
and this is essentially the terminal where

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.410
the cars would be stored, turn around, go
back over the bridge.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.120
This is what it looks like today, actually.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.160
We're able to hoodwink the MTA into a tour,
which is a lot harder than it sounds, and

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.850
when we got down there, we were really blown
away by the height, the scale of what you

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.380
can see down there.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.240
Just again, sort of a sense of scale, you
can see that figure way, way, way in the back

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240
in the center.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.519
That's actually an MTA employee.

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:37.140
So, it's just this incredibly massive space.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.380
It was wet 'cause there had just been a snowstorm.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.870
And so there's a lot of runoff.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.580
These are some more pictures of the location.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.670
It's actually directly adjacent to the JMZ
line, if you guys take the JMZ and when you're

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.120
facing it to Brooklyn, you can actually see--.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120
We had a photo.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120
It's not there.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: It's the one after that.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.120
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: The one after?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.430
I'll show you in a sec.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.310
So, if you're actually on the JMZ track, you
can actually look into the location.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:11.600
And usually it's not lit, so it's this dark
expanse, but when it's lit you can see into

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.089
the location.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.330
One of the incredible things that--.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.519
This is a photo that we actually took during
our tour.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:20.459
There's remnant cobblestone, remnant rail
lines, and it is the kind of that you get

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:23.970
down there--and James just talked about it--it's
like an Indiana Jones moment.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.149
It's this incredibly exciting discovery almost
of this abandoned space.

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:31.350
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I also felt like it was the
scene in Lord of the Rings where they go into

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.350
the dwarf mine.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.740
I don't know if anyone saw it.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.740
Very similar.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.000
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: That's kind of what it was
like.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.610
So, this is the location for those of you
who may or may not be familiar with the neighborhood.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.920
One the left there--.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.500
This is actually Google Maps.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.790
So, it's pretty awesome.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.010
The yellow over there is the Williamsburg
Bridge.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.459
And this is where Delancey Street ends and
when the Brooklyn Bridge starts.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.340
So, it's directly below.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.019
That's Delancey Street and it's that weird,
little hook there.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:02.330
If you guys are familiar with Delancey Street
and you ever wondered why there's all that

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.350
weird, wasted space to the right when you're
facing the bridge, it's actually because of

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.230
the existence of this underground space that
most people don't know about.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:19.790
Here's an old drawing from probably the turn
of the century of what the bridge may have

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.670
looked like back in its earlier days.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.730
As I mentioned, the Williamsburg Bridge was
built in 1903 and obviously the trolley terminal

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.290
was built at the same time.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:36.600
These are some other fun pictures of Delancey
Street in the 1930s.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:45.760
And this is, you can see a lot of the elevated
track lines and a bustling streetscape.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.790
But I think what's compelling about this is
you can see that it had a vibrant night life--,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:13:00.130
streetscape, and it also has, as the Lower
East Side has always been, this crossroads

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.589
from a transportation perspective, but also
just culturally and from a merchant perspective

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:06.329
as well.

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:13.730
Which I think brings us to the current day
and again, this is a view from the Williamsburg

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.730
Bridge.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.990
And you can see, actually, that there's a
really limited amount of green space in the

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.990
area.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:27.100
You can see also that it's a space that is
friendly to cars, but is actually pretty challenging

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.540
for cyclists and for pedestrians.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.810
It's one of the most dangerous parts of the
city from a cyclist and pedestrian perspective.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.870
There was just a little girl who was actually
killed, unfortunately, walking across the

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.320
street just a couple weeks ago.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.800
And it remains this large transportation question,
but also this livability question for the

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.810
neighborhood--how to make this particular
neighborhood, this particular node of the

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.380
city greener and more livable.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:14:01.370
So, one of the answers to why this is the
case is the actual history of New York City.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.570
And I don't know if you guys have been to
exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York,

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:15.170
but there's a really fun exhibit on the grid
and its creation of blocks--very geometric

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.290
blocks that span across the entire city.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.310
And what those do is they're very efficient
from a real estate perspective and are designed

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:27.220
really for optimal economic output, but they
aren't really conducive to green space and

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.840
don't really allow for some of the sweeping
green spaces in parks that you see in less

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.470
gridded cities like many of the European capitals.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.440
This is one of the images that we actually
have some across in our research and our zeal

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.170
for this project in a book called "How the
Other Half Lives," which is a really incredible

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.329
book on the history of the Lower East Side,
specifically in some of its darkest and most

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:58.899
dangerous and uncertain times in the 19th
Century actually.

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.660
And here what you see is a somewhat disturbing
image of a bunch of kids in an obviously very

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:11.910
unclean street, playing or relaxing, basically
next to the carcass of a dead horse.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:19.019
And this was one of many images that actually
helped build a movement for the creation of

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:24.380
parks and specifically the creation of playgrounds
and spaces where children play and recreate

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.470
in a safe and clean environment.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.160
So, this obviously brings us to where we are
today.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.339
And again, if you guys have ever been to Delancey
Street or Lower East Side, you're familiar

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:42.410
with the fact that the streetscape isn't really
very friendly.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.279
It's really not very fun and it's actually
quite dangerous to spend quality time on Delancey

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.980
Street, particularly in this part of Delancey
Street.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:59.410
So, this is again a lot of our motivation
on why this particular project has come to

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.600
where we are.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.990
This is another slide that helps point out
this fact in slightly more statistical terms.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.899
You have the region that's known as the Community
Board Three's jurisdiction.

00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:17.170
I don't know if you guys follow local politics,
but this area that comprises the East Village,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.200
Lower East Side, and Chinatown is one of the
least green parts of the city when measured

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.649
in acres of green space per thousand residents.

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:30.550
And it's one of the least green parts of New
York City.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:36.070
And it's also important to note, and what
comes in surprise to New Yorkers, that New

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:41.580
York actually has less green space than many
other high-density cities.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:49.399
So, this is led to a sense of how do we think
about reclaiming Delancey Street, looking

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:55.350
back to the past, but also looking forward
and thinking creatively about what could potentially

00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.130
be done with and for the neighborhood, but
more broadly thinking about how to solve for

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.769
some of the larger questions of this particular
really inspiring site?

00:17:04.769 --> 00:17:05.769
So--.

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:13.579
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: So, I mean, as Dan is saying,
the Lower East Side itself is a historically

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:18.409
neglected neighborhood, at least by the powers
that be.

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:25.879
And it's one in which infrastructure and commerce
and market-driven concerns have really formed

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.630
its development.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:33.279
And so, it's a neighborhood that is very low
on green space.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:38.739
We happen to have discovered that there is
this ginormous trolley terminal just lurking

00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:41.320
beneath the surface, right at the foot of
the Williamsburg Bridge.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:47.840
So, in a lot of ways, this made a perfect
site for us to look at to actually turn into

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.269
a public amenity.

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.960
And that's the goal of what we're trying to
accomplish here.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.809
Now, you saw the pictures that we were just
looking at before, like the one on the bottom

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:57.470
right here.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:02.870
It would be on the one hand, of course we
wanted to share that sense of, that thrill

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:08.590
of discovery that urban archaeology that we
experienced, actually, figuring out that this

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.600
thing was down there.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.220
At the same time, in terms of sharing that
experience, it would be a stretch to say that

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.399
most people would wanna go down into that
space.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.340
I mean, I thought it was incredibly cool,
but that's just me.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.409
I think that most people would have an aversion
to going down into a space like that.

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:28.630
And so, we started thinking about what are
some of the natural solutions to actually

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.179
making that an accessible space that you would
actually want to go down into and spend time

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:33.179
in.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:37.450
And one of the easiest answers to that is
to introduce natural sunlight.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.779
The simplest and easiest way to introduce
natural sunlight into that space would probably

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:45.419
be to just cut a bunch of holes in the ceiling.

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:47.940
But unfortunately, the ceiling is Delancey
Street.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.669
So, that would be, probably, a bad idea, right?

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:52.610
So, we looked at this.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:58.600
Well, actually, it just happened rather, that
I was working on a technology at the time

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.450
that we actually found out about this space.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:08.649
And that technology is something that perhaps
we can look to to actually satisfy those needs

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:12.989
of the space to create an appealing environment
to be used as a public amenity.

00:19:12.989 --> 00:19:16.350
So, what is this technology then?

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.989
Well, this is a very diagrammatic version
of what this tech could be.

00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:26.669
But in a nutshell, at the top side above the
street, like at a lamp post level or something,

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:32.539
you actually use a system of optics to concentrate
sunlight down into a tiny, tiny footprint,

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.700
a tiny little pellet of super-concentrated
light.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.470
You take that light, you funnel it through
a tube or a fiber optic cable for that matter.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.419
And you lead it to where you need it to go.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:45.840
And then, you distribute it in the inverse
of the way you gathered it.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.779
So, in effect, what you've done having gone
through that process is you've created a skylight

00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:55.789
where you couldn't otherwise normally have
a skylight.

00:19:55.789 --> 00:20:01.109
It's very similar, functionally speaking,
it's a fairly straightforward idea.

00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:05.480
Functionally speaking, it's very similar to
a periscope or even an endoscope--something

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.870
like that.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.879
But it's really just an optical device that
allows us to do this, right?

00:20:10.879 --> 00:20:15.989
So, that has some pretty obvious advantages
for this specific site in that you've distilled

00:20:15.989 --> 00:20:21.470
the footprint of the sky and sunlight down
to a tiny little point and that's all you're

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.470
cutting in the street.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.539
So, you can free up the street level for cars
and people and dogs or whatever, and actually

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:32.280
just run this thing down there and then redistribute
it and then spread it back out and actually

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:38.799
achieve an effect where what you're looking
up at down in the space is a simulacrum of

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:42.009
what you're looking at with the collectors
above.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:48.380
So, that's all fine and well, conceptually,
but we felt like we needed to actually see

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.590
if this idea--this kooky idea--worked.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:58.049
So, we gathered together a few friends and
we went through the process of actually engineering

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:04.639
a system like this, and designing it and actually
fabricating it, too, which was a very telling

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:05.710
process.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.389
In the end--this was probably last summer--we
ended up in the fifth floor walk-up of a buddy

00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:18.109
of mine, sweating in the middle of summertime
in Chinatown, screwing together this device.

00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:21.159
But so, it's very homemade.

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:28.090
But at the same time, we realized that it
is something that is possible and it is doable

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.519
and it works.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.710
It's actually a fairly old process.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.840
I mean, hearkening back to ancient Egypt,
they would cut shafts through their ceilings

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.440
to reflect light down into the tombs and stuff.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.509
The skylight is obviously a version.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:45.700
There's an invention called the "solar tube,"
that also accomplishes something very similar.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.799
So, really this is just a variation on a very
ancient theme.

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:50.799
All right?

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.799
So, we built one.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:53.500
This is a terrible picture and I apologize.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.429
But this was taken with my Blackberry in my
office.

00:21:58.429 --> 00:21:59.559
But this is the device.

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:04.490
This is a small, hand-held prototype version
of the technology.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.860
And what you're seeing here is there's a gathering
instrument on the top.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:14.250
The entire glass cube disconnects into two
pieces, like a Transformer.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.820
And you connect the two sides and there you
go.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.159
You have the three components.

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:23.450
So, there's someone from my office just setting
it up on the sidewalk on the Lower East Side.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.710
This picture was taken in front of Sammy's
Roumanian.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.440
Has anyone ever been there?

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.600
Yeah.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.919
So, yeah.

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:36.389
We're just setting up this incredibly strange
and scary high-tech device in front of Sammy's

00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:39.359
Roumanian's garbage actually.

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:46.279
And we got quite a few strange looks from
the staff at Sammy's.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:49.730
There's me setting up the gathering instrument.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.090
And there's some kid walking away with an
eyebrow.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.090
[laughter]

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.460
And here's us plugging it in.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.429
And here is Dan, rudely shining it in my face.

00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:07.809
And so, it was an exploratory process, but
one that we felt was extremely valuable from

00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:10.970
a conceptual point of view--ie., it works.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.299
And also a technical perspective 'cause we
got to explore some of the technical hurdles

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.929
to actually fabricating an item like this.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:18.929
Proof of concept.

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:19.960
All right.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.720
So, that brings us to the space itself, right?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.481
So, I had someone from my office go down to
MTA Archives and again, what was the term

00:23:28.481 --> 00:23:29.481
you used?

00:23:29.481 --> 00:23:30.481
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Hoodwinked.

00:23:30.481 --> 00:23:31.481
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Hoodwinked, yes.

00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:37.190
So, we hoodwinked our way into stealing the
original engineering drawings for the space.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.619
And the drawing is from 1902, the year before.

00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:47.859
And so, we rolled out these ancient blueprints,
sat down there old school style with the little

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:53.889
triangle scales, measured the thing, and built
a 3-D model of every nut and bolt in the entire

00:23:53.889 --> 00:23:55.019
space basically.

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:57.820
And as per the specifications in their drawings.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:04.830
We then built a 3-D model of our prototype
technology, but written large on a large scale

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.899
that would be specifically applicable to the
space.

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:13.210
And we began to put the pieces together to
see, design-wise, what emerged.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:18.220
And as we messed with it, this is what we
came up with.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:25.379
So, this is quite literally that technology
directly modeled into the space itself.

00:24:25.379 --> 00:24:32.389
And it just so happens, as part of the technical
exploration, we realized that we are transmitting

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:37.360
the wavelengths of light that plants want
to drink up for photosynthesis.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:44.659
So, why not grow trees and grass down there,
too?

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:47.229
[pause]

00:24:47.229 --> 00:24:49.809
The wide shot right here.

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:51.230
[pause]

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.080
All right.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.929
So, anyway.

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:59.409
This is our concept.

00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:02.239
And it has a range of implications.

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:07.599
And the first time these images popped out
of the computer, it kind of gave me goose

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:08.599
bumps.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:15.019
And we started going around, talking to various
friends about this idea, about his concept

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:16.019
in general.

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:20.120
We started looking into the history of the
Lower East Side itself, some of the dynamics

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.419
going on in the community.

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:25.899
And a very clear picture started to emerge,
both what the design, generally speaking,

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:33.820
would be, but also pointing to the fact that
this would be an incredible amenity for the

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.669
community that it's actually located in.

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:41.260
And so, we, for the last two years, have set
about the process of trying to push this forward

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.909
and actually make something real out of it,
to actually make this thing exist.

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:49.700
Conceptually and technically, it's something
that's actually possible and something very

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.230
doable.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.910
From another standpoint, we have to actually
push forward in other ways to actually make

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.029
it a political and fiscal reality.

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:01.220
And so, let's see--.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.220
Here's an image of the skylight.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.190
I was gonna hand the clicker to you, though.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.409
Here we go.

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:07.639
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yeah.

00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:09.989
So, just a couple quick fun things about this.

00:26:09.989 --> 00:26:14.389
I mean, even in this image itself, I mean,
a lot of these images have spoken for themselves.

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:17.840
I know you guys may have read some articles
on this.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.899
And as we share this with people in the community
and friends of ours, what's really funny is

00:26:22.899 --> 00:26:26.409
that people have said, "Oh, it's kind of like
a low line."

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:28.370
And that's actually really fun.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.370
And they meant it as a compliment.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.370
Get it?

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.370
Right.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.580
It's like, Lower East Side, Low Line.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.870
And I think it's a really fun comparison.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:40.570
What the High Line guys have done is unbelievably
incredible, super inspiring.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.669
So, one of the first few things that we did
when we basically set out to try to make this

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:51.269
thing a reality was to go talk to High Line
guys, which I think Robert and Josh have come

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:52.269
here multiple times.

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:55.349
I don't know if you guys have heard them speak
or seen their book.

00:26:55.349 --> 00:26:59.370
They have a new book that's kind of like a
textbook on how to build a new park.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.159
So, we've read that.

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:09.799
And basically, a lot of the advice that has
come from them is to really work on how we

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:15.700
need to understand the complexity and the
multiple layers of business owners and community

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.999
leaders in the Lower East Side, and work directly
with them on initiating a dialogue.

00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:26.419
Not presenting something and then expecting
everyone to accept it, but really just grow

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:29.519
support for the idea over time.

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:34.210
So, in that vein, we've done a lot of things
that actually have been a bit of a learning

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:40.389
curve for both of us as well, like attend
community board meetings and engage with stakeholders

00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:42.700
at the city and the state level.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:48.419
And really learn a lot more about who gets
to decide what happens to this space.

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:55.450
A key piece here is that the core reality
is that the MTA currently owns the location

00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:04.590
and is looking to put the proposal, essentially
open it up for proposals at some point later

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.590
this year.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:12.580
There's also the reality that it's immediately
below one of the largest redevelopment areas

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.690
in the entire city--definitely in Manhattan--at
the moment.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:21.849
So, the Lower East Side is about to be positioned
for some pretty tremendous change.

00:28:21.849 --> 00:28:27.419
And a lot of developers are vying for the
locations really adjacent to the entire location.

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:32.669
So, we've been working with various city agencies
to understand more about that process, understand

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:35.859
more about what we can do there.

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:43.499
So, I think just to, and I can answer more
nitty-gritty questions if anyone is interested

00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:46.920
in the political realities of what we're doing
or lives in the Lower East Side.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.100
If any of you live on the Lower East Side
or in the neighborhood, I'd love to talk to

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.559
you more about it.

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:56.849
But essentially, I think what we're doing
is we're really bringing the community into

00:28:56.849 --> 00:29:00.340
this over the course of this year to build
up support for the concept.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.289
So, one of the first things that we're doing
in just two weeks’ time, is to launch a

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:11.559
kick starter campaign, where we'll be directly
inviting and bringing the community into that.

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.830
One of the things that we're hoping to do
is to actually build a full-scale mock-up

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:21.409
of this actual technology in a large, sizable
location so people will be able to experience

00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:23.869
the technology itself, with their own eyes.

00:29:23.869 --> 00:29:25.599
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Right.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:26.599
Not Sammy's.

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:27.599
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yeah.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:28.599
And not in front Sammy's garbage.

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:34.700
But also just to be able to envision what
an indoor park would look and feel like using

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.570
actual sunlight indoors.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.009
And to continue this larger conversation that
we're having with the community around what

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:44.289
they would use this kind of a space for.

00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:50.729
There's a whole host of supporters in the
community and in business and at the government

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:51.729
levels.

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:55.549
And we're really just planning to use the
rest of this year to get more people excited

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:57.149
about what we're up to.

00:29:57.149 --> 00:30:00.480
So, that's where we are at this point.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.919
And I'm sure there's probably a lot of questions.

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:04.919
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Or not.

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:06.589
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Maybe you wanna--?

00:30:06.589 --> 00:30:11.679
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: So, we have this concept and
we welcome anyone here's support.

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:16.529
We think that it's a concept that, well, showcases
a new green technology.

00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:23.149
I think it is an amenity for historically
under-served community.

00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:31.609
And also, I think it hopefully pushes us in
a direction to maybe possibly rethink the

00:30:31.609 --> 00:30:39.390
way that we deal with public spaces and specifically,
left-over infrastructure, by the use of applying

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:44.009
technology to actually begin to suit some
of those public needs.

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:49.710
So, anyway, I guess it would be probably a
good time to see if anyone here has any questions

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.099
or comments that they wanna rain down on us.

00:30:52.099 --> 00:30:54.440
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Let it rain.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.779
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I don't know.

00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:58.649
I don't work here.

00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:03.419
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: I haven't been keeping up with
it, but I remember a few months ago the Department

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:06.389
of Transportation was talking about doing
a lot of construction on Delancey, the way

00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:08.289
the bridge connects with Delancey.

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:12.309
Putting up a big wall, basically, perpendicular
to the bridge.

00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:14.299
Does that conflict at all with what you're
doing?

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:15.659
Is that still happening?

00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:19.909
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: The proposal that he's referring
to has to do with the way that bikes come

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:21.690
down off of the bridge.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.919
And I think it's safe here to say this.

00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:29.309
I think it's a bonehead idea 'cause say you
are zooming down the bridge at like, Mach

00:31:29.309 --> 00:31:32.339
Two, and then there's a concrete wall right
in front of you, right?

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:33.339
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Yeah.

00:31:33.339 --> 00:31:35.209
That's a popular opinion, I've heard.

00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:41.839
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I mean, I think more to the
point, it does highlight that there is a pretty

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:44.129
hardcore circulation issue at that point.

00:31:44.129 --> 00:31:49.509
I think that basically they built a corridor,
specifically based on cars and trucks.

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:54.719
And everything else is just an afterthought,
including human beings and bicycles.

00:31:54.719 --> 00:32:00.379
And so, for anyone who's been hurtling down
that bridge, you're just unceremoniously dropped

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:04.289
at the end of the bridge into Delancey Street
traffic, which is, as we know, some of the

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.110
most dangerous in the city.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:12.009
So, I think it's admirable that they are proposing
a solution to try and protect the bikers from

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:13.099
the car traffic.

00:32:13.099 --> 00:32:17.649
I think that's a great step in the right direction.

00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:22.839
We see this project as potentially posing
other solutions to that bike circulation issue

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:26.869
that who's repercussions we had ourselves
thought through all the way.

00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:32.149
But we would hope that this addresses some
of those circulation issues directly.

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:34.720
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Yeah, if you could be like, an
alternative to that, that'd be--.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.080
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I mean, wouldn't that be cool?

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080
Zoom down into there, reemerge.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080
You know, something like that.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hey, how are you?

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.080
So, really cool technology.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080
Really awesome idea.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.080
How much do you guys think it's gonna cost?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080
And where do you think the money's gonna come
from?

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080
'Cause I'm assuming that the MTA does this.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080
That the MTA doesn’t have that much money
right now and probably wants to make a lot

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080
of money on any purchase of what they own.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080
Is it--?

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080
Are they looking to sell the city?

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080
I mean, what kind of estimates do you guys
have about how much it's gonna cost?

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:57.570
Besides the technology, there's obviously
a big clean-up and then the safety issues

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:15.039
and then making it sanitary and all those
kinds of things after a hundred years.

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:18.539
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Right.

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:20.619
Plus getting into it and getting a wheelchair,
etcetera.

00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:21.619
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Right.

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:22.619
All of those types of things.

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:26.820
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: See, you pretty much nailed
why this is an amazing challenge, right?

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.820
[laughter]

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.190
And why we're spending all our time on this.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.789
So, you're right.

00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:34.019
So, just to address all of the different elements
there.

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:36.919
The MTA owns the space.

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:42.220
The MTA, you may have heard, is an agency
that is billions of dollars in debt.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.210
And is looking to liquidate all its real estate
as much as it can.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.950
This is obviously a location, interestingly,
that wasn't on the radar before we had started

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:51.950
talking about it.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.070
And now, it's a much more interesting and
people have heard of the location over the

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.130
last few months.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.619
We've been working really closely with the
MTA.

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:02.830
I'm understanding a little bit more about
what kinds of thresholds they would need in

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.679
order for us to submit the competing bid.

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:11.100
And there's a lot of people, both in the MTA
and outside the MTA, who think this is a wonderful

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.429
idea and are basically saying, "We give you
all of our support.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.529
Essentially what you need to do is you need
to go and raise money."

00:34:17.529 --> 00:34:22.440
And so, what we've done is we've set up a
501(c)3 non-profit organization, very similar

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.519
to the High Line, and again, taking a lot
of advice from the High Line founders on where

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:30.230
some of that money would come from.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:36.480
So, we have a range of ways that we've benchmarked
how the cost would be.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.769
It's all conjecture at this point because
there's so many questions we don't know around

00:34:39.769 --> 00:34:42.070
what's gonna happen above ground.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.270
We have a range of engineers and legal experts
and folks who are gonna help us come up with

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.179
a number that's actually a lot more realistic
and then will probably have to get thrown

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.179
away.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.579
Interestingly, the High Line guys came up
with a number on how much it was gonna cost

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:59.829
them, that they were way off on and they realized
that only several years further into the process.

00:34:59.829 --> 00:35:00.829
So,--.

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:02.241
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: They were under?

00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:04.750
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: They were under significantly
actually, yeah.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.520
But what the High Line guys--I think they're
really inspiring in a lot of ways--that what

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.920
they've proven to be is fund-raising juggernauts.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:18.740
And what they've been able to do is to do
a mix of, if anyone has worked in or worked

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:25.039
with non-profits, it's a mix of a standard
non-profit fund-raising model of private donations,

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:32.900
corporate support, Google would be a wonderful
supporter, and foundation support.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.570
And the High Line eventually also moved to
a membership-based model.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.690
So, there's another fund-raising stream there,
too.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.420
They've done all kinds of other interesting
things, too.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:47.990
I mean, another interesting dimension of this
is that the neighborhood is extremely excited

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:54.970
about this as a business opportunity for existing
and new businesses.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:00.599
The Lower East Side business district has
just actually officially endorsed us as our

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:02.480
representative on the city council.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.160
And I think those two votes of support point
to the fact that the local business community

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:13.690
actually feels that this would be a tremendous
magnet and an important economic boon for

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.380
a neighborhood that often is where you go
to get drunk at night, but is actually not

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:24.020
necessarily a vibrant, deeply integrated business
community that others from other neighborhoods

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.670
and other countries and other cities come
to when they come to New York City.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:34.140
So, the High Line has proven its tremendous
economic impact.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:39.110
The numbers that are circling in my head is
that at this point, it's cost about 250 million

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.309
dollars to get the High Line to where it is
now.

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:46.920
But they've generated about two billion dollars
in value for the city and for the economy.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.619
So, and that will only continue and grow over
time.

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:54.180
So, there's a larger story that we need to
be able to tell.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.220
And a big part of what we're doing this year
is doing the research we need to be able to

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.319
land at some compelling numbers, not only
around cost, but also around the potentials

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:05.400
or benefit to the city.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.359
Anyone want to step up to the mic?

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:11.670
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Sure.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.140
What kind of environmental remediation is
gonna need to be done on the site?

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.619
I mean, is it lead paint everywhere?

00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:18.670
Is it more than that?

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.760
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Well, Dan actually, in addressing
the previous question, brought up the issue

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.839
of needing more information about what the
general costs of this overall project to construct

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:30.460
would actually be.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:36.500
And I think you bring up a very valid and
interesting point, but until we actually get

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.510
a team of engineers, cleared by the MTA, to
go down into there and start exploring some

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.240
of the environmental conditions, it would
be difficult to say right off the bat.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.099
I mean, look, dollars to donuts, there's probably
lead paint down there, right?

00:37:49.099 --> 00:37:51.589
I mean, it's from 1903 for God's sake.

00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:57.360
There's also drainage that needs to happen
and who knows what else.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.769
I think what's working in our favor is the
fact that it was basically forgotten about

00:38:02.769 --> 00:38:04.150
after 1943.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.470
And there's just been nothing in there except
maybe the occasional mole person, right?

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:14.740
So, any sort of environmental issues that
might be at play with the space itself would

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:20.630
be ones that are created from the original
construction, like you say, from the lead

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.160
paint, for example.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.270
[pause]

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.620
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Hi.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.059
I love the idea.

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:31.170
I saw this about six months ago and I thought
it was fantastic then.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.829
I still think it's fantastic.

00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:36.370
I had a question about the scale of it, though.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.809
So, in these drawings, you modeled this all
out.

00:38:38.809 --> 00:38:41.269
How large are the collectors?

00:38:41.269 --> 00:38:43.250
How many of them do you need?

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.630
And where do you plan to put them above ground?

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.440
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Well, let's talk about two
things.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.250
First of all, the space itself, I don't think
we got to this little factoid.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:58.480
But the space itself is about 60 thousand
square feet, which is roughly equivalent in

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.579
size to the first leg of the High Line when
they built that.

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:06.141
It's also roughly equivalent in size to--this
is a terrible comparison--to two-thirds of

00:39:06.141 --> 00:39:09.890
the size of Gramercy Park.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:13.789
But I guess the case in point being, it is
a pretty large space.

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:18.980
Now, when you set up a technology like this--light
goes in, light goes out--you don't get to

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980
save it.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.150
You don't get to build it up or anything like
that.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.680
Purely optical device.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.289
So, in a vacuum, let's say you have a square
meter of collection.

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:30.320
You put in a hundred thousand lumens.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.160
You have a distributer downstairs.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.290
So, square meter in a vacuum, a hundred thousand
lumens comes out.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.369
Of course, it's not gonna be a hundred percent
efficient.

00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:41.880
You'll probably lose 20 percent of the light,
which is fine.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.369
But, I guess, point being, you need to manage
how much light is going to be delivered to

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:53.609
certain areas as a design concept really and
based on what the light requirements of the

00:39:53.609 --> 00:39:56.569
various plantings are actually gonna be.

00:39:56.569 --> 00:40:02.859
So, without going into detail about the design
of the plantings and the landscape architecture,

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:06.789
it's difficult to say how much light you actually
need to deliver down there.

00:40:06.789 --> 00:40:14.059
However, just my initial back of the napkin
projections in math indicate to me that for

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:19.640
one thing, I think these things want to live
on the elevated median that's currently in

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.359
the middle of Delancey Street.

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:23.570
It's on the north side of the site.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:28.990
It will not fall into the shadows of the proposed
development that's going up to the south.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:35.950
And it's an appropriate path for the lighting
to actually go filter through.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.710
Now, as for the number of collectors that
we're talking about, I mean, it will depend

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.890
of course on how much light you need to deliver
down into the space.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:49.720
But as far as arrays go, I would say probably
something like 30 or 40 of them or something

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.500
like that.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.170
And of course, you can calibrate how much
light is getting in there by how much you

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.170
need, and therefore, what you need on the
topside, etc.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.170
So,--.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Thank you.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.170
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Do you have a sense of, you mentioned
MTA was opening up this space for proposal.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:03.680
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Yeah.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:11.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Who else is interested in it?

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.210
And how many other people--?

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.210
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: It's just gonna be the world's
biggest Red Lobster.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.210
[laughter]

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.880
And we're really gonna have to duke it out
with them.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.470
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Actually, that's really funny.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:23.079
We had extreme fun of presenting this to a
high school yesterday morning.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:26.790
And I think one of the kids said something
like, "Could this be a McDonald's?"

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.079
’Cause that would be really cool."

00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:29.079
[laughter]

00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:33.000
I think that's actually exactly what we're
trying not to do.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.660
And so, they also demanded Wi-Fi, which I
thought was really funny.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.059
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Like, all of them demanded
Wi-Fi.

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:39.059
Five bars.

00:41:39.059 --> 00:41:42.250
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Right, all the time.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.470
And your iPhone will work down there.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.720
But I think that we really don't know.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.031
I think that the site is going to get more
and more interesting over the course of this

00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:55.510
year if we have anything to say about it.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:42:01.369
And I think that what we're trying to do is
to drive forward a sense that we are the folks

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:03.640
who are actually focused on the community.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:08.680
And when other developers come to the table,
as they almost definitely will, who are interested

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.150
in doing interesting things or things that
have heavy retail component, that we actually

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.859
will be able to say actually we've spent the
time talking to the community about what it

00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:24.960
wants to do and this isn't simply a conversation
around short-term gain for MTA, but there

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.250
are other factors at play and there's a community
here and there's people who actually need

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.910
some green space.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.630
So, I think that's where we're coming from.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:38.180
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: You know it's funny that the
irony here is that, just broadly speaking,

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.950
the reason that you don't find so much green
space in any New York neighborhood is because

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:49.099
there exists this very focused market-driven
mentality, well, throughout the city.

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:55.720
And so, setting aside a piece of land for
just general public use is, it's a very rare

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.549
thing in this town.

00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:58.549
And so, here we are.

00:42:58.549 --> 00:43:02.890
And we discover a giant space that no one
even knew about, all these square feet.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.650
And now all of a sudden, it's like, OK.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:11.570
So, we've gotta look at this competitive development
schemes to generate money from this thing.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.450
I think that's, of course, it's fair to say
it's not our space.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.390
It's the MTA's space.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:21.970
We would very much like to build them an economic
model that actually shows that this thing

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.589
can actually turn a profit as well.

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:28.680
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Actually, I mean, on that point,
the High Line is a recent example of something

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.380
that, in our lifetime, actually for most of
us who have been in New York throughout the

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:37.470
entire process, a group of individuals who
are just from the community decided to say,

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:43.100
"We actually want to fight to turn this, to
A, not tear it down and B, turn it into an

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.970
actual, public space that's free, that's green,
that's beautiful."

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:52.190
And actually, in New York City's history,
most of the parks and green spaces in the

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:59.020
city happened that way, either through community
activism or through the creation of a private-led

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.020
park.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.359
So, even looking at things like the saving
of Grand Central was something where a bunch

00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:09.609
of pissed off people said, "We really want
this to be saved," and not turned into something

00:44:09.609 --> 00:44:12.630
that isn't stunning, beautiful, and for the
public.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.829
So, I think the examples of that go all the
way through New York City's history.

00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:23.070
And the interesting thing is obviously just
that the Park's Department just announced

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.150
a budget cut yesterday.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:34.750
So, it's an increasing age of public austerity
and there just isn't a sense that the government

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:39.269
is going to be able to have the resources
to step in and have a vision for a green space.

00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:42.420
And so, I think what's exciting about the
High Line and hopefully what we're doing,

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:50.250
is that a private-driven and community-led
approach to building a park is potentially

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.420
the wave of the future.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:58.160
And is actually the way that parks will get
built and space will be saved for the public.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:05.030
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: What are you planning to do [inaudible]?

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.030
[inaudible]?

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.010
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Well, I mean, when the sun
goes down these devices no longer produce

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.599
any light.

00:45:10.599 --> 00:45:15.480
So, is the solution to just close it at dark,
or is the solution to actually supplement

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480
the light?

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.859
I think that you will want to create a hybridized
system one way or another so you have the

00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:26.270
option, like some very high-powered LED's
or something built in-line to simulate maximum

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.119
capacity of the sun when it's not out there.

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:33.210
Like, on a really dark day, like the one we
had a couple days ago, I mean, it will be

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:39.250
fairly dark down here and you don't get the
other ambient light that filters through the

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:42.470
clouds in the sky, etc., like you do in an
above-ground space.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.150
So, I think it would be important to supplement--.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:47.160
At least have the ability to supplement that
light.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.190
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: You could simulate the night sky.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.710
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Or you could just--.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:51.710
Ooh.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.799
Actually, if you just point this thing at
the sun at sunset, you will get a sunset.

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:59.950
So, you'll get an orange and purple space,
which I think is kinda cool.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:07.240
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: The MTA made this weird promotional
video for the site.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:13.519
And in it, the MTA spokesman made a joke about
how it could become a nightclub, which was

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:15.480
so weird coming from a public official.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.599
[laughter]
But one of the really fun things that we saw

00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:29.750
in the location on our tour was this abandoned
control tower, this weird little space, totally

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:35.710
graffiti-full and you could tell people slept
in there over the years, and immediately we

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.490
were like, "This would be an incredible say,
tree house, for kids.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.651
Or, just this really amazing space that could
be transformed into something really fun."

00:46:42.651 --> 00:46:45.562
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Isn't it fun we're talking
about tree houses and the MTA is talking about

00:46:45.562 --> 00:46:46.562
a DJ booth?

00:46:46.562 --> 00:46:49.050
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Clearly, they want the party

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.619
to go on all night.

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:55.130
But so, the possibility of what else could
happen down there.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:47:00.000
I mean, again, I think one of the things that
we need to be totally serious about is that

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.970
we do need a real business model.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:06.599
And there's a lot of different ways of thinking
about how we use the space during the day

00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:09.539
as well as the way we think about it during
the night.

00:47:09.539 --> 00:47:14.619
And the High Line has interestingly first
saved the space, and then built an amazing

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:19.970
park, and they're now evolving a lot of their
approach to ways that they can stay in business

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.030
as a park.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.559
The High Line needs to continue to raise money
in order to sustain itself as a private park.

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:32.430
So, this will be hopefully the same sort of
model in which we'll need to, over time, continue

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:33.430
to sustain ourselves.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.160
So, what is that business model?

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.559
Maybe there are the opportunities to do nice
things in there at night.

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:43.819
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I think it is noteworthy that
you do control the entrances and the exits

00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.990
to the space because it's underground.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:51.930
And so, I think that very much opens the door
to what I think Dan is leading into about

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.430
being able to have alternate uses for daytime,
nighttime, other times, etcetera.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.430
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: New York's hottest club.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.430
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Right.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.430
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: So, there's a really large elderly
community in the area with a lot of political

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.430
influence.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:08.970
Looking at this, this would be the perfect
place for them to be outside but not really

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.250
outside.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:14.089
Have you [inaudible]?

00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:20.249
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: We've reached out to a lot
of the housing in the neighborhood, not specifically

00:48:20.249 --> 00:48:26.359
to the elderly, but I think you make a really
interesting point in that because it's underground,

00:48:26.359 --> 00:48:29.230
well, it never rains down there.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:30.589
It never snows down there.

00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:33.839
And the temperature is a very even 60-ish.

00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:37.390
And so, I think actually that's a really good
idea.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:45.039
I actually am not familiar with any sort of
organizations, specifically, in that neighborhood

00:48:45.039 --> 00:48:48.180
that we could reach out to wholesale, but
it's a good idea.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:52.220
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Well, we've also heard a lot
about how young people would actually use

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.220
the space.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.900
I mean, there's actually a lot of families.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.059
I mean, one of the great things about the
Lower East Side, and especially this whole

00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:04.420
corridor and this part of the Lower East Side,
is that it's really, really diverse.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:14.809
A lot of it is populated by people who are
on affordable or subsidized housing.

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:17.539
And it's ethnically really diverse.

00:49:17.539 --> 00:49:22.789
And it has this really vibrant community that
takes care of itself because frankly, I think

00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:27.089
a lot of it is because people have lived there
for generations and the business community

00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:32.500
is very Mom and Pop and it has this community
feel.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.380
And yet, there's a sense that young people
don't really have a lot of green space.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.869
There's nowhere to go with kids.

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:43.579
I mean, as a parent, where do you go with
your kids when it's not nice out on the weekends?

00:49:43.579 --> 00:49:47.430
And so, we've heard a lot of comments on how
people would use the space.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.329
And it's interesting 'cause this is actually
the first time, I think, that someone has

00:49:51.329 --> 00:49:54.990
suggested to us that old people would use
the space.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.242
I think it's exciting to think about that,
too.

00:49:56.242 --> 00:49:59.220
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: What are they thinking about
with the High Line was the architecture company

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.220
[inaudible].

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:07.579
Are you guys thinking about having something
like that, or are you pretty much gonna go

00:50:07.579 --> 00:50:09.869
with what you have here?

00:50:09.869 --> 00:50:11.750
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: That's a good question.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:16.009
Well, as an architect, I would feel a little
bit weird about it, I guess.

00:50:16.009 --> 00:50:22.940
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Well, you build the technology,
so I can see having a [inaudible].

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.839
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: I mean, I think it would be
a great idea to open up many elements of this

00:50:26.839 --> 00:50:27.839
to competition.

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.250
We haven't fleshed out a program.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.430
We haven't really specified what goes on in
there.

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.590
We're deliberately leaving these things blank.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.509
We haven't specified what these things above
ground actually look like.

00:50:36.509 --> 00:50:40.010
We haven't specified what the entries look
like.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:44.160
And so, I mean, I think all of those things
are open and probably would be benefited by

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.079
some sort of competition.

00:50:47.079 --> 00:50:53.770
What we're proposing is actually in and of
itself already so specific that it would be

00:50:53.770 --> 00:51:02.759
hard for me to envision the, I guess, within
this defined set of design constraints, all

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.990
this diversity of ideas that the High Line
generated.

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:08.769
Like, you will recall, there was one that
turned the entire thing into a pool.

00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:12.059
There's one that turned the entire thing into
a jail.

00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:19.131
I think that we could, well, we could turn
this whole thing into a pool, certainly, or

00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:21.180
an ice rink, or a jail.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.190
Actually, it would make a really good jail.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.369
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: A really fun jail.

00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:26.819
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: But in and of--.

00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:31.359
The design is actually, again, the concept
itself is so specific already.

00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:33.140
It makes it a little bit challenging to do
that.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.260
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: But actually just on that point,
I mean, I think there's three classes at Columbia

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:41.690
University that are like, teaching or they
are using this as architecture studios.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:46.559
And we get a lot of people reaching out to
us from NYU, from a lot of other universities,

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:47.559
literally around the world.

00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:51.660
So, I think there already have been or are
going to be a lot of really amazing ideas

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.880
that come out of this.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.440
And I think it'll be fun to bring people in
to the idea over the next year.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:04.640
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: So, I happen to live on Pitt Street,
right there.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.190
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Cool.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.769
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: So, my question.

00:52:08.769 --> 00:52:10.319
I have two.

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:26.786
One is, I'm interested in the development
on the south side of Delancey, what you've

00:52:26.786 --> 00:52:27.786
heard about that.

00:52:27.786 --> 00:52:28.786
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: SPURA.

00:52:28.786 --> 00:52:29.786
Yeah?

00:52:29.786 --> 00:52:30.786
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: So, that's part one.

00:52:30.786 --> 00:52:31.786
Two, you have the economic diversity of the
neighborhood, do you have any thoughts about

00:52:31.786 --> 00:52:32.786
this being successful impact on things like
real estate?

00:52:32.786 --> 00:52:33.786
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: The questions are actually
interrelated.

00:52:33.786 --> 00:52:34.786
Are you on Clinton between Delancey and--?

00:52:34.786 --> 00:52:35.786
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: Between Staten Road.

00:52:35.786 --> 00:52:37.440
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: If you go one block south,
there is a bar called Second Floor on Clinton

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.329
and they are now serving a cocktail called
"The Low Line."

00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:41.329
[laughter]

00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:43.420
So, if you have the chance, go check it out.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:47.369
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: It's delicious.

00:52:47.369 --> 00:52:48.369
It's a modified Negroni.

00:52:48.369 --> 00:52:49.670
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Yeah, it's a Negroni with
rye.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.019
It's really good.

00:52:51.019 --> 00:52:57.109
Anyway, so first of all, the site immediately
to the south was knocked down in the Robert

00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:59.160
Moses era.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.609
It looked a lot like the neighborhood to the
north and it was just unceremoniously bulldozed

00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:09.680
to make way for, I don't know, either for
progress or to get rid of dirtiness.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.369
It's unclear which of the two it was.

00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:16.809
But they actually never built back what they
had originally planned for that neighborhood

00:53:16.809 --> 00:53:18.380
right there.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:28.030
And because this neighborhood happens really
at the nexus point of so many different ethnicities

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:31.339
and neighborhoods, I mean, you've got the
Orthodox Jewish community, you've got the

00:53:31.339 --> 00:53:35.480
Chinese, you've got the Dominicans, you've
got the Puerto Ricans, you've got the hipsters,

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.279
all meeting at this one little point, it's
been a hotly contested neighborhood for something

00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:40.279
like 40 years.

00:53:40.279 --> 00:53:46.279
And as a result, they have not reached a consensus
to build something there until very recently

00:53:46.279 --> 00:53:47.279
anyway.

00:53:47.279 --> 00:53:48.769
So, within the last what?

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:52.499
Year, year and a half, something like that,
they finally reached a consensus for what

00:53:52.499 --> 00:53:54.000
to do with it.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.220
And this is the part that relates directly
to what you're talking about demographically.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.509
The consensus that they reached is they're
gonna build a million and a half square feet

00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:06.640
distributed across all of these sites.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:12.990
And almost half of that square footage is
going to be devoted specifically to affordable

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.990
housing.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:22.430
So, I think we have a built-in system for
that development itself that actually very

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.690
strongly preserves the demographic mix of
the neighborhood.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.680
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Cool.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680
Do we have time for a few more questions?

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Don't you guys have to work
or something?

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.680
Seriously.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.680
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think we have room for

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680
another half hour, but--.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: I guess maybe we'll take a
few more questions, if that's OK.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: I just have one quick question.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.680
I know that you guys mentioned possibly placing
the light devices on the shoulder or the median.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:44.019
Is there any plans to do more on the surface?

00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:50.910
That's such a weird area.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:55.400
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: It is a weird area, yes.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.450
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: I live there and I think it's like
this bizarre zone.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:04.480
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Well, it's like this plastic
bags like tumbleweeds, just going down the

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.420
street.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:12.220
As part of the development that I just alluded
to, called SPURA, Seward Park Urban Renewal

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.960
Area, which is all through that south site
with all those parking lots that you see right

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:24.080
there, there is also going to be a rethinking
of a master plan for that whole south side.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.070
And possibly for a portion of Delancey Street
itself.

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:31.420
We just don't know that information yet 'cause
they're not done designing it.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.010
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: Independent of this initiative.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.240
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: That's right.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.089
But of course, they're inextricably linked.

00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:42.380
We're tied very much to what they decide to
do.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:52.230
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: [inaudible] toward the water
or--?

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:56.559
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Or like, on the bridge or
something.

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:58.410
You know, that's the thing.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.849
And you're hitting the nail on the head.

00:56:00.849 --> 00:56:05.349
But just in researching this, I mean, you
can obviously concentrate light down and send

00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:08.710
it through just an empty shaft and send it
wherever you need it to go.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.180
It will require some pretty hardcore precision
to do that.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:16.619
So, you can, I think, feasibly do that for
a small amount of distance.

00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:21.720
But if you go into a fiber optic cable, there
is, of course, attenuation.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.640
And intercontinental cables under the sea
that transmit data or whatever, they have

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.430
these boosters that help nudge things along.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:36.799
Obviously, we can't do that with the sun,
or else we're just paying for electricity.

00:56:36.799 --> 00:56:42.880
We have an attenuation that really puts our
limit on the fiber cables themselves at about,

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:48.099
I don't know, like 20, 30, 40 meters, something
like that.

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:53.520
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: [inaudible]

00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:01.450
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: So, maybe we just float collectors
in the East River.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:05.380
Pipe it over and then who cares about all
the loss?

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.660
I think that's a pretty cool idea.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:14.200
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: [inaudible ]

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:21.690
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Are you happy with your job
right now?

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:24.319
[laughter]

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.319
That's awesome.

00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:29.920
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: So, do we have time for one
more?

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.920
Cool.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.789
Last one.

00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:42.200
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: Not to get a little personal,
but it seems like it requires a lot of time

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.200
and devotion and you're visiting with us now,
you have some sort of breaking point in the

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200
future--

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.200
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Breaking point.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.910
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: not necessarily asking what's
in it for you, but hypothetically.

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:50.539
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Right.

00:57:50.539 --> 00:57:54.450
Well, it's like being Batman.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.020
We have our day jobs of course.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:01.059
And they're what enable us to pay New York
rents.

00:58:01.059 --> 00:58:06.049
We are largely doing this as a project in
our free time and have been doing so for the

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.049
past couple of years.

00:58:08.049 --> 00:58:11.329
But obviously recently it's been demanding
increasing amounts of time.

00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:17.099
So, this is actually neck in neck with us
actually building and fleshing out an organization

00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:18.170
with more people.

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:27.930
And actually, Dan can actually speak to this
better than I can, but it is something that

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:32.289
we're able to actually distribute the workload
amongst people as well.

00:58:32.289 --> 00:58:36.309
Did I say that right?

00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:37.489
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: Yeah.

00:58:37.489 --> 00:58:38.489
You did.

00:58:38.489 --> 00:58:39.849
&gt;&gt;James Ramsey: Just curious.

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:40.849
Anyone else?

00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:41.849
Last chance.

00:58:41.849 --> 00:58:42.849
All right.

00:58:42.849 --> 00:58:43.849
Well, look.

00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:44.849
Thank you, everyone.

00:58:44.849 --> 00:58:49.150
I hope you all find this project as exciting
as we obviously do.

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.799
And if you're really excited about it, please
just talk to us.

00:58:51.799 --> 00:58:53.440
Maybe you can help us make this thing happen.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440
All right?

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440
Yeah, OK.

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.440
Thank you.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:02.430
&gt;&gt;Dan Barasch: As just one last point, so
we, as I mentioned, we're doing the kick starter

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.900
in just a couple weeks.

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:08.270
So, if you're interested in getting involved,
that's one way.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.529
And then obviously, you can follow us on Facebook
and Twitter.

00:59:10.529 --> 00:59:11.529
Check out our site.

00:59:11.529 --> 00:59:16.349
We have a newsletter just to keep people inside
the loop on all of our little political developments

00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:17.509
and what we're up to.

00:59:17.509 --> 00:59:22.109
So, we'd love to hear from you and just stay
in touch.

00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:23.109
Anyway.

00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:24.250
Thanks again for your time.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.029
[applause]
