00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.060
Children who come from dysfunctional families

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.020
learn to take on roles in order to cope with toxic behaviors in their household.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.560
Such upbringings effects their traits and habits

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.720
they carry into adulthood.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.660
Those who come from a background of alcohol or drug abuse

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.320
experience a turbulent childhood

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.820
and end up playing certain roles to alleviate the sadness, humiliation, or anger they feel.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Family dynamics that include other compulsive behavior, such as gambling or overeating,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.320
overly strict and religious attitudes, narcissism, and physical, emotional, or sexual abuse

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.600
may also effect children to take on the same roles

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.200
People may identify with more than just one role when they grow up in chaotic households.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.240
These are five types of children from toxic families.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.640
One.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
The Hero or Responsible Child.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.420
The Hero, or Responsible Child, is wise and mature beyond their years.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.360
They're self-sufficient, perfectionist, overachieving, and seemingly composed.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.180
In reality, though,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.580
they suffer silently

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.480
and carry the burden of sadness from their parents toxic behavior.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.760
They are afraid of becoming like their parents,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.060
so they learn to be the exact opposite.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.580
For example, if the hero has a narcissistic and abusive parent,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.660
they usually try to be the favorite child- relying on good performance in order to receive love.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.900
Two: The Scapegoat or Troublemaker

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.940
The Scapegoat or Troublemaker is angry and defensive.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.940
At school, the scapegoat is typically the leader within their social group

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.980
and often get in trouble, because that's how they learn to get the most attention.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.740
But because they've built walls around themselves out of fear, their relationship with others may be superficial.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.660
Toxic parents are usually extremely ashamed of them,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.340
as they try to convey their situation by acting out family problems that are usually ignored at home,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.200
but beneath that hard exterior, they're very emotionally sensitive.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.880
They're either the loud rebellious type or the one easily picked on.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.360
And since they've been hurt by their abusive parent, they can be self-destructive.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.120
Three.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.020
The Lost Child or Dreamer

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.500
The Lost Child, or Dreamer, is invisible within their family

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.140
and tries to cope with the family's struggles by disappearing and reading books,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.360
daydreaming, or watching movies. They rarely get in trouble because everyone sees them as a good kid.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.280
It's assumed they also have a good, healthy life at home.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.220
The Lost Child is typically very shy and enjoys having a lot of space and solitude,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.220
causing others to view them as loners.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.680
Since they're more withdrawn, they struggle to develop important social skills and relationships with others

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.320
and often suffer from low self-esteem

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.300
Four.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
The Mascot or Class Clown.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.020
The Mascot, or Class Clown, is usually known as the cute one.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.300
They're always ready to lighten the mood with jokes or entertaining shows.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Their dysfunctional family makes them feel powerless,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.120
so they try to cope by breaking the anger, tension, and conflict with fun and humor.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
Most Mascot children have a friendly disposition and are described as overly nice.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.520
Mascot children enjoy helping others because it distracts them from their own problems.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.100
Beneath their cheerful demeanor, however, they usually suffer from low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.740
developing workaholic tendencies to make up for their insecurities.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.200
They also find it painful to ask for help when they're hurt, so they put on a brave smile for the world.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.400
Five.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.140
The Enabler or Caretaker.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.340
The Enabler, or Caretaker, is typically married to an addict, but children can also take on this role.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.869
They listen to and console the addict while encouraging other families not to react negatively.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.470
Because the enabler doesn't know how to cope with toxic behavior,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.239
they make excuses for the addicts alcohol or drug problems and deny such problems exist,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.820
masking the families downfalls to make sure the public sees them as a happy, well-rounded family.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.100
Do you identify with one or more of these 5 types?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.080
Is there any advice you'd like to provide to those who come from toxic families?
