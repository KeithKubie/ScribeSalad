00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.819
10 Famous Actors Who Were Seriously Injured
On The Set Of Their Movies

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.250
On the whole, acting is one of the safest
jobs in the world.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.220
Actors are well looked after, movie sets are
extremely safe places, stunts are generally

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.340
performed by doubles who are more suited to
the job and, in the event of an emergency,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630
there are always medical professionals on
hand to step in.That being said, some actors

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.870
have been injured on the sets of their movies.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.960
Whether it's because they're amongst the few
who are brave enough to perform their own

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.259
stunts, or simply because they got into some
kind of accident, even the most high-profile

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.600
and talented of stars have managed to hurt
themselves during filming.In this video, we'll

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.980
run through a list of some great examples.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.399
Here are ten famous actors who were seriously
injured on the set of their movies.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.190
Halle Berry
Halle Berry has suffered several injuries

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.430
on various movie sets over the years, most
recently in 2011, when she broke her foot

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
while filming Cloud Atlas in Mallorca, causing
production to come to a halt for two-and-a-half

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
weeks.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.010
Although she performed several of her own
stunts on the movie, the break came when she

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.000
was simply walking and heard a crack.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.321
The actress also almost choked to death on
a fig while filming Die Another Day, broke

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:09.640
her arm filming a scene with Robert Downey,
Jr. for Gothika, and suffered a head injury

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.840
on the set of Catwoman.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.380
Poor Halle!

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.220
Jackie Chan
Where do we even begin with this guy?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.030
It would be more difficult to name a movie
set on which Jack Chan hasn't been injured.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.740
The martial arts actor does all of his own
stunts and claims to have broken every single

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.979
bone in his body at one time or another.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.150
As a result, he's in constant pain - something
you'd never believe, given his ever-present

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.150
smile.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.830
The worst example of an on-set injury was
in 1987's Armour of God, whilst performing

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.830
a routine stunt.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.329
Chan leaped onto a tree from a ledge, but
the branch he grabbed snapped, sending him

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.549
plummeting to the ground and cracking his
skull - it genuinely almost killed him and

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.290
he's been hard of hearing on one side ever
since.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.380
Dylan O'Brien
The production of the third movie in the Maze

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.630
Runner series - Maze Runner: The Death Cure
- had to be brought to a long-term halt in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.479
2016 when its lead actor - promising young
Teen Wolf star Dylan O'Brien - was seriously

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.700
injured on the set.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.819
O'Brien was in a harness on top of a moving
vehicle on set in Vancouver, Canada, when

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.000
he was pulled off unexpectedly and hit by
another vehicle.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.060
His resulting injuries included a concussion,
a facial fracture and lacerations, and the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.920
movie is now expected to be released in February
of 2018 - more than a year later than originally

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
scheduled.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.470
Michael J. Fox
In 1990's Back to the Future Part III, the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.380
legend that is Michael J. Fox agreed to really
hang from the rope whilst filming the scene

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.130
in which Marty McFly is being hanged from
the clock tower in the Old West.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.970
The plan was for the actor to hold the rope
away from his throat with his hand, but at

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.470
one point he wasn't holding it at all and
was genuinely being strangled.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.630
The film crew didn't realise this and simply
thought he was acting incredibly well - that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.640
is until he passed out, had to be rescued,
and was left with an incredibly sore neck!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.130
Channing Tatum
Channing Tatum is probably best known for

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.730
his performances in the two Magic Mike movies,
but did you also know that, on another movie

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.170
set, he once badly burned his... let's call
it has Magic Johnson.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.730
It happened on the set of 2011's The Eagle.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.250
Filming the movie in Scotland was very cold,
so some of the cast members were actually

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.320
pouring warm water down their pants to raise
their temperatures - but the guy who brought

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.330
the water to Tatum forgot to tell him it was
still boiling.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.419
He poured it over himself and literally scolded
his genitals - to the extent that it burned

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.140
away the skin.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140
Ouch.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.620
Charlize Theron
The beautiful Charlize Theron isn't averse

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.169
to performing her own stunts - but doing so
in 2005's Æon Flux led to the actress injuring

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.630
herself pretty badly.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.550
She performed a gymnastics-style back handspring
- having previously completed 18 of them in

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.190
a row - but slipped and landed on her neck
with all of her weight behind the impact.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.910
She herniated the disk between her third and
fourth vertebraes, causing her to be hospitalised

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.910
for five days.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.360
There was also some nerve damage, which left
the entire right side of her body numb.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.440
It could have been alot worse, however, and
we're thankful she's okay!

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.850
Tom Hanks
The insanely talented Tom Hanks gave an incredible

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.320
performance in 2000's epic survival drama
Cast Away - but he almost died in the process.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.449
After cutting his leg whilst filming on location
in Fiji, Hanks failed to treat the wound and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.380
ended up picking up a staph infection.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.889
A full two weeks later, after the swelling
around the cut had refused to go down, the

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.310
actor went to see a doctor - and was told
he was close to death.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.389
How close, exactly?

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.540
Well the doctor told him that he was a mere
hour away from suffering from a type of blood

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.970
poisoning that would have killed him.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.970
Yikes.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.910
Sylvester Stallone
1985's Rocky IV saw the titular Rocky Balboa

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.230
going up against arguably his toughest ever
opponent - Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.510
Sylvester Stallone is known for wanting to
make the fight scenes in the Rocky movies

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.730
as awesome as possible - and in one scene,
he encouraged Lundgren to really try to knock

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.730
him out.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.390
The result wasn't great.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.910
Stallone's blood pressure reached 260 that
night and he was rushed to hospital.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.920
He had been hit so hard in the chest that
his heart had smashed off his rib cage and

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.230
began to swell - something that usually only
happens to victims in car crashes.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.790
He spent five days in hospital as a result.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.911
We sure wouldn't want to get into a fight
with Dolph Lundgren!

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:53.911
Brad Pitt
In what must be the most ironic and unbelievable

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:54.911
injury in movie-making history, Brad Pitt
hurt himself quite badly whilst filming 2004's

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.911
Troy movie.

00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:56.911
He was playing Achilles - the Greek hero whose
only supposed weakness was his Achilles tendon.

00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:57.911
So why was it so ironic?

00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:58.911
Well, Pitt tore his own left Achilles tendon
whilst filming a fight scene on set, delaying

00:04:58.911 --> 00:04:59.911
the movie's production for several months.

00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:00.911
It might sound like some kind of silly urban
myth, but the actor himself has confirmed

00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:01.911
it, saying "It's a true story.

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:02.911
It's sad, it's stupid, but it's true.

00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:03.911
It's so wrong.

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:04.911
It's such a bad headline."

00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:05.911
You're not wrong, Brad!

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:06.911
Nicole Kidman
On the set of her 2001 movie Moulin Rouge,

00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:07.911
Nicole Kidman fell down a flight of stairs
whilst dancing in high heel shoes at three

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:08.911
o'clock in the morning.

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:09.911
This resulted in her breaking a rib and having
to film certain subsequent scenes whilst sat

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.911
in a wheelchair - such as the part where her
character, Satine, says “A real actress”.

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:14.770
Worse still, she rebroke the same rib whilst
trying to squeeze herself into a corset on

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.910
the set of the same movie a few weeks later.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.820
As a result of the injury, she lost the lead
role in David Fincher's Panic Room, which

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:55.950
ultimately went to Jodie Foster.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.611
