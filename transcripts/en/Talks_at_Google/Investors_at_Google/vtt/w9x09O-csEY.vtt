[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.640
SPEAKER: Hello and
welcome, everyone.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.560
Jim O'Shaughnessy is here.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.230
He's written this
fantastic book that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.770
has stayed the test of
time through good markets

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.630
and bad markets.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.650
You're a value investor, you're
an author par excellence,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.690
and we are so glad
to have you here

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.575
to share your
experiences with us.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:33.200
Thank you, Jim.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.825
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY:
Terrific, thank you.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.320
And I'm delighted to be
using a Mac because I'm

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.190
much more familiar with the Mac
so that's better for everybody.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.480
I like to start these talks with
a story that illustrates some

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.840
of the problems that
we face when trying

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.610
to be good, active investors.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.350
And it considers a fellow who
dies-- he's an Uber driver--

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.570
and he dies in a crackup, goes
up to heaven, sees Saint Peter,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.370
and goes right
past him because he

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.430
sees Einstein
sitting at the center

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.710
of this huge group of people.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
And he waddles his
way in and Einstein

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.500
says, "Hi, Albert Einstein--
welcome to heaven.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.540
What's your IQ?"

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.680
And the driver said, you know,
I have been trying forever

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.870
to get a job at Google and,
you know, I just can't get in.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.690
I've been there three times.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.850
I googled the questions
they're going to ask me,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.320
I think I've got it down--

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.720
I know everything
about physics, I

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.710
know everything about
electrical engineering,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.320
I know everything
about computers--

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.160
but I just keep
failing the questions.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.730
And Einstein, yeah, yeah,
that can be hard, I know.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.700
I watch that group--
they're very, very bright--

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.710
I get it.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.150
What is your IQ?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.310
And the guy goes, well,
I don't want to brag

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.240
or anything but my IQ is 175.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.630
And Einstein goes,
this is incredible.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.140
We'll be able to talk
about unified field theory,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.870
about string theory,
about everything

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.820
that's been going on
in the world of physics

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.636
since I'd died.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.260
Oh, my god, you wait
right over there--

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.090
I want to get in a conversation
with you right away.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.120
I want to figure this spooky
action at a distance out.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.850
Maybe you'll be
able to help me out.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.900
He points to another guy.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.000
He says, hi, Albert
Einstein, welcome to heaven.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.840
What's your IQ?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.240
And the guy goes,
well, it's not 175.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.910
I guess I'm a bit average,
right, so my IQ is about 120.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.390
Einstein thinks about this for
a minute and he goes, well, OK,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.530
OK.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.950
Maybe we can talk about
what's happening politically

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.770
down on earth and maybe
we can talk about what

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.870
movies you like.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.170
And if you're reading anything,
which I probably highly doubt,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.390
but if you are reading
something I really,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.250
really want to hear what
you're reading and keep in mind

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.320
if it's something
that is a potboiler,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.080
I don't consider that reading.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.790
And the guy goes, duly noted.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.380
And he kind of
walked away dejected

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.160
because that's
really all he had.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.690
He points at the next guy and
he goes, hi, Albert Einstein,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.440
welcome to heaven.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.580
What's your IQ?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
And so the guy looks
at him and he goes,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.190
I'm not going to tell you.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.440
And he goes, come on, come
on-- you're in heaven.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.420
You're going to have
infinite knowledge--

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
everything that
the universe is you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
are going to know as soon as
you stepped through those gates,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.140
so it doesn't really
matter what your IQ was

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.070
when you were on earth.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.600
The guy pauses,
takes a deep breath,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.710
and he goes, all right,
I make Forrest Gump look

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.210
like a genius.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.300
My IQ is 52.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.940
And Einstein says, so, what do
you think the market's going

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.127
to do tomorrow?

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:54.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.090
I think that we
all too often feel

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.730
like Forrest might have a
better answer than we do,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.900
so I wrote a paper
recently about why

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.130
it is so hard to be
an active investor

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.760
and what I want to talk to
you today is about that.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760
We've all seen
the herd mentality

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.790
move many, many people
to passive indexes.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.579
I would remind you that
things like the S&amp;P 500

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.940
are strategies, right?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.500
The strategy there
is buy big stocks--

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.720
single-line strategy.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.070
Globally, it's buy these
global big stocks based

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.500
on their market capitalization.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.160
Through the research that I
and my team have conducted,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.780
we have found that there are
very many other factors that

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.090
work significantly better
than buy big stocks.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.430
The challenge that
we face there however

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.970
is, by definition,
our portfolios

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.120
are very different
than the benchmark

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.700
if the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.820
And the first thing that we
really want to think about

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.370
is passive investors--

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.250
they face one point
of failure, right--

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.840
presuming they're well
diversified, et cetera.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.430
The only point of failure
that an active investor faces

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
is panicking near
a market bottom

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.350
and selling out of all of
his or her index funds, OK?

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.830
That's really the only thing
they have to worry about

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.980
because, by definition, they're
getting the average return,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.600
they're getting the low costs--

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.270
they're getting a lot
of really good things.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.670
But they do face
that point of failure

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.570
and, sadly, I have
seen many, many people

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.590
who swore that they would
never ever do such a thing

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.780
do exactly that.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.510
But us poor hapless
active investors

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.540
face two points of failure.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.600
The first is the same as
the index investor, right?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.120
We panic and we sell out
before or near the bottom

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.290
of a market--

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.190
but the second one is
really more insidious.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.770
The second point of
failure that we face

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.080
is we suddenly are comparing
our returns of our investment

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.200
strategy or our ETF or our
mutual fund with its benchmark,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.920
right?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.730
Everything has a benchmark
and if you're a value investor

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.160
and it's a large cap
strategy, your benchmark

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.940
is the Russell 1000 Value Index.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.190
If you're a small cap value,
it's the Small-Cap Russell

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.660
Value Index.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.340
And we compare these
things constantly and what

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.550
I have witnessed
over my entire career

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.360
is that really human
behavior never changes--

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.430
we're going to get back
to that in a minute.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.590
But typically what happens is
that people mismatch their time

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.940
frames, right?

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.400
So the majority of people who
are actually making decisions

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.090
on whether they're going to
stick to an active strategy

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.050
are using possibly the
worst time frame to look

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.600
at and that is three years.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.280
I won't bore you
with a lot of people

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.960
that I know who do it
on a quarterly basis,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.740
but what I can tell you
is that if you do this

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.400
on a quarterly basis, I
will guarantee that you will

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.550
fail because quarterly data--

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.750
there is no signal,
it is all noise.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.960
And because of the
nature of human beings,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.710
we always will clamp a
narrative around anything

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.990
that we see and the
narrative is going

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.379
to sound really interesting.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.170
You're going to watch
CNBC and you're going

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.540
to hear some guy say, well, this
quarter happened because of x,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.920
y, and z.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.160
Well, let me be the
one to tell you--

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.750
having been on CNBC a lot--
he is absolutely full of it.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.670
He thought about that
on the way over there,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.370
honestly, because
he has no idea why

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.140
the quarter did what it did--

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.440
no one does.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.730
And so when we accept
that fact and start trying

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.340
to look at longer
periods of time,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.650
we're much, much better off.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.590
But three years-- absolutely
one of the worst things

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.560
that you could look at.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.190
As a matter of fact, a
friend of mine Josh Brown,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.450
who blogs at a site called
The Reformed Broker,

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.160
found a really neat study.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.900
And this study basically
showed that investors who fired

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.870
an active manager for
under-performance and hired

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.130
somebody else--

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.250
guess what happens?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.450
The manager they fired
goes on to do vastly better

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.760
than the manager they hired.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.350
I'm sure many of
you are engineers,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.460
so you understand the concept
of reversion to the mean.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.190
They had a bad three-year
period generally-- not always--

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.540
but generally followed
by a good 3-year period.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.490
The manager that was
hired, well, guess what?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.550
They're coming off a
great 3-year period

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.380
and we love those numbers.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.560
We just love seeing
them beat that benchmark

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.610
and yet we really don't know
why they might have done it.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.680
Two stories that I think
are interesting that

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:20.000
will help us understand why
the long term is against us.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.150
The first is human nature--

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.000
we are very temporal
creatures and there

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.530
is a bias in behavioral
finance called the recency bias

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.600
and we are all subject to it.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.070
Everyone in this room,
everyone on this campus,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.890
everyone in the state,
in this country.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:45.140
Recency bias simply says we
pay the greatest attention

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.220
to what has happened recently
and then, to compound

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.660
our error, we forecast whatever
has been happening recently

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.000
into the future--

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.950
a very, very bad
mistake to make.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.890
So I'll tell you
about something I did

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.400
that demonstrated recency bias.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.860
So when I was a young
guy and beginning

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.590
to look into why stocks
did what they did

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.420
and a big believer in factors--

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.510
underlying things like PE
ratios, dividend yields,

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.530
et cetera--

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.480
I had a cousin, Jerry,
who is a true wild man.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.910
And he had called me on
the phone and he goes,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.700
Jim, you've got to
get into this stock.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.880
This thing is going to explode,
it's going to get taken over,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.140
this is my industry, I know
it-- this is fantastic.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.460
So what did I do?

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.320
I bought it-- of
course, I bought it.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.460
And I looked it up in
the newspaper every day

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.990
and I was a little put off by
the fact that rather than going

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.767
up and up and up, it went
down and down and down.

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:49.850
So I kept calling, Jerry--

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.200
Jerry, what's going on?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.050
You told me?

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.000
Don't worry about it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.700
They delayed the announcement.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.500
It's going to come out, just
keep on buying-- buy it,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.000
buy it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.640
You can't lose.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.695
Any time you hear the term you
can't lose, I can tell you,

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:07.820
you will lose, so I did.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.300
And sure enough, as you
probably can anticipate,

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.950
the stock cratered--
it did horribly.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.450
Why?

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:20.870
Because I telescoped my
feelings into the here and now

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.560
and when we do that,
we are inordinately

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.920
made to think only
of the here and now.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.920
And smartphones aren't
helping us, right?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.610
So I'm glad I don't see too
many people on their smartphone,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.060
but it is reducing our
attention span from quarters

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.160
to quarter of seconds, right?

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.720
And so very, very difficult
to think differently.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.090
The other story, which
is kind of a sad story--

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.550
at least for the guy,
not for his kids--

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.531
was I had a good friend and
this guy is super smart.

00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:56.780
I don't know if he was smart
enough to work at Google,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.240
but he was very
good in real estate,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.810
switched on, knew everything
about everything--

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.740
just a really, really,
really smart guy.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.750
And so it occurred that he
became our contrary indicator.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.070
In other words, whenever
Art called me on the phone

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.900
and said Jim, put me all in.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.840
Put me all in your most
aggressive strategy.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.440
I would say, are you
sure you want to do that

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.860
because, what had happened?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.250
Obviously, it had done really
well over the past year or two.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.510
And yep, you got to do it.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.760
You got to do it for me.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.470
And I went, OK, will do.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.110
Hang up the phone,
get on the speaker

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.420
that everyone at the firm
working for me at the time

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.400
can hear, and I said, we've
just called a market top.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.410
And it virtually always worked.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.270
Of course, he did the
same thing on the way out.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.650
Get the call from Art, "Jim,
sell me out of everything.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.860
This market looks horrible."

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.590
And he'd enumerate
all sorts of reasons

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.070
why, and I'm like, "Art,
you realize that you really

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.210
don't want to do this.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.730
You really should be
buying now, not selling."

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.510
"No, Jim.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.500
No, no, I know--

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.680
I'm selling."

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.730
Get back on the box,
the market has bottomed.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.590
And here's what's cool.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.720
He had his kids invested in
exactly the same strategy

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.340
that he used.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.960
And guess what?

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.960
He didn't touch their
investments, right.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.690
It was only his own
position that he

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.280
felt comfortable playing with.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.660
Well five, seven
years later, Art

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.590
found that his kids were
much richer than Art

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.800
because they just did nothing.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.780
They simply stayed
in the strategy

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.700
and let it do its work.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.490
And, so that is kind of in a
nutshell what we're facing.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.350
And I mentioned recency bias.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.250
So, recency bias is really
interesting-- you're

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.220
going to have to unlock
this again for me.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.730
Recency bias is interesting
because it really

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.320
infects everything that we do.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.330
I'll give you two examples.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.840
So the first example,
let's say you have a doctor

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.510
and he's been reading the
docs on a particular medicine

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.070
that he wants to use.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.100
And he's looking at it,
and basically the efficacy

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.750
is 50/50.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.700
You're flipping a coin.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.700
And so he decides he likes
some of the way it's done,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.530
and so he tries it on a patient.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.080
And, wonder of
wonders, that patient

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.900
does really, really well.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.660
How do you think
the doctor interacts

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.810
with the next patient
with the same disease?

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.090
He says, I want to try this
on you, the 50/50 flip.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.090
And how does he get
the guy to do it?

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.290
He says, it's working really
well with the last guy

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.670
I tried it on.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.540
He totally ignores all
of the descriptive data

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.150
saying this is a coin toss.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.170
And yet everybody he
says that to says,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.090
great, I want to
use that medicine.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.940
A second one is
more market-oriented

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.220
and it is basically
the Bloomberg surveys

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.264
that they do of investors.

00:15:22.264 --> 00:15:24.180
Well, you can see this
one coming a mile away.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.910
When are they absolutely
at their most bullish?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.180
Well, the last
extremes that we noted

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.450
were in the dot-com bubble.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.160
The vast majority of every
investor that they talked to

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.480
and surveyed--

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.530
wildly, crazy bullish
on the market.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.150
When was the lowest amount
of bullishness in the market?

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.470
Near the bottoms of
the financial crisis.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.660
And what's interesting is
we can't help ourselves.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.900
So when our ancient ancestors
were on that plain in Africa

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.770
and the bush was rattling,
one of them ran away,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.010
the other one went, oh I
wonder what's in that bush.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.310
Guess whose genes got
passed down to us?

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.770
The guy who ran away.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.160
So the idea that flee--

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.080
let's get out of here--

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.560
came down us through
our genetic inheritance,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.380
and it is very, very
difficult to overcome.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.980
There's actually a pair of
Swedish scientists who did

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.800
a report-- and I can make all
these links available to you

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.800
if you're interested in
reading the source material--

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.660
and what they did
was pretty clever.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.970
They took identical twins,
so 100% genes matched.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.690
And they looked at their
investment techniques,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.400
and what they found was
really, really disconcerting.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.620
Basically in their
paper they claimed

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.050
that 45% of all of the
investment choices that we make

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:04.140
are genetic and can not
be educated against.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.650
Think about that for a minute.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:12.990
45% genetic, education
has no effect on that.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.480
I often wonder-- because
I'm Spock, right,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.040
I'm not Captain Kirk--

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.920
but it's like, why don't
people pay attention?

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.560
We've had all this data
forever and ever and ever.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.560
And that kind of turned
the light on for me.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.120
And I said, oh, I
realize why we don't.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.100
We don't because we are
in an environment where

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.200
our very genes are
rebelling against us

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.430
and letting things like recency
bias and availability bias--

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.450
I love that one.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:47.070
Availability bias is how easy
do we remember something.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.650
So if we're watching the TV news
and a terrorist attack happens,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.311
guess what we get afraid of?

00:17:52.311 --> 00:17:54.810
We get afraid that we're going
to die in a terrorist attack,

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.540
even though if you look
statistically the chances

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.790
of that happening are
virtually nonexistent.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.690
So a good long-term
performance-- you know,

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.790
Cliff Asness who runs AQR--

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.200
had a great quote, which was,
"If you can have and really

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.970
live by a good long-term
investment outlook,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.240
that is as close to an
investment superpower

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.880
as you will ever be
able to achieve."

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:27.240
And the fact is, the stats show
virtually no one can do that.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.710
So problem number one.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.950
Problem number
two is, again, us.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.400
The next thing that
we focus on when

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.750
you want to be a good investor
is, good investors value

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.570
process over outcome.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.440
What does that mean?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.510
Deming had a great
quote which was,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.380
"If you cannot describe
what you do as a process,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.290
you don't know what
you are doing."

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.160
So basically, if you're
a good active investor,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.510
you will always value the
process over the outcome.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.860
Why is that?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.980
Well, because if you know
nothing about a process

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.500
and you're just
looking at two numbers,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.590
you're basing your
decision on outcome.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.700
Like right here.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.930
This is the five-year
result of buying

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.160
the 50 stocks with
the best sales

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.040
gain-- annual sales gains.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.920
And if we were looking at this
just in isolation, we'd say,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.240
wow, simple strategy, makes
a good deal of sense to me.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.380
I'm going to do that.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.410
This strategy
outperformed the S&amp;P 500

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.400
in four of the five years
that we're looking at here,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.420
and it doubled the total
return of the S&amp;P 500.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.620
Right, so you'd think, if
I'm looking at that outcome,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.610
I love it.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.230
And keep in mind, it would
not appear to you in a vacuum.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.220
Morningstar would have a five
star rating on this fund.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.820
CNBC would have this manager
on and talking about why

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.220
this is such a great strategy.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.440
"Forbes, "Fortune,"
"Wall Street Journal,"

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.260
"Barron's" would all be
writing glowing stories

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.270
about this guy or gal.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.390
They would say they've got
the keys to the kingdom there.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.620
This is amazing.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:20.820
OK, this is what happens when
you value outcome over process.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.480
Let's go to the next slide and
see what really happens here.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.940
Well, what really happens
here is you're wiped out.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.340
This is the data
between 1964 and 2009.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.390
Over to the left is
that very same strategy.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:45.360
That strategy did vastly
worse than T-bills.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.860
Everything else killed it.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.790
So let's all imagine that
there is a bar graph there

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.480
for the S&amp;P 500 that says
you put your money there,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.540
you got $640,000.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.340
And all stocks doesn't
even have a number

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.620
but it's better
than the S&amp;P 500.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.630
The point is a
pretty simple one.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.920
If you have access to
the long-term data,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.620
you're going to get
much better information

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.880
about whether the process that
you're looking at actually

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.380
makes sense.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.510
For the most part, they don't.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.280
Like buying the stock with
the 50 highest sales-- oh,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.220
by the way, these numbers
are from 1964 to 1968.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.270
People who don't understand
market history it's like Twain

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.780
said, history doesn't repeat
itself, but it rhymes, right.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.340
So in 1964 to 1968
we had a bubble

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.815
just like the dot-com
bubble, and it

00:21:40.815 --> 00:21:43.440
led to all sorts of things that
we don't have time to get into.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.710
But in terms of
practical human nature,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.410
they behaved exactly
the same then

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.560
as they did in the
dot-com bubble.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.110
And then for people who don't
like the idea of-- well,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.890
'60s, that's meaningless-- this
same strategy for the three

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:06.300
years ending February of 2000
compounded at 66% per year

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.530
for the prior three years
as of February 2000.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.680
Boy, that's really
difficult to ignore.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.570
And the only way
you can ignore it

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.650
is if you look at the much,
much longer term in terms

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.330
of the underlying strategy
and how it performs.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:29.260
When you value
process over outcome

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.560
what becomes important to
you is to study as much data

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.180
as you have available to you
to see how things in general

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.260
turn out.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.360
You're not always
going to be right.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.830
So, one of the reasons why
that strategy does very poorly

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.360
is because, guess what happens.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.520
Everyone buys those
stocks and they

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.370
become enormously expensive.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:59.730
They're priced to perfection,
and they don't achieve it.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.740
So Murphy would be good here.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.910
Murphy was an optimist.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.630
If it can go wrong, it will
go wrong and generally does.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.060
What we've found
in doing this study

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.440
is that when you pay for
the most expensive stocks

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.970
you manage to subtract
about 6.2% from the return

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.320
from the index.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.140
Think about it like it
was a lemonade stand.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.450
If there was a--

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.820
or you showed me the trucks.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.195
OK, so if one of these
trucks was out there, right,

00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:30.150
and you were getting your lunch
and you're talking to the guy

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.810
and the guy says,
hey, truck's for sale.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:34.980
You're like, cool.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.760
I like this food, I like
everything about it.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.080
What are your revenues?

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.010
And the guy goes, yeah, the
revenues are about $100,000

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.270
a year.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.850
OK, that's pretty cool.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.030
What do I have to pay
you to buy your truck?

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.289
Yeah, I'm going to
need $10 million.

00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:54.080
And you're going to
look at him, and you're

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.900
going to go, well, OK, I didn't
realize that you were insane.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.020
I guess there's a correlation
between insanity and making

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.060
good gyros, I don't know.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.160
But in a specific example like
that everyone goes, oh yeah,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.260
I would never in a million
years be willing to do that.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.880
Well, take a look
around you today

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.210
at some of the valuations of
some of our favorite stocks,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.170
and they are in
the stratosphere.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.330
We call them lottery
stocks, right,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.170
because when you look at how
they pay off, very few of them

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.400
actually pay off.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.340
Like Google-- ooh, paid off.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.130
Amazon-- paid off.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.960
All of those other
1,000-- you know,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.520
Ask Jeeves didn't pay off.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.730
Many of the other search
engines that were there--

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.610
I'm 56, so I used them all--

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.660
and Ask Jeeves was really weird,
because there was a butler.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.210
You're probably all too young to
know this, but it was a butler

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.290
and just made you
feel very weird.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.616
Hi, Jeeves, can you tell
me what's good tonight,

00:25:02.616 --> 00:25:04.115
and then you'd get
horrible results.

00:25:04.115 --> 00:25:06.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.560
Good in what way?

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.800
It's like Kramer when he
did the movie phone, right.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.640
Why don't you just tell me
what movie you want to see?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.540
So anyway, what happens
happens in tech the same way

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.190
it happened in cars.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.880
At the turn of the century,
there were 200 automakers--

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.370
200.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.080
Flash forward a couple of
decades, there were three.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.230
Because what happened was
the three winners took it

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.230
all and everybody else
went out of business.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.920
And so, when you're paying
very, very rich multiples,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.610
it really helps to have
information like this.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.460
The second thing that's
really important here--

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.710
and we're going to get to
it and spend more time on it

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.670
in a minute--

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.890
but is this idea of a base rate.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.000
What's a base rate?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.190
Real simple, batting average.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.890
How often does this particular
strategy beat its benchmark

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.960
and by how much?

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.550
So in the case of--

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.360
this is our value composite
which uses five separate value

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.070
factors--

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.970
in the case here, we see
that in any three-year period

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.890
we have a 73% chance
historically of doing better

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.300
than the benchmark.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.020
Now what does that mean?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.500
It means that we know going in
that in every 10-year period

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.810
we're going to underperform
three of those years.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:39.890
So we take a very, much
more clinical, if you will,

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.680
aspect to the way we
choose to invest in

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.060
that we go in accepting the
fact that we're going to fail

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.510
and knowing by about how much.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:54.800
But to get odds like these on
your side is very exciting.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.330
And yet people refuse to
pay attention to base rates.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.070
Here's a great story--

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.700
and I, sort of being very
logical and rational,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.370
I just can't figure out
why people won't do this,

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.680
but they don't--

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.950
and it concerns a town--

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.660
it's 100,000 in the town.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:20.900
70,000 are lawyers,
30,000 are engineers.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.130
When you just give no
information at all, right,

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.910
and you have a person pick
10 names out of a barrel

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.180
and you say, OK,
how many are lawyers

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.710
and how many are engineers?

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.510
Everybody guesses the same way.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.090
They say well I'm going to
say they're all lawyers.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.970
That way I'm going to
get at least seven right.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.400
And they've done
this experiment.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.280
This one was reproducible.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.950
They've done this a
number of times, always

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.590
comes out the same.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.830
So they pay attention
to the base rate.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.630
Next, they add meaningless
descriptive information.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.350
Tom is 33 years
old, wears glasses,

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.440
and likes to ride
his bike to work.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.110
People start
thinking, huh, I can't

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.590
see a lawyer wanting to
ride his bike to work.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.640
I know that I
shouldn't, but I'm going

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.020
to say that he is an engineer.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.940
And they basically, just
on meaningless information,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.140
allow huge mistakes to start
entering their forecast.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.760
Then finally, they give
stereotypical information.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:40.040
Frank is 34 years old, shy,
likes mathematical puzzles,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.540
spends weekends on his
computer, and really,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.880
really hates parties.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.520
And so, everyone
says, I don't care

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.840
if it's said that there were
99,000 lawyers and 1,000

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.380
engineers, this
guy is an engineer.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.930
No he wasn't.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.400
He was a lawyer, because
the base rate said

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.140
that that's what he had to be.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.950
So, base rate
information is vital

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.620
when you're trying to
manage money effectively

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.710
over long periods of time.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.910
Another thing that--

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.080
I love this quote--

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.120
another thing that successful
active managers don't pay

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.870
any attention to are forecasts.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:33.490
And it's really interesting to
me because that's all we crave.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.220
I was on Twitter before I
got here, and it was always--

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.889
everyone is, so and so is
saying that fill in the blank.

00:29:40.889 --> 00:29:42.180
The market's going to collapse.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.420
The market's going to soar.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.520
This stock's going to do well.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.680
This stock's going to do poorly.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.770
Fact of the matter
is they have zero--

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:56.130
zero-- effort at getting
a correct forecast.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.140
Forecast, the old maxim
was forecast early

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.590
and forecast often right because
you're always going to probably

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.910
get it really, really wrong.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.970
What we do when we're
looking at forecasts

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.680
is we get sucked in to
the story of the forecast.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.160
And I even find myself--
like, I was on CNBC one day

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.190
and this guy he had
a great story, right.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.270
He's like, well we've looked
at 110 different variables

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:30.580
and we ran a correlation matrix
about how these variables have

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.950
done in the past, and
I'm very confident to be

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.610
able to tell you that sometime
this week the market is

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.340
going to go down by 10%.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.670
And I really had to kind of
leave, go to the green room,

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.420
throw water in my face, and--

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.820
He has no idea what
he's talking about,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.010
and yet we love it right
because we crave narrative.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.160
We want to know
the future, right.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.440
And I joked the
other day that, I

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.230
will predict that in the
future people in the future

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.430
will think they can
forecast the future.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.900
And Cicero, a Greek
philosopher and statesman

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.990
who didn't end well,
had a great quote

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.070
that went along the lines of,
you know, it doesn't matter how

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.100
learned you are or how base.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.280
All of us believe that we
can forecast the future,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.740
and we can't.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.010
And it would be great.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.220
and if I could
forecast the future,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.340
I can promise you I would
not be standing here

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.080
giving this talk to Google.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.080
I would be on my
own private island,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.840
having flown there
in a G5 because I

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.910
would've done just great.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.320
And the fact is, though, it
is our very human nature that

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.360
makes us want to be able to
make those types of forecasts.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.500
Here's a forecast.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.160
This is kind of interesting.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.210
So, CXO is a site that is
dedicated to what we do,

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.350
investing.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:12.520
And over a long period of time
they gathered 6,582 forecasts,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.590
and down here are the results.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.330
So basically,
these-- now remember,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.400
these weren't people they
pulled off the street,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.890
right, hey what do you
think the Dow's going to do?

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.510
Actually, there
is a thing called

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.010
the wisdom of
crowds that say you

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.100
might do better if you pulled
enough people off the street.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.390
That's a different story.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.270
Anyway, these experts--

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:41.440
42 of these experts had
efficacy ratings below 50%.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.730
What does that tell us?

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.650
We get a room full of monkeys.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.090
We give them quarters.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.020
We have them flip
those quarters.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.490
And we're going to do
better on our forecast

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.460
than these so-called
vaunted experts.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.560
I mean, let that sink in.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.560
And again, we can't
help ourselves.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.200
There's this thing
called the halo effect.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.670
The halo effect is--

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.710
well, you guys all
have the halo effect.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.700
You work at Google.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.780
I mean, how cool is that.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.510
And so what happens is--

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.010
oh, you work at Google--

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.490
immediately that person
begins to attribute to you

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.450
all sorts of things that many
of you don't deserve, right.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:26.560
It's like, yeah, yeah I work
at Google, how you doin'?

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.110
And suddenly, that
other person who

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.810
is meeting you for the
first time is enraptured.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.010
You're smart.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.540
You're good looking.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.900
You work at Google.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.650
Oh my god, this guy is amazing--

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.700
happens in what I do.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.770
It happens everywhere, right.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.710
The minute you get published
in a prestigious journal

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.800
or the minute you come
up with a great algorithm

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.450
you get other attributes
assigned to you that you

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:57.550
don't deserve as the cold hard
facts basically point out.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.330
And so-- it's not
just this, by the way.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:05.350
They used to do surveys until
they got so embarrassed by them

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.000
that they stopped doing them.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.751
And these were surveys of
institutional investors,

00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:11.500
and they did them once
a year because they

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.460
had a big gathering
in New York City.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.909
What's your favorite
stock for the year?

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.650
Well, if you--

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.080
Jim Chanos, who's very
famous for shorting stocks.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.800
I gotta bet that he was
simply there writing them

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.280
down and then running
out and shorting them.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.790
1999, Guess what their
favorite stock was.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.909
Enron.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.500
They loved Enron.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.350
And for those of you
unfamiliar with Enron,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:44.110
it was the largest bankruptcy
in US history at the time.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.070
They were lying to everybody.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.960
And again, showing the
importance of narrative,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.780
I talked to a fund
manager who owned Enron,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.400
and he was telling me
he was buying more.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.410
I'm like, dude-- we showed
him the quants screens--

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.980
and it's like, this is not
a stock you want to buy.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.840
It's in the worst category
on financial strength.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.640
It's in the worst
category on value.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.010
It's in the worst--

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.100
essentially, it's
like the worst stock.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.680
And he's like, no, no,
Jim, you don't get it.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.210
I got invited to a barbecue
at the CFO's house--

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.500
of Enron.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.360
The CEO was there.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.060
The chief legal
counsel was there.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.680
Everybody was there.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.920
And they gave me a beer
and we started talking,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.050
and they assured me--

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.290
they assured me-- that
their stock was going

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.240
to double from these levels.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.440
And I'm like, OK, probably
a really good thing

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.020
you didn't go to a barbecue
at Bernie Madoff's house

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.440
because he probably
would have even given you

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.670
much better assurances
as to the efficacy

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.080
of his particular take.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.570
And yet again, we're
coming back to the theme

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.950
here, which is guess who sits
right at the center of all

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.390
our screw ups.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.830
Us.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:07.090
It is human nature to
do all of these things

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:11.080
because a lot of shortcuts work.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.790
A lot of them don't, right.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.670
So recency bias doesn't
work when you're

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.350
trying to think long term.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.800
Availability bias
narrows you down

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.370
to thinking about just
what you can remember.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.140
You know, overconfidence bias--

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.240
I'm sure that many in
the room have that.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.920
I certainly do.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.950
Overconfidence bias
is, hey, I'm a stud.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.450
I know how to pick stocks.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:35.920
This is great.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.690
No I'm not, and the fact
is I make as many mistakes

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.000
if I'm trying to do it
without the guidance of base

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.710
rates and all the
things that we've been

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.530
talking about as anyone else.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.900
And so, in terms of
predictions, the last story

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.720
will tell, which I love.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.150
So "Fortune" magazine,
in its wisdom,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:02.540
decided to do a cover story
in the summer of 2000,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.570
and the title of this
story was "10 Stocks

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.550
for the Next Decade."

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.947
And they hyped it, and they--

00:37:10.947 --> 00:37:12.530
these are going to
be the best stocks.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.640
Buy these 10 stocks.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.090
Don't even look at your
portfolio over the next 10

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.640
years.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.400
You're going to be delighted.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.200
Well, for people
who actually didn't

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.690
look at their portfolio
it did probably save them

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:28.610
from killing themselves because,
of the 10, two went bankrupt--

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.760
Enron we've already
mentioned, and Nortel,

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.500
the big Canadian name.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:41.450
And the balance of return for
these 10 stocks was minus 27%

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:48.271
overall versus a gain
of 116% for the S&amp;P 500.

00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:48.770
Why?

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.120
Because they got caught up.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.050
They love this story, and
they just couldn't-- they just

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.280
couldn't bring themselves to
think not in terms of stories,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:04.130
but in terms of what's going
on right then and there.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.220
The next thing I'd
like to talk about is--

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.980
to be a good active
investor requires

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.460
patience and persistence,
and most of us

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.380
are not genetically
designed to do this.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.020
We want results now, right.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.730
We want the win.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.256
We want to be able to look up
at the monitor and see, wow,

00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:27.880
it's up half a point
since I bought it.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.380
I love it.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.690
This is great.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.480
And yet, we really need to
let these things play out

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.470
over longer periods of time.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.760
Now, I happen to be highlighting
Warren Buffett here,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.160
but this is the same
for anyone you've

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.480
heard of-- guys like John
Neff, Peter Lynch, etc.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.760
Actually, Joel who
spoke here yesterday

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.200
is also on this list
of a great investor.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.340
And the fact is they got there
by being patient and persistent

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.280
So, Buffett we can
see how well he

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.090
did in all rolling one, three,
five, seven, ten-year periods.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:09.280
And when we look at one year,
pretty high, 73%, not bad.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.490
But that means that in any
three of those 10-year periods

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.190
he was doing very badly.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:19.360
And he was doing really badly
during the dot-com bubble.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.840
And I recall that
virtually every story

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.880
I read about Warren Buffett
was, man, great guy, used

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.230
to have the chops.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.790
He's just too old.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.340
He's too old.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.900
Do you know that he
doesn't use email?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.560
He writes it out longhand
and his assistant emails it.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.850
I mean, come on.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.480
This guy just--
he doesn't get it.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.380
And you listen to people talking
about him on CNBC, same thing.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.720
Yeah, he had a great run, but
we got a brand new economy.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.220
He's a relic.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.460
This guy just can't
do it anymore.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.540
Did Buffett change
anything that he did?

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.650
Absolutely not.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.550
He was patient.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.380
He was persistent.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.320
And he has a very well-known--
if you read any of the books

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.370
about him--

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.580
group of things that he looks
for, and these are some of them

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.660
up there.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.252
And yet look at his
10-year win rate.

00:40:14.252 --> 00:40:16.110
100%.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.010
You don't see too many
100% 10-year rates.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.630
How did he achieve that?

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:28.140
By paying zero attention to all
of the noise, all of the people

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.930
calling him out, all of the
people calling him names,

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.610
making fun of him.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.650
All of that was happening
around that time.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.200
And he just stuck to his game
because he knew that game,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.210
and he knew what
his base rates were.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.760
He knew what his
level of success was.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.030
The same thing happened to all
those other active managers

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.630
I mentioned.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.510
So, if you're an
active manager, if you

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.680
want to do it on
your own, you've

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.580
got to get ready for
the idea that there

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:01.360
is going to come a point in time
where you look really stupid.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.180
I say to my wife,
who is nice enough

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.700
to come today, more for the
tour of Google than to hear me--

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.430
because, as she said to me
earlier, you're such a gas bag

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.620
I hear all of this anyway.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.540
I don't need to be here

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.110
But, here's the path
of an active investor--

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:24.480
hero, goat, hero,
goat, hero, goat.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.490
If you don't have
the constitution

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.340
to make that work for you, it's
going to be very difficult,

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.140
and we're going to come
to that point in a minute.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.450
So I love this quote, too.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.970
Charlie Munger, "You don't
want to believe in luck.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.830
You want to believe in odds."

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.900
I think this is one of
the more important things

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.460
that I want to tell you about
because we live in a world

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.790
where people believe
more in possibilities

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.280
than they believe
in probabilities,

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.040
as crazy as that sounds.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.210
What's possible?

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:56.060
OK, what's possible?

00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.410
I flew out of JFK to come here,
very possible my plane crashes.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.200
Very possible that I
make it on the plane,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.570
but then the Uber driver
gets into an accident

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.040
and I get killed.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.470
Very possible that
somebody decides

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.200
they're going to mug us when
we're walking to dinner.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.750
Very possible that all
these horrible things

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.190
could happen to me.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.720
Well people who think in
terms of possibilities,

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.190
what are they going to do?

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.100
They're never getting
out of bed, right.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.860
It's like the only good
thing that could potentially

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.620
happen to them is they
could win the lottery.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.540
And as Fran Lebowitz
loves to say,

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.030
your chance of winning
the lottery or not

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.080
is the same whether you
buy a ticket or not.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.880
So that's the good thing.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.070
Everything else is bad, right.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.140
Remember the movie
"Dumb and Dumber,"

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.040
and Lloyd Christmas had
the hots for the woman who

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.370
he rescued, and he says to her
very hopefully, you know, Mary,

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.250
I just got to know.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.080
You just got to tell me.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.561
Do I have a chance with you?

00:42:56.561 --> 00:42:58.560
Of course she's happily
married, can hardly wait

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.210
to get back to her husband.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.540
And she goes, I don't think
it's looking very good for you,

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.290
Lloyd.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.720
And he goes, well,
so give me the odds.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.100
Give me the odds.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.760
And Mary says, I'd
say the best odds

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.460
that you're going to see
are one in a million.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.950
And Lloyd gets this
huge smile on his face,

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.965
and he goes, "so you're
telling me I got a chance!"

00:43:19.965 --> 00:43:22.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.550
No you don't, Lloyd.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.040
You're not hooking up
with Mary, and you're

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.350
thinking about possibilities
not probabilities.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.620
Now, some real world examples.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:36.120
People who think in terms of
possibilities, they freak out,

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:36.780
right.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.150
It's the bottom of
the financial crisis

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.220
and I'm going down
to Washington to call

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.880
on one of the smartest,
most articulate advisers

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.260
we'd worked with.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.480
He'd been a client for 10 years.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.690
I get there with my head
of private client services.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.220
We walk into his office.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.270
Literally-- this is the door.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.790
We get here, one foot in.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.130
And he's like, stop right there.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.390
Stop.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.790
He's sitting at his desk.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.150
So Ari and I look at
each other like, OK,

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.770
are you scanning us for weapons?

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.510
What's going on?

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:17.330
And he goes-- puts a hand
up like this, O'Shaughnessy,

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:18.860
I know what you're going to do.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.070
I know that you're going to
show me all sorts of charts

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.820
and graphs and you're going to
show me that thing I just saw

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.030
on your website where you looked
at the 50 worst 10-year periods

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.870
back to 1871 and how in every
one of them the next three,

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.900
five, seven, and ten years
were very, very positive--

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.260
talk about having the
odds on your side--

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:45.260
and I know you're going to
do this, and I don't care.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.330
I have to act
right now on what's

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.020
happening right now because
you say it's a possibility,

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.060
I say it's a probability.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.510
The US is going down.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.410
And I was like, well, thanks
for keeping the meeting short.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:06.080
Good luck with your
gold and your cave

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.220
stacked with
antibiotics and weapons.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.460
Can I get the address
of that just in case?

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.030
Anyway, he went on to do
very poorly, obviously,

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.560
because we published this
piece in March of 2009

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.600
saying a generational
buying opportunity.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.930
I heard crickets
and/or you're crazy,

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.180
you're a mad
Irishman, et cetera.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:36.290
And so, what we found
was people understood

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.730
what we were trying
to tell them,

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.390
but they just didn't
want to listen to it.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:46.400
And this is endemic
across the spectrum.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.630
There was a great story about a
guy by the name of Semmelweis.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:54.680
He was a doctor
in Vienna in 1847.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.580
And he was assigned
to the maternity ward,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.120
and he noticed
that the women who

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.810
were being delivered
by male surgeons

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:10.100
were dying at a rate that was
five times the rate of those

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.173
that were dying
serviced by midwives.

00:46:14.173 --> 00:46:16.640
He was like, hmm, this is bad.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.010
And so, he was a scientist.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:21.170
Let's test a hypothesis.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.600
Well, the women who
were attended by men

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.410
are on their backs.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.200
The women who are attended
by women are on their sides.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.300
Let's put everybody
on their side.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.130
No difference.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.310
OK, well, we have this
really creepy custom

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:39.530
of if somebody dies a nun
goes down the row of beds

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.250
with the women ringing
the death bell.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.450
Yep, another one
bought the dust.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.670
You're probably next.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.720
So he had them stop
the death bell.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.490
No difference.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.160
And then he said, I
think it's that we

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.080
aren't washing our hands.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.940
And so he had a special
concoction of lye and several

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.970
other things that he
forced the doctors--

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.320
he was the chief guy--

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.830
forced the doctors
to wash their hands.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:11.300
Death rates plummet,
his Eureka moment, OK.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.510
It's because you're going
from dissecting cadavers

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.860
to giving birth.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.340
You're passing along
some pretty nasty stuff.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.050
Everybody's got to
wash their hands.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:27.110
And so they did, begrudgingly,
because again society.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:33.740
Society is our software, right,
and it's evolved rapidly.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.680
Our hardware has
not evolved at all.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:42.230
So we're running 21st-century
software on a 50,000-year-old

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:43.400
hardware.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.310
And this is where we run
into all of our problems--

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.090
because society was
going to reject.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:49.190
Semmelweis.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.710
The men didn't like having
to wash their hands,

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:54.140
and they stopped.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.060
And they kicked Semmelweis out.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:00.650
He ended up, unfortunately,
in an insane asylum

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:05.600
where he died of the exact same
disease that all of the women

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.970
were dying from, sepsis.

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:11.210
And it took another 50 years
before some other doctors

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.730
said, hey what's this
hand-washing stuff?

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.600
And so, all of that
time, they weren't

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.520
looking at the probabilities
of his example.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.770
They were looking at the
mores of the particular time

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:26.330
in which they lived.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.690
So, when you're looking at
probabilities, what you want

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:31.880
to see is lots of data, right.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.830
So, here, shareholder yield--

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.330
I won't spend a lot
of time on this,

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.610
but shareholder
yield means you buy

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.370
the stocks that have the highest
buyback rate and the highest

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:41.960
dividend yield.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.530
And we actually have this
data going back to 1927.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:50.370
We've truncated it here
for ease of looking at it.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.280
But look at its base rates.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.880
It's amazing.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.030
And when you think about
it, and you dig deeper,

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.950
you say, OK, this
is how it's done

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.816
on all rolling five-year bases.

00:49:01.816 --> 00:49:03.550
Wow.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.150
The probabilities that I've got
here are really in my favor.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.260
Now, you can see underneath--
not all the time, right.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.880
So, there are
going to come times

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.930
when we have to suffer a
bit, but the preponderance

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:21.390
of the evidence basically
says this is a great way

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.020
to buy stocks.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.250
The point of this
is quite simple.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.850
Diluters-- you, know
Snapchat, right.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.400
They're diluting the
hell out of their owners

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.140
by issuing new shares--

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.670
typically lose the most money.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.590
Expansion loses almost
the same amount of money

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.120
as the diluters.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.150
The only one that actually
makes a ton of money

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.240
are buybacks and dividends,
returning capital

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.980
to the shareholder.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.630
Everything we've
talked about right

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:54.680
now is absolutely meaningless
unless you as an investor,

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.670
if you're doing it yourself,
or the person that you

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:03.130
hire to do it for you,
has unwavering discipline.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.140
And I got to tell you,
having been there many,

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.240
many times, this is
really easy to say,

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.950
and it is really,
really hard to do.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.000
When things are going your way,
you are the cock of the walk.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.780
You're, of course, it's 500
basis points of its benchmark.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.150
We've got the greatest
strategies in the world.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.860
And you're feeling
so good that if you

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.610
had a song the lyrics would
be, or the title would be,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.310
the future's so bright I
gotta wear shades, right?

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.880
I mean, you're loving life.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.700
But as is the case in
all active managers,

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.390
the one thing I can tell you is
you are going to underperform.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.580
Sometimes by a lot.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.380
That's when you have
to have discipline.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.810
So, how many of you sold a
stock that you bought on a tip

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.850
and it did horribly for you?

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.640
Actually bought
that stock on a tip.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.530
How many of you--

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:01.040
you can just keep your hand up.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.340
How many of you
have done something

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.510
because all your
friends were doing it?

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:08.650
How many of you watch
somebody on CNBC

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:12.340
or Fox Business News or
any Bloomberg Business News

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.190
and bought it simply because
that man or woman said

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:17.180
it was going to be great?

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.370
And the results, generally
speaking, are very, very poor.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.220
It's a very undisciplined
way to approach

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.160
investing in the stock
market, and it leads

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.590
to very, very similar results.

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.670
So, without discipline,
everything I've

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.340
talked about,
meaningless, right.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.430
And we had a consultant
come in and talk to us

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.450
about what happened with
quantitative investors like us

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:45.400
during the financial crisis.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.860
60% left their models.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.140
More than half
left their models,

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.430
which to me says, every bit
of their past performance--

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.600
meaningless.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.730
Because they didn't
have what it took

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.320
to actually stick to the model.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.690
And let me tell you,
it's really, really easy

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.450
to say your
disciplined, and doing

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.000
it is virtually impossible.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.520
So if we're going back
to songs, your song

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.890
when you're in your third
month of underperformance

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.860
and everybody's laughing at you,
or they're making fun of you

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.470
on--

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.950
you go and do a guest
interview on CNBC,

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.820
and they're just
chuckling, are you wrong.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.920
And again, recency, right.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.670
It's all what's happening right
now, not-- long-term track

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.140
record, meaningless.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.170
Right now you're doing
horribly, and therefore you

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:40.290
are a fool and a
buffoon, and do you

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.470
have a reply Kind of
like, when did you

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:46.470
stop beating your spouse?

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:50.400
And there you are
in a dark place.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.410
There's just no
question about it.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.310
You know, Shakespeare had a
great sonnet, the 29th, which

00:52:56.310 --> 00:53:00.340
went, "When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes,

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.390
I all alone beweep
my outcast state,

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.610
and trouble deaf
heaven with my bootless

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.710
cries, and look upon
myself and curse my fate."

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.180
OK, if you're
reading Shakespeare

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.490
and you're reciting
that particular line

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.760
from the sonnet, you
are near the end.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.350
And the fact is that the only
thing you have to hang onto

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.500
is this too shall pass.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.630
And it's really not
a lot to hang onto.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:32.340
And yet if you don't have
that underlying discipline

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.780
you are lost.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.280
And this is sort
of interesting--

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.560
and we'll close and
then take questions.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.770
I like this.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.520
I love these magazine articles.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.410
There's always the five or 10--

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:46.980
only, these are the only
things that everybody shares.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.350
You know, these are the
only ways to get dates.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.590
These are the only ways
to become a millionaire.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.340
There are a lot more.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.140
But anyway, for what
it's worth, the only five

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.960
fears we all share.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.380
And I want to talk
about the last three.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.720
Loss of autonomy--
basically, that

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.700
means that you find yourself
in a situation that is entirely

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:16.680
beyond your control, and
that does not feel good.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.040
And you have people coming
at you from all sides,

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.980
and you are getting
bombarded daily.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.560
You feel like you've lost
all sense of control--

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.890
very, very tough to
gut that one out.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:32.910
Separation-- that's losing
people, people rejecting you,

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.270
people not respecting
you for your ideas,

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:39.000
and for what you're
thinking about.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.710
Very, very difficult.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.750
And ego death--
I love ego death.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.080
Ego death is what it implies.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:51.370
Your self-constructed image
of yourself is shattered.

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.650
It's shattered.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.770
Because, if you're an
active money manager

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:59.550
and you're
self-constructed self view

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:04.110
is that you're really good at
this, and suddenly for months

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.680
and then maybe quarters
and then maybe years

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.800
all the evidence is
saying you're not so good.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:16.890
That takes a toll which very,
very few people can actually

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:20.910
continue to stick with
their underlying strategy.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:26.360
So, I didn't really mean this
to be as bleak a talk-- as I'm

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.310
listening to myself, everyone
in here is like, I'm indexing.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.210
Jeez.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:36.740
But the fact is, the more
people index, the better for me

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.280
because stocks will become
less and less well-priced,

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.620
right, because they are
going into an index.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.030
Really, the S&amp;P 500--

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:45.950
it's a momentum fund.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:51.770
When was energy at the top, most
overrepresented in the S&amp;P 500?

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.440
Right before oil collapses.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.390
When was tech
overrepresented in the S&amp;P?

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.660
Right before tech collapses.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.330
So, nothing's perfect.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.670
But the fact is
that, in the world

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.690
we find ourselves in today,
the group of active investors

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.400
while getting
smaller and smaller

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:16.280
is also becoming a much more
effective, in my opinion, club.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.490
And if you can
weather these things,

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.090
the amount of excess return
over long periods of time

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:26.930
that you are able to generate
will be absolutely worth

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:30.710
having to make it through
all of these hurdles, sort

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:34.190
of the challenges of Hercules.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.410
So thank you, and we'll
take any questions.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.862
SPEAKER: Thank you, Jim.

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:40.070
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you.

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:41.300
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.020
Very provocative, and I
expected nothing less.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.300
We have room for maybe
a couple of questions

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.460
I want to start with one
because you mentioned

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.100
Warren Buffett in there.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:57.260
Having read some of your
works, if one buys stocks

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.630
in a basket of low valuations--

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:02.860
low price to book, low price to
cash flow, that's sort of one

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.400
we of investing, if you will.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:10.100
Whereas a lot of people who
are following, as they say,

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.690
Warren Buffett, would say his
way of portfolio construction

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:16.080
is concentration.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.710
Six to eight
stocks, compounders,

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:21.020
hold them for the long term.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:25.650
I would love your thoughts
on the concentration aspect,

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.830
portfolio allocation aspect.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.290
And you know, Dogs
of the Dow strategy,

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.630
for example, which
you elaborated.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:37.570
You rotate once every year,
whereas that other way is hold

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:39.912
six to eight for the long term.

00:57:39.912 --> 00:57:41.370
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY:
Sure, thank you.

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:44.660
So, as far as the
concentration goes,

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.000
we believe in
highly-concentrated portfolios.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.230
We don't own just eight names,
but for an active manager

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.720
our portfolios are
highly concentrated.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.320
SPEAKER: Could you define,
maybe quantify how much?

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.440
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY: So in
the large cap portfolio

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:07.160
we might own as few
as 75, 50 to 75 names.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.281
And we rebalance these monthly,
so the weight of the evidence,

00:58:11.281 --> 00:58:11.780
right.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.270
So if the same name
appears each time

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:18.770
it gets a much bigger
weighting in the portfolio.

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:21.680
So, we think that
to succeed you've

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.780
got to be very
different than the index

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.650
so you have to have what they
call a high active share,

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.380
and you have to be
concentrated, and you

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.100
have to have the courage
of your convictions.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.070
I think most of the managers,
maybe with the exception

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.820
of Peter Lynch, you
will see that these are

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.760
highly-concentrated managers.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.930
And that is so because
that's where the returns are.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:57.890
It's important to us that you
know what stocks you don't own

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:01.640
are just as important
as which ones you do.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:07.130
So we'll run screens and
eliminate half the universe

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:09.120
just because they don't qualify.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.640
So, yes, a highly-concentrated
portfolio tends to lead

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:16.400
to the best results, but--

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.380
very important
caveat-- it can also

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:23.780
lead to the worst results
over a short period of time.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.030
If you're in the
group that wants

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.180
to achieve that
long-term excess return,

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.910
you've got to take
the good with the bad.

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.150
And again it comes
back to discipline.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:38.150
It comes back to the
things I've talked about--

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:43.820
very difficult, because when
your ego is being crushed

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.910
and your sense of self is gone--

00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:50.290
you know, you're not a
fun guy at the party.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.000
AUDIENCE: So there
was a famous bet

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.260
going on with Warren Buffett and
some other hedge fund managers.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.700
They bet for 10 years
against some index fund,

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:02.420
and so it looks like the hedge
fund manager's going to lose.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:07.470
So do you think of a
reason why they lose?

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.470
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY: Sure.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:11.890
So Ted Seides, who
I know very well,

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:19.345
is the author of that bet,
and he took a group of,

01:00:19.345 --> 01:00:22.000
kind of fund of funds.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.610
And I can tell you pretty
much very easily why he lost.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:33.490
He lost because the costs of
the hedge funds, two and 20,

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.380
wiped out the
advantage that they

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.330
might have had
through performance

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:44.770
because Buffett took Bogle and
we're talking six basis points.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:49.480
And the second reason was
because we had a nine-year bull

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.690
market starting in 2009,
basically continuing to today.

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:59.950
And in a bull market, people
who are shorting stocks

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:03.260
tend not to do nearly as well.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:09.820
And then finally, I
think that the hedge

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.160
funds that Ted picked--

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.970
you know, I probably would
have taken the index with all

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.210
of the various hedge funds.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:22.550
But some did really great,
and some did very poorly.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.380
And the only other thing
if I were in Ted's shoes

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.820
was that if you look at it
on a risk-adjusted basis,

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.750
the so-called Sharpe ratio,
actually the hedge funds

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:35.650
killed it.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:41.050
They did so well in terms
of drawdown versus the index

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:44.920
itself, which had a massive
drawdown between '08 and '09.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.190
And that gets back to the
emotional side of investing.

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.790
What good is an investment
that no one can stick at?

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.600
Yeah, technically the S&amp;P
won, but it lost all of its

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.280
investors in '08 and '09,
whereas the hedge funds have

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.980
lost many of their investors at
all because their drawdown was

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.050
much smaller than the
drawdown for the S&amp;P 500.

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:12.640
But fair is fair.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.190
Ted owes Warren the donation.

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.180
The thing I found really
funny was the thing

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.350
that they use as collateral,
which was zero coupon bonds,

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:26.140
beat both.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.230
So next time I'm going
with the collateral.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.170
SPEAKER: I think what they did
was they took the zero coupon

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.510
bonds I think five or
six years after the bet

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.419
and then put them
into Berkshire shares.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.460
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY: Right.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.890
SPEAKER: So the charity
is actually going

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:40.370
to get the best of both worlds.

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.690
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY: Yes

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.273
SPEAKER: Gets the bond returns
when they did the best and then

01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:44.360
the Berkshire returns.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.680
So this is a very,
very provocative note,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.070
and we've run out of time.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.580
Thank you so much for
this fascinating talk.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.180
JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY:
Thank you very much.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:52.680
Thank you.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.530
