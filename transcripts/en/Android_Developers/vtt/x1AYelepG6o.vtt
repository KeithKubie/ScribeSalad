00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.710
LARRY YANG: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.804
Welcome to today's session on
subscriptions on Google Play.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.220
I want to give a
special shout out

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.230
to all the people around
the world watching us

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.190
right now on the live stream.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.690
Yeah.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.190
Woo!

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.060
My name is Larry Yang.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm a product manager on the
Google Play billing platform.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.780
Today, I'm joined by my fellow
product manager, Angela,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.909
and our business
development lead, Niko.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.235
Say hi, everyone.

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:35.401
NIKO SCHROER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.660
ANGELA YING: Hi.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.493
LARRY YANG: All right,
let's kick things off

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:39.720
with a quick show of hands.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.750
Who here is already running
a subscriptions business

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.700
on Google Play?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
Wow, that's like
over half the room.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.330
That's awesome.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.120
All right, who here
is looking to get

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.179
started on running a
subscriptions business on Play?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.220
All right, that's like
about a third of the room.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.680
That's awesome.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.500
Well, good news for all of you.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.530
Today, we're going to
run through a whole bunch

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.180
of features and
capabilities that you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.510
can use right now to start
a subscriptions business,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.630
whether you already have
an existing business

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.540
and you're looking to
optimize your growth,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.650
or if you're just looking
to get something started.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.550
But before we jump in,
let's take a quick look

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.825
at why we're even all here
talking about subscriptions.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.780
Subscriptions is one
of the fastest growing

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.650
businesses on mobile today,
and it's no surprise.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.770
Users have been telling us
that they love subscriptions.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.400
They love the value that
subscriptions provide

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.700
and they love the access
to continuous fresh content

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.040
that they get via a
subscription service.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.280
And users have
demonstrated this love

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.610
by making subscriptions a
part of their daily lives.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.820
In fact, 62% of paid
Android subscribers

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.990
use their subscription app at
least once every single day.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.330
And because users
love subscriptions,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.670
developers love them, too.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.500
Let's watch a short
video highlighting

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.630
some of the great success
that you developers have

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.801
had on subscriptions
on Google Play.

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.669
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.960
All right, that's
pretty cool, huh?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.500
So this is a real testament
to all the great work

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.670
that you developers have done
on subscriptions on Google Play.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.060
But together, we
can do so much more.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.790
So today, we're going to
share three things with you.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.670
First, we'll recap some of
the features we've rolled out

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.860
recently and share
some of the successes

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.820
that developers have seen
with those recent features.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.670
Next, we're going to
announce a dozen new features

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.010
that you can put to
work right away to help

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.590
grow your business.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.700
And finally, we'll give a
sneak peek at some of the ideas

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.360
that we have around the corner.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.750
But more importantly,
tell you what

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.820
you can do today to
be ready for when

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.170
those features are available.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.650
So Niko, why don't you come
on up and get us started.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.840
Tell us about some of
the successes developers

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.690
are having today.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.430
NIKO SCHROER: Thanks, Larry.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.620
The past 12 months have
been truly exciting

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.080
for subscriptions
on Google Play.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.120
We, as a team, have
worked hard to address

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.800
the biggest challenges you
are facing as developers.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.070
For example, minimizing churn.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.470
So quickly, want to
run through three

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.530
features we have seen successful
developers use to do just that.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.690
Number one is real time
developer notifications.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.340
Real time developer
notifications

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.650
give you immediate
notifications when

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.150
the subscriber state changes.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.840
For example, a subscriber
renews or cancels.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.580
Essentially, it changes the way
you operate your subscription

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.520
business on Google Play,
especially in regards

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.940
to minimizing subscriber churn.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.690
Let me quote two of our top
developers on this feature.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.390
Brain training app Elevate
says, real time developer

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.400
notifications have helped
them identify the exact moment

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.270
a user cancels.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.290
So they can remind them of
the benefits of a subscription

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.540
and entice them to resubscribe.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.990
And music streaming on
[INAUDIBLE] loves real time

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.370
developer notifications because
it lets them predict subscriber

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.100
churn--

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.775
real time, and quickly target
canceling users with win

00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:06.750
back offers.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.880
The bottom line
is, for developers

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.750
serious about retention, real
time developer notifications

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.970
have become a must.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.600
Secondly, we
invested quite a bit

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.540
in helping you combat
involuntary churn because it's

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.980
just so painful.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.460
You've spent all this time
building a great product

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.480
or service, then you convince
users to become subscribers

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.780
to your product,
just so they may

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.880
churn because, for example,
they forgot to update

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.100
their form of payment.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.370
That's why we have seen such
great success with a grace

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.620
period, which allows us to
re-try to charge subscribers

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.520
whose payment has failed for
a defined period of time.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.460
An account hold which
lets you put subscribers

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.950
in a suspended state, until they
update their form of payment.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.650
As you can see here in
the example provided

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.080
by our partner,
Musixmatch, that's

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.570
notifying the user about
the payment that has failed.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.510
Lastly, we offer really great
feedback on the Play Console

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.190
subscription reports we launched
at IO last year on this stage.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.310
Actually, over there,
and how it provides

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.980
many ways to analyze
your business

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.550
and find optimization potential.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.250
Developers have made it
the primary destination

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.890
for business
intelligence for anybody

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.120
working on subscriptions
in their company.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.280
So to quickly summarize, our
most successful developers

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.120
show us how these features help
them build great subscription

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.930
services today.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.290
So we recommend all of
you to check them out

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.100
if you're not already
using them, anyways.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.950
OK, enough of features
you already know.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.630
I want to welcome
Angela to tell you

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.493
all about the new
things we're announcing.

00:08:07.493 --> 00:08:08.576
ANGELA YING: Thanks, Niko.

00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:10.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.250
We've talked about how much
users love subscriptions.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.040
We strongly believe that
by building a great user

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.860
experience, we're also building
a high quality subscriber base.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.650
But we know that the
user experience is not

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.540
always perfect.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.429
So just taking a quick straw
poll out there, how many of you

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.890
have hesitated to sign up
for a subscription service

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.890
because you thought it would
be too annoying to cancel

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.799
or it was just going to
be a hassle to remember?

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.190
I know I have, and I see a
bunch of you guys have, as well.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.760
And this is what we found
in our user research.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.530
Users told us that
while they can

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.080
derive a lot of value out
of their subscriptions

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.300
once they've signed
up, they also

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.640
feel like they'll be
trapped in the subscription

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.250
without the ability to cancel.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.290
And since the
majority of our users

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.686
also have multiple
subscriptions to manage,

00:09:04.686 --> 00:09:06.310
they're worried that
they'll lose track

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.040
of how much they're spending.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.190
These fears create a
barrier for users signing up

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.780
for your subscription apps, and
we want to address that fear.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.630
And so we're really excited to
announce that we're launching

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.060
a new subscription center.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.100
This is a one stop
shop for users

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.040
to manage their
subscriptions in Google Play.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.230
We've done a
complete UX overhaul

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.290
of our old subscriptions
page to make it easier

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.360
for users to get
more information

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.870
about their subscription,
easily fix their payment issues,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.380
and do other actions, such as
restore their subscription.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.300
But rather than
talk about it, let

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.890
me just show you how it works.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.570
Niko has graciously volunteered
to be my demo person.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.320
NIKO SCHROER: Yes.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:55.530
ANGELA YING: Can I get two
forward on the slides, please?

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.110
OK, we're just going to do this.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.260
NIKO SCHROER: Do you
want to go to the demo?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.610
ANGELA YING: Yeah, so
let's go to demo A, yeah.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.970
OK, so Niko, could you
open the Play Store

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.920
and open the Hamburger menu?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.240
OK, so we're looking at
Vincent Verily's account,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.250
and we can see that
subscriptions is now

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.740
on a very prominent position
on the Hamburger menu.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.200
This is something new that
has already been launched.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.420
So let's see what happens when
you go into subscriptions.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.120
So Vincent doesn't actually
have any subscriptions,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.370
but there's a new empty state
with a Get Started link.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.450
So let's see what happens
when you tap Get Started.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.200
When we tap Get Started,
we see that there

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.430
is a whole new selection of
different subscription apps

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.570
that the users can explore.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.931
And keep in mind that this
is not the final version.

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:54.930
This is something that
our amazing merchandising

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.870
team is working on,
making a better experience

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.600
day after day.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.070
So let's actually see
what the subscription

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.560
center looks like when the
user has some subscriptions.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.970
Can you switch to
Wendy's account, please?

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.761
NIKO SCHROER: Yeah.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.400
ANGELA YING: OK, so we can see
that Wendy actually has three

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.240
subscriptions in her account.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.820
One of them has the
payment decline,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.100
which needs to be addressed.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.670
But in general, we can see that
she has all this information

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.170
about her
subscription, including

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.140
the SKU name, which is something
that we didn't have before.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.740
And in order to go in and
manage a specific subscription,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.160
we just have to tap somewhere.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.950
So Niko, let's tap
on Pearl &amp; Straw

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.950
to manage that subscription.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.550
So let's say that Wendy
just got a new credit card,

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.040
and she wants to use
that for her subscription

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.720
and she wants to update
that payment method.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.507
So Niko, let's tap Update
under primary payment method.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.340
So now we can see all
of the payment methods

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.880
that Wendy has in her account.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.050
So let's go ahead and switch
that to the new credit card.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.820
So we're done now, right?

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.280
Well, we've actually
launched a cool new feature,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.070
so you could either tap Got
It, and Wendy can go back

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.020
to enjoying her bubble
tea subscription,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.220
or we can tap Add Backup to add
a backup payment method, which

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.620
is a payment method
that will charge in case

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.940
the primary fails.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.420
And this is also a new feature
that we have already launched,

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.930
and is available today.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:34.490
So let's go ahead and use that
old credit card as the backup.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.990
Awesome.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.820
And so now, we're all set.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.570
So let's switch back
to the slides, please.

00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:43.410
Sorry.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.360
OK.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.580
With the launch of the
subscription center,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.820
we're also launching new deep
links specifically designed

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.650
for developers.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.900
You can direct your
users to manage or fix

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.440
their subscriptions from your
app, over email, over web--

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.860
really, over any platform, and
it's super easy to implement.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.214
All you really need is the
pack name and the SKU name

00:13:14.214 --> 00:13:15.880
to construct the deep
link, and then you

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.310
can put that deep link
in a button or a link

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.210
from any of your properties.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.020
So let's cut back to the
demo to see how this works.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.290
So Niko, I need my yak fix.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.000
Can you open the
Fabulous Yak app?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640
NIKO SCHROER: Sure.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.960
ANGELA YING: Oh man.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.990
I wanted to access that
premium article about yaks,

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.360
but all I see is a dead yak.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.411
So I guess-- let's
manage payment methods

00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.285
and see what happens.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.140
OK, so I just followed
the deep link,

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.820
and now I'm in the
manage subscription

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.904
page for the Fabulous Yak app.

00:13:52.904 --> 00:13:54.820
And I can see that there's
an action required,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.640
so there's a problem
with my account

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.670
in that the awesome thing is
that there's also a CTA for me

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.150
to fix this problem.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.910
So let's go ahead
and fix that problem.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.400
So it looks like the old
credit card, which is actually

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.930
the credit card which we
wanted to update earlier,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.999
has been declined.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:14.040
So let's go ahead and
update that to the new one.

00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:20.740
Awesome.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.327
So now, it looks like the
subscription has been updated.

00:14:23.327 --> 00:14:25.660
Why don't we check whether
we can access the Yak premium

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.451
subscription again.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.430
Nice.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.096
The payment's been
fixed, and we're back

00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:35.390
to the premium experience.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.290
And that yak is so happy, he's
just over the moon with joy.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.198
Let's cut back to
the slides, please.

00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:44.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.650
Finally, I'm very, very
excited to announce

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.050
that we'll be launching a
survey to users for when

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.850
they cancel this subscription.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.360
This is a feature that many,
many of you have asked for,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.060
and you can access the survey
answers through our server side

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.590
API today.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.960
And eventually, you'll also
be able to see the answers

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.920
in console reporting.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.760
So we're still rolling out
the user facing changes,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.686
but because we've
already launched the API,

00:15:08.686 --> 00:15:10.060
if you query it
today, you'll see

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.860
a small percentage
of the answers

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.910
that users have already input.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.344
So let's get back to the
demo to see how this works.

00:15:18.344 --> 00:15:20.760
So Niko, let's go to the Play
Store and to Wendy's account

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.260
again.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.520
So Wendy is not only
a big fan of Yaks--

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.680
she also loves narwhals.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.380
But she's gotten kind of
tired of the narwhal monthly

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.340
newsletter, so let's just cancel
that subscription for her.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.930
So let's go into Narwhal,
and then it's really easy.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.180
We just tap Cancel Subscription.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.560
Now what we see
is a quick survey

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.750
for the user to give the
developer some feedback

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.760
as to why they're canceling.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.640
And there are already a
few pre-written answers,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.550
but Wendy has a
pretty specific reason

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.010
and can select Other
to type in that reason.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.330
So Niko, she told you what
that reason was, right?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.580
NIKO SCHROER: She did, indeed.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.595
She said, there are
not enough narwhals.

00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:14.260
ANGELA YING: I mean, I guess
they are an endangered species,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.120
so that makes sense.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.250
All right, let's finish
canceling that subscription.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:20.750
Cool.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.440
And the nice thing is even
if tomorrow, Wendy wakes up

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.930
and she's realized she's
made a huge mistake,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.630
she can actually go back
and restore her subscription

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.070
in the subscription center.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.349
So let's go ahead and
restore that subscription.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:39.750
Awesome.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.480
So now, Wendy can continue to
enjoy her narwhal subscription,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.100
even next month.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.350
And that's it for the demo.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.215
So let's go back to
the presentation.

00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:52.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.350
At Google, we've always believed
that if you focus on the user,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.180
all else will follow.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.300
Because of this new user first
experience to easily manage

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.180
subscriptions, users
will trust our store

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.852
and engage more with your apps.

00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:12.310
With the subscription
center, we'll

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.390
also be able to deliver
more capabilities

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.250
to you, the developer.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.650
The deep link and cancel
survey are just two examples

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.102
of these new abilities.

00:17:20.102 --> 00:17:22.310
So let's go back to Larry
and Niko, who will tell you

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.980
about the other new
developer features

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.920
that we're coming out with.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.127
LARRY YANG: Thanks, Angela.

00:17:29.127 --> 00:17:30.460
NIKO SCHROER: Thank you, Angela.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.640
Can we get a round of applause
for flawless demo execution?

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.510
So when I'm not busy
demoing things at IO-- so

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.410
to say in real life, I'm part
of the Google Play business

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.270
development team.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.760
The Google Play business
development team,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.550
on a daily basis, works directly
with subscription developers

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.150
of all kinds of backgrounds
around the world.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.090
Naturally, we hear a lot
of feedback and ideas

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.480
for features, which we
then take to our PM teams,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.440
such as Larry or Angela
to see how we can solve

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.490
these things we hear about.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.730
So one of the requests is
that you developers told us

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:19.040
you want more flexibility in
issuing refunds to your users.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.290
Currently, on the
server side API,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.990
you can only refund
the latest subscription

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.780
order using the purchase token.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.900
You cannot issue a refund
using the order ID,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.570
issue a refund for previous
subscription orders,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.010
or do partial refunds, and
that's really not ideal,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.037
when dealing with subscribers.

00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:42.120
LARRY YANG: Well, I have
great news for you, Niko,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.520
and for everyone here.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.840
We've now closed these gaps.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.970
We're extending the
server side API now

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.000
to support refunds
using order IDs.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.380
That means now, you can refund
a specific subscription renewal,

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.630
not just the latest one.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.050
And starting today, you can
also issue partial refunds.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.846
You can do that on
the Play Console.

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:04.470
You can actually go
over to our sandbox

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.840
afterwards and see a
demo of that in action.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.390
And this feature will also be
available on our server side

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.854
API next week.

00:19:10.854 --> 00:19:12.750
NIKO SCHROER: Cool.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.040
I'm sure that will make a lot
of developers really happy.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.670
Another request
we've heard a lot--

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.490
it's maybe the longest
standing feature

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.950
request that I personally
know of, is price changes.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.940
At the moment, you cannot
change the price of an SKU once

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.100
it's been created.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.440
Obviously, that is very
limiting for businesses,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.430
especially for businesses
whose costs have gone up.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.500
So currently, the only way to
do this is to create a new SKU

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.290
and get users to upgrade.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.150
That also means that
you, the developers,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.650
have to do all
the heavy lifting,

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.900
like messaging
users or canceling

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.040
users who don't upgrade.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.410
LARRY YANG: So
we've heard so much

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.140
about this feature from Niko
and other business development

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.830
partners that we figured the
easiest way to make them happy

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.150
was to just build the feature.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.620
So I'm pleased to announce we
now support mandatory price

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.580
changes on existing SKUs.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.580
All right.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.969
Yeah, see?

00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:20.010
NIKO SCHROER: I told you.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.400
LARRY YANG: You made
everyone happy now.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.890
So let's say you need
to roll out a price

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.690
change to all of your users.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.390
Maybe your cost of
content has gone up

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.580
or the tax structure
has changed in one

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.800
of the countries
you do business in.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.610
So now, all you need to do is
you go to the Play Console,

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.200
choose the country
or countries where

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.080
you need to change the
price, enter the new price,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.290
and click Save, and you're done.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.650
30 days before the
user's renewal date,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.870
we, Play, start sending
emails and push notifications

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.740
asking the user to agree
to that price change.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.890
We also give you, the developer,
a seven day head start,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.060
so you can also message
the user in app.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.970
If that renewal date
comes and the user has not

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.160
agreed to the price
change, we will take

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.490
care of canceling that user.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.190
This feature is currently
in early access.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.920
If you're interested in
trying it out and joining

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.817
our early access program,
please visit the link

00:21:21.817 --> 00:21:23.150
that you see on the screen here.

00:21:24.942 --> 00:21:27.150
NIKO SCHROER: I think it's
so awesome that we finally

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.340
let developers do that--

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.610
give you that flexibility to
actually grow your business.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.484
I'm sure developers will love
this addition of flexibility

00:21:36.484 --> 00:21:38.150
and building their
subscription business

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:43.140
on Play, which actually
brings me to another ask.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.510
I mentioned earlier
how much developers

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.000
love the subscription
reports, and that retention

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.770
is a key topic.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.780
So what we've heard quite a bit
is that you, developers, ask

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.670
for reports that provide
even more details,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.540
especially on the topics on
retention and cancellations.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.500
So Larry, I know we have
a lot to share here.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.610
You want to jump right in?

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.990
LARRY YANG: Yep.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.030
So we have a lot of great
news in this area, as well.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.010
So at IO last year, we announced
a brand new subscriptions

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.450
dashboard.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.240
A lot of developers have told
us that they love their reports,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.780
and many of our top developers
use those reports every day

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.420
to gain insights
onto their business.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.780
But you have all asked for
more capabilities, which

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.600
is why we've extended
two new capabilities

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.530
in our subscription reports.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.850
Let's take a quick
look at what those are.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.140
First, we're creating
a new retention report.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.800
Now, it's super easy to go in
and look at specific cohorts,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.050
say by SKU or dates
or by country.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.420
Now, you can also drill
into your free trial

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.310
conversion and other interesting
metrics in this report.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.320
And you can also
look specifically

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.950
at how many renewal periods
various users in the cohorts

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.390
have advanced through.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.880
After all, that's the name of
the game when you're running

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.960
a subscriptions business.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.420
So the second
change we're making

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.530
is we're making improvements
to the cancelation report.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.690
Here's where you will see the
data from the cancellation

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.920
survey that Angela and
Niko showed you earlier.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.720
And we'll also give you
details on how your win back

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.610
and your retention
features are performing,

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.680
such as account hold
and grace period.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.450
All in all, this feature
will be rolling out

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.939
over the next few
weeks, and it's

00:23:36.939 --> 00:23:38.480
going to help
subscription developers

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.610
like you understand and optimize
your entire user lifecycle.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.210
You can get more details on
our new reporting capabilities

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.110
in tomorrow's session on
analyzing and benchmarking over

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.891
on stage three at
9:30 tomorrow morning.

00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:55.890
NIKO SCHROER: OK, I know,
already, I said a lot,

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:56.834
but are you done now?

00:23:56.834 --> 00:23:58.500
I think we have more
things to announce.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.900
LARRY YANG: Wait, no,
I've got a few more things

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.880
I've just got to squeeze in.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.480
Our engineers have
done so much stuff.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.020
NIKO SCHROER: OK.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.060
LARRY YANG: Just give
me a few more seconds.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:04.280
NIKO SCHROER: You go.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.810
I sit down in the meantime.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.740
LARRY YANG: I wish
we had more time,

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.560
but they told us they're
going to just cut us off

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.410
at the end of this session.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.290
So just real quick
here, there's a couple

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.990
of other things with the world
I wanted to share with you all.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.830
You all have asked
for the ability

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.530
to do quicker renewals on
your test subscriptions,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.690
so we've now rolled
that capability out.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.840
For example, a monthly
test subscription

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.990
will now renew in
just five minutes.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.690
You also wanted the ability
to create an intro price

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.240
period that's different from
your regular recurrence period.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.200
So we've now rolled out that
capability, so you could say,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.200
for example, offer
$1.00 for 90 days,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.160
and then kick into $10 a
month on your subscription.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.410
And finally, we have
the capability for you

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.220
to offer an upgrade, but
keep the user's renewal date

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.310
and charge an incremental,
prorated price.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.950
This last feature is only
available with the Play billing

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.887
library, which you'll hear a
little bit more about later.

00:24:58.887 --> 00:25:00.470
ANGELA YING: All
right, thanks, Larry.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.886
I think my brain
hurts from trying

00:25:01.886 --> 00:25:04.170
to remember all those new
features he just covered.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.020
So let's just recap.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.660
We've launched 12 new features
in total, both for users

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.490
and for developers.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.760
On the user side, we've created
a better user experience

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.710
with the new
subscription center,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.920
including app discovery,
backup payment method,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.920
new deep linking,
and a cancel survey.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.850
For the developer, we're giving
you a ton more flexibility,

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.340
including improved
refunds, ability

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:34.330
to change SKU prices,
advanced reporting, and more.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.430
We've bolded the features
that are available now,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.174
so go check them out
as soon as you can.

00:25:40.174 --> 00:25:41.590
All of these other
features, we're

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.020
working on rolling out in
the next couple of weeks.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.540
So these are the
features that we've

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.020
been working on this
past year, but what

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.320
are we going to do next year
and the year after that?

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.080
Larry, do you want
to tell them more?

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.480
LARRY YANG: Yes.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.950
So these features we
just shared are things

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.020
you can use right now
to grow your business,

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.720
but we're not done.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.610
Our engineers are
hard at work coming up

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.270
with new features that will
help you acquire and retain

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.110
your subscribers.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.790
So for example, imagine if
your users could sign up

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.040
outside of your app,
say, from the Play Store

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.200
or from anywhere
else on the web.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.550
Or what if your users
could pay with cash?

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.190
Or what if we offered the option
for users to temporarily pause

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.370
their subscription, instead
of outright canceling them?

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.190
Or maybe we can help
you win back users

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.800
by getting them to reactivate
a subscription well

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.370
after the subscription
has expired.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.420
NIKO SCHROER: OK, but
wait a sec, Larry.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.950
As exciting as that
sounds, does it

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.540
mean that every
single time we launch

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.730
one of these new
features, our developers

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.774
have to rewrite all of the code?

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.690
LARRY YANG: I knew you
were going to ask that,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.310
so we've thought
a lot about this.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.190
So our goal is to
be able to build

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.775
all these features in such a way
so that you don't have to do--

00:26:59.775 --> 00:27:01.690
you do as little
work as possible.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:06.210
Our goal is to get as close as
possible to zero integration,

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.910
and we want that to happen
on both the client side,

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.524
with your app, as well as on
your server side integration.

00:27:12.524 --> 00:27:14.190
NIKO SCHROER: That
sounds great, but how

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.060
are you going to do that?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.110
LARRY YANG: All
right, just relax.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.650
I got this.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.210
All right, let me just--
give me a few minutes.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.460
I'll talk through how we're
going to make this happen,

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.930
all right?

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.210
So first, let's
talk about what you

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.060
need to do on your client side.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.080
So last fall at Play Time,
we announced version 1.0

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.450
of the Play billing library.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.580
The Play billing library
is an abstraction layer

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.560
on top of your AIDL file.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.990
API updates are picked
up automatically

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.060
when you update your
build dependency file,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.010
and the next time
you compile your app.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.950
So now, there is no more
searching reference code,

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.320
sample code, and
copying it and hoping

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.120
you got the right
version and all of that.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.680
It's all taken care
of automatically.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.090
Today, we're announcing
version 1.1 of the Play billing

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.350
library.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.790
This version
includes the feature

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.020
I mentioned earlier where
you can upgrade and keep

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.340
the expiration date, and
when we roll out the price

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.550
changes, that feature will also
only be available via the Play

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.160
billing library.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.720
Using the Play billing
library is very, very simple.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.990
There's just three easy steps.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.810
Now, since no IO presentation
is complete without showing

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.960
some code, I'm going to go and
show a few of the code examples

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.190
for this.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.174
Now, you're probably
thinking, oh no, we're

00:28:25.174 --> 00:28:26.340
near the end of the session.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.210
Now you're going to
show me a bunch of code.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.040
Don't worry.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.960
The whole point of
showing you this code

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.060
is to show you just
really how little code

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.120
it takes to use the
building library.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.820
So first, all you need to
do is add this one line

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.510
to your build.gradle
dependency file.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.090
Second, you need to, of course,
create the billing client

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.370
instance.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.770
And to do that,
setup the listener

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.660
and connected to Google Play.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.820
Of course, don't forget to build
your own retry policy, in case

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.270
your client loses a connection.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.920
And the third and final
step is, of course,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.540
to call the proper method as
you go through your purchase

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.980
lifecycle, just
like you do today.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.660
That's it.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.990
NIKO SCHROER: OK, I'm convinced.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.320
It's so straightforward
that even I get it.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.560
And it's actually very
close to zero integration,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.350
but still, it's
late afternoon and I

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.340
think we've had enough
slides with code.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.290
At the end of the day,
what really matters

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.510
is how developers
actually like it,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.960
and my favorite quote
here comes from Joe Birch.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.560
He's an Android
Eng lead at Buffer,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.950
and he's also a Google
Developer expert

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.640
who called the
Google Play billing

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.240
library a dream come true.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.180
And we're making this dream
come true for thousands

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.030
of developers today, already.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.970
So if you, like me, did
not memorize the code

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.130
on those slides,
note down this link

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.740
here on this slide
to learn more.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.770
LARRY YANG: So remember, with
the Play billing library,

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.530
integration is much, much
simpler-- just a lot less code

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.850
to manage.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.610
New features rolling
out in the future

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.330
will only be available using
the Play billing library.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.570
Currently, it's only available
for Java and Kotlin developers,

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:23.040
but a C++ version
is coming soon.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.450
OK, so that's what you need
to do on your client side.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.640
Now, here's what you need
to do on your server side.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.420
Earlier, we talked about real
time developer notifications.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.850
Let me go through a little
bit of detail on what it is

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.450
and how you can use
it today, and then

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.010
how it will prepare
you for the future.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.310
So with real time
developer notifications,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.120
you set up a Google Cloud
Pub/Sub integration,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.620
and we send you
real time messages

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.770
whenever important events happen
with your users' subscription.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.490
So for example, when you
have a new user that signs up

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.650
or an existing user that renews,
we'll send you a message,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.510
and you now know
you need to continue

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.230
or you need to grant
a new entitlement

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:07.150
or continue to grant an
entitlement to that user.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.810
If today, you've integrated
and implemented account hold--

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.570
and by the way, in case you
weren't looking in that video,

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.600
you really, really should
integrate with account hold.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.050
We now send you a real
time developer notification

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.140
when the user has a payment
issue and goes on hold

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.390
or when the user recovers
from their payment issue

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.280
and they come off hold.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.500
So now, immediately,
you will know

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.070
when to withhold entitlement
or to grant back entitlement

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.720
to that user.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720
This is super important
if you have a service that

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.220
operates cross-platform.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.800
Say you have users who
sign up on Android,

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.990
but might consume on Web
or other mobile platforms.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.760
Real time developer
notifications

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.700
also tell you about
voluntary cancellation, where

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.890
the user chooses to cancel.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.770
In this situation, when
you get that message,

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.960
right away, you should start
trying to win back that user.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.504
Maybe remind the user about some
new content that's coming up

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:05.920
or tell them about some features
that you notice that they

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.050
haven't used in your app.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.050
And using the deep link that
Angela told you about earlier,

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:14.200
you then drive the user back
to the subscription center,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.330
where they click on
the Restore button.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:20.632
And with one tap, they become
an active subscriber again.

00:32:20.632 --> 00:32:22.090
So these are some
of the things you

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.910
can do today, right now,
with real time developer

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.250
notifications.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.110
But in the future,
if you integrate now,

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.997
you'll be ready for
some of the new things

00:32:30.997 --> 00:32:32.080
that we'll be rolling out.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.166
Like say a user temporarily
pauses their subscription.

00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:37.790
We'll send you a
developer notification

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.610
so you'll know that's happened.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.670
Or if we got a user to
reactivate their subscription

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.250
after it's expired, you'll
get a real time developer

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.420
notification, and you now know
to grant entitlement back.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.060
But remember, with real time
developer notifications,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.640
the notification's only
telling you that a subscription

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.300
state has changed.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.760
You still need to call
our server side API

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.430
and query the full state
of the subscription,

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.250
and know exactly
what you need to do--

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.027
exactly what action you need
to take with that subscriber.

00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:11.770
NIKO SCHROER: So as
I mentioned earlier,

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.380
real time developer
notification has

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.490
become an essential part of
our top developer subscription

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.320
setup.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.870
Check out the details on how
to set up real time developer

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.670
notifications on
this link, which

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.730
takes you to the developer
pages and has all the details.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.640
LARRY YANG: So
remember, if you want

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.620
to future proof
your integration,

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.950
be sure to use both the Play
billing library on your client

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:38.250
side, and integrate with real
time developer notifications

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.060
on the server side.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.090
All right.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:42.600
Phew.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.800
That was a lot of stuff.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.271
So give us a couple
of minutes here

00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:46.770
and we're just going
to, real quick,

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:52.020
recap all the stuff that we
introduced and told you about.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.099
NIKO SCHROER: So we
started off with talking

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:55.890
about how much you guys
love subscriptions,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.700
thanks to the great
work you have done.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.690
Thanks to the great products
and subscription services

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.510
you have launched
and you're operating.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.240
ANGELA YING: We've shared with
you 12 new features, including

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.114
many features built around
the new subscription center.

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:11.530
LARRY YANG: And
finally, we talked

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.840
about how you can use
the Play billing library

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.330
and integrate with real
time developer notifications

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.590
so that you're ready as
we roll out new features.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.340
NIKO SCHROER: Yeah,
and because obviously,

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.780
this is only day one of IO, so
there are more great sessions

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.370
that you should
definitely check out.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.280
Two we want to recommend to
you are the 6:00 PM session

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.020
on games today,
which will also talk

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.120
about subscriptions and games.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.420
And then tomorrow at 9:30,
you can learn much more

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.822
about all the great reports
we only touched on today.

00:34:40.822 --> 00:34:42.280
ANGELA YING: You
can also check out

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.840
demos of a lot of
the features we've

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.820
announced in the sandbox,
which is over there.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.730
And we also have an
office hour specifically

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.465
for Google Play subscriptions
tomorrow at 2:30 PM.

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:55.090
LARRY YANG: If you
have more questions,

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.390
join us over at the Android and
Play conversations area right

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.360
after this session.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.610
I think it's just on the
other side of the wooden deck

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.600
to your right, as you walk out.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.300
And lastly, we would love
to get your feedback.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.921
After all, how is Niko going
to get better at his jokes

00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:11.170
if we don't give him feedback?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.380
OK.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.350
That's it, everyone.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.290
Thank you very much, and
enjoy the rest of your IO.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.290
NIKO SCHROER: Thank you.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.830
