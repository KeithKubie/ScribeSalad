00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.320
So we're asked to
solve for x, and we

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.060
have this equation with
absolute values in it.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.750
So it's 4 times
the absolute value

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.580
of x plus 10 plus 4 is equal to
6 times the absolute value of x

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.382
plus 10 plus 10.

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:16.090
And at first, this
looks really daunting,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.680
but the key is to just solve for
this absolute value expression

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.039
and then go from there.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.080
Let me just rewrite it so
that the absolute value

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.860
expression really jumps out.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.240
So this is 4 times
the absolute value

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.450
of x plus 10 plus 4 is equal to
6 times the absolute value of x

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.500
plus 10 plus 10.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.580
So let's get all of the
absolute values of x plus 10

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.620
on the left-hand side.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.100
So I want to get
rid of the 6 times

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.340
the absolute value of
x plus 10 on the right.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.720
Well, how would I do that?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.360
Well, I could subtract 6 times
the absolute value of x plus 10

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.150
from the right,
but we've already

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.295
seen this multiple times.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.920
If these two things
are equal, and if I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.601
want to keep them
equal, if I subtract 6

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.600
from the right-hand side,
I've got to subtract--

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.222
or if I subtract 6 times the
absolute value of x plus 10

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:12.680
from the right-hand side, I
have to subtract the same thing

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.310
from the left-hand side.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.230
So we're going to
have minus 6 times

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.190
the absolute value of x plus 10.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.385
And likewise, I want to
get all my constant terms,

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:26.230
I want to get this 4 out
of the left-hand side.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.340
So let me subtract
4 from the left,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090
and then I have to also
do it on the right,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.980
otherwise my equality
wouldn't hold.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.310
And now let's see
what we end up with.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.680
So on the left-hand side,
the 4 minus 4, that's 0.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.099
You have 4 of something
minus 6 of something,

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.140
that means you're going
to end up with negative 2

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.700
of that something.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.405
Negative 2 of the absolute
value of x plus 10.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.280
Remember, this might
seem a little confusing,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850
but remember, if
you had 4 apples

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.860
and you subtract 6 apples, you
now have negative 2 apples,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590
I guess you owe
someone the apples.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.280
Same way, you have 4
of this expression,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.080
you take away 6 of
this expression,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.230
you now have negative
2 of this expression.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.730
Let me write it a
little bit neater.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.710
So it's negative 2 times the
absolute value of x plus 10

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.620
is equal to, well the whole
point of this, of the 6 times

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.010
the absolute value of
x plus 10 minus 6 times

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.690
the absolute value of x plus
10 is to make those cancel out,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.610
and then you have 10 minus
4, which is equal to 6.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.320
Now, we want to solve for the
absolute value of x plus 10.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.820
So let's get rid
of this negative 2,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.420
and we can do that by dividing
both sides by negative 2.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.670
You might realize,
everything we've done so far

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.782
is just treating
this red expression

00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:44.490
as almost just like
a variable, and we're

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.073
going to solve for
that red expression

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:47.950
and then take it from there.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.250
So negative 2 divided
by negative 2 is 1.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.490
6 divided by negative
2 is negative 3.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.660
So we get the absolute
value of x plus 10

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.980
is equal to negative 3.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.930
Now, this gets us to a
very interesting situation.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.180
You might say maybe this
could be the positive version

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.060
or the negative, but
remember, absolute value

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.660
is always non-negative.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.906
If you took the absolute
value of 0, you would get 0.

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.530
But the absolute
value of anything else

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.850
is going to be positive.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.760
So this thing right
over here is definitely

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.900
going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.625
Doesn't matter what
x you put in there,

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.000
when you take its
absolute value,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.416
you're going to
get a value that's

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:31.990
greater than or equal to 0.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.600
So there's no x that you
could find that's somehow--

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.010
you put it there, you add 10,
you take the absolute value

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.450
of it, you're actually
getting a negative value.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.640
So this right over here
has absolutely no solution.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.910
And I'll put some exclamation
marks there for emphasis.
