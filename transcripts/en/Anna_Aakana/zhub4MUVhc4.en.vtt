00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.700
Tim!  Write this down!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.640
Use your phone!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.840
*traditional wedding theme song*

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.920
Hey guys!  Right before we get into the video I want to say congrats

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.720
to the Mac Air winner!  Ahh!

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.320
If this isn't you, don't worry.  I have more stuff to give away.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.240
And the only rule to enter is to be subscribed.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600
Now, I am of the age where a lot of my friends

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.380
are getting married and having kids

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.180
because they bugged their partners to get married and have kids.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.060
Some of my friends are pretty subtle.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.980
What!?

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.040
Then I have friends who are much more direct.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.720
Baby, I just got my first tattoo!  Do you want to see?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.800
Okay.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.160
Tada!

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.160
Babe, are you kidding?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.500
That's crazy because I just got my first tattoo!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.100
Oh my God!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.340
*gasps*

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.880
Oh, I love it!

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.100
Yay!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
Some of my friends have given their partners ultimatums.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.700
It's marriage or death!

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.500
Bring it on!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.360
Ahhhh!

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.320
Some can do this nonverbally.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.540
*dramatic music plays*

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.200
And I have some friends who like don't even drop hints.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.600
They drop bombs.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.480
Walkin' down the aisle.  Ear to ear smile.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.500
Ring on my finger license ready to file.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.500
Tax incentive.  House in Venice.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.700
Come on baby be my husband I'm attentive!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.080
Uh!  You can be my wifey.  I can tell by the way that you smell you like me.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.760
Goin' off the top just like a toupee.  Invite all your friends and throw a bouquet yeah!

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.560
Uh!

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.600
We can start a collection of babies right after the wedding reception.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.620
Uh!  Yeah!  Anna if you listen, I go to your dad and I'll get his permission like ay!

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.680
Can I marry Akana?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.700
Maybe!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Then, I'm a give her my banana.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.020
But we won't split.  Stay together and we won't quit.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.540
Till death!

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.000
Do us part!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.700
Straight.  From the heart!

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.540
Marriage!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.120
I do!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.300
Me too!

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.720
Oh!

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.880
Personally, I've done this like probably in every relationship I've ever been in

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.760
I've dropped hints and have been like "Hey!  Marry me.  Put a ring on it!"

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.740
But even then I feel like it's so crazy.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.600
I mean I'm actually really happy that I don't really have the power to propose.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.860
I mean I could.  It's a feminist world--I could.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.840
But I don't want that.  I want someone else to do that for me.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.960
Because if it were up to me, I probably would have been married like 4 times already.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.200
Just cause I'm in love with the idea of getting married

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.720
probably more than I was in love with the actual person

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.460
I wanted to get married to.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.060
So I don't know.  I've kind of like come to a place

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.580
where I'm very content with like just "go with the flow"

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.920
there's no rush.  I don't have to do anything.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.560
I mean I still drop hints because it's fun.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.780
It's really fun to do that.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.320
But for the actual marriage I don't know yet.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.320
I'm still touring.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.140
Oh!  And thank you so much to Tim for being a part of today's video.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.080
Don't forget to check out his channel.  He's a very funny guy and I appreciate him doing all this for me.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.880
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640
Ow!  Beetle!  (her kitten)

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.820
Beetle makes me not want to have children.
