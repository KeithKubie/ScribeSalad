00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.010
Problem 92.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.810
In a certain furniture store,
each week Nancy earns a salary

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.840
of $240, plus 5% of the amount
of total sales that exceeds

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.590
$800 for the week.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.990
Plus 5% of whatever is greater
than 800 for the week.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.480
If Nancy earned a total of $450
in a week, what were her

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.210
total sales that week?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
So she earns $450, so what
was her 5% bonus part?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.800
So 450 minus 240, she
got $210 bonus.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.440
So 210 represents 5% of
her sales above 800.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.160
210 is 5% of what number?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.626
So you could say 210 is equal to
0.05 times x, and x will be

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:56.850
her sales above 800.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.530
So x is equal to 210 divided
by 0.05, so 0.05 goes into

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.380
210, add some decimal points.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.790
That's the same thing as 5 going
into, put the decimal

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.100
point there, 21,000.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.570
So 5 goes into 21 4 times, 4
times 5 is 20, bring down 1.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830
5 goes into 10 2 times,
2 times 5 is 10.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.010
We're done.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.790
So her sales were 4,200, but
that's not her total sales.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.130
Remember, she only gets 5%
on her sales above 800.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.170
So she sold $4,200 more
than $800 that week.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.640
So her total sales are going
to be 4,200 plus

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640
800, which is $5,000.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.670
And that's choice E.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.180
Next question, 93.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.420
They give us two lists.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.580
So that's list one, and they
give it 3, 6, 8, and 19, and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.860
they give us list two, they say
it's x, 3, 6, 8, and 19.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.720
It's actually the same list,
except they have an x here.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.830
If the median of the numbers in
list one above is equal to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.340
the median of the numbers in
list two above, what is the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.260
value of x?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.320
So what's the median
of this list?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.350
Since we have an even number of
numbers, this would be the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.810
average of the middle two
numbers, so what's the middle

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.440
two numbers right here?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.470
The middle two numbers are 6 and
8, the average is 6 plus 8

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.620
divided by 2, it's 7.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.870
So the median is 7.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.250
So they're telling us that the
median of this list is also

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.750
equal to 7, so where can
I put x so that the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.070
median doesn't change.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.640
Well what if x is 7?

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.140
If x is 7, then this list
becomes 3, 6, 7, 8, 19, and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.940
now the middle number, since
we have odd numbers, is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.690
actually the middle number.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.530
We don't have to do any of
this averaging business.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.740
So now the median is actually
7, if we place 7 there.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.110
So x equals 7.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.320
Choice B.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.140
94.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.960
In a certain city, 60% of the
registered voters are

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.406
Democrat, and the rest
are Republican.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.320
So 40% of voters.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.990
In a mayoral race, if 75% of the
registered voters who are

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.960
Democrats, and 20% of the
registered voters who are

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.480
Republicans are expected to
vote for candidate A, what

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.520
percentage of the registered
voters are expected to vote

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.290
for candidate A?

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.740
In a mayoral race, if 75% of
Democrats, so 0.75 Democrats

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.290
are voting for candidate A,
and 20% of Republicans, so

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.290
plus 0.2 times the Republicans,
are expected to

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.350
vote for candidate A, what
percent of the voters are

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.290
voting for candidate A?

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.030
So let's just express this in
terms of the total voters.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.720
The Democrats are 60% of the
voters, Republicans are 40%

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.220
of, not the Republicans,
of the voters.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.800
So 0.75 times the Democrats, the
Democrats are 60% of the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.900
voters, so let's just
substitute.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.890
0.6 voters for D, so we get
0.75 times 0.6 of all the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.370
voters, that's the number of
Democrats there are, plus 0.2

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.750
times the Republicans,
Republicans are 0.4 times all

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.580
the voters.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.280
And so let's see, what's
75 times 6?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.930
Let me just do the whole
decimals, 0.75 times 0.6.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.480
6 times 5 is 30.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.580
6 times 7 is 42 plus 3 is 45.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.970
And we have one, two, three
numbers behind the decimal

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.860
point, so it's 0.45 of the
voters plus, let's see, 2

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.350
times 4 is 8, and we have two
numbers behind the decimal, so

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.410
it's plus 0.08 times
the voters.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.230
0.45 plus 0.08 that's 0.53.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.980
You have 45 plus 8, is 0.53, or
53% of the voters are going

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.760
to vote for candidate
A, that's choice B.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.640
Problem 95.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.120
A certain company retirement
plan has a rule of 70

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.010
provision that allows an
employee to retire when the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:49.770
employee's age plus years of
employment within the company

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.210
total at least 70.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.280
So greater than or
equal to 70.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.770
In what year could a female
employee hired in 1986, this

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.830
is interesting, 1986, on her
32nd birthday, first be

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.665
eligible to retire under
this provision?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.640
So let's say that y is
equal to the year.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:32.780
Her age is going to be the
year minus 1986 plus 32.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.240
That's her age, because she
starts at 32, so if the year's

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.420
1986, we're just going
to get her age as 32.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.960
If the year's 1987, we're going
to get 1987 minus 1986,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.810
which is 1 year, plus 32,
her age will be 33.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.060
So that's her age.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.740
Her years of employment
are going to be

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.000
the years minus 1986.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.590
So a plus e is going to be equal
of this, and so that is

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.430
equal to what?

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:20.510
2y minus 2 times 1986 plus 32
have to be greater than or

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.580
equal to 70.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.480
Just so I don't have to multiply
2 times 1986, let's

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.690
divide both sides of this
equation by 2, and I don't

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.700
have to change the inequality,
because that's positive.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.870
So I get y minus 1986
plus 32 is greater

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.360
than or equal to 70.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.070
So y is greater than or equal to
70, let me add 1986 to both

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:54.530
sides, plus 1986, minus 32.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.500
So what's 1986 minus 32?

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:06.230
That's 1954, 8 minus 3
is 5, 6 minus 2 is 4.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.390
What's 70 plus 1954?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:20.810
Plus 70, is 4, 5 plus 7 is 12,
1 plus 9 is 10, so 2024 is an

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.770
acceptable year for her.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.350
2024.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.480
And that is not one of
the choices, so I

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.340
clearly made a mistake.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.330
Let me see where I might
have made a mistake.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
So a certain employee retirement
has a rule of 70

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.289
provision that allows an
employee to retire when the

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.470
employee's age, age plus years
of employment within the

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.930
company total at least 70.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.680
In what year could a female
employee, the fact that she's

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.710
female shouldn't matter, a
female employee hired in 1986

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.500
on her 32nd birthday,
first be eligible to

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.050
retire under this provision?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:07.030
OK, her age is going to be the
year, whatever year we're

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.070
talking about, minus
1986 plus 32.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.610
And then her years of employment
are going to be

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:21.590
whatever year we're talking
about minus 1986, fair enough.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.500
So I have a year plus year, and
I have two subtractions of

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.180
my 1986 plus 32 is greater
than or equal to 70.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.200
I divide both sides by 30--
oh, I see my mistake.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.090
Here, this stuff right here,
where I divided both sides by

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.880
2, I divided only the
left side by 2.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.310
That by 2, that by 2-- oh,
I didn't even do that.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.690
2 times 1986 divided by 2 is
1986, 32 divided by 2 is 16,

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.610
70 divided by 2 is 35.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.740
OK, so let me rewrite it here.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.510
That's what happens when you
try to do too much at once.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:08.400
So I have y is greater than or
equal to 35 plus 1986 minus

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.170
16, I just added 1986 to
both sides, subtracted

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.100
16 from both sides.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:23.230
So this is equal to 1970, and
then we have 35 plus 1970, so

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:30.240
y has to be greater than
or equal to 2005,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.230
which is choice C.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.050
And I'm out of time, sorry for
that careless error, and I'll

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.120
see you in the next video.
