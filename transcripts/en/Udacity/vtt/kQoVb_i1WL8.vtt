00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.460
So, let me start by recapping some of the operations that

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
we can perform on local repositories. I'm just going to list them

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
here and go through them by separating them into three main

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.930
categories. The first one is commands that, to create a repository and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.470
notice that not all of these are git commands, that for

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.710
example, to create the repository, we would normally want to. Create a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.560
directory, which is exactly what we did in our demo. We want

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.310
to go to that directory and then execute the git init statement,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.110
which initializes that directory as a git repository. The second

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.530
category includes commands that we'll use to modify the content of

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.280
the repository. We saw that we can use git add

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.190
to add a specific file or a complete directory to our

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.650
index. So to the list of files that will be

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.510
committed, that will be considered in the next commit. Then we

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.620
can use commit to actually commit the changes that we

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.374
made to those files to our local repository, and we can

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:54.030
also use git move and git rm or git remove

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.420
to move files around and to remove files. Finally, the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.270
third category is the category of commands that we can

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.950
use to inspect the concrete repository. And this set includes git

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.960
log, that we can use to see the log of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.970
the repository, git status, that can give us important information

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.810
about the status of the file center repository. Git diff,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.500
that we can use to see the differences between for example,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.160
our local files. And the remote files. And finally git

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.270
show, that will show us information about our last commit. What

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.940
we committed, what were the changes and so on. And again,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.290
we saw most or all of these commands in our demo.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.920
So let me also remind you of a possible workflow. Which

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.350
again, we already saw but it's always good to go through

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.670
it once more. And remember that this is just an example.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.520
It's just a possible workflow. You can do many different things,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.210
you can have many different workflows with git. This is just

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.980
up to illustrate some of the things that you can do. So,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.430
you might do some local editing. Execute git status to see what

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.020
files you changed. Then you might run a git diff on the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.230
files to see what are these changes. And then you can run

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.460
git commit -a to commit your changes. And in case you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.520
want to specify the commit message right away without having to go

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.040
through an editor, you can also add the -m parameter and

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.110
specify the message here on the same line.
