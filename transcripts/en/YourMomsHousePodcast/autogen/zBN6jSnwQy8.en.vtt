did he said we're gonna put it on the
 

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.700
did he said we're gonna put it on the
ballot again and guess what it passed

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:24.710
ballot again and guess what it passed
 

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.920

the second time Cowen's I know it is a

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:26.930
the second time Cowen's I know it is a
 

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.480
the second time Cowen's I know it is a
really coincidental it's very

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.490
really coincidental it's very
 

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:33.400
really coincidental it's very
coincidental yeah where were you leading

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:33.410
coincidental yeah where were you leading
 

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.620
coincidental yeah where were you leading
to before and I really I don't know what

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:35.630
to before and I really I don't know what
 

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.370
to before and I really I don't know what
were there - I was gonna say oh well he

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.380
were there - I was gonna say oh well he
 

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.560
were there - I was gonna say oh well he
probably falls into this category and

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:41.570
probably falls into this category and
 

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:46.390
probably falls into this category and
that is that we we've always kind of

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400
that is that we we've always kind of
 

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.830
that is that we we've always kind of
been fascinated by you know people of

what the this the book is written by a
 

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:32.980
what the this the book is written by a
very accomplished psychologist a woman I

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:32.990
very accomplished psychologist a woman I
 

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.040
very accomplished psychologist a woman I
can remember her name but essentially

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.050

like most of us do you we can't

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:49.880
like most of us do you we can't
 

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.690
like most of us do you we can't
comprehend it like it's it's never ever

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:52.700
comprehend it like it's it's never ever
 

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.520
comprehend it like it's it's never ever
ever feeling badly or empathy they lack

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:57.530
ever feeling badly or empathy they lack
 

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.310
ever feeling badly or empathy they lack
empathy but the main thing is that you

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:00.320
empathy but the main thing is that you
 

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.410
empathy but the main thing is that you
have no conscience whatsoever you and

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:02.420
have no conscience whatsoever you and
 

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.780

now sociopaths differ from Psychopaths

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:04.790
now sociopaths differ from Psychopaths
 

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.030
now sociopaths differ from Psychopaths
because sociopaths can learn to mimic

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040
because sociopaths can learn to mimic
 

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.480
because sociopaths can learn to mimic
like the behavior of somebody like they

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:13.490
like the behavior of somebody like they
 

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.300
like the behavior of somebody like they
they go oh like people with a conscience

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:16.310
they go oh like people with a conscience
 

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.910
they go oh like people with a conscience
go oh I feel really badly about that you

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920
go oh I feel really badly about that you
 

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.590
go oh I feel really badly about that you
know and they they see that that's what

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:20.600
know and they they see that that's what
 

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.120
know and they they see that that's what
people do so they learn to mimic that

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.130
people do so they learn to mimic that
 

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:29.680
people do so they learn to mimic that
you can be tricked more much more easily

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:29.690
you can be tricked more much more easily
 

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.930
you can be tricked more much more easily
by a sociopath and a psychopath a

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:31.940
by a sociopath and a psychopath a
 

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.320
by a sociopath and a psychopath a
psychopath doesn't have that ability

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:35.330
psychopath doesn't have that ability
 

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.720
psychopath doesn't have that ability
they don't learn to read that stuff and

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:37.730
they don't learn to read that stuff and
 

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:42.340
they don't learn to read that stuff and
they just well also I think sociopaths

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.350
they just well also I think sociopaths
 

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.470
they just well also I think sociopaths
what they have in common with people

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480
what they have in common with people
 

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.080
what they have in common with people
with like Asperger's is that they can

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.090
with like Asperger's is that they can
 

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.200
with like Asperger's is that they can
read and mimic emotional cues like I

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.210
read and mimic emotional cues like I
 

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.510

once talked to a guy with Asperger's and

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520
once talked to a guy with Asperger's and
 

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.950
once talked to a guy with Asperger's and
I was like you don't seem like you have

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960
I was like you don't seem like you have
 

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.599
I was like you don't seem like you have
it and he's like yes because I've

00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:55.609
it and he's like yes because I've
 

00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:58.090
it and he's like yes because I've
learned to read the human face and I've

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:58.100
learned to read the human face and I've
 

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.820
learned to read the human face and I've
learned what an emotional response looks

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:00.830
learned what an emotional response looks
 

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.340
learned what an emotional response looks
and sounds like which is really right

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:03.350
and sounds like which is really right
 

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.340
and sounds like which is really right
and that's what sociopaths and and the

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:06.350
and that's what sociopaths and and the
 

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.800
and that's what sociopaths and and the
other thing that the - two of the more

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:08.810

are that a how common it is and how
 

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:17.250
are that a how common it is and how
and hell how little it's discussed it's

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:17.260
and hell how little it's discussed it's
 

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.080
and hell how little it's discussed it's
so common that it's basically 1 in 25

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.090
so common that it's basically 1 in 25
 

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:27.410
so common that it's basically 1 in 25
people and that is a higher

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420
people and that is a higher
 

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.280
people and that is a higher
statistically higher than eating

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:29.290
statistically higher than eating
 

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.350

question I think that over time they

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:50.970
question I think that over time they
 

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.760
question I think that over time they
recognize that everybody around them is

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:53.770

the thing yeah oh the other thing one of
 

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.530
the thing yeah oh the other thing one of
the great misconceptions and this is

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:28.540
the great misconceptions and this is
 

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.550
the great misconceptions and this is
actually something I've always wondered

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:29.560
