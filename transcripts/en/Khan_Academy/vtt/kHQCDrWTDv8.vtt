00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.240
Which is less-- the unit rate
of the equation y equals 6.5x

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.642
or the unit rate of
the graph shown below?

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.350
So when they're talking
about unit rate--

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.391
and they're actually a
little bit ambiguous here.

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:13.500
They should have been
clearer in this question.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.640
I'm assuming they're
asking us about the unit

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.400
rate at which y changes
with respect to x.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.680
Or how much does y
change for a change of 1

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.640
in x, the unit rate.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.300
And over here, you
see when x changes 1,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.940
y is going to change by 6.5.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.620
Every time x increases by 1,
y is going to increase by 6.5.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.050
Or you could say the unit rate
of change of y with respect

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.440
to x is 6.5 for
every 1 change in x.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.750
In this graph right over
here, as x changes 1,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.340
as x increases 1, y increases it
looks like by about 3 and 1/2.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.590
x increases by 1, y
increases by 3 and 1/2.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.300
So the unit rate
of change here of y

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:04.400
with respect to x is 3 and 1/2
for every unit increase in x.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.950
So this line is increasing at a
slower rate than this equation.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.260
Or y in this line is increasing
at a slower rate with respect

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.750
to x than y is increasing with
respect to x in this equation

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.910
right over here.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.390
So the unit rate of
the graph is less

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.580
than the unit rate
of the equation.
