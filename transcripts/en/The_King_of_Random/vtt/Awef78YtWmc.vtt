00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.540
A paper plate speaker for less than a dollar
really is too good to be true, if you're trying

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.810
to make it with aluminum foil and a penny.
There's a better way to do it, so in this

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.010
project, we're going to figure out exactly
how to get this plate to make some noise.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.829
The idea of making a speaker out of a paper
plate is intriguing, and to do it for under

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.350
a buck is even better. But first, we have
to understand how a speaker works. I've still

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.039
got these 8 Ohm speakers from a TV I salvaged
in a previous video, and I'll sacrifice this

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.640
one in the name of discovery. I'll use a utility
knife to cut the cone away from the surround,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.359
exposing the basket, as well as this yellow
diaphragm known as a spider. I'll cut through

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.460
that and snip these 2 wires, and am impressed
at how simple a speaker really is. The bottom

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.450
of the basket is attached to a strong ceramic
magnet, with a hole just big enough to allow

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.520
this voice coil to vibrate in. Ok we've got
the basics, now let's see if we can make one.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.310
We can use a foam bowl for the basket, an
8.5" paper plate for the speaker cone, 6 button

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.200
magnets, and a piece of printer paper to form
the voice coil. This brings our pro-rated

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.270
cost to about $0.80 for this soon to be speaker.
But what about insulated copper wire? That

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.490
can be expensive, and where do we get it?
Well, almost anything electronic will have

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.170
some, you just have to know where to look.
I know there's some inside this old TV, but

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.670
I don't have a sledge hammer to bust it open,
so I'm gonna have to get creative.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.740
Ok, I'm down to the circuit boards, and there's
the piece I'm after. A small audio transformer.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.540
These things are packed tight with the perfect
wire for this project. I'll use my pipe wrench

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.540
pliers to rip that off the board, then use
my bench vise to crack the ceramic casing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.990
off. I'll peel off the insulating tape, and
voila, we've got ourselves a nice roll of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.280
insulated copper wire .. for free! Ok, we're
ready to start building, so let's make the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.640
voice coil first. Start by cutting a few strips
of paper and rolling them around the stack

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.970
of magnets. Once we have a couple layers taped
in place we can use a hot glue stick to help

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.340
unravel some wire. I'll wrap the wire about
50 times and then use some hot glue to keep

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.620
it in place. When that's cooled, we can pull
the magnets and the inside layers of paper

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.200
out, leaving just this shell. The voice coil
is done, but it's too long, so let's snip

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.590
it to size, and then hot glue it to the bottom
side of the paper plate. While that's drying

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.310
we can cut some holes in the sides of the
bowl, to make it look more like a proper speaker

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.810
basket. The next step is to hot glue our magnet
stack to the bottom, and slide the coil over

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.350
top to see how it fits. It moves freely because
of the gap we made earlier, and it's looking

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.340
good, so now we can hot glue the plate to
the bowl and hit it with a little spray paint

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.840
for aesthetics. When the paint dries, there's
only 1 thing left to do, and that's remove

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.880
the coating from the ends of the wires, so
I'll do that with a lighter. Ok, It's ready

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.960
for a test, so I'm hooking it up to my TV
with some alligator clips, to see what happens.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.540
Well there you go, our 80 cent speaker is
working, and if "..a paper plate speaker for

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.100
less than a dollar really is â€¦ too good
to be true.", then we can call this part of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.510
the myth UN-BUSTED. But it's not very loud.
The magnets are cheap and weak, so let's try

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.910
something stronger. I've got a super strong
1" N48 Neodymium magnet I just got in the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.260
mail. We can roll that up, and add some 26
gauge wire that came out of a sump pump motor,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.640
and hot glue to secure it. The magnet and
inner layers come out, and the paper gets

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.849
trimmed to size. Hot glue that to the plate,
and glue the lead wires right about here.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.599
This time let's use another plate as our base,
and these markings are for some supports we'll

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.319
need to build. Those can be made out of a
3rd plate, just by trimming out the bottom

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.490
into a rectangle, folding them accordion style,
and cutting into 2 pieces. I'm gluing them

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.490
to our base plate with the feet facing inward,
and these will act as a type of shock absorber

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.780
for the speaker plate. Now we can add some
glue to the tops, and join them to the plate

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.550
making sure the coil is overtop the magnet.
A quick manual test, and it seems the suspension

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.319
on this is perfect. I'll burn the coating
off the tips of the wires, and now it's time

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.880
to test this one out. I'm disconnecting the
external speakers from my TV, and using these

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.940
alligator clips to connect the leads to our
plate. I'm anxious to see how the paper plate

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.920
does with the stronger magnet. 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.699
That's pretty
impressive. It's amazing to think that all

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.150
that sound is coming from this flimsy little
plate, but it is. Just for fun, I'm gonna

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.970
pour in some water to see what happens.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.920
And, that's probably the coolest thing I've seen

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.909
all day. Well that was a fun project. We UN-BUSTED
a myth, and made a huge mess in the living

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.529
room. That's it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
