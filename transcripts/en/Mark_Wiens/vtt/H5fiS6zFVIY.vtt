00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.500
- Welcome to Pakistan Chowk.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.500
This is a busy, busy kinda
energetful, ultimately,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.980
energetic market in Karachi, Pakistan,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.110
and we are here to eat what
is one of the ultimate,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.360
one of the most beloved Karachi,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.050
Pakistani street food snacks.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.121
It's called a bun kebab.

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.871
(rhythmic music)

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:26.947
(traffic sounds)

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:29.480
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.260
Very good, thank you.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.930
Welcome to the iconic Karachi bun kabab.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170
- Yeah, finally.
- This is our last bite

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.950
together on this Pakistan
food trip of a lifetime.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.460
- This is so iconic that it
should have been the last one.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.870
- Yeah, this is something we
could not miss in Karachi.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.617
- Because they say all
that's well that ends well.

00:00:47.617 --> 00:00:48.450
(laughing)

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.283
So, it can't end better than this.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.951
(group chattering)

00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:59.784
(traffic sounds)

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:22.833
(rhythmic music)

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.760
- Okay, so the Karachi bun kebab,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.310
it is a street food snack of wonders,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.370
and it is just amazing to
watch them as they make it.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.970
It takes you some time to even figure out.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.260
He does it so unbelievably fast,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.110
it takes you some time to even
process what even happens.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:09.030
There's a pan of, I
believe that they're little

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.470
vegetable patties, mini sliders,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.500
and then he has this pan
of what looks like foam,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.480
but they said it's whipped-up egg white,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000
so he grabs one of the patties,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120
sticks it with his hand into
the pan of egg white foam,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300
and then drops it into the
oil into a little patty,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.390
and so, the little vegetable
patty is within the foam egg,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.110
and then it fries in oil,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.360
and he does that until
the entire pan is full.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030
Once the entire pan is full, he remembers

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.300
where he added the first one,
and then starts flipping them,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.080
and when he flips them, you
can see that the little patty

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.579
is beneath that egg foam.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.496
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.590
And it almost looks like
a completely new form,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.360
like a molecular gastronomy fried egg,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.131
but instead of a yolk, you
have that little patty in it.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.881
(rhythmic music)

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.970
The second part of the bun
kebab is the bun itself,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.730
and it just is a straight-up bun,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.890
but they add some oil to the hot griddle.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.740
They just let it sizzle in the oil until

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.463
it just toasts perfectly.

00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:29.575
(group chattering)

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.861
(rhythmic music)

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.450
He lets it toast until
it's perfectly golden,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.860
then he adds on some
chutney onto that bun,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.800
and then he adds on some onions,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.380
and then he adds on the little patty,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.160
and then just wraps it up like a burger.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.610
That is a Karachi bun
kebab, one of the ultimate

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.660
Karachi, Pakistani street food snacks.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.110
It's so beautiful to watch
them as they make it.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.550
They do it in such precision.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.580
They could do it with their eyes closed,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.990
and we got some fresh bun kebabs
to try, Karachi bun kebabs.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.060
It looks like a completely
new form of a fried egg,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.320
yeah, deconstructed and
with a little patty inside

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.353
instead of the yolk.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.530
It's just a perfect,
little handheld creation,

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.420
and let's just try it first

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.330
before we dunk it into the chutney.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.163
- [Men] Cheers.

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.201
(laughing)

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.190
- And, by the way, it's vegetarian,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.030
but you would not even know.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.020
- Really?

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.976
- It's very good.

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:52.549
That tastes like a lentil
patty, and then that's like

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:55.763
the foamiest, fluffiest, deep fried egg.

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.484
- And that questionable chutney.

00:04:58.484 --> 00:04:59.317
(laughing)

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.630
- Okay, we gotta dip it into this chutney,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.475
and some of those onions as well.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:04.590
(rhythmic music)

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.790
I'm just gotta dunk the
entire thing in there,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.180
in that chutney.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.800
In one swipe, I got like half
the chutney on the plate.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.820
That is a beautiful thing.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.890
We found out from the
owner that the little patty

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.740
is a mixture of minced beef

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.780
and some kind of a lentil, right?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.730
Actually, the lentils
really come in nicely,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.710
but it's actually not that
much meat, but you do taste

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.780
a little bit of the ground
beef, but mostly lentils.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.553
They add that creamy lentil taste.

00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:28.324
- [Ali] Chutney, boys.

00:05:28.324 --> 00:05:30.283
(laughing)
- [Mark] Chutney, boys.

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:33.033
(rhythmic music)

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:37.570
(laughing)

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.880
- Done.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.713
Done.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.820
- Wow.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.135
- He slammed it.

00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:46.750
(laughing)

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.900
Ali pulled a two biter, the slider.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.993
Oh man, that is just extraordinary.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.250
This is one of the
ultimate, fast food burgers

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.730
I've ever had in my life.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.000
The combination of those creamy lentils

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.620
with that ground beef, and
then with that chutney,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.300
it just bumps it up.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.500
You taste the coriander in that chutney.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.090
You taste the slight hardness of it.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.900
The onions in there, and then the bun

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.713
is so buttery and crunchy.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.510
It just works.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.710
It's dangerously tasty.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.120
You could just stand
here and eat bun kebab,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.900
after bun kebab, after bun
kebab, listening to the traffic,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.283
watching them as they cook.

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.140
This is an establishment.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.350
Every bite needs to be
wiped up with that chutney,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.800
and grab some onions as well.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.840
The coriander seed on that bite.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.253
Oh, wow, it is unbelievably good.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.820
Okay, now I know why this place

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.720
is so popular and so legendary.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.290
It is that good.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.310
- You wanna know one more
thing, these are 30 rupees each.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.870
That's 25 cents.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.113
That's eight Baht.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.723
- That's four for a dollar.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.669
I got a massive wipe
of chutney on my lens.

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.419
(rhythmic music)

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.930
Oh, wow, that is everything you want

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.740
in a patty stuffed within a bun.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.589
That is Karachi in a bun.

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:40.497
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:40.497 --> 00:07:41.810
- Thank you.
- [Mark] That's amazing.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.750
It's so good.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.020
- You like it?
- Amazing, yes.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.490
And the owner here is
so nice, so friendly.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.600
Go and check them out.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.683
Super biryani and bun
kebab in Pakistan Chak,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.363
Karachi, Pakistan.

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:56.900
What a spot, and what energy here.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.220
I loved it.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.680
That was one of the greatest
street food, handheld snacks

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.973
I think I can think of that I've ever had.
