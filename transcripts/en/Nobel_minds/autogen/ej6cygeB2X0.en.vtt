great introduction

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400
great introduction
 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.689
great introduction
so I've I've been interested in

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699
so I've I've been interested in
 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:26.599
so I've I've been interested in
gravitational waves for a long tono so I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
gravitational waves for a long tono so I
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.429
gravitational waves for a long tono so I
I began this inquiry really with a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
I began this inquiry really with a
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.889
I began this inquiry really with a
series of stories stories and thought

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
series of stories stories and thought
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.680
series of stories stories and thought
experiments and I thought what I would

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
experiments and I thought what I would
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860
experiments and I thought what I would
do in the lecture today is give you a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
do in the lecture today is give you a
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.650
do in the lecture today is give you a
sense of the path of behavioral

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
sense of the path of behavioral
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290
sense of the path of behavioral
economics how it started from these

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
economics how it started from these
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.790
economics how it started from these
stories and thought experiments and we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
stories and thought experiments and we
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.270
stories and thought experiments and we
will end up with the Swedish Social

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
will end up with the Swedish Social
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.180
will end up with the Swedish Social
Security system which is another

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190
Security system which is another
 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.200
Security system which is another
experiment so maybe my most famous story

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
experiment so maybe my most famous story
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.510
experiment so maybe my most famous story
involves a dinner party and a bowl of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
involves a dinner party and a bowl of
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.050
involves a dinner party and a bowl of
cashew nuts this was back when I was in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
cashew nuts this was back when I was in
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.469
cashew nuts this was back when I was in
graduate school a bunch of economists

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
graduate school a bunch of economists
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.039
graduate school a bunch of economists
were coming over for dinner we put out a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
were coming over for dinner we put out a
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.570
were coming over for dinner we put out a
bowl of cashews and serve drinks and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580
bowl of cashews and serve drinks and
 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.760
bowl of cashews and serve drinks and
after a while about half the bowl had

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
after a while about half the bowl had
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160
after a while about half the bowl had
been consumed we were worried about our

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
been consumed we were worried about our
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.969
been consumed we were worried about our
appetites and so I took the bowl and hid

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
appetites and so I took the bowl and hid
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.200
appetites and so I took the bowl and hid
it in the kitchen and I think came back

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
it in the kitchen and I think came back
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.819
it in the kitchen and I think came back
and first of all everybody thanked me

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
and first of all everybody thanked me
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.719
and first of all everybody thanked me
thank God you got rid of those nuts and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
thank God you got rid of those nuts and
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.030
thank God you got rid of those nuts and
then since it was a group of economics

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
then since it was a group of economics
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.289
then since it was a group of economics
graduate students we began to analyze it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
graduate students we began to analyze it
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.069
graduate students we began to analyze it
which shows you the danger of going to a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
which shows you the danger of going to a
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.539
which shows you the danger of going to a
dinner party with a group of economists

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
dinner party with a group of economists
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.280
dinner party with a group of economists
and so the the analysis was a that we

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
and so the the analysis was a that we
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350
and so the the analysis was a that we
were happy and B that we were not

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
were happy and B that we were not
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.760
were happy and B that we were not
allowed to be happy because it's a basic

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
allowed to be happy because it's a basic
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.710
allowed to be happy because it's a basic
axiom of economics that more

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
axiom of economics that more
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.230
axiom of economics that more
choices are always preferred to fewer

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
choices are always preferred to fewer
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.860
choices are always preferred to fewer
and before we had the choice to eat the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
and before we had the choice to eat the
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.770
and before we had the choice to eat the
nuts or not and now we didn't so what

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
nuts or not and now we didn't so what
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.990
nuts or not and now we didn't so what
were we doing being happy so how is it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
were we doing being happy so how is it
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.930
were we doing being happy so how is it
that having a choice removed can make us

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
that having a choice removed can make us
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.170
that having a choice removed can make us
better off this led to a series of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
better off this led to a series of
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.100
better off this led to a series of
papers with my friend here schefren

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110

followed in his footsteps
in becoming a wine lover and so when I

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
in becoming a wine lover and so when I
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.890
in becoming a wine lover and so when I
met him he had been collecting and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
met him he had been collecting and
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.540
met him he had been collecting and
drinking wine for a long time

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
drinking wine for a long time
 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.780
drinking wine for a long time
and had made some wise purchases early

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
and had made some wise purchases early
 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.590

on possibly including even this bottle

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600
on possibly including even this bottle
 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.960
on possibly including even this bottle
but for this story we're gonna say he

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970
but for this story we're gonna say he
 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.440
but for this story we're gonna say he
bought a bottle for $4.95 and later was

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
bought a bottle for $4.95 and later was
 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.100
bought a bottle for $4.95 and later was
able to sell it for $100 and he had a

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110
able to sell it for $100 and he had a
 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.740
able to sell it for $100 and he had a
rule that he wasn't willing to pay more

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750
rule that he wasn't willing to pay more
 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.970
rule that he wasn't willing to pay more
than $30 for a bottle of wine but he

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
than $30 for a bottle of wine but he
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.120
than $30 for a bottle of wine but he
sometimes would drink one of his old

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130
sometimes would drink one of his old
 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.930
sometimes would drink one of his old
bottles well that's a puzzle if you're

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
bottles well that's a puzzle if you're
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.650
bottles well that's a puzzle if you're
an economist he won't buy he won't sell

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660
an economist he won't buy he won't sell
 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.570
an economist he won't buy he won't sell
but he will drink so that's kind of the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580
but he will drink so that's kind of the
 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.280
but he will drink so that's kind of the
economists reaction to this and that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
economists reaction to this and that
 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.090

all from the same vintage kind of when I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140
all from the same vintage kind of when I
 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.550
all from the same vintage kind of when I
was in grad school

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
was in grad school
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.190
was in grad school
a friend and I were given tickets to a

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200
a friend and I were given tickets to a
 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.850
a friend and I were given tickets to a
basketball game in Buffalo we were

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860
basketball game in Buffalo we were
 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.250
basketball game in Buffalo we were
living in Rochester there was a big

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260
living in Rochester there was a big
 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.790
living in Rochester there was a big
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to
 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.420
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to
go to the game but my friend said had we

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430
go to the game but my friend said had we
 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.880
go to the game but my friend said had we
bought those tickets we would have been

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890
bought those tickets we would have been
 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.390
bought those tickets we would have been
we would go to that game now of course

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400
we would go to that game now of course
 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.040
we would go to that game now of course
the economists call this the sunk cost

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
the economists call this the sunk cost
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.590
the economists call this the sunk cost
fallacy and the question is why would

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600
fallacy and the question is why would
 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.400
fallacy and the question is why would
anybody think going to the game helps so

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410
anybody think going to the game helps so
 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.850
anybody think going to the game helps so
yes in that hypothetical where we had

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860
yes in that hypothetical where we had
 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.360
yes in that hypothetical where we had
paid a lot of money for these tickets

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
paid a lot of money for these tickets
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.430
paid a lot of money for these tickets
there would be that wasted money but

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
there would be that wasted money but
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.320
there would be that wasted money but
going to the game wasn't gonna get that

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330
going to the game wasn't gonna get that
 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.950
going to the game wasn't gonna get that
money back so why is it that there was

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
money back so why is it that there was
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.830
money back so why is it that there was
this temptation to feel like we should

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840
this temptation to feel like we should
 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.290
this temptation to feel like we should
go to the game if we had paid for the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300
go to the game if we had paid for the
 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.300
go to the game if we had paid for the
tickets and this and many other stories

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310
tickets and this and many other stories
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.060
tickets and this and many other stories

Tversky and Daniel Kahneman and I got an
 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.970
Tversky and Daniel Kahneman and I got an
idea from them the kind of that made my

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980
idea from them the kind of that made my

studying how people make judgments this

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640
studying how people make judgments this
 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.970
studying how people make judgments this
is before they wrote their famous paper

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980
is before they wrote their famous paper
 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.510
is before they wrote their famous paper
on prospect theory and the idea related

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520
on prospect theory and the idea related
 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.800
on prospect theory and the idea related
to earlier work by herb Simon it says

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810
to earlier work by herb Simon it says
 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.420
to earlier work by herb Simon it says
okay people how are boundedly rational

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
okay people how are boundedly rational
 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.360
okay people how are boundedly rational
and so they use simple rules of thumb to

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370
and so they use simple rules of thumb to
 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.320
and so they use simple rules of thumb to
help them make decisions and then here

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
help them make decisions and then here
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.070
help them make decisions and then here
was the aha moment I got from reading

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080
was the aha moment I got from reading
 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.910
was the aha moment I got from reading
their research which is that the use of

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920
their research which is that the use of
 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.580
their research which is that the use of
these heuristics not only leads to

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590
these heuristics not only leads to
 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.130
these heuristics not only leads to
errors economists would have no problem

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140
errors economists would have no problem
 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.969
errors economists would have no problem
with that we know how to add an error

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979
with that we know how to add an error
 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.600
with that we know how to add an error
the idea was that they would lead to

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610
the idea was that they would lead to
 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.890
the idea was that they would lead to
systematic bias so an example is you can

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900
systematic bias so an example is you can
 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.710
systematic bias so an example is you can
ask people what do they think is the

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720
ask people what do they think is the
 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.760
ask people what do they think is the
ratio of gun deaths by homicide to gun

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
ratio of gun deaths by homicide to gun
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.240
ratio of gun deaths by homicide to gun
deaths by suicide in the United States

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
deaths by suicide in the United States
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.920
deaths by suicide in the United States
people think homicides are much more

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930
people think homicides are much more
 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.650
people think homicides are much more
frequent cause of death in fact suicides

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660
frequent cause of death in fact suicides
 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.260
frequent cause of death in fact suicides
are about twice as often that's an

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270
are about twice as often that's an
 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.430
are about twice as often that's an
example of what they call the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440
example of what they call the
 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.570
example of what they call the
availability bias and it's just you can

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580
availability bias and it's just you can
 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.779
availability bias and it's just you can
you can win bar bets based on their

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789
you can win bar bets based on their
 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:17.189
you can win bar bets based on their
research so one lesson from these

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199
research so one lesson from these
 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.279
research so one lesson from these
stories is that there's a bunch of

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289
stories is that there's a bunch of
 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.240
stories is that there's a bunch of
things that economic theory tells us we

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250
things that economic theory tells us we
 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.180
things that economic theory tells us we
can leave out and in fact makes the

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190
can leave out and in fact makes the
 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.850
can leave out and in fact makes the
strong prediction that they simply will

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860
strong prediction that they simply will
 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.260
strong prediction that they simply will
not matter I call these supposedly

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270
not matter I call these supposedly
 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.290
not matter I call these supposedly
irrelevant factors and really my

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300
irrelevant factors and really my
 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.080
irrelevant factors and really my
research can be summarized as there are

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090
research can be summarized as there are
 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.360
research can be summarized as there are
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.370
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant
 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.120
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant
factors that are not irrelevant they

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.130
factors that are not irrelevant they
 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.379
factors that are not irrelevant they
matter so I call these sifts supposedly

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:49.389
matter so I call these sifts supposedly
 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:53.490
matter so I call these sifts supposedly
irrelevant factors so my three little

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.500
irrelevant factors so my three little
 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.339
irrelevant factors so my three little
stories illustrate them if you push the

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:56.349
stories illustrate them if you push the
 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:58.499
stories illustrate them if you push the

that professor rosette owned that bottle
 

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.010
that professor rosette owned that bottle
of wine is as if his willingness to

affect our decision to go to the game so

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.490
affect our decision to go to the game so
 

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.880
affect our decision to go to the game so
once we realize that there's this long

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:53.890
once we realize that there's this long
 

00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:00.800
once we realize that there's this long
list of sifts we can expand the

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:00.810
list of sifts we can expand the

because a lot more stuff matters so how

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.270
because a lot more stuff matters so how
 

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.950
because a lot more stuff matters so how
do we get from stories to science I'm

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:13.960
do we get from stories to science I'm
 

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.680
do we get from stories to science I'm
gonna illustrate that with one

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:16.690
gonna illustrate that with one
 

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.950
gonna illustrate that with one
experiment that I did with my friends

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:19.960
experiment that I did with my friends
 

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.460

you'll see the the mug here is place a

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.190
you'll see the the mug here is place a
 

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.270
you'll see the the mug here is place a
crucial role in this my last remaining

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:33.280
crucial role in this my last remaining
 

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:40.320
crucial role in this my last remaining
mug is now in the Nobel Museum so I

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.330
mug is now in the Nobel Museum so I
 

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.430
mug is now in the Nobel Museum so I
stole these Legos from my grandchildren

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440
stole these Legos from my grandchildren
 

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.670
stole these Legos from my grandchildren
and you'll see they're gonna play a

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680
and you'll see they're gonna play a
 

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.190
and you'll see they're gonna play a
crucial role in in this little

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200
crucial role in in this little
 

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.980
crucial role in in this little
illustration so here's how the

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:52.990
illustration so here's how the
 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.700
illustration so here's how the
experiment works we start using a

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:56.710
experiment works we start using a
 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.000
experiment works we start using a
technique that was invented by Vernon

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.010
technique that was invented by Vernon
 

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.630
technique that was invented by Vernon
Smith who shared the Nobel Prize with

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
Smith who shared the Nobel Prize with
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.380
Smith who shared the Nobel Prize with
Danny Kahneman fifteen years ago and in

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.390
Danny Kahneman fifteen years ago and in
 

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.070
Danny Kahneman fifteen years ago and in
using Vernon Smith's technique we assign

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.080
using Vernon Smith's technique we assign
 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.180
using Vernon Smith's technique we assign
values to people so we do that by saying

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.190
values to people so we do that by saying
 

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.690
values to people so we do that by saying
if you end up with one of these tokens

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:21.700
if you end up with one of these tokens
 

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.570
if you end up with one of these tokens
at the end of the experiment you can

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:24.580
at the end of the experiment you can
 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.750
at the end of the experiment you can
redeem it for the value indicated here

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760
redeem it for the value indicated here
 

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:37.890
redeem it for the value indicated here
then we assign tokens at random which

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:37.900
then we assign tokens at random which
 

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.050
then we assign tokens at random which
we've done here and incidentally my

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.060
we've done here and incidentally my
 

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.540
we've done here and incidentally my
friend linea who produced all these

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:45.550
friend linea who produced all these
 

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.960
friend linea who produced all these
beautiful slides has assigned these at

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:48.970
beautiful slides has assigned these at
 

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.570
beautiful slides has assigned these at
random in the way that condiment and

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:51.580
random in the way that condiment and
 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.560
random in the way that condiment and
Tversky would say is the most random

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.570
Tversky would say is the most random
 

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.920
Tversky would say is the most random
looking way of a random

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:58.930
looking way of a random
 

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.380
looking way of a random
the assigning took nicely done Linea so

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.390
the assigning took nicely done Linea so
 

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.200
the assigning took nicely done Linea so
we've assigned these at random and now

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.210
we've assigned these at random and now
 

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.820
we've assigned these at random and now
we conduct a market in which we allow

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:11.830
we conduct a market in which we allow
 

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.269
we conduct a market in which we allow
people to trade so people who don't have

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279
people to trade so people who don't have
 

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.670
people to trade so people who don't have
tokens can buy them people who have

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680
tokens can buy them people who have
 

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.280
tokens can buy them people who have
tokens can sell them and then we see

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.290
tokens can sell them and then we see
 

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:25.040
tokens can sell them and then we see
what happens and this is what happens

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.050
what happens and this is what happens
 

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.380
what happens and this is what happens
which is exactly what is supposed to

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.390
which is exactly what is supposed to
 

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.250

about 90% of the people join if we use

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:17.869
about 90% of the people join if we use
 

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:21.609
about 90% of the people join if we use
automatic enrollment much less for other

00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:21.619
automatic enrollment much less for other
 

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:24.129
automatic enrollment much less for other
groups particularly for lower income

00:28:24.129 --> 00:28:24.139
groups particularly for lower income
 

00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:31.180
groups particularly for lower income
groups so this this is this is a nudge

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.190
groups so this this is this is a nudge
 

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.849
groups so this this is this is a nudge
that's particularly effective at helping

00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:33.859
that's particularly effective at helping
 

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:37.529
that's particularly effective at helping
lower-income people save for retirement

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:37.539
lower-income people save for retirement
 

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:41.019
lower-income people save for retirement
well there's a problem with automatic

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:41.029
well there's a problem with automatic
 

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:42.230
well there's a problem with automatic
enrollment

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240
enrollment
 

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.310
enrollment
and that is that particularly in the

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320
and that is that particularly in the
 

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.690
and that is that particularly in the
United States the firms that employ this

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700
United States the firms that employ this
 

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.710

income that is not enough to save for
 

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.420
income that is not enough to save for
retirement so how can we solve this

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:08.430
retirement so how can we solve this
 

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.570
retirement so how can we solve this

artsy and i took this on and what we
 

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.690
artsy and i took this on and what we
decided to do is think about this

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:19.700
decided to do is think about this
 

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.250

starting with the psychology and and ask

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.260
starting with the psychology and and ask
 

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.560
starting with the psychology and and ask
well what is it that's preventing people

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:27.570
well what is it that's preventing people
 

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:32.720
well what is it that's preventing people
from saving enough well one is self

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:32.730
from saving enough well one is self

we're are saving for retirement that's
 

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.820
we're are saving for retirement that's
some time off in the future and we know

some time off in the future and we know
 

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.130

people have more self control for the

people have more self control for the
 

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.060
people have more self control for the

to see their income go down so we wanted

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:11.430
to see their income go down so we wanted
 

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.060
to see their income go down so we wanted
to take that into consideration and then

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:14.070
to take that into consideration and then
 

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.680
to take that into consideration and then
inertia people are good at doing nothing

inertia people are good at doing nothing
 

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:22.100
inertia people are good at doing nothing
so our idea was we know these things are

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:22.110
so our idea was we know these things are
 

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.100
so our idea was we know these things are
preventing people from saving let's flip

preventing people from saving let's flip
the problem around and use those to

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.050
the problem around and use those to
 

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:34.210
the problem around and use those to
create a plan that will take those

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:34.220
create a plan that will take those
 

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.110
create a plan that will take those
weaknesses if you want to call it that

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120
weaknesses if you want to call it that
 

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:45.380
weaknesses if you want to call it that
and use them to help so the plan we

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.390
and use them to help so the plan we
 

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.500
and use them to help so the plan we
created who we called save more tomorrow

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:47.510
created who we called save more tomorrow
 

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.890
created who we called save more tomorrow
and the basic idea was to invite people

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:51.900
and the basic idea was to invite people
 

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.710
and the basic idea was to invite people
now to save more later

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720
now to save more later
 

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.919
now to save more later
because self-control is easier for later

00:30:58.919 --> 00:30:58.929
because self-control is easier for later
 

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:01.350
because self-control is easier for later
it's like the our diet plan that will

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360
it's like the our diet plan that will
 

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.600
it's like the our diet plan that will
start in January and particularly to

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:06.610
start in January and particularly to
 

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.390
start in January and particularly to
invite them to save more when they get

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:09.400
invite them to save more when they get
 

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.149
invite them to save more when they get
their next raise so they won't see their

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159
their next raise so they won't see their
 

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.970
their next raise so they won't see their
income go down that will eliminate the

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:14.980
income go down that will eliminate the
 

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.180
income go down that will eliminate the
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.190
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep
 

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:23.100
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep
that up until they hit some goal so

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.110
that up until they hit some goal so
 

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.440
that up until they hit some goal so
we'll get inertia working for us so we

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.450
we'll get inertia working for us so we
 

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.110
we'll get inertia working for us so we
spent years trying to get any company to

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120
spent years trying to get any company to
 

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.840
spent years trying to get any company to
try this and we finally found one in

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:33.850
try this and we finally found one in
 

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.779
try this and we finally found one in
Chicago and in this particular

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:36.789
Chicago and in this particular
 

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:39.840
Chicago and in this particular
implementation the company it was a

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:39.850
implementation the company it was a
 

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.029
implementation the company it was a
small company they hired a financial

00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039
small company they hired a financial
 

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:45.870
small company they hired a financial
advisor and offered his services to any

advisor and offered his services to any
 

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.080
advisor and offered his services to any
employee it was about 300 employees and

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.090
employee it was about 300 employees and
 

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.820
employee it was about 300 employees and
for most of them he the advisor said we

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:56.830
for most of them he the advisor said we
 

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.220
for most of them he the advisor said we
think you should save at least five

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.230
think you should save at least five
 

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.250
think you should save at least five
percentage points more and most of the

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:02.260
percentage points more and most of the
 

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.100
percentage points more and most of the
employees said that you're nuts I can't

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.110
employees said that you're nuts I can't
 

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.270
employees said that you're nuts I can't
afford that so then and only then were

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:09.280
afford that so then and only then were
 

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.880
afford that so then and only then were
they offered the same or tomorrow plan

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:11.890
they offered the same or tomorrow plan
 

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.880
they offered the same or tomorrow plan
and it was a quite an aggressive one

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:16.890
and it was a quite an aggressive one
 

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.640
and it was a quite an aggressive one
they're saving was increased by three

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:20.650
they're saving was increased by three
 

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.310
they're saving was increased by three
percentage points every time they got a

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320
percentage points every time they got a
 

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:30.060
percentage points every time they got a
raise so notice this is all a SIF right

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.070
raise so notice this is all a SIF right
 

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.390

with life cycle savers a they would have

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:33.400
with life cycle savers a they would have
 

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.610
with life cycle savers a they would have
no interest in joining save more

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:35.620
no interest in joining save more
 

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.260
no interest in joining save more
tomorrow because they're already saving

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:37.270
tomorrow because they're already saving
 

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.649
tomorrow because they're already saving
the right amount and if it was put in

00:32:40.649 --> 00:32:40.659
the right amount and if it was put in
 

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:44.730
the right amount and if it was put in
they would undo it because they are

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:44.740
they would undo it because they are
 

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.710
they would undo it because they are
already saving the right amount so so it

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720
already saving the right amount so so it
 

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.140
already saving the right amount so so it
shouldn't work a no one should join and

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:52.150
shouldn't work a no one should join and
 

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.039
shouldn't work a no one should join and
be their behavior won't change well

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:56.049
be their behavior won't change well
 

00:32:56.049 --> 00:33:02.039

let's see what happened the first line

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:02.049
let's see what happened the first line

financial advisor and you can see

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:08.690
financial advisor and you can see
 

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.129
financial advisor and you can see
the inertia in this system these numbers

00:33:12.129 --> 00:33:12.139
the inertia in this system these numbers
 

00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:15.009
the inertia in this system these numbers
fluctuate a little it's not that anyone

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:15.019
fluctuate a little it's not that anyone
 

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:18.789
fluctuate a little it's not that anyone
is doing anything it's in there's

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799
is doing anything it's in there's
 

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:23.080
is doing anything it's in there's
attrition so we some people leave the

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.090
attrition so we some people leave the

company then here is the group that took

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.340
company then here is the group that took
 

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.879

the advice to go up by five percentage

00:33:30.879 --> 00:33:30.889
the advice to go up by five percentage
 

00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:34.509
the advice to go up by five percentage
points you can see they did that and

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519
points you can see they did that and
 

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:40.049
points you can see they did that and
then stopped then here are our guys and

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:40.059
then stopped then here are our guys and
 

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:45.070
then stopped then here are our guys and
you can see we almost quadrupled saving

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080
you can see we almost quadrupled saving
 

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.849
you can see we almost quadrupled saving

factors now a question we asked and we

00:33:56.229 --> 00:33:56.239
factors now a question we asked and we
 

00:33:56.239 --> 00:33:59.979

campaigns stopped both the government

00:40:44.759 --> 00:40:44.769
campaigns stopped both the government
 

00:40:44.769 --> 00:40:50.029
campaigns stopped both the government
and the funds stopped advertising and

00:40:50.029 --> 00:40:50.039
and the funds stopped advertising and
 

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:52.589
and the funds stopped advertising and
there were some lingering effects of

00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599
there were some lingering effects of
 

00:40:52.599 --> 00:40:54.809
there were some lingering effects of
those some people are joining just a

00:40:54.809 --> 00:40:54.819
those some people are joining just a
 

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:59.819
those some people are joining just a
month after the campaign ended but then

00:40:59.819 --> 00:40:59.829
month after the campaign ended but then
 

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:07.999
month after the campaign ended but then
it wore out and here's what happened so

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:08.009
it wore out and here's what happened so
 

00:41:08.009 --> 00:41:13.049
it wore out and here's what happened so
you can see this is year one when two

00:41:13.049 --> 00:41:13.059
you can see this is year one when two
 

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:17.220
you can see this is year one when two
thirds of the people chose their own

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:17.230
thirds of the people chose their own
 

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.990
thirds of the people chose their own
portfolios that tapered off and in

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000
portfolios that tapered off and in
 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.910
portfolios that tapered off and in
recent years almost no one is choosing

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920
recent years almost no one is choosing
 

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.450
recent years almost no one is choosing
their own portfolio those numbers on the

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:30.460
their own portfolio those numbers on the
 

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:36.029
their own portfolio those numbers on the
right are about half a percent so that's

00:41:36.029 --> 00:41:36.039
right are about half a percent so that's
 

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:43.300
right are about half a percent so that's
kind of interesting right so

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:43.310
kind of interesting right so
 

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.960
kind of interesting right so
but one of the questions we're

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:46.970
but one of the questions we're
 

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.960
but one of the questions we're
interested in is well how long do not

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:49.970
interested in is well how long do not
 

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.530
interested in is well how long do not
just last right so those guys on the

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:53.540
just last right so those guys on the
 

00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:00.250
just last right so those guys on the
left were well actually until 2008 they

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.260
left were well actually until 2008 they
 

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.980
left were well actually until 2008 they
were locked in there was an obscure rule

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:02.990
were locked in there was an obscure rule
 

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.640
were locked in there was an obscure rule
the justification of which no one has

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:06.650
the justification of which no one has
 

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.200
the justification of which no one has
been able to explain to me but if you

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.210
been able to explain to me but if you
 

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:15.450
been able to explain to me but if you
maybe somebody here knows but if you

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:15.460
maybe somebody here knows but if you
 

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.730
maybe somebody here knows but if you
turn down the default fund you weren't

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:18.740
turn down the default fund you weren't
 

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:24.970
turn down the default fund you weren't
allowed to take it later until 2008 then

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:24.980
allowed to take it later until 2008 then
 

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.920
allowed to take it later until 2008 then
they changed that rule but so one of the

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:29.930
they changed that rule but so one of the
 

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.590
they changed that rule but so one of the
question is those guys who were nudged

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:32.600
question is those guys who were nudged
 

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.270
question is those guys who were nudged
to be individualistic did they stay that

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280
to be individualistic did they stay that
 

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.660
to be individualistic did they stay that
way and if so that'd be interesting

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:40.670
way and if so that'd be interesting
 

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.480
way and if so that'd be interesting
because almost no one has chosen to do

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:43.490
because almost no one has chosen to do
 

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:50.770
because almost no one has chosen to do
that since so 27 percent of the people

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:50.780
that since so 27 percent of the people
 

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.920
that since so 27 percent of the people
in the default fund have left and

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:53.930
in the default fund have left and
 

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.360
in the default fund have left and
decided to become do-it-yourselfers

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:57.370
decided to become do-it-yourselfers
 

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:03.040
decided to become do-it-yourselfers
but essentially no one that started as

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.050
but essentially no one that started as
 

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:07.210
but essentially no one that started as
into it yourselfer has switched their so

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:07.220
into it yourselfer has switched their so
 

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.630
into it yourselfer has switched their so
this nudge has lasted more or less

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640
this nudge has lasted more or less
 

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.730
this nudge has lasted more or less
forever and that's in spite of the fact

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:15.740
forever and that's in spite of the fact
 

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.570
forever and that's in spite of the fact
that the default fund has had drastic

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:19.580
that the default fund has had drastic
 

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:27.070
that the default fund has had drastic
changes so in 2010 the managers of the

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.080
changes so in 2010 the managers of the
 

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:32.050
changes so in 2010 the managers of the
fund decided they wanted to juice the

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:32.060
fund decided they wanted to juice the
 

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:37.210
fund decided they wanted to juice the
returns well hopefully so they decided

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:37.220
returns well hopefully so they decided
 

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.250
returns well hopefully so they decided
to add leverage you know what does that

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:39.260
to add leverage you know what does that
 

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.700
to add leverage you know what does that
mean technically they were borrowing and

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:42.710
mean technically they were borrowing and
 

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:48.280
mean technically they were borrowing and
buying options but the details of that

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:48.290
buying options but the details of that
 

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:52.540
buying options but the details of that
are not important you they initially had

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:52.550
are not important you they initially had
 

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.070
are not important you they initially had
a hundred and twenty five percent

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:54.080
a hundred and twenty five percent
 

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.790
a hundred and twenty five percent
leverage meaning

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800
leverage meaning
 

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.740
leverage meaning
that if the market went up 10% the fund

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:00.750
that if the market went up 10% the fund
 

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.010
that if the market went up 10% the fund
would go up 12 then they switch to 50%

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020
would go up 12 then they switch to 50%
 

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:08.660
would go up 12 then they switch to 50%
leverage so 50 percent leverage means

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:08.670
leverage so 50 percent leverage means
 

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.750
leverage so 50 percent leverage means
that if the market goes up 10% you go up

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760
that if the market goes up 10% you go up
 

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.330
that if the market goes up 10% you go up
15% but if the market Falls 10% the fund

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:17.340
15% but if the market Falls 10% the fund
 

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:22.160
15% but if the market Falls 10% the fund
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.170
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys
 

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:25.580
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys
look like geniuses since the market has

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:25.590
look like geniuses since the market has
 

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.740
look like geniuses since the market has
pretty much steadily gone up since they

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:27.750
pretty much steadily gone up since they
 

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.390
pretty much steadily gone up since they
took these but we can ask what would

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400
took these but we can ask what would
 

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.040
took these but we can ask what would
happen if we had another financial

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.050
happen if we had another financial
 

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:39.200
happen if we had another financial
crisis so what would this fund have done

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.210
crisis so what would this fund have done
 

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:44.540
crisis so what would this fund have done
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:44.550
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
 

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:52.010
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
down 82% so you know this is a pretty

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
 

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.480
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
big change and so a question that Frank

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:56.490
big change and so a question that Frank
 

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:02.680
big change and so a question that Frank
and Henrik and I have been exploring is

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:02.690
and Henrik and I have been exploring is
 

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:10.790
and Henrik and I have been exploring is
did anybody notice this so by the way

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800
did anybody notice this so by the way
 

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.600
did anybody notice this so by the way
there are now 900 funds because 450

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:14.610
there are now 900 funds because 450
 

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:21.610
there are now 900 funds because 450
really wouldn't do so and one of those

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:21.620
really wouldn't do so and one of those
 

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:27.500
really wouldn't do so and one of those
900 funds is identical to the default

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:27.510
900 funds is identical to the default
 

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.640
900 funds is identical to the default
fund but has no leverage so it was

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:31.650
fund but has no leverage so it was
 

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:35.030
fund but has no leverage so it was
possible if you liked the thing you were

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040
possible if you liked the thing you were
 

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:40.400
possible if you liked the thing you were
in and these guys in the room and I know

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.410
in and these guys in the room and I know
 

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.520
in and these guys in the room and I know
who you are who claim they picked the

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:43.530
who you are who claim they picked the
 

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.510
who you are who claim they picked the
default fund by choice in their wisdom

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520
default fund by choice in their wisdom
 

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:52.580
default fund by choice in their wisdom
I'm looking at you pear presumably they

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:52.590
I'm looking at you pear presumably they
 

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:57.350
I'm looking at you pear presumably they
were picking an unlevered fund and you

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:57.360
were picking an unlevered fund and you
 

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.400
were picking an unlevered fund and you
know might have noticed that this thing

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:01.410
know might have noticed that this thing
 

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.270
know might have noticed that this thing
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should
 

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.000
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should
switch into this other fund that's just

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.010
switch into this other fund that's just
 

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.109
switch into this other fund that's just
like the one I

00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119
like the one I
 

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:16.039
like the one I
allegedly actively picked so did anyone

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:16.049
allegedly actively picked so did anyone
 

00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:20.120
allegedly actively picked so did anyone
notice so here's a plot of the leverage

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:20.130
notice so here's a plot of the leverage
 

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:27.529
notice so here's a plot of the leverage
over time this is the number of people

00:46:27.529 --> 00:46:27.539
over time this is the number of people
 

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:33.230
over time this is the number of people
that were leaving the default fund I

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240
that were leaving the default fund I
 

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.269
that were leaving the default fund I
don't know whether you can read those

00:46:35.269 --> 00:46:35.279
don't know whether you can read those
 

00:46:35.279 --> 00:46:40.839
don't know whether you can read those
numbers the scale goes from 0 to 400

00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:40.849
numbers the scale goes from 0 to 400
 

00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:44.829
numbers the scale goes from 0 to 400
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million

00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million
 

00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:49.549
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million
investors in this fund so our conclusion

00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559
investors in this fund so our conclusion
 

00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:53.660
investors in this fund so our conclusion
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:53.670
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that
 

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:58.239
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that
3 million Swedish investors are asleep

00:46:58.239 --> 00:46:58.249
3 million Swedish investors are asleep
 

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:01.759
3 million Swedish investors are asleep
they may be asleep we cannot rule that

00:47:01.759 --> 00:47:01.769
they may be asleep we cannot rule that
 

00:47:01.769 --> 00:47:06.859
they may be asleep we cannot rule that
out they certainly are not deserting the

00:47:06.859 --> 00:47:06.869
out they certainly are not deserting the
 

00:47:06.869 --> 00:47:12.680
out they certainly are not deserting the
fund in droves so what can we conclude

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:12.690
fund in droves so what can we conclude
 

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:15.079
fund in droves so what can we conclude
from this

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:15.089
from this
 

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:17.809
from this
the first is nudges can be quite

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819
the first is nudges can be quite
 

00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:18.710
the first is nudges can be quite
powerful

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720
powerful
 

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.430
powerful
both the nudge of creating a default

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440
both the nudge of creating a default
 

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.370
both the nudge of creating a default
which has recently been all powerful and

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:25.380
which has recently been all powerful and
 

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.120
which has recently been all powerful and
the earlier nudge saying please don't

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:29.130
the earlier nudge saying please don't
 

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.180
the earlier nudge saying please don't
take the default that was also very

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:32.190
take the default that was also very
 

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:36.410
take the default that was also very
powerful second and this we've never

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420
powerful second and this we've never
 

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.239
powerful second and this we've never
been able to test before Thank You

00:47:38.239 --> 00:47:38.249
been able to test before Thank You
 

00:47:38.249 --> 00:47:42.200
been able to test before Thank You
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.210
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we
 

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.739
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we
now know nudges can last at least 17

00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:45.749
now know nudges can last at least 17
 

00:47:45.749 --> 00:47:51.289
now know nudges can last at least 17
years possibly longer and it's

00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:51.299
years possibly longer and it's
 

00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:53.630
years possibly longer and it's
suggesting a new marketing campaign for

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640
suggesting a new marketing campaign for
 

00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:02.020
suggesting a new marketing campaign for
our nudging efforts

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.030
 

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:10.100
so let me conclude it is possible many

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:10.110
so let me conclude it is possible many
 

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.590
so let me conclude it is possible many
people told me early on it's just not

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:12.600
people told me early on it's just not
 

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.780
people told me early on it's just not
possible to do economics any other way

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:14.790
possible to do economics any other way
 

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.240
possible to do economics any other way
it wouldn't be economics so that's not

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.250
it wouldn't be economics so that's not
 

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:22.300
it wouldn't be economics so that's not
true it's possible to do economics

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.310
 

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:28.570
without homo economics sorry

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:28.580
 

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:35.120
second if we learn from other social

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:35.130
second if we learn from other social
 

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:41.750
second if we learn from other social
scientists we can improve economics we

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760
scientists we can improve economics we
 

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.710
scientists we can improve economics we
can increase its explanatory power and

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720
can increase its explanatory power and
 

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.060
can increase its explanatory power and
it can give us all kinds of new tools

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:49.070
it can give us all kinds of new tools
 

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:56.380
it can give us all kinds of new tools
that we can use to improve people's

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:56.390
that we can use to improve people's
 

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.860
that we can use to improve people's
outcomes so in short we can nudge for

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:00.870
outcomes so in short we can nudge for
 

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:11.069
outcomes so in short we can nudge for
good

00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079
 

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:13.430
