00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:07.273
In 2004, I got a call
from LIFE magazine.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.442 line:0%
They said we have this
incredible assignment for you.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.077 line:0%
It's to photograph the wounded
coming out of Fallujah.

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:13.646
<i> When we flew in</i>

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.648
<i> this is one of the
 first scenes I saw.</i>

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.117
<i>This is on my birthday in 2004</i>

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.253
<i> and it was during the
 Battle of Fallujah.</i>

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:23.656
And there were so many wounded
Americans coming out of Fallujah

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:27.226
that they cleared out the
inside of a C-17 cargo aircraft

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.262
and put all the wounded
on the ground.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.965
And this is how they flew them
to Germany for treatment.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.534
<i>And this is a young man who
 was wounded in Fallujah</i>

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.636
<i> and that's how he was
 being flown to Germany.</i>

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.540
<i>And this is from an IED attack.</i>

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.876
<i>I spent five days on the ground</i>

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:47.680
<i>and when I got back from the
assignment, I called and I said</i>

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.882
<i> "You know, I think these
pictures are really going to</i>

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.818
<i>change the tide against the war.</i>

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.987
<i>The public is gonna see them and
turn against the war, for sure."</i>

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:58.691
LIFE magazine asked me to send
the pictures, I sent them

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.928
and that was in
November of 2004.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:05.331
And through November,
December, January, February

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.767
they held the pictures and
never published them.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.703
And finally in February I got
an email from my photo editor

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.873
saying, "I hate to tell you
this but we will never publish

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.342
your pictures of wounded
American soldiers because

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:19.078
we don't think the American
public can handle seeing them."

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.149
I was frustrated and angry,
and so I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.318
at that point as a freelancer,
I can then

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.787
try and sell the pictures
to someone else.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.989
I called my editor at the
New York Times magazine,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.924
Kathy Ryan,
and she was able to get them

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.260
in the next issue of
New York Times magazine.
