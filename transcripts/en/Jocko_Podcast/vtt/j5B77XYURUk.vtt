00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.350
Thoughts on how to deal with toxic slash negative people.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
Oh,
those people.
Yeah.
So first of all,

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.620
it's important to recognize that those people exist everywhere and everybody's

4
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.060
got to deal with me.
If you run into one of these people,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.810
don't get all surprised as if they're a lone ranger out there being negative.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.000
No,
there's negative rangers all over the place.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.180
So we gotta do you gotta know how to deal with them?

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.400
And it's so,
so when you're dealing with someone like that,
first of all,

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.040
confronting them,
of course,
as you can probably predict,

10
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.670
is not usually the best option because all you're doing is you're,

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.000
you're attack and they're heavily defended position,
which,
which is not good.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.210
So one of the techniques that I use when dealing with these kind of people is I

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.160
absorb,

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
I absorb their critiques,

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:05.400
I absorb their toxicity,
I absorb their negativity.

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
Now obviously this takes a little bit of strength,
right?

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.600
You can't be taking stuff personally.
You have to,

18
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.610
in order to learn how to absorb them,
you gotta say,
okay,

19
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:16.230
I'm just going doing this for the team.
Right?
But it looks like,

20
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.990
for instance,
when they say,
oh,
this is horrible.
I don't say no.

21
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:26.010
It's not horrible.
I don't just go right back at him.
I say,
yeah,
you know what?

22
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.310
We definitely got some room for improvement,
right?
So I kind of just deflect it.

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.240
Kind of just absorb it.
Right?
It was the orbit a little bit.

24
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.490
Because what they want to do is they're lashing out,
right?

25
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.220
They're throwing the negativity.
They liked those explosions.

26
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:41.250
They like to see it hit something and blow up.
They,
that's what they're doing.

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.440
That's how they roll.
So you're going to absorb,

28
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.140
you gonna catch it and pull it in.
Right?
So when they're like,

29
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.230
we can never do this.
I don't say we can absolutely do this.
No,

30
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.470
because you didn't.
You're just go,

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.360
you're going to create the explosion that they're looking for in San Jose.

32
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.030
You know what?
We might not be able to do it.
I'm going to give it a,

33
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.190
I'm going to give it a good solid try.
I'm gonna try and make it happen.
Right?

34
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.310
So we're just deflected that a little bit into going to show you some other

35
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.370
negative thing.
And you know,
if they say,
oh,

36
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220
this is stupid,
I don't say no,
this is the most brilliant thing I've ever seen.

37
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:18.450
I don't do that.
No.
Go head to head.
I'm going to say,
you know what,

38
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.800
there's definitely some room for improvement the next time around.
You're right,

39
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.920
100% oh yeah,
you just got deflected.

40
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.120
And those reactions,

41
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.650
they disarm these ultra negative people and

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.200
it kind of takes their,

43
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.470
their fight from the minute also makes them look like emotional extremist.

44
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.720
So with the group,
right,

45
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.440
when somebody calls that out in the group and they're common across all extreme

46
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.690
and you just absorb it and negate it a little bit,

47
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.690
it negates their view or I shouldn't say negate,
negate.

48
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.160
And it's like totally Latins and cross out when you just absorb it and deflected

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.440
a little bit,
the rest of the team goes on.
Yet,
you know,
oh echo,

50
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.800
he's just super emotional.
He's in negative.
They see him for what he is,

51
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.970
which help is helpful for you.
Right.

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.680
And then once I'm done absorbing their attacks and taken some of those shots,

53
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.281
no big deal,

54
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:20.281
then I'm going to start to override them somewhat with some with some positivity

55
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.580
which is going to be directed at them.
Right.
So they were all negative,

56
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.680
but I'm going to say,
Hey,

57
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:31.010
what you did there really work well or you know what?
Hey,
good job on that.

58
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.730
I didn't know I did care.
I'd never could have figured that out like you did.

59
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.260
Right.
So I'm going to start,

60
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.240
start getting in their head a little bit and start filling their head with some

61
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.940
positive stuff.
That's right.
That's what I'm going to do.
Bad.

62
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.960
You figured that out better than anybody.
Nicely done.

63
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.300
And I'm bringing them

64
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.220
from the dark side over to the light.
That's what I'm doing.

65
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:59.221
I'm bringing them over and actually I used to have the funniest up one of my

66
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.880
favorite guys in the seal teams.
He was my,

67
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.550
he was my first deployment to Iraq.

68
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.350
He was the senior enlisted guy in our tasking.
It's an,

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.960
and actually we're just bros,

70
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.520
but when one of us would start getting a little off the reservation on something

71
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:22.180
like getting all addicted to some id or something,
the other one we were doing,

72
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.700
we would be looking like I be telling them,
look,

73
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:26.800
we need to do this and this is bullshit.
We need to do.

74
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.990
And he looked at me like he'd be like,
come back,
come back to the life.

75
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.020
We're over here.
It's okay.
We're all going to be okay.

76
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.730
So when I would start getting negative,

77
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:39.760
he would start pulling me back to the light.
Right.
And same thing with,
with me,

78
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.110
with him,
he would get,
he would get all,
you know,
get all,

79
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.840
matter of fact he's the guy.
Um,
I remember when we talked about,

80
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.950
well if fire repeat then yeah,
no,
simplify,
amplify and repeat.

81
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.560
That's a,
yeah,
that's it.

82
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.860
He would also have to bring me back from the dark side and I have to do it to

83
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.870
him too,
if he started getting a little too negative.
Um,

84
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.150
good times.
But the,

85
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.990
the last thing I want to do with someone that's being super negative is I am

86
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:10.570
actually want to,
I want to give them some ownership.

87
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.710
I want to give them some ownership,
some ability to make changes,

88
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.950
some ability to have some kind of a positive impact on the mission.

89
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.250
So I'm going to pick something that I think they can step up and handle,
right?

90
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:29.251
Something that is within their grasp and realm and ability and I'm going to give

91
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.500
it to him and then I'm going to give them,

92
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.480
I'm going to give him to kind of overload them with help and with assistance and

93
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.360
with guidance to make sure that they win

94
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.850
and that's going to start spinning them in a more positive direction.
Yeah.

95
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.750
So that's my way to deal with the big negative people out there.

96
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.280
Just absorb and slowly counter.
I like to know your are,

97
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.140
you'd be like,
Hey,
like oh you figured that out.
And I said this before,

98
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:05.030
but a good one is to be light,
to say,
hey,
that's what I like about you.

99
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.480
You're real,
whatever,
x,
Y,
z.
You know,
you're getting that feeling like,

100
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.210
because people said that to me.
That's what I like about you.

101
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.590
You're real whatever,
you know,

102
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.980
and it makes you want to like continue to be that they know and you,
you're like,

103
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:18.570
Hey,
he thinks I'm,
you know,
a problem solver.

104
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.180
Some of I'm going to be aware and just continue to solve problems.
You know,

105
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.200
you put the self fulfilling prophecy in their own heads and positive things that

106
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.450
you want them to do.
Exactly.
