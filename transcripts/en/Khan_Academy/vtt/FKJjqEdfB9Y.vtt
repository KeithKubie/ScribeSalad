00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.061
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that this rectangle,

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:04.530
this green rectangle right over here,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.857
let's say it had an area of

00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:10.647
268 square units,

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:12.253
whatever those units are.

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:14.366
You could imagine them
being square centimeters,

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.862
or if you imagine this being a big field

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:17.942
that you're looking at from space,

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:19.928
it could be square miles or something.

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:23.410
So I'm just gonna write square units.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.731
And lets say you knew the dimensions

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.766
of one side of the field.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.439
So let's say that you
knew, you knew that this...

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.793
let me just hit a color,

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:33.290
let's say you knew

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.551
that this side of the
field right over here,

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:40.406
the length of this side
of the field is two units.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.665
Two units.

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.366
And I haven't really drawn this to scale.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.491
If I wanted to draw it to
scale, it would be like,

00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.934
it would be much shorter,
it would be like that.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.589
But you would have trouble
seeing the rectangle then.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.250
But let's just assume it's two units.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.303
So if you know the whole
area is 268 square units,

00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:56.020
and one side is two units,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.330
what's the other side going to be?

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.710
What is the other side going to be?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.567
What is, what is...

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:05.006
let me pick another color.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.979
What is this side,

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.706
what is this side of this rectangular,

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:13.504
of this rectangle, this
field, whatever this might be,

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:16.359
what is the length of that side?

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.459
Well if you multiply these
two sides, you get the area,

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:20.980
so if you start with the area,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.103
if you start with 268,

00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:27.864
268, and you divide by the other side,

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.661
divide by the other side,

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.028
you're going to get the length
of this side right over here.

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:35.028
So if we wanted to figure
out the length of that side,

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.858
it would be 268 divided by two.

00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:40.867
And you've already seen,
or we've already seen,

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:45.139
multiple ways to figure out
what 268 divided by two is,

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.844
but the whole reason of
me drawing this rectangle,

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:49.585
or this aerial view of this field,

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:50.978
or whatever you want to call it,

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:54.206
is so that we visualize it using area.

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:55.518
And so one way to do it is,

00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:59.359
is to break up this 268 square unit area

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.359
into areas that are easier
to imagine dividing by two.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.576
So here I have the same field,
but I've just broken it up.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.097
So it's the same field,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:15.069
this dimension right over
here is still two units,

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.459
two units,

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.062
but I've broken it up.

00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:21.660
This blue area is 200...

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.095
let me do that in another color.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:28.859
So this blue area is 200 units,

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.877
this yellow area is 60 units,

00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:36.660
and this magenta area is eight units.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.633
Now why is that useful?

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:42.615
Well, now each of these, it's
much easier to divide by two.

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:47.352
All I did is I took the 268, and I said,

00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:50.253
"Well look, this is the same thing as

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.992
"200 plus 60...

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:57.173
"plus 60, plus eight."

00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:59.518
I just broke up the 268
into things that are

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:03.741
easier to divide by two, and
now I can take those things

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:05.678
and divide by two.

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.340
I can take each of them and divide by two.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.234
So what is, what is this,

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:14.299
what is this dimension going
to be, right over here?

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.200
Actually let me do that
in a different color.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.730
What is this dimension
right over here going to be?

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.070
Well two times that is
going to be a hundred,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.801
so this is going to be 100.

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:25.989
And how did we get that?

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.542
Well we got that by 200 divided by two.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.526
200 divided by two is 100.

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:33.771
What's 60 divided by two?

00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:37.968
Well, 60 divided by two is going to be 30.

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.129
So this part of the field

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.102
is going to be 30 in that direction

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:43.208
and two in this direction.

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:46.640
And once again, not drawn to scale.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.184
And then finally, what's
this section going to be?

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:52.457
It's going to be, it's going to be,

00:03:52.457 --> 00:03:55.720
eight divided by two, which is four.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.038
Notice, hundred times two
is 200, 30 times two is 60,

00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:03.405
four times two is eight.

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.382
And so this whole length up here

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:09.140
is going to be 100, plus 30, plus four,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.146
or 134.

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:14.143
Now we've already seen other
ways of coming up with this.

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:17.382
You say, "Look, two hundreds
divided by two is 100,

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.923
"six tens divided by two is three tens,

00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:24.081
"eight ones divided by two is four ones."

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.484
And that's exactly what
we just did over here,

00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:30.506
but we visualized it using
this kind of a rectangle,

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:32.511
breaking it up into chunks that are,

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:34.953
maybe easier to imagine dividing by two.

00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:37.895
We broke it up into two hundreds,

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.055
two hundreds right over here.

00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:43.863
We broke it up into six tens, or 60,

00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:46.799
or 60 right over here.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.826
And we broke it up into
eight ones, eight ones.

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:52.754
We broke up the area, and then
we took each of those areas

00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:55.738
and we divided it by two to
find that part of the length.

00:04:55.738 --> 00:04:59.081
And when you add them all
together, you get the entire,

00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:01.717
you get the entire length.

00:05:01.717 --> 00:05:03.323
Now, that's just one way to do it,

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:04.955
where you take each of the place values

00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:07.598
and you break up your field
or your rectangle like that,

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.077
but you could do it other ways.

00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:11.074
You don't always have to
break it up that much.

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:16.074
For example, let's say,
let's say that this...

00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:19.188
let's say that this area

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:23.767
is 856 square units.

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.544
Square units...

00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:31.003
Now let's say that this
dimension right over here

00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:33.801
is eight, is eight units.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.239
Is eight units.

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:37.864
So how could we break this up

00:05:37.864 --> 00:05:39.025
so it's easier to think about

00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:41.278
what the other dimension would be,

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:43.053
what the length is going to be?

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:43.952
And this length, once again,

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:47.859
is going to be 856 divided by eight.

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:52.648
856 divided by eight

00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:55.394
is this length right over here.

00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:56.740
Well you could break it up in to

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.780
eight hundreds, five tens, and six ones,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.876
but you might notice,

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.940
"Well five tens, it's not so
easy to divide that by eight."

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.169
But we can divide 56 by eight.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.001
We know that eight times seven is 56.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.474
So what you could do is, you
could break this rectangle

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.296
into the 856 square units,

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:17.672
you could break it up
in to 800 square units,

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:22.653
and then another 56, and
another 56 square units.

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:25.473
So once again, we broke it
up in to eight hundreds,

00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:28.120
and then 56 ones.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.140
And then 50...

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.113
56...

00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:33.611
856 ones.

00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:35.759
Same area, I just broke it up.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.995
And now if you say, "Look, this is eight."

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:42.074
if you say, if you say, "This
right over here is eight,

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:47.074
"well what is going to be, what
is going to be this length?

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:48.994
"What is this length up here going to be?"

00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:52.035
Well it's going to be 800 divided by,

00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:54.310
it's going to be 800 divided by eight.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.573
So actually, let me write it below it.

00:06:55.573 --> 00:06:57.155
So 800 divided by eight,

00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:59.232
this length right over
here is going to be,

00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:01.694
is going to be 100.

00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:02.502
How did I get that?

00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:05.618
I got eight hundreds
divided by eight is 100.

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.544
800 divided by eight is 100.

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:10.517
And then you have this other magenta part.

00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:12.711
What is 56 divided by eight?

00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:13.894
Well that's seven.

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:16.797
56 divided by eight, this
length right over here,

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:18.167
is going to be seven.

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:20.036
So what's this entire length?

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.649
What's this entire length?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.611
It's going to be a hundred plus seven,

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:26.783
which is equal to 107.

00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:27.659
So once again, you could have said,

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:30.243
"Look, eight goes into
800 a hundred times,

00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:32.587
"eight goes into 56 seven times, 107,

00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:34.945
"why did Sal draw these rectangles?"

00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:36.488
Well just so that you can help...

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:38.578
it's sometimes helpful
to visualize, and say,

00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:41.132
"Look, you're trying,
this is an area problem.

00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:44.117
"If this is the total area,
if 856 is the total area,

00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:46.426
"and eight is one of the dimensions,

00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:48.745
"well then 856 divided by eight

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:50.670
"is going to be the other dimension."

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.559
And one way, when you're
breaking this up by place value,

00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:54.743
you're breaking up the numbers into

00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:56.914
pieces that are easier to divide by eight,

00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.402
you can think of it as you're
just breaking up that area

00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:02.305
and you're just trying to
figure out parts of this length.

00:08:02.305 --> 00:08:04.082
So that's a hundred right over there,

00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:06.543
and then this right over here is seven.

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:09.468
So anyway, hopefully this broadens your

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:11.685
visualization capabilities

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:14.146
when you are dividing multiple,

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:17.024
when you're doing division.
