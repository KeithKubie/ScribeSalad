00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Genetically engineered microbes have long been used as

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.640
living foundries for the production of drugs and fine chemicals.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.130
More recently, different laboratories have

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.325
combined bacteria with semiconductor nanotechnology.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.120
When you put semiconductor nano particles on the surface of the microbes,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
they function similarly to solar panels on the surface of a house.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.375
So, in other words they are able to convert

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:26.145
light energy into other forms of energy to boost the bio-synthetic potential of the cells.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.620
The first biological inorganic hybrids or

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.325
bio-hybrids focused on organisms that could convert

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.610
carbon dioxide into relatively simple organic molecules that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.040
could be for example used as alternative energy sources.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.940
In a project led by two postdoctoral fellows in my lab,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.205
Junling Guo and Miguel SuÃ¡stegui who come from vastly different disciplinary backgrounds,

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:50.900
we've extended this concept of bio-hybrids to baker's yeast which is already

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.380
an industrial workhorse and can be genetically manipulated

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.270
relatively easily to produce a more complex range of molecules.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.010
Genetically programmed yeasts are broadly used in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.160
bio manufacturing to produce high value chemicals and medicines.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.220
A yeast cell is like a tiny factory with a highly complex system of metabolic pathways,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.715
many of which are linked to each other.

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:17.060
Engineered yeasts use renewable carbon sources to generate

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.990
energy and precursors for the synthesis of chemical products,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.985
some of which are very useful for pharmaceutical and other industries.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.415
For example, the yeast metabolize shikimic acid

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:32.550
is a key precursor to the influenza drug Tamiflu.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.865
The pathway that produces shikimic acid starts from the raw material glucose,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.769
which is taken up as a carbon source into the cell,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.540
converted over several steps into

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.540
3-dehydroshikimic acid or DHS and eventually to shikimic acid.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.805
The final conversion of DHS to shikimic acid

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.085
consumes the energy stored in the molecule, NADPH.

00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:00.915
The energy depleted from, NADP+,

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:06.325
is recharged by the pentose phosphate pathway and becomes NADPH again.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:10.040
However, the pentose phosphate pathway consumes glucose and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.240
diverts some of the yeast carbon flow away from shikimic acid production.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.580
To enable yeast cells to funnel more of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.700
the carbon atoms from glucose towards shikimic acid production,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.825
we have genetically modified them to shut down their pentose phosphate pathway.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:26.510
However, this also means that the energy carrier,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.390
NADPH needed for shikimic acid synthesis is significantly reduced.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.730
To solve this energy crisis,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.770
our team now has enabled yeast cells to use

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.615
an external light source as an alternative energy source that drives their metabolism.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:44.930
The system works by installing tiny solar panels in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.590
the form of inorganic nano-particles on the yeast cell surface.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.140
The solar panel like nano-particles are

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.265
made of a semiconductor material, Indium Phosphide,

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.960
and coated with polyphenols which function as

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.950
a glue to attach the nano-particles to the yeast cell surface.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.740
Once attached, the nano-particles absorb

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.700
light energy and convert it into electrons that they hand over to

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.120
the yeast cells which in turn use the electrons to convert

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.275
NADP+ to NADPH in their cytosol,

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.075
thus accumulating energy to fuel metabolic processes.

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:23.360
In this way, the yeast cells are able to funnel more carbon atoms that they derived

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.085
from glucose toward shikimic acid significantly boosting its production.

00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:32.910
Combining genetically engineered yeast with an efficient semiconductor component provides

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.690
a biochemical energy to its metabolism without being

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.750
toxic which has been a problem with previous bio-hybrid systems.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.175
In this proof of concept study,

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:42.530
we focused on shikimic acid as a product because

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.900
its bio-synthetic pathway is well understood,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.310
and because it's an important synthetic precursor in the anti-viral drug,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.770
Tamiflu, other medicines, nutraceuticals,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.515
and several other fight chemicals.

00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:57.830
However, this approach also creates a scalable blueprint for

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.990
future bio-hybrid technologies in which

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.425
the identity of the semiconductor and the engineered cell

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:08.165
can be varied in a plug-and-play fashion greatly expanding the range of

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:11.270
drugs or fine chemicals that can be

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.630
produced in a cost effective bio-manufacturing process.
