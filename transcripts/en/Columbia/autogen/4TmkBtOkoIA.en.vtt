of the book that section on the early
 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.460
of the book that section on the early
civilizations in South America will be

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470
civilizations in South America will be
 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.860

gone from this chapter instead it will

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870
gone from this chapter instead it will
 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.930
gone from this chapter instead it will
be linked to a single chapter dealing

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940

with the pre-columbian Western
 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.760
with the pre-columbian Western
Hemisphere and that chapter will be

Hemisphere and that chapter will be
 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.550
Hemisphere and that chapter will be
moved from where it is currently chapter

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560
moved from where it is currently chapter
 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.390
moved from where it is currently chapter
12 to being around Chapter five so we

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400
12 to being around Chapter five so we
 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.790
12 to being around Chapter five so we
know it's it is instructive actually to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800
know it's it is instructive actually to
 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.350

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:42.980
look at the teeth and see whether they
have tooth decay but that that of course

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:42.990
have tooth decay but that that of course
 

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.980

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:47.610
teeth and people with bad teeth whereas
 

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.699

something like a blood group has this
 

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:52.069
something like a blood group has this
distinction of having a specific

distinction of having a specific
 

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:55.189
distinction of having a specific
boundary so the a group is sometimes

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199
boundary so the a group is sometimes
 

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:57.710

associated with agriculture and the B

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720

originally use milk from those animals
 

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.949
originally use milk from those animals
because everyone seems to think that

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959
 

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:13.210
that if you can't digest milk properly

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:13.220
that if you can't digest milk properly
 

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.670
that if you can't digest milk properly
you're not going to drink milk so the

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:15.680
you're not going to drink milk so the
 

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.350

then you discover that actually Japanese

the world you find that seemingly the

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:27.940
the world you find that seemingly the
 

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.480
the world you find that seemingly the
farther you go back in time the bigger

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:30.490
farther you go back in time the bigger
 

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:37.620
farther you go back in time the bigger
the stones are used as if somehow it was

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:37.630
the stones are used as if somehow it was
 

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.450
the stones are used as if somehow it was
hard for people to discover that it was

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:39.460
hard for people to discover that it was
 

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.400
hard for people to discover that it was
easier to carry a small stone in a big

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:41.410
easier to carry a small stone in a big
 

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.080
easier to carry a small stone in a big
stone which shouldn't have been a hard

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.090
stone which shouldn't have been a hard
 

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:48.510
stone which shouldn't have been a hard
discovery now I'm going to present a

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520
discovery now I'm going to present a
 

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.950
discovery now I'm going to present a
theory as to why big stones are so

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960
theory as to why big stones are so
 

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.340
theory as to why big stones are so
common and I will link here big stones

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:56.350
common and I will link here big stones
 

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:01.020
common and I will link here big stones
with big piles of dirt or in China with

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.030
with big piles of dirt or in China with
 

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.410
with big piles of dirt or in China with
tamped for that say where you take a big

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:04.420
tamped for that say where you take a big
 

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.990
tamped for that say where you take a big
pile of dirt and you drop it down for a

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000
pile of dirt and you drop it down for a
 

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.180
pile of dirt and you drop it down for a
few years to make it into sort of solid

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.190
few years to make it into sort of solid
 

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.970
few years to make it into sort of solid

the the the common feature between the

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.060
the the the common feature between the
 

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.460
the the the common feature between the
big stones and the and the big piles of

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:23.470
big stones and the and the big piles of
 

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:28.540
big stones and the and the big piles of
dirt and the tamped earth

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:28.550
 

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:34.210
seems to me to be that they are highly

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:34.220
seems to me to be that they are highly
 

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:39.320
seems to me to be that they are highly
highly labor-intensive and that they

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:39.330
highly labor-intensive and that they
 

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:44.500
highly labor-intensive and that they
tend to be focused on a single place as

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:44.510
tend to be focused on a single place as
 

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.260
tend to be focused on a single place as
you go slightly later in time and you

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.270
you go slightly later in time and you
 

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.980
you go slightly later in time and you
get to using bricks or smaller stones

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:50.990
get to using bricks or smaller stones
 

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:54.620
get to using bricks or smaller stones
you have a greater likelihood so far as

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:54.630
you have a greater likelihood so far as
 

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.410
you have a greater likelihood so far as
I can see that the structures will be

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420
I can see that the structures will be
 

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.110
I can see that the structures will be
dispersed rather than concentrated in a

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.120
dispersed rather than concentrated in a
 

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.530
dispersed rather than concentrated in a
single place

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:02.540
single place
 

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:09.980
single place
so the as you move to smaller stones you

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:09.990
so the as you move to smaller stones you
 

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:15.050
so the as you move to smaller stones you
get greater dispersal but for these big

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060
get greater dispersal but for these big
 

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.000
get greater dispersal but for these big
stone things they tend to be

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.010
stone things they tend to be
 

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.370
stone things they tend to be
concentrated in a single single spot

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:21.380
concentrated in a single single spot
 

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.890

with grain agriculture that's something

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140
with grain agriculture that's something
 

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.560

that's you know worth worth getting into

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:12.570
that's you know worth worth getting into
 

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:16.210
that's you know worth worth getting into
now why would this happen

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:16.220
 

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.870
if you have a productive of a

if you have a productive of a
 

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.120
if you have a productive of a
substantial of foodstuffs that are

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.130
substantial of foodstuffs that are
 

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:29.230
substantial of foodstuffs that are
storable such as grain or for that

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240
storable such as grain or for that
 

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.329
storable such as grain or for that
matter you know dried yams or manioc and

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:34.339
matter you know dried yams or manioc and
 

00:38:34.339 --> 00:38:35.710
matter you know dried yams or manioc and
so forth but let's stick here with the

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720
so forth but let's stick here with the
 

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.819
so forth but let's stick here with the
grain if you have a a substantial amount

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:39.829
grain if you have a a substantial amount
 

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:42.970
grain if you have a a substantial amount
of food stuff that is storable and that

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:42.980
of food stuff that is storable and that
 

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.839
of food stuff that is storable and that
is surplus beyond what you are going to

00:38:46.839 --> 00:38:46.849
is surplus beyond what you are going to
 

00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:50.440
is surplus beyond what you are going to
eat in a given season or save for the

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.450
eat in a given season or save for the
 

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:55.870
eat in a given season or save for the
next season then you have the temptation

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880
next season then you have the temptation
 

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.250
next season then you have the temptation
of those people who are able to steal

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:00.260
of those people who are able to steal
 

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.760
of those people who are able to steal
the surplus from everyone else that's

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:03.770
the surplus from everyone else that's
 

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:10.300
the surplus from everyone else that's
what we call taxation you know it's

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.310
what we call taxation you know it's
 

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.710
what we call taxation you know it's
associated with the rise of towns of

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720
associated with the rise of towns of
 

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.460
associated with the rise of towns of
kingdoms and so forth that you have some

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:18.470
kingdoms and so forth that you have some
 

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.640
kingdoms and so forth that you have some
group of people who are bringing the

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:21.650
group of people who are bringing the
 

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:27.180
group of people who are bringing the
surplus together now how do you do that

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.190
surplus together now how do you do that
 

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.559
surplus together now how do you do that
here you have a village and it's growing

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:31.569
here you have a village and it's growing
 

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:36.069
here you have a village and it's growing
but they tweet and now you come to the

00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079
but they tweet and now you come to the
 

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:39.609
but they tweet and now you come to the
end of the harvest and somebody comes to

00:39:39.609 --> 00:39:39.619
end of the harvest and somebody comes to
 

00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:42.550
end of the harvest and somebody comes to
the village and says I'm from the

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560
the village and says I'm from the
 

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.660
the village and says I'm from the
government and I'm going to take

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:45.670
government and I'm going to take
 

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.839
government and I'm going to take
one-third of all your wheat then the

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:49.849
one-third of all your wheat then the
 

00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:52.450
one-third of all your wheat then the
people who village who are quivering in

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:52.460
people who village who are quivering in
 

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.780
people who village who are quivering in
fear say yeah go ahead take 1/3 of the

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:55.790
fear say yeah go ahead take 1/3 of the
 

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:59.550
fear say yeah go ahead take 1/3 of the
wheat we've hit in half of it anyway and

00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560
wheat we've hit in half of it anyway and
 

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.970
wheat we've hit in half of it anyway and
so then the guy says yeah well now you

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:03.980
so then the guy says yeah well now you
 

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.349
so then the guy says yeah well now you
have to carry it to where the King lives

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359
have to carry it to where the King lives
 

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:10.420
have to carry it to where the King lives
because I can't carry it that's a lot of

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:10.430
because I can't carry it that's a lot of
 

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:15.630
because I can't carry it that's a lot of
wheat so you so that when you have large

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640
wheat so you so that when you have large
 

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.930
wheat so you so that when you have large
quantities of stuff that are claimed by

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:19.940
quantities of stuff that are claimed by
 

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.100
quantities of stuff that are claimed by
people who

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.110
people who
 

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.040
people who
have the power to collect the surplus

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.050
have the power to collect the surplus
 

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.980
have the power to collect the surplus
whether it is olive oil or wine or grain

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:26.990
whether it is olive oil or wine or grain
 

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.560
whether it is olive oil or wine or grain
or whatever and we know fair about about

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:29.570
or whatever and we know fair about about
 

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.810
or whatever and we know fair about about
this because when all these things are

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:31.820
this because when all these things are
 

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.520
this because when all these things are
brought together in storehouses this is

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:33.530
brought together in storehouses this is
 

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.870
brought together in storehouses this is
one of the main reasons for the

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880
one of the main reasons for the
 

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.360
one of the main reasons for the
invention of writing was to heat

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:37.370
invention of writing was to heat
 

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.130
invention of writing was to heat
notations of what was in the storehouse

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.140
notations of what was in the storehouse
 

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.380
notations of what was in the storehouse
to keep the store housekeeper from

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:41.390
to keep the store housekeeper from
 

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.820
to keep the store housekeeper from
selling it out the back door so you have

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:45.830
selling it out the back door so you have
 

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.730
selling it out the back door so you have
to bring all this stuff to one place all

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:48.740
to bring all this stuff to one place all
 

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:53.650
to bring all this stuff to one place all
right now you have a storehouse where

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:53.660
right now you have a storehouse where
 

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.060

to do is to bring in all the surplus to
 

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:02.650
to do is to bring in all the surplus to

let's say one oxen is worth eight men
pulling on a rope so you can divide the

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:06.190
pulling on a rope so you can divide the
 

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.800
pulling on a rope so you can divide the
number of people pulling let's say at

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:07.810
number of people pulling let's say at
 

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.000
number of people pulling let's say at
eight hundred people pulling now you can

eight hundred people pulling now you can
 

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.350
eight hundred people pulling now you can
say just have builders have one hundred

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:10.360
say just have builders have one hundred
 

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:14.280

oxen you can't say to the oxen one two

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:14.290
oxen you can't say to the oxen one two
 

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:18.360
oxen you can't say to the oxen one two
three pull because they don't know what

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.370
three pull because they don't know what
 

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:23.060
three pull because they don't know what
you're talking about and getting animals

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.070
you're talking about and getting animals
 

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:26.430
you're talking about and getting animals
that are not harnessed in a single team

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440
that are not harnessed in a single team
 

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.450

to pull at the same time is a difficult

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:30.460
to pull at the same time is a difficult
 

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:35.000
to pull at the same time is a difficult
process it's easier to break your loads

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.010
process it's easier to break your loads
 

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.760
process it's easier to break your loads
into the sizes that is most convenient

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:38.770
into the sizes that is most convenient
 

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:41.220
into the sizes that is most convenient
for the animals to pull maybe you can

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:41.230
for the animals to pull maybe you can
 

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.560
for the animals to pull maybe you can
harness to animals or for animals or six

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:43.570
harness to animals or for animals or six
 

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.530
harness to animals or for animals or six
or eight animals but you can't harness

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:46.540
or eight animals but you can't harness
 

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.980
or eight animals but you can't harness
as many as you can with the humans so

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:49.990
as many as you can with the humans so
 

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:52.730
as many as you can with the humans so
when you have the harnessing of animals

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740
when you have the harnessing of animals
 

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.170
when you have the harnessing of animals
the size the average size of the stones

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:55.180
the size the average size of the stones
 

00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.420
the size the average size of the stones
goes down and it moves closer to what is

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:00.430
goes down and it moves closer to what is
 

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:04.050

you have your bricks bricks are great

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:10.900
you have your bricks bricks are great
 

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.890
you have your bricks bricks are great
because bricks are modular and you can

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:13.900
because bricks are modular and you can
 

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.570
because bricks are modular and you can
divide them into the number of bricks

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:16.580
divide them into the number of bricks

and you don't like some of the others
 

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.330
and you don't like some of the others
and so it just don't have enough to use

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:46.340
and so it just don't have enough to use
 

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.140
and so it just don't have enough to use
a lot of collective labor so you get an

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:50.150
a lot of collective labor so you get an
 

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:54.820
a lot of collective labor so you get an

more human muscle power that's a shift

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:01.790
more human muscle power that's a shift
 

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.520
more human muscle power that's a shift
of the energy profile it's not a shift

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:03.530
of the energy profile it's not a shift
 

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:05.770
of the energy profile it's not a shift
in the nature of the energy because the

in the nature of the energy because the
 

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:10.200
in the nature of the energy because the
energy is still human muscle and the

energy is still human muscle and the
 

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.150
energy is still human muscle and the
human muscle is fueled by consumption of

have a shift in an energy profile so

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:49.730
have a shift in an energy profile so
 

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:52.870
have a shift in an energy profile so
you're using a lot of animal power

you're using a lot of animal power
 

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.670
you're using a lot of animal power
you're still using muscle power for a

you're still using muscle power for a
lot of things human muscle power but

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:56.630
lot of things human muscle power but
 

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.160
lot of things human muscle power but
you're increasingly using animal power

00:54:59.160 --> 00:54:59.170
you're increasingly using animal power
 

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.690
you're increasingly using animal power

then that becomes a questionable Society
so you look at the at the Western

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:00.010
so you look at the at the Western
 

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:04.440
so you look at the at the Western
Hemisphere and you say oops no wheels

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:04.450
Hemisphere and you say oops no wheels
 

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:08.760
Hemisphere and you say oops no wheels
and in fact you know they didn't know

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:08.770
and in fact you know they didn't know
 

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.610
and in fact you know they didn't know
how to harness animals and in fact they

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:11.620
how to harness animals and in fact they
 

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.120
how to harness animals and in fact they
didn't have any animals to harness oh

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:14.130
didn't have any animals to harness oh
 

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.580
didn't have any animals to harness oh
it's not really true in one of the

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:17.590
it's not really true in one of the
 

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:21.030
it's not really true in one of the
interesting things is that 10:00 they

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:21.040
interesting things is that 10:00 they
 

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.990
interesting things is that 10:00 they
had dogs they use dogs use dogs to pull

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000
had dogs they use dogs use dogs to pull
 

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.650
had dogs they use dogs use dogs to pull
two sticks a travel ah that you could

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:28.660
two sticks a travel ah that you could
 

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.900
two sticks a travel ah that you could
load things on but even beyond that

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:32.910
load things on but even beyond that
 

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:36.450
load things on but even beyond that
where do they use dogs in the far north

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:36.460
where do they use dogs in the far north
 

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:42.090
where do they use dogs in the far north
using dogs to pull sleds large numbers

of dogs effectively harnessed to the
same task why didn't they use dogs

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:49.110
same task why didn't they use dogs
 

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:51.900

why is a wheelbarrow preferred because
only has one wheel so the friction that

you only have one as soon as you have
 

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.390
you only have one as soon as you have
two then you have the problem of

you're pushing and you just hate it
 

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:16.330
you're pushing and you just hate it
because one wheel isn't turning right

but with the wheelbarrow you just have

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560
but with the wheelbarrow you just have
 

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.140
but with the wheelbarrow you just have
the one wheel and yet there are no

wheelbarrow you say well this is a
 

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:54.500
wheelbarrow you say well this is a
pretty bad design because it's a lever

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:54.510
pretty bad design because it's a lever
 

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.830
pretty bad design because it's a lever
in which you have a fulcrum which is the

carrying most of the weight when you
 

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.330
carrying most of the weight when you
lift it why couldn't you have another
