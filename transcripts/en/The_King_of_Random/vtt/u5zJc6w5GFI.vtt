00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.700
Ha ha ha kakimora revenge. Bye. Bye. Hey guys

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.760
It's time to get frosty what do you think would happen if we tried putting a coconut in liquid nitrogen?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.340
Would it crack open? For today's experiment

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.440
I jumped down to the comments

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.360
And I pulled this one out from Tommy Linden who says "could you please try a coconut in liquid nitrogen to see if it cracks?"

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.060
Open that's an interesting request there tommy so today we're doing this experiment for you now to make this experiment possible today

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.640
I ran down to the grocery store this morning and picked up four coconuts

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.740
I'm also bringing back this monster filled with 35 liters of liquid nitrogen as well as this styrofoam crate

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.860
I'm using styrofoam because it has more insulating properties than some of the containers

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.420
I've used in the past and the hope is I'll be able to save more liquid nitrogen by using styrofoam rather than metal dish

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:53.320
[Music]

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.280
So here we are guys. I've literally just emptied the rest of my dewar into the styrofoam container

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.069
And this thing is full of a lot of nitrogen in fact. I'm completely out now

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.830
I may have to make some more this thing is almost full to the top

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.739
We better not spill it because things get awfully cold if we did, but this is exactly the kind of setup

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.650
I wanted because I want to be able to submerge these coconuts completely

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.139
I want them to freeze as quickly as possible. No shallow containers. We're going all in I just need to grab pair of tongs

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.619
Are these things even strong enough to pick up a coconut ?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.560
That could work. This is pretty sketchy, but I think it's going to work. Alright, coconut number one, here we go

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240
And we're going all in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.780
Bubble bubble bubble this thing wants to float look at that the coconut is floating

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.410
I take it back, no actually it is kind of floating

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.339
That's like half and half, half's floating and half's not

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.409
You can definitely tell where the coconut is because there's like isolated boiling

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.790
All this is pretty calm

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.790
And then this is boiling right over here which means that's where our coconut  that got little pieces of coconut husk floating around

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.499
Alright, we've been in for about 15 seconds and pull it out and take a look

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oop if I can get it out

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.440
There we go. This thing is slippery these aren't the best tongs

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.660
We got some cracking there. That's cool

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630
Looking that's getting a little crispy I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.600
Can still hear the water shaking around the inside?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.649
I'm kind of tempted to freeze this thing until the water doesn't shake anymore

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.939
Like can we freeze it solid?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.220
Just for the sake of time. I'm going to go ahead and throw in all four coconuts at once

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.270
What do you think about that but before we do let's just check on coconut number one?

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.040
Looking pretty good. That's cold. Here we go,  check that little guy out

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300
Listening listen to the crack

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
The water inside is still liquid

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.610
You can see it cracking on the outside of the shell here. I'm just curious to know at this point

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.610
if I capped it with a hammer

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360
Apparently not much all right. Let's go back in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.940
along with all of his little buddies ha ha ha ha kakimura revenge

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580
bye-bye

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.980
Whoo doggy wait. I want to play, too.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820
Oh gosh, that's a lot of lookin I think I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.989
I got the lid on just to prevent the nitrogen from escaping too rapidly now

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.880
Let's just go ahead and let that sit for about 10 minutes

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.040
And then come back and craft our footnotes with a hammer

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.010
All right guys it is 15 minutes later check her out the edges here the gaps of the styrofoam look at it's getting all

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.260
Frosty all this stuff is like shooting out like spikes. It's very very cool like mini icicles do that with that all around the gap

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.530
Cool

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.570
Hopefully that's been able to salvage a little bit of nitrogen, and I'm seeing we've only dropped about 2 inches in volume

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.349
Which is very very good considering you're not a mass we head in there now the question is have these

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.350
Coconuts frozen all the way through let's do the shake test

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039
If I can even get these things out there we go

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.359
Coconut on number 1. Oh wow my gloves are freezing shaking it

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.850
well

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.500
I don't hear any of the water shaking around, so

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.369
Potentially this thing now is completely frozen. I'm going to give it a little drop test three, two, one

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.130
Three , two , one

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.809
Maybe a little bit harder a forceful drop.There we go look at that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.200
Look at that. Oh my gosh. You know what?

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.110
What?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.780
The shell just came right off and that is all the meat

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.649
Oh boy, oh, wow wow wow look at that?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.330
There's our coconut water frozen completely solid here's our coconut meat

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.289
I wonder if we can get the rest of this thing out look at that it just all falls out

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.070
Whoa

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.520
There's our shell. There's our coconut meat. There's our coconut water

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.080
That's crazy. I got to put that in the glass before it thaws

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.029
You know what's really cool about this is this thing just fell right out of the shell

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.489
I have never got the meat out of a coconut as cleanly as that that is absolutely perfect

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.590
There's nothing left in there no scraping no risking cutting off your fingers with the blade of a knife

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.180
No endless prying it just like cracked and fell right out

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.180
Easiest coconut de meating ever. Is 
de meating even a word?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.800
Now I do have to say this is quite cold to hang on to but if I keep moving it, it doesn't freeze my fingers

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.540
Grab it smack it rotate smack it rotate smack it what that's doing is. It's breaking up everything on the inside just

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.219
Just like that look at how that shatters. This is a coconut, and it just shattered

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280
into a bajillion pieces

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.760
Me that the shell just falls right away

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.370
Now my hands getting really cold okay, take these pieces of coconut water there now like glass

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.650
Put them in a cup that'll cool you down in the hot summer sun

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.210
Look at that

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.210
It looks like a ball of ice

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.729
pure coconut water

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800
That's a little gem. I'm hanging on to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.920
Goes right in there oop these pieces of the meat here are extremely hard and extremely brittle

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.540
That's satisfying. Okay next

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.480
No skinny cracks yet

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.219
Hulk Smash

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.179
That's the way to get it done right there look at that. Oh

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.590
Wouldn't it be cool if we get the whole coconut out in one piece.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.110
Oh look at that

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.639
What?

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.158
That's the inside of the coconut it's completely intact no cracks

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.879
But that's the meat and on the inside of the meat is the coconut water

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.539
Look at all the veins in it. It almost looks like some kind of organ like it seriously does look organic

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.889
That's so cool. Eel heart. This is kind of mind-blowing guys

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.218
this is what the inside of your coconut looks like if you remove the shell it's completely intact unscratched and

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.039
Still full of coconut water. I'm going to let this file out because I'm quite proud of that. I think we can do it again

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.240
Probably not

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.909
All right last one. No cracks to begin with transfer it to the chopping block

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.859
You can see how brittle that shell is just a few taps from a hammer and starts cracking all over

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.849
and then

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:07.899
Just pops right off. I wasn't quite as lucky with this one

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:14.199
You can see the meat did crack we turn this upside down the rest of it falls out. It's freezing. My hand like crazy

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.799
Here we go transfer our coconut water in there

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.190
Look at that

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:27.569
It's like a coconut puzzle 3D puzzle. Good luck trying to put that back together so guys that's pretty cool

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.189
And I have to admit. I never really know what to expect. We're going to try something like this and the results are always

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.360
Mind-blowing we start off just trying to see what would happen if you put a coconut and liquid nitrogen

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.680
Would it actually get cold enough that it would crack but in four different cases?

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.379
We didn't see any of our coconut shells begin to crack

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.329
But we did notice that the shells were brittle enough if we give them a little tap with a hammer or drop them hard enough

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.189
Under something like a concrete surface they would crack enough to expose the meat and the water on the inside

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.970
We also notice this only works as well as it does if you shake the coconut

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.590
And you can't hear the water sloshing around

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.670
It needs to be frozen completely solid and what was completely mind-blowing for me

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.499
It was coconut number three because we removed the shelf and kept the inner parts completely intact

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.810
I don't know about you, but I have never actually seen the inside of a coconut in whole and intact like this before

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.779
It's very well could be a first very cool

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.230
I'm going to let this thing thaw and when it's completely warmed back up to room temperature

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.400
The whole thing will be edible outside and in the heart of the coconut

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.100
Getting this stuff out of the shells really is most of the work

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.639
But as long as they got a little bit of liquid nitrogen and a hammer no sweat

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.080
And a big thanks to Tommy Linden for suggesting this experiment today, you can go check your Youtube inbox

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.080
Tommy I'm sending you 25 bucks

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.879
So there you have a guy's liquid nitrogen versus coconut very cool experiment and very glad that you were here to join me for it

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.819
Thanks for hopping into this video. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.180
Stuff is pretty dang expensive, so I'm saving it

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.440
Sweet now we have more for another day
