00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.590
In the last lesson,
Rachel told you a bit about equations.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.980
Today, we're going to learn how
to visualize those equations.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.380
How to make a picture
from them using Graphing.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.970
When I was a kid,
in order to make a little extra money.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.410
I would rake leaves.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.740
Usually, in my neighbor's backyards or
something.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.280
And I charged $10 per hour.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.620
So to get us thinking mathematically.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.520
Maybe you can tell me,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.110
how much money would I make if
I worked 5 hours or 10 hours?

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.120
You can enter your answers here and
here, and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.670
notice have already given
you the dollar sign.
