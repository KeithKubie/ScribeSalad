00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.769
In conclusion I would like to say that
this has been a fantastic journey for us

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.619
and the wonderful team of people that
I've had in my lab. That's really, for me,

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
that's one of the best things to see.
These people do great work and they kind

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
of move on and set up their own labs and
flourish on their own. And in terms of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.340
where we are now in terms of
understanding T-cell exhaustion and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
understanding how to restore function
back and in terms of clinic, I think we

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
still have a ways to go, because 
we would want to be able to get

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
much better response rates in the cancer
patients. Wwe want to be sure that there

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.059
is durability of the treatment that
they're getting. So here would require

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.719
greater understanding of the T-cell
exhaustion mechanisms. I would say maybe beyond PD-1.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.309
You know, what can you do beyond PD-1, to take it to even to the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.770
next stage. Combination therapies with either cytokines or other inhibitory

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.740
receptors, or with therapeutic
vaccinations are possibilities, but there

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.100
are other ways. Also there is a work that
we and others are doing looking at the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.520
epigenetic landscape of exhausted cells
and could we change basically the insides.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.259
The PD-1 actually is working at
the outside... well, inside can we change

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.540
the chromatin of the cell? Can we change
the epigenetic landscape of the cell?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.549
So these are not easy to do, but there are
ways of doing this. There are enzymes

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.640
that methylate for example the DNA that
regulates gene expression. So, one we have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
some preliminary data, that modulating
some of these methyl transferases will

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.979
change the function of the cells. 
So there's very exciting and challenging

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.689
things that can be done to what I would
call changing the insides of the cell.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.549
So the goal would be release the brake and
change the insides of the cell.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.679
The next stage now is that why doesn't
everyone respond? Why is it only that the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.790
rates are for melanoma,
the rates are actually quite high.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.959
Melenoma responses are as high as 40
percent response rate to late stage melanoma.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.269
But then you ask what about the other 50%.
Why don't they respond?

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.459
I think this is for us the
next challenge.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.659
Are there other inhibitory receptors
that need to be identified and the

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.930
the right combination tried? Or do you need to provide some other kinds of stimulus?

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.269
Do you need to combine the PD-1
blockade with a therapeutic vaccine with

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:50.569
a vaccine against the cancer antigen? 
So there's a very active area of research - many companies, many groups. And we're
also exploring these things and how can

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.109
you take it from being 30%, 40% out to
80% or 90%. That's a very, very high bar

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.480
but I think that's what the goal will be
for us and for all the other people

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.680
working in this in this area.
The other question is and for this we don't have

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.409
the answer yet. PD-1 has only gone into
cancer patients in the last few years,

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.750
and as I mentioned to you, in lung cancer
the response rates are between 20% in

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.879
that range for melanoma about 40-50 %
range, 40% range, but the question is...

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.840
so instead of their survival being
three months now, they're still alive two

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.319
years or three years. But the question is,
how long will be the durability of this

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.099
response? Will the cancer again come 
back, if it come back what then?

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.549
Two issues that need to be assessed: how long will be the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.560
durability of this effectiveness and 
how can we get a response in the patients

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.449
who don't get the response. So I think
this science here is very exciting.

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:52.519
I would encourage any medical student who looks at this to go into the area of

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.180
cancer immunology - fascinating area where you can do basic science and also see

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.750
applications in the clinic very quickly.
And again I think the main message I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.030
want to give you is do fundamental
discovery work and that will

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.569
result in something useful.
