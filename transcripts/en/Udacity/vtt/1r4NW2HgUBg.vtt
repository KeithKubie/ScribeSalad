00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.790
The first practice that we just saw goes together with

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.320
small releases practice. This idea that instead of having a big

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.390
release at the end of a long development cycle, we try

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.610
to release very often. And there are many advantages to small

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.260
releases and to releasing often. The first one is that

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.980
we deliver real business value on a very short cycle. And

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.070
what that means is that we get business value sooner, and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.550
that in turn increase our customer confidence and makes the customer

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.040
more happy. So more releases also mean rapid feedback. We

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.420
release the software soon, we get feedback from the customer soon,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.710
and we can in this way do exactly what we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.510
were saying before, steer instead of driving, adapt weekly to possible

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.680
changes in the requirements. We avoid working for six months

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.970
on a project and find out six months later that the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.950
customer wanted something else and we got the wrong requirements. In

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.610
addition having small releases, so seeing your product deployed and released

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.040
soon produces a sense of accomplishment for the developers.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.000
And in addition, it also reduces risk because again,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.640
if we're going down the wrong path, we will

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.730
know right away. If we're late, we will know right

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.370
away. So these are just additional advantages of having

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.140
this quick cycle and more releases. And finally, as we

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.130
also said before, we can quickly adapt in the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.540
case our requirements change our code to the new requirements.
