00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:11.090
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.839
the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.139
But before the poisons could end his life,

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.620
a leaf drifted into his mouth.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.130
He chewed on it and it revived him,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.701
and that is how we discovered tea.

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.562
Or so an ancient legend goes at least.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.461
Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings,

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.082
but the story of Shennong,

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.540
the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.682
highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China.

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.811
Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there

00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:44.271
as early as 6,000 years ago,

00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:48.535
or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:50.080
That original Chinese tea plant

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.952
is the same type that's grown 
around the world today,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.631
yet it was originally consumed
very differently.

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:59.291
It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.751
Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:06.252
when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:10.992
could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:14.032
After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method,

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.101
the standard became to heat tea,

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:17.992
pack it into portable cakes,

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:19.706
grind it into powder,

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:21.203
mix with hot water,

00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:25.634
and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:30.141
Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged.

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:32.192
Tea was the subject of books and poetry,

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.983
the favorite drink of emperors,

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:35.853
and a medium for artists.

00:01:35.853 --> 00:01:38.703
They would draw extravagant pictures
in the foam of the tea,

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:42.932
very much like the espresso art
you might see in coffee shops today.

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:45.373
In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty,

00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:49.354
a Japanese monk brought the first
tea plant to Japan.

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:53.243
The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals around tea,

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:56.394
leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:59.034
And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty,

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.284
the Chinese emperor 
shifted the standard

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:04.845
from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea.

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:08.754
At that point, China still held a
virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees,

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.416
making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods,

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:14.855
along with porcelain and silk.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:17.806
This gave China a great deal of power
and economic influence

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:20.585
as tea drinking spread around the world.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.623
That spread began in earnest
around the early 1600s

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:27.195
when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities.

00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:30.725
Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese noble woman,

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:33.785
for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:37.915
when she married King Charles II in 1661.

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:41.834
At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst of expanding its colonial influence

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.766
and becoming the new dominant world power.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.586
And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world.

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:53.195
By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:56.287
and the plant was still 
only grown in China.

00:02:56.287 --> 00:02:57.844
The tea trade was so lucrative

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.531
that the world's fastest sailboat, 
the clipper ship,

00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:04.926
was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies.

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:07.495
All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.776
to maximize their profits.

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:13.656
At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver.

00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:15.220
When that proved too expensive,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.689
they suggested trading tea 
for another substance, opium.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.108
This triggered a public health problem
within China

00:03:22.108 --> 00:03:24.796
as people became addicted to the drug.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:28.038
Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men

00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:30.547
to destroy massive 
British shipments of opium

00:03:30.547 --> 00:03:33.927
as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China.

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:37.598
This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations.

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:41.488
Fighting raged up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:45.437
when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded
the port of Hong Kong to the British

00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:48.131
and resumed trading on unfavorable terms.

00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:52.077
The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century.

00:03:52.077 --> 00:03:56.818
The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves

00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:58.948
and further control the market.

00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:01.391
So they commissioned 
botanist Robert Fortune

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:05.108
to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation.

00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:07.479
He disguised himself 
and took a perilous journey

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.458
through China's mountainous tea regions,

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.428
eventually smuggling tea trees 
and experienced tea workers

00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:14.858
into Darjeeling, India.

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.039
From there, 
the plant spread further still,

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.389
helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.699
Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water,

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.449
and from sugary Turkish Rize tea,

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.440
to salty Tibetan butter tea,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.041
there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.299
as there are cultures on the globe.
