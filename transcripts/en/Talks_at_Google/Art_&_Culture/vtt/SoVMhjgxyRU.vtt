[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:07.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:08.870
JOSH LANZET: I know.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.830
Good afternoon.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.757
My gosh.

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:11.840
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Thank you.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.380
How's lunch?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.130
Is it good?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.040
JOSH LANZET: I feel
like, if it were just me,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.498
that reception would have made
sense when everyone was just

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:19.820
dead silent.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.660
I get that, guys.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.975
I get that.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:23.850
Well, thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.240
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Thank you.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.323
JOSH LANZET: I know you
were traveling everywhere.

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:30.080
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: So I've
been on a 35-city tour

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.810
for the last seven weeks,
6 and 1/2, seven weeks.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.060
We've been out screening the
film at some film festivals,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.230
at libraries, for
homeless advocacy groups,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.940
and at some shelters.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
And the idea was to create
a grassroots awareness

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.320
of the film before we
ultimately landed in New York

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.390
and did the mainstream media,
which was "The Today Show,"

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.620
and Fallon, and Kelly and
Ryan, and all of those.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.870
JOSH LANZET: First name basis.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.555
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Even "Rachel Ray."

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:58.820
Yeah, even "Rachel Ray."

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.620
I'm exhausted, and I'm
really happy to be back

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.787
in LA, even for a moment.

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:09.870
JOSH LANZET: Yeah, I was
going to say, we get you,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.828
and then you disappear.

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:11.850
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Right.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330
JOSH LANZET: But yeah, I guess,
my first question for you--

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.960
I think that when you were
at the start of your career,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.870
you made a lot of movies that
resonated with a generation.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.890
And I think, as that generation
got older, a lot of the movies

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.080
that you started to direct
and pursue from a writing

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.840
perspective began to
also resonate with us,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.720
because those kind
of grew with us.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.510
You started to tackle a
little more serious topics

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.910
and serious things
of that nature.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.230
was that an intentional choice?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.350
And how did you start kind
of making that shift out?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.590
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well, I kind of
took a left turn, if you will,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.952
about 20-some years ago.

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:51.410
I would do one for the studio
or two for the studio and one

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.030
for me.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.370
And then it was all for
the studio and none for me.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.910
And then I thought, I'm
doing "Mighty Ducks 3,"

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.170
and I'm miserable.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.330
And this is not where
I really wanted to be.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:12.260
And so I decided to do movies
that spoke to the humanity

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.230
and to do films that,
ultimately-- this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
is where I've arrived,
especially during this tour

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.910
and with this
film, "The Public,"

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.350
is that, if you look at the "War
at Home," which we did in '95,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.350
where I played a Vietnam
vet suffering from PTSD,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.960
and then "Bobby," which was
about the day Bobby Kennedy

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.323
was shot at the Ambassador
Hotel here in LA,

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.490
and, really, what the world
looks like without Bobby

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.050
Kennedy, then "The
Way," which was

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.120
up about a spiritual
journey that takes place

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.170
in the north of Spain along the
Camino de Santiago about grief

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.780
and loss, and then "The Public."

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.150
All of the movies that
preceded "The Public,"

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.640
inform where we are
right now in terms

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.850
of where I've wanted to go.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.840
I believe that none of us
walk the planet pain-free.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.260
I think that we all have a
certain amount of trauma.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.280
And it's how we process that
trauma or not process it.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.940
And it's all about degrees.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.420
And so what all of these
movies have in common

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.580
is a shared trauma and shared
grief and how we process that.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.330
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.610
Yeah, a lot of your
movies resonate with me.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.040
I've seen so many of them.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.630
Before I get into
those, I guess,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.330
you're talking about
doing more movies for you.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.580
Is there a bigger challenge,
I think, in doing some

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.497
of those independents?

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:27.710
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Oh, yeah.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.490
You see what's going
on in movies these days

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.780
with the studios.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.200
And in many ways, they sort
of operate like big oil.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.040
They go out there with
their rigs and their drills,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.740
and they drill down
into your wallets.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.290
And they extract
enormous amounts of cash.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.990
When you're an
independent filmmaker,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.140
you're out there with a
divining rod and a shaman, just

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.430
trying to figure stuff out.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.710
And you're just like, oh,
we'll get a little money

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.793
from this person, a little
money from that person.

00:03:56.793 --> 00:03:59.840
And we'll cobble all of
these elements together--

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.400
actors, and funding,
and a location,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.390
where you're in a state
that provides a tax rebate,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.340
which is how we ended up
in Ohio and landed in Ohio.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550
And again, the state
becomes somewhat

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.329
of a partner in the
making of the film.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.410
So yeah, they're tough.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.920
Independent movies, they're
tough, not only to get made,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.665
but it seems like
that's the easy part.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:25.790
The easy part is making it.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.748
The tough part is the
marketing and the distribution.

00:04:28.748 --> 00:04:30.290
JOSH LANZET: So you
didn't like going

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.910
to 35 cities in seven weeks?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.870
That wasn't--

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.120
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: You know what?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.760
I love the country.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.650
And I drive a lot.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.550
I'm on the road quite a bit.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.940
I've got a 12-year-old car.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.420
It's got 280,000 miles on it.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.600
And I've probably driven a
million miles around the United

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.610
States in my lifetime
quite easily.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.660
I love this country.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.230
I love seeing what's
going on out there.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.990
And places like Omaha, Nebraska
and Marfa, Texas and Lawrence,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.910
Kansas and Farmington Hills,
just outside of Detroit,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.600
and then, of course,
Cincinnati, where I now have a--

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.650
I bought an old building.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.040
I bought a building
that was constructed

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.953
in 1881, which is
significant, for me anyway,

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.870
because that's the year
that Billy the Kid was

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.440
shot and killed, if you
believe that part of the story.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.720
So yeah, built in '81, and
it needs a lot of work.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.040
I'm pretty handy.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.560
And so I've been doing a
lot of the work myself--

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.977
and then having
people come behind

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:37.950
me and fix what I screwed up.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.700
JOSH LANZET: Sure.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.990
I just go right to that,
but that makes sense.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.055
That makes sense.

00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:43.680
One of things I wanted
to ask you about

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.552
was actually Culture
Clash in America.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.510
Really interesting-- for
those that don't know,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.100
Culture Clash is a performance
troupe out of San Francisco.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.510
They do a lot of
different things

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.370
as they relate to the
immigrant experience.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.245
You worked with them.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:58.162
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: I did.

00:05:58.162 --> 00:05:59.982
They would be considered
like satirists.

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:00.690
JOSH LANZET: Yes.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.440
Yes.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.540
I was curious, how did
you guys get connected

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.370
and what interested
you in that project?

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.920
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Well, I saw a play

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.630
that they had done
downtown, I think,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.130
at the Ahmanson or the Taper,
called "Water and Power."

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.700
I met them backstage,
and they said,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.300
they wanted to do
a show and film it.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.530
And we had a mutual
producing friend,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.170
and the guy says, I'll fund
it if you want to direct it,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.460
and we'll put the show on.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.300
So over the course of,
I think, four nights,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.870
we shot the live
show all four times,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.800
and then cobbled together
for the best of those four

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.890
performances.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.990
But they're great.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.510
It's Montoya, and
Salinas, and Siguenza.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.630
They're very active, and
they're very into it.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.020
I've lost touch with
them over the years,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.730
but they're wildly talented.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.490
If you don't know
who they are, they're

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.660
three extraordinary talents
that you should check out.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.525
JOSH LANZET: Yeah, I really
enjoyed it-- very hard to find,

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:07.900
in case anyone is
looking for it.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.810
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well, I don't
know if it ever got released.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.800
JOSH LANZET: I had to go to the
production company to get it.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.758
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Arenas?

00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:14.670
Was it the Arenas?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.670
JOSH LANZET: Yes,
Arenas Entertainment.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.470
And it was tough.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.330
And I was curious--

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.263
I guess my last question
on that, I believe--

00:07:20.263 --> 00:07:22.680
and please correct me if I'm
wrong-- that you spent about,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.110
I think, six months
living in Mexico,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.090
I think, when your dad
was shooting "Catch 22."

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.673
Is that right?

00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:28.590
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Right.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.006
JOSH LANZET: You're
looking at me.

00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:30.960
It's so suspicious.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.835
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Where
are we going with this?

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:35.460
JOSH LANZET: I was just
curious if that experience made

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.110
you more interested
in a project that

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.640
was talking about the
immigrant experience

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640
and doing Culture Clash.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.400
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well, no.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.950
I never wanted to
leave New York.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.840
So we left New York in 1969.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.430
It was the only city
that I ever really knew.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.240
I love New York.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.430
It's probably why I'm
attracted to Cincinnati,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.390
because it reminds me of New
York in a smaller way, in 1969.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.580
In neighborhoods,
you could walk.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.940
You'd be out on the street
and feel very comfortable,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.470
even back then.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.900
I was just there last week,
and if you've been-- well,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.800
you're from there.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.775
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:09.900
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: It's crazy.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.750
It's almost impossible
to navigate.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.970
It wasn't that.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:20.580
And Cincinnati is very similar
to what New York was like then.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.300
But it was interesting to
go to Mexico for that film,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.550
because that was
directed by Mike Nichols.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.220
He was just coming
off of "The Graduate,"

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.960
and he had everyone in
the world in that film,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.049
including Orson Welles, and
Alan Arkin, and Art Garfunkel,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.169
who I was a huge Art--

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:40.950
Simon Garfunkel--

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.950
At six years old, I knew every
song that they had recorded.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.530
I was a wild fanatic
of Simon Garfunkel.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.600
And now, Art Garfunkel
is in this movie.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.150
I'm thinking, I'm going
to have an opportunity

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.030
to meet Art Garfunkel.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.530
This is going to be insane.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.880
This is a dream.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.850
And so when we first
got there, they

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.570
put us in a really nice
hotel, which we only

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.670
stayed in for about a
week, because my dad had

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.483
a very small role.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:11.400
So they said, you're
going to stay here a week

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.930
until you get set up in a
house or apartment later.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.920
So it's great.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.160
So I was sitting at a table with
my mom and my sister, Renée.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.458
And right next to us--

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:24.000
our table was in
the middle, and then

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.340
there was a two-top
next to us there,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.150
and it was Mike Nichols
and Art Garfunkel,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.490
like, five feet away.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.240
And my little sister
began to eat the butter

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.490
on the table a cube at a time.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.050
And my mom kept pulling it away.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.475
And somehow, she got
her hands on it again

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:44.850
and ate more butter and more
butter, and then, of course,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:50.070
got sick to her stomach and
puked all over the table.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.240
Now, of course, I have
a gag reflex, which is--

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.910
right.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.210
And so, of course,
I smelled the vomit,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.940
and I turned to Art Garfunkel,
and I puked all over the floor.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.920
And I remember
Garfunkel just sort

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.450
of looking up from his
eggs in absolute disgust

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.957
and shook his head.

00:10:10.957 --> 00:10:11.790
And I never met him.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.158
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.772
I never met him.

00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:17.730
JOSH LANZET: He probably
remembers you, though.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.813
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: And my mom
just grabbed both of us

00:10:19.813 --> 00:10:21.343
and marched us out.

00:10:21.343 --> 00:10:23.010
JOSH LANZET: That's
some troubled water.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.010
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Heart-breaking
story, of course.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.521
[LAUGHS]

00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:27.600
JOSH LANZET: Well,
speaking of, I mean, you

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200
named a lot of great actors
that were in that movie.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.790
You happen to employ so many
actors in all of your films,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.190
especially-- this is
an intimidating poster

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.370
to look at, let alone to
actually see this film.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.280
But people you've worked with,
like Sir Anthony Hopkins,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.450
you worked with Helen Hunt.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.370
The number of people
just on this poster alone

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.240
that you've worked with, is
that intimidating at all?

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.470
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Yes.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.250
I mean, we were on the set of
"Bobby," and Shia LaBeouf, who

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.000
was relative unknown at that
time, pulled me aside and says,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.150
Emilio, I'm so confused.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.300
I don't know where to look.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.508
I don't know who to stare at.

00:11:04.508 --> 00:11:07.320
There's so many huge
actors on this film.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.430
I'm so intimidated.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.730
And I said, let me tell you
something. (WHISPERS) I am,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.090
too.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.920
So yeah.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.420
But I love actors.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.010
I love the process.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.350
I love ensemble films.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.800
I love the films
of Altman, and I

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.110
feel like, a lot of what
I've been doing lately

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.070
is influenced by that.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.700
But also, as an actor, the films
that I have really scored in

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.940
have been ensemble pictures.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.660
You look at "The Breakfast
Club," "St, Elmo's Fire,"

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.250
"Young Guns," even "The Mighty
Ducks" to a lesser extent,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.920
have been all ensemble pictures.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.200
And it allows you to lean
on your fellow cast members.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.140
It allows you to sort of
pass the ball off and let

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.220
them run with it for a while.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.920
I think that I'm better suited
in an ensemble environment.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.277
And so obviously, I'm now
creating them for myself.

00:12:01.277 --> 00:12:03.360
JOSH LANZET: Yeah, almost
every one of your movies

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.310
is just like
show-stopping person

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.193
after show-stopping person.

00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:10.110
You were talking about,
you were in ensembles.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.690
Did you take any lessons
from being in ensembles

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.160
from the directors
you worked with

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.050
and how they kind of wrangled
that many talented people?

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.720
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well,
you know, probably,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.820
to a certain extent, yeah.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.580
I mean, Joel Schumacher did
"St. Elmo's Fire," John Hughes,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.550
of course, "Breakfast Club."

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.000
Those were early movies
for me, and, of course,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.980
you're influenced
by your early days.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.730
JOSH LANZET: Sure.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.730
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
And so yeah, being

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.060
on the set, watching
them work, I

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.650
would often come
to work on my days

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.430
off just to watch
the directors and try

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.410
to understand their process.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.090
I was very interested in
directing at a very young age.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.600
In fact, I did it
when I shouldn't have.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.880
I directed my first film.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.840
It was dreadful.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.598
But I wrote the script,
directed it, starred in it.

00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:01.890
It was a movie called "Wisdom."

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.170
I was 23 years old, and I wanted
to be the youngest writer,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.490
director, actor in Hollywood.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.970
Because Welles had done it
with "Citizen Kane" at 26.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.920
And I was like, I've
got to beat Welles.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.990
So it was just absolute hubris.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.000
And so I write the script, and
we put this cast together that

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.920
included Demi Moore,
and Tom Skerritt,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.410
and Veronica Cartwright--
both from "Alien"--

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.645
and who else was in it?

00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:28.770
A couple other actors that
you may or may not know.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.010
Anyway, so we go off.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.090
We make this film.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.410
I have this amazing
behind-the-scenes talent.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.910
Robert Wise, the director of
"Sound of Music" and "West Side

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.920
Story," is my
executive producer.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.140
And on the set every
day, Michael Kahn,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.780
who is Steven Spielberg's
editor, cutting the film.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.660
Danny Elfman, from Oingo
Boingo, and the composer,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.240
it's his second score after
Tim Burton's "Pee Wee's Big

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.930
Adventure."

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.050
And I stood outside, I think,
it was the Pantages Theater,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.570
with my script after an
Oingo Bongo concert, like,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.730
Mr. Elfman, I'm going to
direct a movie someday.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.120
And I really want you to do
the score, and he did it.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.940
Dennis Gassner, who's
won several Oscars,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.530
was the production designer.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.440
Adam Greenberg, who'd just shot
"The Terminator" was my DP.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.970
I mean, it's ridiculous.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.320
It was an embarrassment
of riches on this film.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.320
And I had a terrible
script, and nobody told me.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.870
Or if they did, I
wasn't listening.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.120
And so I got my
ass handed to me.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.750
And just to top it--
to come back around

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.450
to the Orson Welles of it all,
the "LA Weekly" did a review,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.000
and they devoted a
ton of ink to it,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.360
I mean, a ton, like, two pages.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.590
And I open it up,
and the headline

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.548
was "Ain't No Rosebud."

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:42.257
JOSH LANZET: Oof.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:43.160
[AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS]

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.940
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: I was
like, OK, I deserved that.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.863
Yeah, it was pretty devastating.

00:14:48.863 --> 00:14:50.280
I stopped reading
the "LA Weekly."

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.257
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:53.340
JOSH LANZET: You don't
need a sled in Los Angeles.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.300
That's what I've always felt.
You know, you don't need that.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.530
I have to ask this.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.692
I used to work a lot.

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.900
When I was in high school,
I used to a lot of theater

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.730
with my sister.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:11.040
I cannot even fathom directing
a family member in anything.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.460
You have worked with both
Charlie and your father

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.265
multiple times.

00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:16.650
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: That's right.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.840
JOSH LANZET: What is it
like directing family?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.230
Is one of them harder to
direct than the other, more

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.130
intimidating?

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.530
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Yeah.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.447
I mean, they both are.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.510
When you direct
family, you know where

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.950
all the buttons are, because
you helped build the machine.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.130
So there were moments
where my dad and I

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.730
would clash on the way.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.450
And when we started
off on that--

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.100
I mean, my dad's
a devout Catholic,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.427
and he really wanted the film
to be reflective of that.

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:48.510
And I said, you know what?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.410
We've got to get our arms
around it being, yes,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.895
we're on a Christian pilgrimage.

00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:55.800
It ends on the
Camino de Santiago.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.600
Yes, you are Catholic.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.233
But the character
isn't, so can you

00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:00.400
separate yourself from that.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.900
He said, no.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.483
I said, well, you're
going to have to.

00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:05.010
And you're going to have
to fight your instinct

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.960
to make this a Catholic movie.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.620
And in fact, we
clashed quite a bit

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.420
about that, because
I wanted the film

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.690
to be accessible to
non-Catholics as well.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.240
I'm not a practicing Catholic.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.180
I am what people would
call a work in progress

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.620
in terms of my faith.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.260
I am more of a humanist.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.690
JOSH LANZET: Sure.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.070
So was the moment
in the way when

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.667
he receives the rosary
beads, was that originally

00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:32.250
in the script.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.310
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
No, that was him.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.370
He says, I want to
receive some rosary beads.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.440
So I was like, great.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.302
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:16:38.302 --> 00:16:40.260
And last question before
I get to "The Public."

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.725
I just have to quickly ask
about James Duff's "Home

00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:46.012
Front," which you adapted
into "The War at Home."

00:16:46.012 --> 00:16:47.220
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: That's right.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.470
JOSH LANZET: How much more
challenging was it to adapt

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.690
something from an
incredible play--

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.280
one of my favorite plays--

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.007
to adapt something from that
and a rather challenging play,

00:16:56.007 --> 00:16:57.090
generally, into your film?

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.400
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Did you and your
sister play Karen and Jeremy?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.790
JOSH LANZET: I played
Jeremy, but not with her.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.620
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: OK.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.480
It's a great monologue, right?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.369
JOSH LANZET: Super-hard to--

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.983
when you leave every day, that
feeling doesn't leave you.

00:17:08.983 --> 00:17:09.900
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Right.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.780
Now you remember the
monologue about his friend

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.530
who kills himself?

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.040
JOSH LANZET: Brady.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.430
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Brady.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:14.910
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.349
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
You remember that?

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.619
It was a long monologue.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.670
We filmed it.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.170
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.410
it's a story about a
Vietnam vet, which I played,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.960
which you played as well.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.770
JOSH LANZET: Not as well.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.869
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Suffering
from PTSD, in a home,

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:32.070
in his folks' house, in Texas.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.930
Kathy Bates played my mother.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.920
My dad played my dad.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.350
And Kimberly Williams
played Karen.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.930
And it's a very tough play.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.840
I think, when it
opened on Broadway,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:48.690
Carroll O'Connor played
Bob and Frances Sternhagen

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.760
played the mom.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.510
And I think it closed
in, like, two weeks.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.460
It was not a long run.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.650
It was a very, very tough play.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.440
So James Duff
wanted to open it up

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.120
for the film, which I
thought was a great idea.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.500
But it was a very difficult role
to not only play, but direct

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.580
myself playing.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.390
And so I did that
monologue, which you know,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.765
and it was terrible.

00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:13.890
It was absolutely terrible.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.420
And I was just like, OK,
the whole movie stops.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.770
And so we say, as
filmmakers, oftentimes,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.420
you have to kill your babies.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.550
And this was one
of those moments,

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.490
where the movie was going along.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.168
Its going along.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.210
The audience is laughing.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.710
They're involved.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.560
Now, there's this monologue,
and it brought the film

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.510
to a screeching halt.
And I stepped back

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.460
and I said, it's got to go.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.440
And that was it.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.740
But Duff was--

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.210
James Duff, if you
don't know him,

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.123
also created the show with
Kyra Sedgwick called--

00:18:47.123 --> 00:18:48.040
JOSH LANZET: "Closer?"

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.390
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: "Closer," yeah.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.600
Terrific writer and
was very much a partner

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.490
during the creation of that.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.110
JOSH LANZET: That's awesome.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.550
I have to get to "The Public."

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.500
I have so many questions.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.080
"The Public" was inspired by
an essay called "Written Off,"

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.760
by Chip Ward.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.968
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: That's right.

00:19:06.968 --> 00:19:10.390
JOSH LANZET: What drew you
about that specific essay that

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.290
resonated with you?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.780
Because I believe this was
over 10 years in the making.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.980
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Right.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.320
Last week, was the
12th anniversary

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.830
of the publication of that
piece in the "LA Times--"

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.650
April 1, 2007.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.420
And so I read this piece.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.820
It was about how
libraries have become

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.580
daytime de-facto homeless
shelters, how librarians

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.920
are now tasked with
being first responders,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.160
and de-facto social workers.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.790
And at the end of the
piece, he asked the reader,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.930
are you doing enough to remedy
this issue of homelessness

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.680
in America?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.980
What can you do?

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.500
So I stepped back from that.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.650
I said, OK, I'm a filmmaker.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.230
I'm a storyteller.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.690
I might be able
to find something.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.510
I was looking for a
follow-up piece to "Bobby."

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:00.460
So I went back to the downtown
LAPL, the central branch,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.620
to hang out and just observe.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.920
And what Ward was
talking about was not

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.960
just localized to
Salt Lake City,

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.870
but it was, in
fact, an epidemic.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.230
And so I began to imagine
what the story would

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.450
look like on a chilly night.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:21.040
You have the patron stage in
old-fashioned '60s sit-in,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.053
how the law enforcement
would react,

00:20:23.053 --> 00:20:24.220
how the media might spin it.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.870
And if there was a politician
in the middle of a mayoral race,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.420
how might he spin it for
his own political gain?

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.128
And so imagine, over
these last 12 years,

00:20:34.128 --> 00:20:35.170
you're turning on the TV.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.503
You're opening up the newspaper.

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:38.290
You're going online
to read your news,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.530
and you're watching all of these
stories unfold, including now,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.410
librarians are trained
in the use of Narcan,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.470
because the overdoses
in libraries,

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.360
that's become epidemic.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.120
JOSH LANZET: Wow.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.280
One of the biggest themes
that I spotted in this movie,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.830
which is not hard to spot, is
the ideas of climate change,

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.490
everything from the cold snap.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.157
There's a discussion earlier in
the film between your character

00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:05.490
and Jena Malone's character
about minimizing your carbon

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.570
footprint.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.500
What about that side-- because
I know, in the original essay,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.845
it's touched on, but not
nearly as much as you went--

00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:14.970
what drove you to go in as
deep as you did on that?

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.428
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Well, what happened

00:21:16.428 --> 00:21:21.120
was, in the actual location,
when we first scouted it,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.480
there was no polar bear.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.897
And if you haven't
seen the movie,

00:21:23.897 --> 00:21:27.680
there's a polar bear in
the middle of the library,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.570
in the lobby.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.330
So that polar bear wasn't there.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.210
In fact, the Natural
History Museum

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:38.610
is renovating in Cincinnati, and
they spread out their exhibits

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.330
all over the city.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.080
So for the three years,
this polar bear--

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.690
I think his time is up in May.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.880
They're going to take
him back to the museum.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.987
Again, before the polar bear
got there, I said, great.

00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:55.320
We're going to use this library.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.040
Terrific.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.390
Came back with the crew.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.540
Now, there's this
15-foot polar bear.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.130
I thought, OK, I can't
shoot around this.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.005
I have to include it.

00:22:04.005 --> 00:22:05.460
I need this lobby.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.800
I said, how can I use this bear
to help inform Jena Malone's

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.500
character even more?

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.990
And again, she's a bit of a
"couch-tivist" in the film.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.930
She's not active,
except on social media.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.240
So she posts memes,
and she thinks

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.080
she's doing the right thing.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.020
And in fact, she
doesn't understand

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.038
what community service
looks like until the end

00:22:29.038 --> 00:22:29.580
of the movie.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.730
She has that woke
moment, but it doesn't

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.910
happen until much later.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.190
So yeah, I'm grateful
to this polar bear,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.875
which the locals in the
library had named Barry White.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.250
JOSH LANZET: Of
course, they did.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:44.958
That makes sense.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.070
I hate this phrasing,
but another big character

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.800
in the film, is "The
Grapes of Wrath."

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.272
"Grapes of Wrath" comes out
multiple times in the film.

00:22:55.272 --> 00:22:56.730
One of the quotes
that you included

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.070
was, "wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.710
I'll be there."

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:00.840
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: That's right.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.215
JOSH LANZET: Part of that,
when I was watching the movie,

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.970
kind of felt almost like
you were there for the fight

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.590
after reading Chip Ward's essay.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.270
That's why you were
there making that,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.433
and that was kind of
your thematic statement.

00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:12.600
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: I like that.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.120
JOSH LANZET: Oh.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.860
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Yeah, that was good.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.568
JOSH LANZET: Well,
that's our time, guys.

00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:16.322
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.300
But did you see a lot of
connections when you were first

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.347
starting to write "The
Public" between that

00:23:23.347 --> 00:23:24.430
and "The Grapes of Wrath?"

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.680
Did that immediately
come to you?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.222
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: No,
"Grapes of Wrath"

00:23:27.222 --> 00:23:29.730
didn't immediately land for me.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.360
Again, the first draft of the
script was super-didactic.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.640
And it was that speech--

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.980
people are dying on the
streets, and da-da-da.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.000
It was so on the nose.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.820
It was a platitude that
the movie couldn't sustain.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.080
And so I said, how can
I say the same thing

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.790
without actually saying it?

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.298
And to use Steinbeck's words
and to have those come back up--

00:23:54.298 --> 00:23:56.340
you know, "Grapes of Wrath"
is going to celebrate

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.900
its 80th anniversary this year.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.140
It was published April 14, 1939.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.070
So those words are, I
believe, as relevant now

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.520
as they were when
he first wrote them.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.470
He was writing
about what he saw,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:14.220
which was a great injustice
and a great sorrow.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:23.220
And he felt that the success
that we were experiencing

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.720
as a country were
being overshadowed

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.170
by these enormous failures.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.380
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.130
I also noticed that
just even around a lot

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.290
of the pieces in
your movies, not only

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.640
does literature play a part.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.290
I've noticed that
addiction pops up

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.310
in a few of your
different films.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.550
Obviously, it's pretty
prominent in "The Public,"

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.760
even down to the
cigarettes that, I believe,

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.320
the character's name is Sarah
was smoking in "The Way."

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.568
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Joost, the Dutchman,

00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:51.360
was smoking pot throughout
the whole thing.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.425
JOSH LANZET: And eating a lot.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.147
Just saying.

00:24:55.147 --> 00:24:55.980
Looked good, though.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.480
I was hungry.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.150
What were you hoping that
people would take away,

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.930
I guess, from your
commentary on addiction,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.410
whether across films or
specifically in "The Public?"

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.320
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Well, I think, again,

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.330
we all self-medicate
to a certain extent.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.650
Some of it is over the counter
or over the liquor counter.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:19.410
Some of it is by prescription,
and some of it is street drugs.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.420
Of course, nobody in this
room I'm referring to.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.820
JOSH LANZET: Of course.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.650
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Nor me.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.890
But there is a certain
amount of self-medication

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.340
that is very prevalent
in the culture.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.760
I underscore it and
highlight it in my films,

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.900
because again, these are
movies about people and people

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.390
who are, again, dealing
with their trauma.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.970
And one of the ways that so
many of us deal with our trauma

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.060
is by and through
self-medication.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.820
JOSH LANZET: This took place
in Cincinnati, as you said.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.445
Your mother, I believe,
was from there.

00:25:56.445 --> 00:25:57.695
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Born in Cincy.

00:25:57.695 --> 00:25:58.780
My dad's from Dayton.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.550
JOSH LANZET: Did
either of them get

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.100
to sneak in anything
about their experiences

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.720
there as they were
talking to you?

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.620
Like, you know, I used to
love this place in Cincinnati.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.210
Put it in.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:07.650
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: No.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.100
JOSH LANZET: No?

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.430
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: No,
neither one of them.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.850
JOSH LANZET: Really?

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:10.570
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Yeah.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.410
JOSH LANZET: Did
you talk to her?

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.420
Was she really happy that
you were putting the movie

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.110
in Cincinnati?

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.030
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Well, my mom was born

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.950
in a home for unwed mothers.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.830
And so imagine, in 1939, that
was a pretty unpopular place

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.940
to be born in.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:28.990
So her mom, she wasn't ready
to be a mom when she had her.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.870
And so she was taken
across the river

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.500
to be raised by
her grandparents.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.580
So her experience in
Cincinnati was limited.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.330
I think they've torn down the
building where she was born.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.670
I was looking all around
for her birth records

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.800
and couldn't find them.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.925
JOSH LANZET: Obviously,
you have so much free time.

00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:54.798
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Exactly.

00:26:54.798 --> 00:26:56.590
JOSH LANZET: I have to
say, I'll never here

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.750
"I Can See Clearly
Now" by Johnny

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.270
Nash ever again in the same way.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.310
If you haven't seen
the film, you need to.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.460
I don't want to spoil
anything, but oh, boy.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.910
How did you choose that
song for such a pivotal part

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.760
of the film?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.427
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well,
so out of context,

00:27:12.427 --> 00:27:13.510
it's tough to talk about.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.420
Because it plays
a part, especially

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.660
in the ending of the film.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.480
But the end of the
film was originally

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.360
going to be a Journey song.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.270
It was "Don't Stop
Believing" by Journey,

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.480
which, again, used quite often.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.240
We hear it in
commercials, other films.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.540
It had been in the
script for years.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.780
And two weeks before we were
to start shooting, they said,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.752
you can't have it.

00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:39.460
I said, who said?

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.020
They said, well, they're just
not going to grant the rights.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.690
And so I said, what
do I need to do?

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.740
Because I'd already learned the
song, which my character sings.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.287
And so they said, you have
to write Steve, and Neil,

00:27:50.287 --> 00:27:51.370
and the rest of the group.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.030
You have to beg them.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.530
So I did.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.190
I sat on the computer,
and I crafted

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.180
this beautiful letter basically
saying, I'm begging you.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.060
This is what the movie's about.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.820
The song's not going to
be used in a silly way.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.330
They still said no.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.133
So I thought, OK, what to do?

00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:13.800
I was at a friend's
house in Cincinnati.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:20.310
And "I Can See Clearly Now" came
on his Spotify or one of them--

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.450
Pandora maybe.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.350
And I said, play that again.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.283
Play that again.

00:28:25.283 --> 00:28:25.950
Play that again.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.560
And it became the
song for the end.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.560
JOSH LANZET: Yeah, I can't
hear it the same now.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.010
EMILIO ESTEVEZ:
Right, of course.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.230
JOSH LANZET: Again, watch it.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.207
While we're talking
about music overall,

00:28:36.207 --> 00:28:38.540
this seems to be the first
movie that really prominently

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.110
featured hip hop of the
movies that you've done

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.480
and also featured one
of the bigger names,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.430
I think, in hip hop
history in Rhymefest,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.930
also appears in here.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.320
How did you come to
incorporating hip hop so much

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.960
in here and also bringing
Rhymefest into that movie?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.070
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: So Che came
to the film in a weird way,

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.490
because he was
originally suggested

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.150
by my mother, who had seen
Che in a documentary called

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.770
"In My Father's House."

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.920
And the documentary was
essentially about his reunion

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.880
with his dad.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.990
His dad was homeless
for 30 years.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.830
When Che finally was
able to connect with him,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.470
his father said, the only place
I'm comfortable meeting you

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.330
is in the local public library.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.230
So they met.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.460
They made this documentary.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.630
My mom saw it.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.690
She said, hey, you're casting.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.400
You should know this guy is.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.630
He's a really
fascinating character.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.960
And he has lived
experience, which

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.515
could actually help
you along the way

00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:36.640
as you're making this film.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.880
And so I called Che.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.990
We connected.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.140
I said, I'm interested in
having you be a part of this

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.180
as an actor.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.040
And if you know
the song, "Glory,"

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.550
that was in the film "Selma,"
he was the third writer on that.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.220
So it was Common and John
Legend that wrote that.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.720
And they won the
Oscar and, I guess,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.400
all the awards for that song.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.500
So Che said, I'm game.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.280
I want to be a part of this.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.420
And then once he arrived,
and "I Can See Clearly Now"

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.740
was chosen as one of the end
songs of the film, he said,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.173
I want to rerecord this, and
I want to write an original.

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:10.340
And I want to write another.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.610
So I was like, dude, have at it.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.520
So we have three original
Rhymefest songs in the film.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.680
"Make Noise," he recorded
with Tariq Trotter,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.790
better known as Black Thought,
and they're really good tunes.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.730
And you're talking about
not being able to find them.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:26.560
JOSH LANZET: I wasn't
going to say anything.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.435
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: I think
we're going to know--

00:30:28.435 --> 00:30:30.780
are they going to be out,
Mark, they say, today?

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.280
Today?

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:31.910
They're going to be out?

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.080
Yeah, they'll be out today.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.500
JOSH LANZET: Good.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:33.980
They're great.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.980
That's why I was asking.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.280
I wasn't complaining.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.140
Yeah, and I think,
what's interesting is

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.180
his performance was incredible.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.000
He played one of the people
experiencing homelessness.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.750
I believe that you also brought
people who were actually

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.260
in that position in Cincinnati,
who are currently homeless,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.220
as part of the film.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.500
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Yes, we
invited them to participate.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.230
And the only criteria
was, once you're

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.363
in this lockdown
situation, I need you

00:30:59.363 --> 00:31:00.530
to come back the next night.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.080
You can't just work one
day and then take off.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.740
I need you to be consistent.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.470
And the idea of needing
to be counted on

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.120
made a difference
in their lives.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.750
And they were counted
on, and they showed up.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.410
And they were an important
part of our overall group.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.720
JOSH LANZET: That's incredible.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.380
And the last question
I have for you--

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.750
I think, when we
look, this movie

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.833
is saying a lot of things.

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:27.000
And I think it's pulled a
lot of people's attention.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.610
It's definitely
pulled my attention

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.895
to a lot of what we're facing
as a country right now,

00:31:30.895 --> 00:31:32.270
especially as
weather's changing.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.780
And a lot of people still
don't have a place to be.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.890
What do you want us as
audiences to take away?

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.030
What can we do?

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.180
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Well,
again, going to the article,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.180
what can we do?

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.430
What more can we do?

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.350
And how do we get our
arms around this issue?

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.630
And especially in Los
Angeles, where real estate

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.790
comes with such a premium.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.150
My daughter's been forced
to move now three times.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.340
She got priced out
of the LA market.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.510
She's living in Long
Beach now, where

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.950
she has a great
place, but, again,

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.950
very far away from
where she works.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:16.100
So OK, we've got the money
through measure Triple

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.610
H, $1 billion for 10,000 units.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:24.487
But we have 57,000 in LA alone--

00:32:24.487 --> 00:32:26.070
individuals experiencing
homelessness.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:30.960
So 10,000 units doesn't
even scratch the surface.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.230
What's important is
permanent supportive housing.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.290
So again, it's sort of
a chicken-and-egg thing,

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.060
because a lot of
neighborhoods don't

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.030
want that permanent supportive
housing in their backyard.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.890
So there's the NIMBY issue.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.430
Real estate coming with a
premium, the people who,

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:53.160
like my daughter, who
can't afford to live here.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.920
So there's the issue
of where and how.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.030
25% of those experiencing
homelessness are vets.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.220
20% are children.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.690
And here's a
staggering statistic--

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.920
11% of California
State college students

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.590
are couch-surfing or
living in their car.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.880
I mean, staggering-- 11%.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.220
So how are you going to get
an education if you're just

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.910
thinking about survival?

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.230
So the issue is enormous.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.880
But when you look at
homelessness, and you look

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.180
at what got us to where
we are right now--

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.560
Carter signed the Mental Health
Services Act into law in 1980.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.220
It was repealed the next year
by the incoming administration,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.110
so that was a big hit.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:41.310
Then that same administration,
under the Omnibus Budget,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.840
cut HUD by 77%.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.830
So you had these
two enormous strikes

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.670
against the poor,
and the marginalized,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.060
and the mentally ill.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.020
And that is how we've gotten
to, ultimately, where we are.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:00.060
Clinton's Welfare Reform
Act also didn't help.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.140
But homelessness has only been
with us, really, for 40 years,

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.160
in earnest.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.460
And so if it only took 40
years to get us to this place

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.620
right now, I believe that we
can get our arms around it.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.120
And we need to stop
bringing our own bias to how

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.790
we look at people on the
street and stop assigning

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.770
a story to that individual.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.900
Because we don't know
how they got there.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.449
People assign stories to
all of us all the time.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.830
They assume they
know how we live

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.960
or how we arrived
at a certain place.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.096
We need to stop
doing that when we

00:34:31.096 --> 00:34:32.929
see an individual
experiencing homelessness.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.469
And we need to say, you know,
that is a person with a name,

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.449
and a face, and history.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:41.469
And they need help.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:45.040
And homelessness
is not a condition.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.719
It's a situation.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.929
And here's another staggering
number-- and you probably

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.920
know this-- but EA,
Emergency Assistance,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.470
for an individual on the
street cost $68,000 per year.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.510
You put a roof over that
same individual's head,

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.540
it goes down to 15 grand.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.940
And we all pay for that anyway.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.010
So how do we pay less?

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.960
How do we build the housing?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.670
Where do we build the housing?

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.810
Those are the big questions that
we need to get our arms around.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.220
Because I'm not OK with it.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.030
I don't think anybody in
this room is OK with it.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:26.680
You can't be immune
living in this city, where

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.280
there is such immense
wealth, and not be--

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.310
It's heartbreaking
what's going on.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.230
The discarded, and
the marginalized,

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:43.360
and disenfranchised, and the
poor, they need our help.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.120
And I think it's
criminal on our part

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.400
not to figure out
how to solve this.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.230
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.950
Well, thank you so much
for your time today.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.030
I really, really appreciate it.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.230
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Thank you.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.830
JOSH LANZET: Great
having you here.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:54.502
EMILIO ESTEVEZ: Appreciate it.

00:35:54.502 --> 00:35:55.002
Thank you.

00:35:55.002 --> 00:35:56.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.790
Thank you.
