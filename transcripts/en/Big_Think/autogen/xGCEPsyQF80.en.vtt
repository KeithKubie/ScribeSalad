I think that the word history is a lot

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559
I think that the word history is a lot

more demanding of us than we think
we spend much of our time dwelling in

we spend much of our time dwelling in
 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.720
we spend much of our time dwelling in
things that aren't history we have

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730
things that aren't history we have
 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.359
things that aren't history we have
notions of the way time flows that are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369
notions of the way time flows that are
 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.269
notions of the way time flows that are
comfortable but basically wrong and

allow us to sleepwalk and drift away
 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.920
allow us to sleepwalk and drift away
from what's actually confronting us and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930
from what's actually confronting us and
 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.029
from what's actually confronting us and
what we should actually be seen in

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039
what we should actually be seen in
 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.020
what we should actually be seen in
feeling one of those is what I call the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030
feeling one of those is what I call the
 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.139
feeling one of those is what I call the
politics of inevitability or for short

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149
politics of inevitability or for short

we could call it progress and that's the

we could call it progress and that's the
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.329
we could call it progress and that's the
idea that we know the rules of history a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339
idea that we know the rules of history a
 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.639

that's a core problem this kind of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340
that's a core problem this kind of
 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.670
that's a core problem this kind of
thinking takes you out of history and it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
thinking takes you out of history and it
 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.650
thinking takes you out of history and it
says you're not responsible what you do

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660
says you're not responsible what you do
 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.850

as an individual doesn't really matter
very much now the problem with that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350
very much now the problem with that
 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.590
very much now the problem with that
they're one of many problems is that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600
they're one of many problems is that
 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.060
they're one of many problems is that
eventually you're going to get some kind

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
eventually you're going to get some kind
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.820
eventually you're going to get some kind
of a shock you might get shocked in 2008

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830
of a shock you might get shocked in 2008
 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.680
of a shock you might get shocked in 2008
when you figure out you can't own a

when somebody don't expect when it's a
 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.230
when somebody don't expect when it's a

shock you and suddenly this story about
 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.390
shock you and suddenly this story about
inevitability about progress that's no

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400
inevitability about progress that's no
 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.250
inevitability about progress that's no
longer to make sense to you and then

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260
longer to make sense to you and then
 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.620
longer to make sense to you and then
you're gonna be vulnerable to what I

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
you're gonna be vulnerable to what I
 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.840
you're gonna be vulnerable to what I
call the politics of eternity which is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850
call the politics of eternity which is
 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.640
call the politics of eternity which is
another way of dwelling in time which

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650
another way of dwelling in time which
 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.560
another way of dwelling in time which
isn't history and the politics of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570
isn't history and the politics of
 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.860
isn't history and the politics of
eternity we say it's not my fault I'm an

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870
eternity we say it's not my fault I'm an
 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.930
eternity we say it's not my fault I'm an
innocent victim everything which is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940
innocent victim everything which is
 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.340
innocent victim everything which is
wrong comes from enemies from the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
wrong comes from enemies from the
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.370
wrong comes from enemies from the
outside those others those enemies over

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380
outside those others those enemies over
 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190
outside those others those enemies over
and over again come for us attack us try

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
and over again come for us attack us try
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.649
and over again come for us attack us try
to penetrate us hurt us and history then

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659
to penetrate us hurt us and history then
 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.540
to penetrate us hurt us and history then
just becomes a cycle we're over and over

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550
just becomes a cycle we're over and over
 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.860
just becomes a cycle we're over and over
and over again the innocent people are

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870
and over again the innocent people are
 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.170
and over again the innocent people are
attacked by by the bad guys basically

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180
attacked by by the bad guys basically
 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.210
attacked by by the bad guys basically
and then the politics of eternity what

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220
and then the politics of eternity what
 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.940
and then the politics of eternity what
also happens is that the news cycle the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
also happens is that the news cycle the
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.520
also happens is that the news cycle the
daily cycle overwhelms you and it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
daily cycle overwhelms you and it
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.140
daily cycle overwhelms you and it
instructs you who you're supposed to be

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
instructs you who you're supposed to be
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270
instructs you who you're supposed to be
afraid of how you're supposed to feel

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
afraid of how you're supposed to feel
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.819
afraid of how you're supposed to feel
so the danger that when right now in the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829
so the danger that when right now in the
 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.500
so the danger that when right now in the
u.s. is we're shifting from a politics

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
u.s. is we're shifting from a politics
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.670
u.s. is we're shifting from a politics
of inevitability to a politics of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
of inevitability to a politics of
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860
of inevitability to a politics of
eternity and it along the way we won't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
eternity and it along the way we won't
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780
eternity and it along the way we won't
notice how we're in history you know

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790
notice how we're in history you know
 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.789
notice how we're in history you know
history demands of us that we understand

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799
history demands of us that we understand
 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.250
history demands of us that we understand
that it's not inevitable to become

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260
that it's not inevitable to become
 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.720
that it's not inevitable to become
better it's also not inevitable become

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730
better it's also not inevitable become
 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.459
better it's also not inevitable become
worse there are certain structures and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469
worse there are certain structures and
 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.330
worse there are certain structures and
what we do within those structures

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340
what we do within those structures
 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.729
what we do within those structures
matters and what history teaches us is

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739
matters and what history teaches us is
 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.729
matters and what history teaches us is
what those structures our that the

what those structures our that the

Europeans have a different politics of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
Europeans have a different politics of
 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.720
Europeans have a different politics of
inevitability so the structure is the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730
inevitability so the structure is the
 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.399
inevitability so the structure is the
same the overall structure is that

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409
same the overall structure is that
 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.989
same the overall structure is that
things are pretty good they're going to

things are pretty good they're going to
 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.089
things are pretty good they're going to
get better there are rules to history we

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099
get better there are rules to history we
 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.500
get better there are rules to history we
know those rules are there for it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510
know those rules are there for it
