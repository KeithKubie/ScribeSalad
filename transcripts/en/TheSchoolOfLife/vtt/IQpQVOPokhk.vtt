00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.680
The idea of being a sociable person

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.160
is nowadays heavily associated with finding enjoyment in going to,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.820
and in all likelihood also in giving, parties.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.300
To be sociable means welcoming the idea of being in a room

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.120
replete with an above-average number of other guests,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.600
many of whom will be unknown, most of whom will be holding a glass of alcohol,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.920
bantering, with lights lower than they normally would be,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.920
and music somewhat higher than required in order faithfully to catch the details of another’s voice.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.260
Parties have become synonymous with sociability

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.780
because of certain underlying ideas about what true social connection might require and entail.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.840
We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.360
that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.960
about things that have been happening in our lives,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.940
that it depends on a jokey manner

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.060
and – ideally – on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.020
often involving striking coincidences.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.280
Firstly, true sociability – that is a real connection between two people –

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.140
is almost never built up via anything cheerful.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.700
It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.040
by revealing something that is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.300
We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.520
that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement;

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.420
we make real friends through sharing in an uncensored and frank way

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.120
a little of the agony and confusion of being alive.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.480
Secondly, true sociability requires a context.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.520
We are generally under such pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.940
we are understandably uninclined spontaneously to disclose our true selves.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.420
Our default mode is – without anything sinister being meant by this –

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.580
to lie about who we are and what is really going on in our lives.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.440
This suggests that a genuinely social occasion

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.680
might be rather different from what we typically envisage.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.880
We think of a ‘good host’ as someone who makes sure there is enough wine

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.060
and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other’s names.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.140
But in the profound sense, a good host

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.240
is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.620
about being sad and desperate together.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.480
Unfortunately, the modern world seems particularly resistant

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.680
to anything that seems artificial around parties,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.360
which threatens to evoke that most dreaded of all social genres: the corporate get-together.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.380
The thought is simply to pack a room and leave the rest to nature.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.400
But a commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
that we do depend on a little artful choreography

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.000
to get us into the psychological zone in which connections can unfold.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.600
We might need encouragement – and even a helpful lanyard –

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.700
to share a little of what is sad within us.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.000
We need help in networking, not in order to find new investment opportunities,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.660
but so as to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.660
Parties, as they are currently structured,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.160
constitute a clever ruse by a sharp minority,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.620
– perhaps only ten per cent of humanity –

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.420
But, in truth, it takes a sharply insular and misanthropic person

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.100
to feel that what goes on in an average party

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.000
really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one’s fellow human animal.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.280
If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.300
It doesn’t mean that we don’t like other people,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.420
rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.380
to put up with what is on offer at most parties.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680
The mark of a truly sociable person

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.640
might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.940
