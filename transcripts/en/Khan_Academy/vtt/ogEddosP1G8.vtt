00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
how many solutions does the following system of linear equations have

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.160
i have my system right over here

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.240
there's a couple of ways to think about it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.180
one way is to think about them graphically

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.480
and think about well, are they the same line in which case they would have an infinite number of solutions

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.260
or they are parallel in which case they never intersect you would have no solution or they intersect exactly

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.780
at one place, in that case, you would have exactly one solution but instead, we're going to do this algebraically

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.620
So let's try to actually just solve the system and see what we get

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.600
So, the first equation...I will leave that unchanged 5x-9y=16

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.480
Now this second equation right over here, let's say I wanna cancel out the x terms so let me multiply the second equation by negative 1

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.400
so I have a -5x that I can cancel out with the 5x

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.480
so if I multiply this second equation by -1

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:00.660
we will have -5x + 9y = -36

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.000
Now I'm going to add to the left side of the equation and the right side of the equation

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.160
to get a new equation

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.760
so 5x - 5x

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.400
well that's going to make a zero

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.860
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.420
-9y + 9y well that's gonna be zero again

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.280
i don't even have to write it, it's gonna be zero on the left side

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.540
and on the right-hand side

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.400
I'm gonna have 16 - 36 = -20

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.320
So now I'm left with the somewhat bizarre looking equation that says

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.220
that 0 is equal to -20

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.200
Now one way, you might say, "Well-well how does this make any sense?"

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
And the way to think about it is:

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.300
"Well are there any x y values for which 0 is going to be equal to -20?"

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.560
Well no, 0 is *never* going to be equal to -20

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
And so it doesn't matter what x y values there are,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.220
You can never find an x y pair that's going to make 0 equal to negative 20.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.960
In fact the X's and Y's have
disappeared from this equation there's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.649
no way that this is going to be true so
we have no we have no solutions now if

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.040
you were to plot these if you were to
plot each of these lines you would see

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.210
that they are parallel lines and that's
why they have the same slope different

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.890
y-intercepts and that's why we have no
solutions they don't intersect let's do

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.560
another one of these this is this is fun
all right how many solutions does the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.079
following system of linear equations
have so let's do the same thing I'm

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.560
going to keep the first equation the
same negative 6x plus 4y is equal to 2

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.430
and the second equation let me just see
if I can cancel out the X term so if I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.310
have a negative 6x if I multiply this by
2 I'm going to have a positive 6x so I

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.329
can let's see I'm going to multiply this
whole equation both sides of it by 2 so

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.260
I'm going to have 6x 3 x times 2 is 6x
negative 2y times 2 is negative 4y and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.889
that is going to be equal to negative 2
now let's do the same thing let's add

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.689
the left sides and let's add the right
sides so negative 6x plus 6x well that's

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.540
going to be 0 4y minus 4y that's 0 we
just have a 0 on the left-hand side now

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
on the right-hand side we have 2 plus
negative 2 well that's 0 so this is a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.060
little bit different it still looks a
little bit bizarre 0 equals 0 last time

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.709
we had 0 is equal to we add what 0 is
equal to negative 20 now we have 0

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.669
equals 0 so one way to think about it is
even though the X's and Y's are no

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.810
longer in this equation okay well what
XY pairs is it going to be true for is

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.189
that it's going to make it true that 0
is equal to 0 well this is going to be

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.639
true no matter what x and y are in fact
x and y are not involved in this

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.129
equation anymore 0 is always going to be
equal to 0 so this is going to have an

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.840
infinitely this is going to have
infinitely many solutions here and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.709
that's because these are the same lines
they just look a little bit different

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.669
algebraically but if you scale one of
them in the right way in fact if you

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.959
just multiply both sides of this one the
second one by negative 2 you're going to

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.590
get the top one and so they actually
represent the exact same lines you have

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.879
an infinitely many solutions all right
when trying to find the solution to the

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.900
following system of linear equations
Evon takes several correct steps that

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.729
lead to the equation negative 5 is equal
to 20 how many solutions is the system

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.400
of linear equations have I don't even
have to look at the system right over

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.210
here the fact that she got the statement
that can never be true negative 5 is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.270
never going to be equal to 20 tells us
that she has no

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.539
those solutions and once again if you
were to plot these graphically you would

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.900
see that these are parallel lines that's
why they have no solutions they never

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.960
intersect there's no XY pair that
satisfies both of these constraints

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.770
let's do a let's do a couple more of
these when trying to find the solution

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.430
to the following system of linear
equations Alba's take several correct

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.360
steps that lead to the equation 5y is
equal to negative 5 and say how many

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.740
solutions does this system of linear
equations have well 5y equals negative 5

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.750
we could divide both sides by 5 and we
get Y is equal to negative 1 and then if

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.740
you substitute back in Y is equal to
negative 1 if you did it in this first

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.169
equation if Y is equal to negative 1 all
of this becomes positive 2 you can

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:16.669
subtract 2 from both sides and you get
5x is equal to 4 or you'd get what X is

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.250
equal to 4/5 or if you put negative 1
over here you would get 5x minus 3 is

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.340
equal to 1 you could add 3 to both sides
and you get 5x equals 4 again X is equal

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.300
to 4/5 so you have exactly one solution
you would have X is equal to 4/5 y is

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.870
equal to negative 1 let's do one more
when trying to find the solution of the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.139
following system of linear equations
Livan take several correct steps that

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.889
lead to the equation 0 equals 0 so once
again I don't even need to look at this

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.969
over here zero equals zero is always
going to be true so this is going to

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.770
have an infinitely this is going to be
an infinitely many solutions
