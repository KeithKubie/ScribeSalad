00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.610
In physics, questions about astronomy led
to revolutionaries such as Kepler and Newton,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.900
who provided a new theoretical framework that
replaced the old Aristotelian one.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.039
But when it came to the study of living things,
this shift didn’t happen until a little

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.540
later, in the 1800s.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.040
You’ve probably heard of Charles Darwin,
but before we get to him, and I'm ecited to get to him,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.040
you really need to understand how different people, throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.840
tried to answer the same question: “what
is life?”

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.280
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS}

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.690
During the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment,
there was no biology—that term was first

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.579
used in 1799.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.630
Instead, there was natural history, the observation-based
study of living things, based on the work

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.630
of Aristotle.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.870
For Aristotle, living things were all of one
kind, but animated by different types of soul.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
So, plants have a vegetative soul and can
grow.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.909
Animals have a sensitive soul and can move.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.280
And humans alone have a rational soul, capable
of reason.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.910
Organisms could be compared by imagining their
position on a great chain, leading upward

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.900
in complexity and worth from grass to starfish
to humans.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.520
This Great Chain of Being gave people throughout
Europe and parts of Asia and Africa a way

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.200
to understand differences in form between
things.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800
But it didn’t include an element of time.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.920
Did living things change over time?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.450
That is, did they evolve?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.840
What sorts of evidence would prove this, and
would this proof contradict the bible?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.570
Would God let extinctions happen!?

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.510
Let’s set the stage for these questions,
which would rock the world of natural history.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.510
Alongside the first microscopists, other brilliant
people were creating knowledge about living

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.210
things in the 1600s.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.150
Two notable natural historians jump out—a
great experimentalist and a great observer.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.820
In 1634, the Spanish Inquisition arrested
Flemish alchemist Joannes Baptista van Helmont

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.760
for the crime of… studying plants!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.670
He was put under house arrest, but this experience
didn’t deter him: like Galileo, it made

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.620
him want to science even harder.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.200
Van Helmont really wanted to understand how
plants grow, so he devised his famous willow

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.810
tree experiment to provide some answers.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.920
Van Helmont wanted to test the theory that
plants grow by eating soil, so he weighed

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.230
a willow tree—it was five pounds—as well
as some soil—two hundred pounds of it.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.970
He planted the willow in the soil, in a pot,
and then tended to the plant’s needs, observing

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.700
its growth over five years.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.920
After that time, he weighed the tree again,
then dried the soil and weighed it, too.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.430
The mass of the soil had remained the same
over five years, but the tree’s mass had

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.340
significantly increased.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.430
Van Helmont concluded that the tree grew not
by eating soil but by drinking water.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.460
Published in 1648, after Van Helmont had died,
this willow-weighing became the first quantitative

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.920
experiment in biology!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.260
Another major seventeenth-century natural
historian was Maria Sibylla Merian.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.850
Born in Frankfurt in 1647, Merian was the
leading entomologist, or insect expert, of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.190
her day, as well as a highly skilled scientific
illustrator.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.069
Merian became well known for her work on how
some insects metamorphose, or change shape.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.260
Her careful observations of the life cycle
of the butterfly became a benchmark for other

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.260
natural historians.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.209
In 1699, Merian traveled to the Dutch colony
of Suriname in South America to study tropical

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.209
insects.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.790
She was horrified by the slavery she encountered
there, but was also aided by an enslaved person,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.430
which was typical of many European natural
historians.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.120
In 1705, Merian published the heavily illustrated
Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, cementing

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.810
her reputation in both art and science.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.460
The next major shift in natural history came
thanks to Carl Linnaeus.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.290
Born in 1707, Linnaeus sought to discover
the order of nature.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.180
He reasoned that, if you could just compare
every species along the same axis—say, sexual

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.360
organs, or limbs—then you could create a
gigantic table, showing every living thing

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.820
on earth, side by side.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.790
Think about that supremely Enlightenment-style
visual metaphor: life was a static table full

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.239
of information.

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.450
Lots of other people were trying to figure
out how to classify living things.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.199
But Linnaeus’s system won out.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.409
Linnaeus invented the binomial system that
biologists still use.

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.969
The first name or genus represents a more
general category.

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.729
The second name or species is based on a specific
characteristic.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.169
Humans, for example, are Homo sapiens, or
the “intelligent men,” as opposed to our

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.550
extinct relatives, Homo erectus, the “standing
men,” or our closest living relatives, the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.539
bonobos, who some scientists classify as Homo
sylvestris—the “forest men.”

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.370
Linnaeus introduced the binomial system in
Systema Naturæ in 1735.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.009
We can compare this text to Galileo’s Two
Sciences or Newton’s Principia, in that

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.000
it provided natural historians with a new
paradigm for how to do their jobs.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.139
Beyond the binomial, Systema also addressed
higher-level classification.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.930
Say you encounter a thing.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.150
First, you decide on its kingdom—meaning
whether it’s an animal, vegetable, or mineral,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.559
as per tradition.

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.759
Then you assign it to a class, such as such
as mammal or bird, and an order based on some

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.710
characteristic, such as, say, eels or spiny-finned
fishes.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.530
FYI, Linnaeus was the first to assign bats
to Team Mammal instead of Team Bird.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.219
Then you assign genus and species.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.690
And all of these decisions you make rationally,
based on some observable and comparable feature:

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.749
does the thing have wings or arms?

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:34.919
Spines or no spines?

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.130
How many ventricles in its heart?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.719
Internal or external gills?

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.509
Although it’s evolved a lot over three centuries,
we still use Linnaeus’s system today!

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.960
Linnaeus was called the “Second Adam”
because he named so many organisms, mostly

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960
plants.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.900
He didn’t go out collecting plants, but
he inspired a generation of European natural

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.900
historians who did.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.620
They had a new tool at their disposal that
allowed them to rapidly concentrate thousands

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.779
of botanical samples in a small number of
botanical gardens: empire.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.710
With tall-ships constantly sailing from London,
Antwerp, Stockholm, and Calais for distant

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.159
continents, the naturalists of the 1700s used
military might to make knowledge about ecosystems

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.569
that Europe didn’t have.

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.659
A perfect example of a statesman–scientist
who took advantage of colonial empire in order

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.069
to fill in the table of nature was Sir Joseph
Banks.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.699
Born in 1743, Banks became the preeminent
British naturalist of his day.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.509
Appointed by the Royal Navy and the Royal
Society, Banks sailed with James Cook aboard

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:39.719
the HMS Endeavour from 1768 to 1771, traveling
to Brazil, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia.

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.879
When he returned home, famous and full of
ideas about the great variety of living things,

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.449
Banks became advisor to the king on the Royal
Botanic Gardens at Kew.

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.150
He also rose to become president of the Royal
Society, holding the position for over forty

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.150
years.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.050
In order to build Kew into one of the greatest
botanical gardens in the world, Banks directed

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.039
other botanists to travel the world, collecting
plants, and bringing them back to the center

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.180
of the British Empire.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.550
There, they were classified using the Linnaean
system and shown off to the public.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.699
So, Linnaeus was hugely influential in thinking
about how to classify organisms, and Banks

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.830
pushed the powerful British Empire to make
tabulating nature a project of prestige.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.850
But they didn’t raise deep epistemic questions
about what living things are, like if species

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.400
change over time or not.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.949
Those questions would come into the mainstream
of science thanks to a trio of French thinkers

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.569
who we can think of as the “Transformists”:
Buffon, Lamarck, and Cuvier.

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:40.389
Georges-Louis Leclerc, AKA the Comte de Buffon,
was born in 1707.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.999
He became superintendent of the Royal Garden
in Paris and argued with Thomas Jefferson

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:49.110
about whether animals and plants in the Americas
were inferior to those in Eurasia.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.689
(We’ll come back to the Americas.)

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:55.319
But, importantly for natural history, Buffon
thought that living things are degenerating,

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.569
or slowly becoming worse than God originally
designed.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.479
He didn’t provide a mechanism for how this
devolution worked, and he later recanted his

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.180
controversial views.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.589
But Buffon did at least open the door among
well-connected, university-trained philosophers

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.639
to the idea that species changed.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.129
This idea was pushed further by a more humble
botanist.

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:21.400
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, born in 1744, he was a
peasant, but he became a professor of invertebrates:

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.960
actually, he coined the term “invertebrate!”

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.120
Lamarck was an expert on marine worms and marine snails, mostly focused on shells.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.879
Although he also published Flowers of France, in 1778.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:38.310
And, influenced by Buffon, Lamarck criticized
the fixity of Linnaeus, moving toward an evolutionary

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.860
theory.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.880
ThoughtBubble, What did that theory look like?

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:43.709
The reason we remember Lamarck as the almost-Darwin

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:49.350
is that he developed a specific theory of
“transformisme” to describe how species

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.959
changed—providing a how and, perhaps more
importantly, a why.

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.610
Lamarck believed that individuals inherited
the traits that their parents had acquired

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.850
during life.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:04.940
In life, individuals use certain body parts
more than others, changing them ever so slightly,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.250
and then pass those changed parts down to
their kids.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.010
Although this idea has been proven wrong since
Lamarck’s time, some historians still credit

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.430
him with essentially predicting epigenetics,
or changes in living things made by changes

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.490
to which gene are expressed rather than by
changing the genetic code itself.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.220
Gradually, Lamarck thought, creatures would
become more complex.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.540
This progressive evolution was the opposite
of Buffon’s devolution.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.490
Lamarck’s famous example was the giraffe:
according to Lamarck, its neck elongated as

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.259
the animal stretched up to reach leaves that
were higher on trees.

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.930
Over time, short giraffes grew slightly longer
and slightly longer necks until—voila—they

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.540
could reach those high leaves.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.980
Of course, Lamarck never actually studied
or even saw a giraffe—although he almost

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.130
got the chance.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:54.000
The Pasha of Egypt had given France a giraffe
in 1827, shortly before Lamarck died… but

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.029
after Lamarck had gone blind.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:00.790
Lamarck’s transformisme was not exactly
a full framework for doing natural history.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.970
But he did argue that, essentially, the environment
is what pulls an organism along into a new

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.370
form… which makes historiographical sense.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.829
After all, Lamarck lived in a setting of rapid,
radical change for humans like himself:

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:15.180
the French Revolution.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.389
He saw the transition from a post-Revolution
republic into the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:23.899
And he saw how different individuals responded
to environmental shifts.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:28.209
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.
Finally, there was Georges Cuvier, born in

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:34.370
1773, and he added a different wrinkle to
the theory of biological transformation: extinction.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:39.720
Cuvier was an immensely famous professor,
known as the “Napoleon of natural history.”

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.350
Cuvier met Ben Franklin, corresponded with
Thomas Jefferson, and advised the real Napoleon.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.490
Scientifically, Cuvier established modern
comparative anatomy as a discipline, specializing

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.790
in the study of elephants.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.829
Cuvier believed each species was perfectly
adapted to its environment, and that you can

00:10:56.829 --> 00:11:02.639
reconstruct an organism from only one or two
bones, if you understand how anatomical systems

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:03.639
function.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:09.820
Cuvier opposed any theory of evolution, vigorously
arguing against Lamarck’s progressive one.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.209
But Cuvier also built his entire personal
scientific empire on the careful study of

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:20.819
fossilized animal remains, comparing living
and dead animals and classifying them by their

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:22.100
bone structure.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.279
He could see that some types of animals
simply no longer existed!

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:32.079
How did Cuvier square the fossil record with
a belief in a divinely ordered, mostly unchanging

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.079
creation?

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:37.710
He argued for catastrophism, the idea that
major changes in species come about due to

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.620
catastrophic events—such as the Flood of
Noah.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.889
At the end of the 1700s, natural historians
had a system for comparing and naming everything

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:46.899
alive.

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:48.310
They had state support.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.310
And they had some ideas about how life changed
over time.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.800
But they didn’t have a new paradigm for
researching this change.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.300
They didn’t have a biology.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.671
Next time—let’s follow the fossil trail,
hunt for mines, learn the true age of the

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.320
earth, and further clear the way for Darwin’s
biology: first, we need the birth of geology!

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.320
Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.600
and is made with the help of these nice people and our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.350
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.680
