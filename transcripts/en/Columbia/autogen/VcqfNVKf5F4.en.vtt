work so what we did was we took the

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:47.380
work so what we did was we took the
 

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.960
work so what we did was we took the
technology that reads text in documents

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:48.970
technology that reads text in documents
 

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.780
technology that reads text in documents
and we applied it to this we found the

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:51.790
and we applied it to this we found the
 

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.550
and we applied it to this we found the
date that the event happened and then

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:53.560
date that the event happened and then
 

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.890
date that the event happened and then
the date the 8k was filed we call the

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:55.900
the date the 8k was filed we call the
 

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.920
the date the 8k was filed we call the
intervening period the 8k trading gap

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:57.930
