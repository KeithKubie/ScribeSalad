00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.840
So David,
how did you configure the chair?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.530
&gt;&gt; So you can see here my final
configuration for this chair.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.955
I ended up with a 160 gram chair.

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:12.230
It cost $16 based on
having four metal legs.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.210
I didn't give it arms.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.790
I gave it a metal back.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.820
And of course the 100 gram
metal seat that was required.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.580
As far as how I actually did
this though, like before,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.050
I started off by writing out
the initial constraints we were given.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.360
The chair has to cost less than $16.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.960
It has to have 100 g metal seat.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.530
And it has 100 g metal seat.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.049
And that seat has to cost $10.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.330
So 100 grams times $0.10 per
gram means $10 for the seat.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.660
After this, however, we're already
pretty close to our price limit.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.510
So the plan I'm using might specify
that when we're getting within a certain

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.530
range of our price limit to operate
under a heuristic that calls for

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.250
minimizing the cost.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.660
That heuristic in that
plan might then say,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.490
find the part that can be
minimized the most next.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.730
That part would be the arms.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970
The arms had a range
from 0 grams to 50 grams,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.510
meaning that arms are not
even required in our chair.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.040
So to minimize our costs, we're
going to go ahead and cut the arms, and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.840
say that our arms cost nothing.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.810
Now our plan might recognize that we're
no longer quite as constrained by our

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.970
price, so we're going to choose the next
most important part of the chair,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.610
which might be the legs.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.300
Given some information that
the plan has about the ideal legs,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.290
it might choose to have four legs,
that are ten grams each and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.490
are made of metal,
which gives us a cost of $4.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.810
Based on the $10 seat and
the four dollar legs,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.720
we now know that we have $2 left for
our back.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.420
The plan may have a heuristic that
says it's ideal to match materials or

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.080
the plan may have a heuristic that
says that metal is the optimal

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.650
material to use.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.888
So it may choose metal.

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:37.740
And given $2 for the remaining money and
a material of metal,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.250
it can derive that 20g is
the mass available for the back.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060
And now that all of these individual
variables have been assigned,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.455
we can then see that the final mass
is 160g, and has a cost of $16.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.550
At most $16 meets that constraint.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.290
And we have our 100g
metal seat over here.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.315
&gt;&gt; That's good David.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.430
This important note that David used
several different kinds of knowledge.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.010
First, he had knowledge
of the general chair.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.430
He knew about the components,
he knew about the slots, but

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.980
not necessarily all the fillers for
the slots.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.430
Second, he had heuristic knowledge,
he used the term heuristic.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.440
Recall that heuristic stands for
rule of thumb.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.280
So heuristic knowledge about
how to go about filling

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.258
the values of some of these slots.

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:22.560
Third, explicit list is not
just knowledge about legs and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.990
seats and arms and so on,
but also how this chair,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.260
as a whole,
is decomposed into its components.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.610
That is one of the fundamental rules
of knowledge and knowledge-based AI.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.490
It allows us to structure the problem so

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.330
the problem can be
addressed efficiently.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.630
Note that this process of configuration
design is closely related to the method

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.800
of constrained proposition that we
discussed in a previous lesson.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.020
Here are some constraints, and
these constraints have been propagated

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.970
downwards in the plan
abstraction hierarchy.
