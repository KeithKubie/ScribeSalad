JOSH LIVNI: Thanks for
watching, guys.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.350
My name is Josh Livni,
I'm on the Maps

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.590
Developer Relations team.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.900
And special guest
today, we have--

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.239
FELIPE HOFFA: Hello, everyone,
I am Felipe Hoffa.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm with the Cloud Platform
team, with the Big Data team,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.830
specifically.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.150
And specifically BigQuery, the
tool that allows you to query

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.570
millions, billions of records
in very few seconds.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.080
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, BigQuery
is amazing.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.200
And I was watching this video
that you and Michael put on

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.110
last week about the new
correlations, Pearson

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.590
correlations, that BigQuery
magically

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.720
takes care of for you.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.060
And it was a really
great video.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.690
Tell me a little bit more about
what are correlations

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.430
and what you did.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
FELIPE HOFFA: That was a
very fun video to tape.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.170
To get out if you can, we took
70 million flights across the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.920
United States, across
10 years of story.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.360
We were looking for
correlations.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.700
We were looking how to
predict the future.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.840
How to know if you're flying
tomorrow from any airport in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.810
the United States, how to
predict how late your plane

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.130
will be depending on what
happened today.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.590
JOSH LIVNI: Pretty cool.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.890
Pretty cool.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.700
So I was watching the video.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.780
You had the states that are
most correlated with each

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.530
other, lots of nice graphs
in matplotlib.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.610
And then I was waiting for it,
I was waiting for it--

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.065
no map.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.890
I was very sad.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.560
But luckily, I was able to
track you down in the San

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.660
Francisco office, and in a
matter of like an hour put

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.240
together a map.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.680
So that's what we're talking
about today is, let's say you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.690
have a big data analysis
you're doing.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.040
You have some output, it fits
into a nice spreadsheet.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.170
Is it spatial data?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.870
Why not go ahead and
put a map on it?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.370
So this is what we did
with this blog post.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.020
Fresh off the presses, Felipe
and I, talking a little bit

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.950
about how one takes some
output from BigQuery,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.180
puts it on a map.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850
FELIPE HOFFA: We have up
here, let's look at it.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.090
What do you do here, Josh?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.610
JOSH LIVNI: What do we have?

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.960
So we have a lot of little black
circles on this map.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.290
These are the airports that we
have lots of data for over

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.790
this 10 year history.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.330
And go ahead and click on, I
flew out of Seattle last week.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.630
Click on it.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.920
FELIPE HOFFA: Let's see what's
happening on Seattle.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.220
So if I click here, I see a lot
of circles-- big circles,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.000
small circles, no circles.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.230
What do they mean?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.800
JOSH LIVNI: What do they mean?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.110
Yeah, so basically what we're
doing is resizing and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.980
recoloring the circles based on
the correlation of airport

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.010
delay departure between today
and what we predict tomorrow.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.960
So in this case for Seattle,
it means that if I'm flying

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.370
out of Seattle tomorrow,
what airport

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.460
should I look at today?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.600
Probably Seattle, which
kind of makes sense.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.150
FELIPE HOFFA: There is a very
high correlation for having a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.140
data point in this
time series.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.240
There is a very high correlation
on what happened

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.700
yesterday in Seattle, predicting
what is going to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.290
happen today.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.690
JOSH LIVNI: Well, not that high
a correlation-- we're

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.700
like 0.47 here.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.460
What if we change the seasons?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.600
I know that there's sometimes
more correlations in different

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.400
seasons for different
airports.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.040
FELIPE HOFFA: Whoa.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.660
JOSH LIVNI: Airports, planes,
weather, kind of makes sense.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.750
Yeah, so now at 0.7, that's
pretty good correlation.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.730
Again, it just kind of makes
sense-- if you want to know

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.590
what's in Seattle tomorrow,
look at Seattle today.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.820
Probably raining.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.690
FELIPE HOFFA: That's a very
good way to predict the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.860
future, whatever happened today
would happen tomorrow.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.820
But sometimes there
are better ways.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.420
For example, let's fly to
a different airport.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.970
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.110
I don't know, where did
you fly from recently?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.820
FELIPE HOFFA: Let's
call San Diego.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.010
JOSH LIVNI: Okie doke.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.290
FELIPE HOFFA: Let's
go to San Diego.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.330
What do we have here?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.430
JOSH LIVNI: A very different
pattern.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.810
FELIPE HOFFA: Yes.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.340
Correlation size is smaller.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.140
But this is interesting.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.490
The biggest correlation
is not with San Diego

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.300
with itself but LA.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.230
What's happening today in LA
predicts better what's

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.520
happening in San
Diego tomorrow.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.310
JOSH LIVNI: Maybe that
makes sense.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.240
LA's kind of the
hub down there.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.530
So this is kind of
interesting.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.210
Small correlations distributed
kind of evenly throughout the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.030
country, unlike the West
Coast, Seattle.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.940
What happens if you
pick a major hub?

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.090
FELIPE HOFFA: Let's go
to the East Coast.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.980
How about New York, JFK?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.580
JOSH LIVNI: OK, so lots of
stuff, bigger circles, bigger

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.100
correlations on the
East Coast.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.380
It's kind of interesting.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.540
JFK's not even in the top five
for predicting what JFK's

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.490
going to be like.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.360
FELIPE HOFFA: That's
very interesting.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.620
If you want to know what is
going to happen in JFK

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.460
tomorrow, during spring,
look at what happened

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.430
in Nashville yesterday.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.840
JOSH LIVNI: Nashville
predicts JFK.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.150
I love it.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.490
So yeah, you can click around
this map, kind of see some

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.839
distributions of how the
different airports are

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.890
correlated with each other.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.660
It's kind of interesting.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.940
Change the seasons around,
have some fun.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.830
And this was super easy
to put together.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.490
Why don't we hop back
to the blog post?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.620
Just take a quick look at the
code, and talk a little bit

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.650
about how it works.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.400
FELIPE HOFFA: Please show me
how you're doing this.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.300
This is great.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.070
I love it.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.420
JOSH LIVNI: Well, of course,
all of the code is

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.040
available on GitHub.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.020
If you click through to the map,
you can view the source.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.570
But we also have a short gist
down here showing the main

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.230
functions to recolor things.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.260
It's pretty easy.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.230
I have a method down at the
bottom, the get icon one that

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.900
passed in the scale of the
correlation, and a color to

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.620
color [? by, ?] say,
red versus black.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.760
Let's get back a circle.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.130
It's pretty easy to
draw circles on

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.270
a map, that's useful.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.040
And then the other thing is
just highlighting the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.550
correlations.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.430
Looping through all of the hard
work that Felipe did to

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.170
give me the results of
the correlations.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.640
And then go ahead and just say
for each airport get the

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.470
appropriate icon back.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.240
Not super hard.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.920
Not a lot of code to create
a map like this.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.560
We started from a template
visualizing earthquakes that

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.590
we put a really basic article
on that you guys can start

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.100
with if you have different
size circles.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.890
And more importantly, if you're
doing some big data

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.030
analysis and there's some
spatial aspect to the data, go

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.520
ahead and make a visualization
that has a map with it when

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.400
you're finished.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.090
FELIPE HOFFA: I love it.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.180
Thank you very much for
doing this, Josh.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.910
JOSH LIVNI: Thank you
for doing all

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.840
the hard work, Felipe.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.200
My job was easy.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.300
FELIPE HOFFA: Well, your
job is awesome.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.000
So anyway, remember, if you have
spatial data and you like

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.860
it, put a map on it.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.740
JOSH LIVNI: I love that.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.580
Quotes to live by.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.780
Felipe, thank you very much.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.380
I'm Josh.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.320
FELIPE HOFFA: And I'm
Felipe Hoffa.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.830
Goodbye.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.080
JOSH LIVNI: Cheers.
