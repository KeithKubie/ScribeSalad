00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.319
 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.629
In the past we released a video on how your childhood affects your love style.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.110
Now that you've identified

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.250
what your core patterns are, we figured it would be helpful to offer insights on how to work with each love style.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.269
Whether your partner is prone to being a distant avoider or an anxious

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.550
vacillator, know that working out your differences will only strengthen your relationship in the end.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.239
Here are five tips on how to work with your partner's love style.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.090
One: the pleaser

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.019
Charming, nice and known as the stereotypical good students, these type of people actually grew up walking on eggshells.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.169
Their parents were most likely either overly critical,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.300
overly protective or both. As a result, they have a hard time setting boundaries, saying no and do their best to maintain

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.640
peace even at their own expense.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.108
In relationships they don't deal with conflict well and may try to avoid it altogether

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.908
by resorting to bad habits such as lying. To resolve issues with the pleaser show them that it's normal for things to get messy.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.879
But instead of getting mad at them let them know that you want their honest input not something sugar-coated.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.720
Two: the victim

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.739
Victims grew up in a violent, abusive environment.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.019
Consequently, they do not like to attract much attention to themselves and prefer to blend in the background. Often compliant and adaptable,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.729
it can be hard to tell whether a victim is suffering or not. Common problems

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.069
they face are putting up with toxic behaviour and choosing a partner who repeats the abusive behavior

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.600
they've been accustomed to. In order to work with a victim provide the encouragement

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.940
they lacked growing up and set healthy, consistent habits to let them know they are safe with you.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030
Three: the controller

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.780
Bossy, intimidating and quick to anger, these type of people adopted a black and white mentality at a young age.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.258
Either you are controlled or do the controlling.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.910
In relationships partners may find them rigid and selfish with their expectations and threatening during breaking points. Inside though

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.779
they're definitely hurting. When working with a controller don't give them the upper hand nor excuse their toxic behavior.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.070
Instead, meet in the middle.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.989
Let them know that you aren't the main source of their pain, but rather it's the unresolved childhood memory they need to address.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290
Four: the vacillator

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.440
Vacillators grew up in an unpredictable household. Fearing abandonment and yearning for stability,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.769
these individuals have felt misunderstood their whole lives.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.949
Still, they managed to remain idealistic searching for their soulmate. They have to be careful

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.720
however, with their starry-eyed nature. Prone to venting, anger and guilt, vacillators will often be paralyzed by the problems

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.480
they face.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.390
They may expect their partners to come up with solutions instead of standing on their own two feet.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.729
To work with a vacillators, provide emotional support and listen to their frustrations.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.449
Ask them questions and help them reflect on potential solutions, but don't do the work for them. Over time

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.440
this will help them realize they are capable of more than they usually think.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.450
Five: the avoider

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.019
Known to be self-sufficient, these types of people value their space and freedom above everyone.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.798
Since they come from a background where little to no support was offered they learn to mature fast and take care of themselves.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.039
In relationships common problems avoiders face include being dismissive of their partner's feelings,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.779
having difficulty providing empathy and creating too many boundaries to the point of being unreachable. To work with an avoider

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.109
never try to force ideas onto them or throw temper tantrums.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.009
This will only cause them to retreat or shut down even more.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.809
Avoiders can get easily overwhelmed if you're being too emotional or defensive. Give them time to cool off and attempt to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.139
problem-solve with them when the both of you are clear minded.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.940
