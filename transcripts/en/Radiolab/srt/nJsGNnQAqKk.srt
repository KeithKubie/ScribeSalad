1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,570
You're listening to radio lab from
New York public radio, public radio,

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,840
W, C,

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,850
n, n. P. R.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,200
[inaudible].

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,060
This is Radiolab on Jab and Rod.

6
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:26,980
Today we're in a doctor
Frankenstein sort of mood,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,610
so we figure we're better to start
death test and at the museum,

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,680
American Museum of natural history where
they have on a kind of Frankenstein

9
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,750
exit. Okay, I'm Laurel Candle.

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,890
I curate the American Museum of Natural
History is exhibit mythic creatures.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,880
We're standing in front of a dragon now.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,740
Why would there be a dragon at the
Museum of Natural History? Well,

13
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,760
according to the curator,
Laurel Kendall, yes,

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,920
the human mind loves to wonder, well,

15
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,530
what would happen if we put wings on a
horse or put a tail on a beautiful woman?

16
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:03,130
Dad is human justified, however you
want that belongs in the museum.

17
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:07,750
What you see before you, we'd begin
these all strange twisting creatures,

18
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,880
a dimly lit, and when
you look more closely,

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,770
you realize that they're all mashups
from the natural world. For example,

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,340
she takes us over to one corner
points at a class case we're inside.

21
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:22,090
What you're seeing is this creepy
little hybrid skeleton thing.

22
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:26,170
Look at this spaced and see
how it really is a composite.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,340
Half of it is a monkey,

24
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:30,940
the upper half monkey skull and
the lower half is a fish tail.

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,780
Like some kind of trout with some
scales, places full of stuff like this.

26
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:39,190
A Elian with an eagle head. Humans
with snake tails, just spending thing.

27
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,200
You can imagine. Very operatic. Oh,

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,950
and I forgot to mention the
most important part. Kid.

29
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,060
Tons and tons of kids
completely in awe. Oh my God.

30
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,983
Your uniform.

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,330
What are we standing
under here? The Pegasus.

32
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:02,050
Can you describe what we're seeing here
is a horse. The body's like a horse.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,590
He has these really big wings,
wings like birds, like an eagle.

34
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,450
Maybe somehow his parents were a horse
and a bird in there. Their genes,

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,790
um, together too. Make a Pegasus.
Just what I see that what I see.

36
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,810
It just looks so exciting that
it just looks really cool.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,930
And when you ask these kids, is
there a producer? Little Miller did.

38
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:27,040
Why is it cool? Like why is it fun
to see two animals mashed together?

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,120
Um, will they just look
at you like you're dumb.

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,790
So Horse [inaudible] yes. Um,

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,330
birds, they're not mythical.

42
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,690
They're like the regular
every day you see them,

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,180
every time you just see a pigeon
you're like, oh, whatever.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,950
Maybe it's that simple. Yeah.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,480
Any case the kids would get sick of us
and are dumb questions ran off to this

46
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:56,080
kiosk at the museum and set up around
the corner right here where they could

47
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:59,980
actually build their own creatures.
Okay. Now can you, your guy here?

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,030
Well he has um,

49
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,620
seven heads and he has a tail
with fire on it for a lay.

50
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,130
He has a long body and the thing
is how the legs are though,

51
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,503
you can't help them.

52
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,680
Chicken leg,

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
like these same kids in about 30 or 40
years might actually be able to do this

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,210
for real.

55
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,030
Where did that grown up?

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,270
Those kids will be at home in
the new world of biotechnology.

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,360
They won't be ready to
put their skills to use.

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,370
That will be do it yourself kits to breed
new varieties of pigeons and parrots

59
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,870
and lizards and snakes.

60
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,970
I buy like a snake and then like a
bird. Oh, can I do it? Cause I never got

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,770
genetic engineering.

62
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:41,480
Once it gets into the hands of housewives
and children will give us an explosion

63
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,460
of diversity of new living creatures.

64
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,510
That is physicists, Freeman Dyson.
We'll hear more from him later. Now,

65
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,910
whether it's true or
not, what he's saying,

66
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,630
it does seem to be the case that we
are at this pivotal point now where the

67
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:57,631
stuff that we used to only imagine
might actually turn into reality,

68
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,090
which is why maybe you get an exhibit
of fantasy creatures at the Museum of

69
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,040
natural history. This is a
celebration of the human imagination.

70
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,540
Human Ingenuity. Human. Yeah.

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,210
[inaudible] name of God. Oh, I
know what it feels like to be gone.

72
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,210
That's our show today. Life, but not as
we know it. Life as we might invent it,

73
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,620
tweak it, augment it. Yes. But if
you augment, tweak, and remake,

74
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:47,920
people will quickly come to you
and say, Hey, don't fuss with this.

75
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,520
It's not natural. It's not right.
Speaking of right and natural and fussing.

76
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,600
Who are you? Oh I'm sorry. I, Robert
Krulwich who was always right,

77
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,620
always naturally and always
fussing that word you,

78
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,730
you mentioned um, natural. Yeah, that
one. Natural. What does it mean exactly?

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,930
Let's just think usually means what it
means, what's familiar, what we know,

80
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,070
who we know. Let's say.

81
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's just muck that up a bit because
it turns out when you look in nature you

82
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,810
will find things that are frankly
very strange and not familiar. Like,

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,220
well, let me tell you a story.

84
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,030
It's an amazing story about a woman
heard about it from a reporter,

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,200
Soren Wheeler. I sworn right. Hey,
it's a Soren. Tell me about Karen.

86
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,230
Well Karen is, I'm a mother of three,

87
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:34,150
a middle aged woman living outside of
Boston and the suburbs of Boston and uh,

88
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,490
she lives there with her husband Pete.
The kids are out of the house now.

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,990
Tell me what you were thinking when
you walked up to her door. Well, I,

90
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,410
I was nervous. I was kind of
strangely nervous about meeting her.

91
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,600
Hi Karen. Hi. But I got there and
she was just friendly as can be,

92
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,920
bring in a couple of cups
of tea. She made me tea,

93
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,850
we sat in the living room
and talk and uh, she was just

94
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,700
normal, which it's kind of weird given
the story that she was about to tell me.

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,060
So let's start at the very beginning. Oh,

96
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,870
well in 1995,

97
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,820
I was told that I needed a
kidney transplant immediately.

98
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,350
What's that like? Like what are you
going through? It was frightening.

99
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,380
The doctors told Karen
they needed to act fast.

100
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,470
They asked me who in my family
might be willing to donate a kidney.

101
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,700
The two older boys, that's Matt
and Jess and Karen's husband Pete,

102
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,470
you all went in to get what should have
been a pretty routine DNA test. Yup.

103
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,850
They had the blood work
done and they waited.

104
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,940
A couple of weeks later I got a phone
call from the hospital and they said,

105
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,630
Mrs Keegan, um,

106
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,760
this is a very unusual
situation that we're, uh,

107
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,830
going to explain to you. It's
something that we've never seen before.

108
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,560
But uh,

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,130
when the DNA testing
was done on your sons,

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,350
we found that they didn't match your DNA.

111
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,330
Is that how they said it? They
said they match the father,

112
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,690
but they're not a match for
you. What does that mean?

113
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,930
That they didn't match her
DNA? She's not their mother

114
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,120
ready much here. And this was
crazy. Yeah. I mean she told them,

115
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,870
well I was there. This could not
possibly be. I gave birth to these kids.

116
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,250
I felt the pain. You know,

117
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,220
you better do the test again
because you're obviously wrong.

118
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,880
And so they did do the test again.
Same result. The read was correct.

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,450
There was not a laboratory error. This
is one of her doctors when you, we,

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,210
we felt particularly after the
second time that it was real.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,860
And then they said,

122
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,010
now we have had situations where
the husband's DNA didn't match,

123
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,450
but we've never had a mother whose
DNA didn't match their children.

124
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,970
Mm hmm.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,960
So wait, if the DNA saying she's not
the mom, then what would explain that?

126
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,660
Well, first thought was that
there was some kind of mix,

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,800
some switch babies or something like a
baby switch right after birth kind of

128
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,940
thing. Yeah. But the problem with
that is that the dad is, the dad is,

129
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,980
or the fathers. Right.

130
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,120
So you have to figure out like how
could they have gotten the wrong kid,

131
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,000
but the right dad says, then
what if, if that's the case,

132
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,870
here's the thing at this, at this point,
as we got further involved with this,

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,580
people are thinking maybe Karen's
done something kind of fishing.

134
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,770
There must be something
that you're not being told.

135
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:41,771
Like maybe she implanted her womb with
another woman's baby and then she just

136
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:46,280
kind of lied about it. Yeah, that
she lied about it. They said, well,

137
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,690
could you tell us what hospital you
had these children and how exactly how,

138
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,440
what would,

139
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,370
I'm still confused as being accused of
being some kind of monster who maybe

140
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,580
wish they had children stolen
that child or something had to be,

141
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,680
because obviously DNA is
never wrong. It's never wrong.

142
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,590
Wow. So how did she talk
to her family about this?

143
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,240
What are those conversations like?

144
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,330
I do remember some very
sort of sad moments.

145
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,600
Bless my sons. Yeah.
You know, I told them,

146
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,960
I don't think they maybe even
completely realized what I was saying.

147
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,710
Lynn, Karen's doctor couldn't
get this out of her head.

148
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,140
Something wasn't adding
up. Didn't make sense.

149
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,500
So she thought about the fact that
they'd done all of the tests on Karen's

150
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,880
blood, only in our blood cells.

151
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,210
So Lynn started thinking maybe the next
step they ought to look at some other

152
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,980
parts. And to do that we would
need to test other tissues,

153
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,981
scrape the inside of your mouth and get
a little saliva and maybe a hair or to

154
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,870
thyroid and a skin biopsy with
you're getting all sorts of parts,

155
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,670
you're getting a law parts and
all kinds of parts from me.

156
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,300
That's when things started to get strange.

157
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,320
When we got the results of the tissue
studies, we identified two, two,

158
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,810
two, two sets of DNA. Two people

159
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,190
to what? Another person in Karen,

160
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,720
she had another person
inside her. Well sort of.

161
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,610
She did have a separate set of DNA.

162
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,990
So it was like she had another person
with its own genetic identity in her body.

163
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,200
And the thing is that that other
person that was the mother of the boys,

164
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,490
well how did they get there? That,

165
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,210
I mean that's what the doctors were
wondering. So they all sit down,

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,260
put their heads together and try to
figure it out and then it hit him.

167
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,370
You were a twin. You are a twin. She,

168
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,610
I mean she had a twin.
No, she's both twins.

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,700
Here's what happened in
Karen's mother's womb.

170
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,930
Originally there were two
eggs, two fertilized eggs,

171
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,300
twin girls side by side,

172
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,310
developing in their own separate
sacks. Then after a couple of days,

173
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:11,120
something strange happened. Somehow
the two embryos bumped into each other

174
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,120
and they fused into one unit
and that one became Karen.

175
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,400
Like a mixture of the
two of them. Well, no,

176
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,710
they didn't blend according to Lynn,

177
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:24,440
what happened is they kind of
claimed different parts of,

178
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,520
they still had their own,
I want to say boundaries.

179
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,440
One twin claimed her blood and the
other twin claimed her thyroid and her

180
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,980
bladder. And Karen is a plural.

181
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,050
Yeah. [inaudible]

182
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,000
is this, has this, has this happened
before? Well, supposedly it's pretty rare,

183
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,560
but it does happen. In fact, there's,

184
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,810
there's a scientific
word for this condition.

185
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,950
Karen first heard that word
from her doctor, Margo cres.

186
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Margo came to my bedside,
explained that I was a Chi.

187
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,190
Mira a term which I had never heard of.

188
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,340
Did she fall? Did she come and say,
you're a Chi Kymera and it, yeah.

189
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,280
Yes.

190
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Now that was interesting because I
called my son the English major and said,

191
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,540
Matt, I've found out I was a
Chi Mira, and he said, oh, well,

192
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:22,150
you know what a Kai Mira is, don't
you? And I said, no. And he said,

193
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,984
well,

194
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,120
in the ancient Greek myths, I,

195
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,320
Thai Mira is an animal
that has like a lion,

196
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:34,970
has a donkey's a goat, Kale,

197
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,530
you know, it's a mixture and Greek myths.

198
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,920
The Camaro was a monster that
the heroes opposed to slay.

199
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,840
That didn't make me feel very good.

200
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Then Karen learned more about what
Kymera meant medically and what could've

201
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,380
happened to her.

202
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,130
If the eggs hadn't
fused. Within four days,

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,850
I would have become a Siamese twin.

204
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,180
When you hear that,

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,240
you immediately have a more
concrete vision of two selves.

206
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,070
It brought home the reality
that I really was a twin.

207
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,590
She is a twin. One doctor said,
do you think you have two souls?

208
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,330
I think of myself,

209
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,230
yeah. There is

210
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,910
almost a sort of subtle sadness to
sink did I would've had a sister.

211
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,883
Yeah.

212
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,730
And so there is sort of
a shadow feeling of loss.

213
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,170
There could have been more

214
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,190
thanks to reporter Soren Wheeler for that.

215
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,520
Let's make things a little more
disturbing now because human beings,

216
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:16,050
scientists are now capable of
creating kindnesses purposefully.

217
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,980
And we talked to Lee silver who is a
scientist at Princeton elite. Okay. Lee,

218
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:20,814
you have to say something.

219
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,240
Okay. You know my left ear is receiving
more than my right. Is there a,

220
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,750
when he told us about
an intentional Kemira,

221
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:33,030
a creature created by a Danish
embryologist named Steen Wilson.

222
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,390
Keith took a goat embryo and a sheep
embryo and he pushed them together in his

223
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,460
petri dish.

224
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,720
But that mixture of
embryo back into a female,

225
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,980
I don't remember which species.

226
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,220
And then what was born was an animal that
was part part sheep and he called that

227
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:58,520
agape. Was it visibly kind
of goatee and kind of sheepy?

228
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,890
Well it was actually,
yes, it was very visible.

229
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,680
And what happened because of
the way development occurs,

230
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,030
parts of its body looks, sheep like
and parts of its body look goat.

231
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,130
Like which parts? Well,

232
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,600
he did this multiple times and so he
actually got multiple gifts and sometimes

233
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:19,010
the animal would have for goat had, but
then parts of his body would be sheep,

234
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,260
like with wool. Other times
it would have a sheep.

235
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,450
How confusing it would be at the dance.

236
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,240
You wouldn't know like who was
supposed to dance with home? Could,

237
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,350
could gifts relate with
one another in that way.

238
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,700
I don't remember. It's not
a deep, as you may look,

239
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,010
a little beard and
everything in the hooves.

240
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,120
Ah,

241
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,060
I mean, just to give you a visual,

242
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:43,900
we've got a picture here of three
beeps hanging out near a tree.

243
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you want to describe
it? Well, the Geeks,

244
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,500
one of them looks like a naked animal
wearing the coat of shaggy hair is,

245
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,980
it's got this streak of sheep
wool running on its back,

246
00:15:56,981 --> 00:16:00,820
but the rest of it looks kind of
Godi. Which deal do you find a cute?

247
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,300
I kind of do find it cute. Well,
Bucknell, it's an cuted a bit.

248
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,410
Suppose instead of talking about
mixing sheep with goats, okay,

249
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,330
since you're not a sheep or a
goat, let's make it more personal.

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
People are most worried about combining
human embryonic cells and monkey or

251
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,550
chimp embryonic cells.

252
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,260
And so the idea is if you took a chimp
embryo in a human embryo and you push

253
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:31,230
them together based on the Geek results,

254
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,410
based on lots of other data that
scientists have accumulated,

255
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,300
it's very likely that you'd have an
organism born that was part chimp,

256
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,510
part human. Well, there once
was a creature like that because

257
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,020
if you believe in evolution,

258
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:48,130
you believe that chimps
eventually became humans.

259
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,430
So somewhere in history there is
someone who is 10% chimp and 90%

260
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,270
and that common ancestor evolved
continuously and slowly from a chimp like,

261
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,410
um, individual to human. And in every
point along the 100,000 generations,

262
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,280
the children didn't look very different
from their parents. But here's the,

263
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,270
here's the very sad Hollywood movie.

264
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,590
I go and I go and I create a creature,

265
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,490
a jeep like you know, amalgamation,

266
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,880
which is 50% chimpanzee,

267
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,180
ape and 50% human homosapiens and he's
the only one that's like creating a

268
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:36,720
tragedy. It seems like because you'd be
creating someone who is isolated in his

269
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,490
physiology.

270
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,920
Yes. I mean this is agreed with
him on, maybe they could, but

271
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,480
at the cost of you're
taping us opening something.

272
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,760
I'm opening something for good.
This is actually a play here.

273
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,740
You can look at this. It's going
to be performed next week. Sweet.

274
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,270
Sweet Motherhood, isn't
it? Yes, that's it.

275
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,240
So this is a play at the
Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

276
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,430
Shelley McCann wants to baby
a human chimpanzee baby.

277
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,050
Oh.

278
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,410
Shelley's been spending too much time
partying to build up a respectable grade

279
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:15,980
point average. So she proposes
the following senior thesis,

280
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,930
fertilized one of her eggs with the
sperm from a chimpanzee in her womb.

281
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,510
It's an interesting term paper.

282
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,740
So professor Harry Stein must do
everything he can to stop her.

283
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,700
The play is inspired by
a true event. Really?

284
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,720
This is your play. Yes.

285
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,620
Jeremy character is the main playwright
and I've collaborated with him.

286
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,520
What is the true truth? And I watch this,
his base, the true event is that, uh,

287
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,520
about 10, 12 years ago now,

288
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I was talking to my usual flippant way
to a bunch of students and a sequence

289
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:55,710
information had just come out showing
that chimps and humans were almost 90% the

290
00:18:55,711 --> 00:19:00,300
same at the DNA level. And so I
just threw out the idea, well,

291
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,900
based on what we know about goats
and sheep and everything else,

292
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,000
you probably could have a hybrid
developed between a chimpanzee and human

293
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,370
beings. It was a thought
experiment. What would it be?

294
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,460
How would it developed which of
its characteristics be human,

295
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,300
which would be chimpanzee?
The next day a student,

296
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,450
a junior came to my office and said she
wanted to do the experiment inside her

297
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:29,100
own womb. Ah, and uh, so then yes, uh,

298
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,090
in real life, what did you do? He hit
her on the head with a baseball bat or,

299
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,120
well, no, I had a long,
I was flabbergasted.

300
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,990
She was absolutely serious
because she is actually true. She,

301
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,090
she was this student who partied a lot
and she needed and the senior thesis at

302
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:49,980
Princeton counts an enormous amount
in towards your final GPA. So, uh,

303
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,640
she wanted to do this unique experiment
hoping she'd get an a plus in her senior

304
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:56,430
thesis. And she was very naive obviously.

305
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,510
That was the last time I saw this
little chimpanzee up for adoption.

306
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:04,770
As soon as it was born. Well, no, no
worse. She posted that she, I asked her,

307
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,700
what would you do with this individual?
I said, well, if it's a human being,

308
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:11,250
you have to raise it like a human
being and as rights, like human being,

309
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,670
if it's a chimpanzee, you put
her in a zoo or you use it,

310
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,040
use it for experiments
and what's it going to be?

311
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,370
And her answer to that question was she
would abort right before it came time to

312
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:25,290
go into labor, she'd board.

313
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,350
And so the whole idea of the senior thesis
was to study the development of this

314
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,370
hybrid inside of her womb. She
really wanted to do this for real,

315
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:39,450
not just on paper for a project,
but actually she wants, yes. Now,

316
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
there are many, many, many, many problems.

317
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,920
Do meaning liberal arts
education, really liberal here.

318
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,060
We talked for about an
hour. Um, I dissuaded her.

319
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,040
I never saw her again

320
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,350
except in a way in his play.
The, when he cowrote road.

321
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:01,020
This is the play about the
teacher at the fancy university.

322
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,210
It happens just to be
teaching a biology class,

323
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,770
the human ovary within the masters.

324
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,950
But it happens to have this notion about
what would it be like if chimps and

325
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:10,410
humans had babies together.
Actually in a number,

326
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,810
I am more similar to a MailChimp than I
am to my sister happens to have in the

327
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:19,260
play. The student who comes
up after class and says,

328
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,510
I want to combine one of my eggs with
chimpanzees wants you to do this except by

329
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:29,230
the way in the play checks
he goes through with it.

330
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,711
But you know, he,

331
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:35,580
he wrote the play to keep a conversation
going that wouldn't get out of his

332
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:39,000
hand. And the question is
what is a human being? Um,

333
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,740
if you look at a developmentally,

334
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:43,320
evolutionarily through these
hybrids and time areas,

335
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,150
where's the boundary between
human being and non human being?

336
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,170
And at the end of my quest,

337
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,400
I personally concluded that there
is no boundary. No, no, no, no.

338
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,670
It's fuzzy. So in other
words, if you look at,

339
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,760
the analogy I like to give is look at the
color spectrum between green and blue.

340
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,330
When you go from green to
blue along the color spectrum,

341
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,810
it's a continuous gradual
change from one to the other.

342
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,290
There's no point in which you say, here's
the boundary between green and blue.

343
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,830
And if you take that analogy,
which I did, two human beings,

344
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:23,520
you say during development
or in evolution in the,

345
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,520
in terms of a Kemira, there's no boundary.

346
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,640
But the social effect of having staked
out that position is that you aren't

347
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:38,271
going to defend our species
against all kinds of amendments.

348
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
There is a consequence to this
kind of thinking, right? I mean,

349
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,290
you can't do it cold porter,
anything goes, can you know? No,

350
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,770
I don't believe you can do anything
goes. My purpose is to say,

351
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:52,740
not that anything goes,
but that in theory,

352
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,490
all these outrageous things could
happen and actually are happening.

353
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,750
Here's an example,

354
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,220
since 1980 scientists have
been taking human genes,

355
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,310
genetic information, putting it into mice.

356
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:10,311
I mean this is sort of a routine procedure
and for people who do mouse molecular

357
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:10,980
genetics,

358
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,130
and in fact the really exciting thing
that people are doing now is they're

359
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:19,131
making cows that are engineered
to produce human blood.

360
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,860
And the idea is that you want to change
all the genes in the cow that normally

361
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:27,060
produce the proteins in cow blood.

362
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,050
You want to make them all human so
you'd have a cow making human blood.

363
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:32,760
I don't think most people would mind that.

364
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,670
And then you could use it
for blood transfusions. Wow.

365
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,990
Could you make a cow with human blood
and a human kidney so that you could use

366
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:44,820
that to, well, actually, uh, Ma, uh,
Israeli scientists have already created a,

367
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,420
that has a tiny little functioning
human kidney can't out.

368
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,050
I could show you the
picture. Yeah. So, I mean,

369
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,540
and you know when there are other people
who are working with sheep and trying

370
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:00,800
to make human livers and side sheep
and the whole ideas is regenerative

371
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,360
medicine, sacrifice the animals
to get a new kidney for you. Now,

372
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,800
I actually think that as long as you
don't play with the external features,

373
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,440
I think society walks up
to it. I mean, you know,

374
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:15,020
people eat pigs and if you can eat a pig,

375
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,260
why not grow a pig to have a
human liver or kidney or heart?

376
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,480
As long as it still looks like a
pig, you're saying that's right.

377
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,260
As long as it still looks like a pig
and it's still behaves like a pig.

378
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,390
You know, if you put a
human arm onto a pig,

379
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,680
I don't think people would like that.

380
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,590
But you acknowledge that the
distinctions you're drawing are emotional

381
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:33,500
distinctions and not rational.
Absolutely. There are emotional,

382
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:37,970
and I'm saying that sometimes
emotional distinctions matter. I mean,

383
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:40,370
I have no solutions. I mean, I
don't know where to draw lines.

384
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:41,750
Society has the draw lines.

385
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,560
[inaudible]

386
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,060
radio, Radiolab. We'll
continue in a moment.

387
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,120
Message one. Hi, this is Lee silver.

388
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,080
Radiolab is funded in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

389
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,040
the corporation for public broadcasting
and the National Science Foundation.

390
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,540
Radiolab is produced by W N Y C York
public radio and distributed by NPR

391
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,390
national public radio.

392
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,170
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert
Krulwich Radiolab. Our topic today is, um,

393
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,261
what is our topic today?

394
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:22,261
Robert today is making life that isn't
there before you arrived in the room.

395
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,040
Okay. Uh, life not as we know it yet,
but as we might invent it or make it.

396
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,230
Well, let's talk about
life. You and I. Okay.

397
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,740
So when you look around in the world
at living things, and I say, Look Dad,

398
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:38,680
there's a cat and next to that
is a dog and that's a tree.

399
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,310
And you noticed that those things
of course are different. Yes.

400
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,690
And later when we go to school,

401
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,700
we learn about phylum's and
categories like kingdoms and stuff.

402
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,330
So we've learned about the
nature of those differences.

403
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,900
And then you're taught about
struggle and competition.

404
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,700
Darwin species,

405
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,690
there is a new theory that's being talked
about that turns all of that on its

406
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:04,150
head. I heard it first from
this guy. I'm Steve Strogatz.

407
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,660
I'm an applied mathematician at
Cornell and the story he told me,

408
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:11,470
which is based on analysis of DNA
and very tiny organisms, microbes,

409
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,250
is that once upon a time he says,
life began with a very primitive,

410
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:17,830
very simple collection
of cells and these cells

411
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,950
[inaudible] like to shoot. It appears
that legend, when you go back far enough,

412
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,890
there's a kind of rampant
sharing of molecules.

413
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,160
It's a kind of orgy in which there are
no well-defined species or organisms and

414
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,060
I can give you my genes and
you can pass. We're a commune.

415
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,560
It was a calm year. What?

416
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,830
What does that mean? He's like, it was
a, what do you mean? What does it mean?

417
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,030
I know what it means in the 60 screen.
Love sets, but what does it really mean?

418
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,760
What are, what cells are
exchanging is chemicals,

419
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,180
chemicals that give them talents and
traits. Genes. Here's what happens.

420
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:55,014
I did this with [inaudible]

421
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,810
that are in our ancient puddle in Darwin
thought the life might've begun in a

422
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:03,560
warm puddle. Let's say that
you and I are both cells. Okay?

423
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,830
So once upon a time there was you and a
puddle and I'm in the same Preble as you

424
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,760
and it gets a little colder in the
puddle. So we should all get sick.

425
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:14,480
But you don't get sick, you don't
have some kind of accidental talent.

426
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:17,210
You can handle cold water. I'm shivering.

427
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,980
Describe again what happens in it at
this point in the glorious old days,

428
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,350
my membrane that is I, I'm a cell, I've
got a membrane, I've got my outer layer,

429
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,420
maybe a little bit porous and maybe
Lipson. I'm on my jeans just leaked out.

430
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,581
Okay.

431
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:39,581
We're not talking sophisticated organisms
and maybe your poorest too and oh wow.

432
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,130
You just absorbed some of those
genes. So now we both have this,

433
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,400
we both got and you both come.

434
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,610
And if I've got this clean
now I can survive cold water.

435
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,850
And because it's part of me and if I
bump into you now it's part of you.

436
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,520
So now the Steve Jean
has become a Robert King,

437
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,270
which has then become Jag gene and we're
doing it over and over and over and

438
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,500
we're getting really um, come here.

439
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,470
[inaudible]

440
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,620
it sounds so friendly. I actually
don't think of sounds like, yeah,

441
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,580
people shout out all these exchanges.
This gene swapping was not intentional.

442
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:18,870
It's not purposeful sharing.
That's Nigel Goldenfeld.

443
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,730
I'm a theoretical physicist at the
University of Illinois and he and his

444
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:25,720
colleague Carl woes did the science
that led to some of these kind of goofy

445
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:27,700
ideas. It's not me sort of saying, hey,

446
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:30,730
I'm going to just help out my buddy
over there. Here's a couple of jeans.

447
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:33,970
I think you'll find handy. It's not
something like that. You can still,

448
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:36,400
if we're swamping jeans
so much and you know,

449
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,000
you're giving me yours
and I'm going to be mine,

450
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,770
what does it actually mean to be me? Yeah.

451
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,280
So much of me is spread around.
Well, would be very weird.

452
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:48,940
Imagine a world in which for a
while I have your nose, God forbid,

453
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,300
and then I get my nose back.
You'd have Steve's hair, then I,

454
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,170
Steve would get my ear. Then he
would get your nose on to stall,

455
00:28:56,171 --> 00:29:00,820
having a lot of exchange. Take Your
Chin. Okay. And you can have my,

456
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,670
um, allergies. And then you start
even asking what does it mean, um,

457
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,580
to be a species. You can have
my love affair with doubt.

458
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,460
You may not even be able to
talk about individuals. Yeah.

459
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,710
If the mixing is good enough, we're
all kind of indistinguishable.

460
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,800
So identity would be very
strange in this ancient world,

461
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,420
but a lot of the concepts
that we take for granted, the

462
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,420
biology become more and more nebulous as
you get further and further back to the

463
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,230
roots of the origin of life.
Take for instance Charles Darwin.

464
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:38,090
What Nigel is really saying is that for
the first billion years of life with the

465
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,340
be good to be everything
that Darwin teaches,

466
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,050
all that stuff happened in no borders,
no individuals has no species.

467
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,130
That is Darwinism evolution as we now
understand it. That's an interlude

468
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,430
[inaudible]

469
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,940
and the real story of life,
it's only what's happening now.

470
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,970
What you got back at the very beginning
was a whole bunch of cells swapping

471
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,170
genes, swapping advantages, swapping
disadvantages, and this kind of goes wild,

472
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,550
Huh? Tremendous explosion.

473
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,220
What diversity in a way that
life has not seen since then.

474
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,040
[inaudible]

475
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,873
until

476
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,390
one dark and terrible
day, 3 billion years ago,

477
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,200
as interpreted by Freeman
Dyson, sweetening famous
physicist and delivered here.

478
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,430
Now our friend, the mathematician,
Steve Strogatz, hears d one evil day,

479
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,080
a bacterium anticipating Bill
Gates by 3 billion years.

480
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
Refuse to share,

481
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,390
refuse to share. Ooh, the first
bad guy is this cellular bill.

482
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,810
K Two who decides that you,

483
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,480
I've got an innovation that I don't feel
like sharing or possibly by found a way

484
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:55,690
to keep my membrane from leaking. That is,

485
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm not going to be a sharing
soul anymore. And why?

486
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,750
I mean what made that one little
cell decide to stop sharing?

487
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,850
That's a good question.
We don't really know,

488
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,410
but what we do know this is was maybe the
most dramatic moment in the history of

489
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:09,244
life on earth.

490
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,580
This transition from the age of,

491
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,480
if you want to call it the age of
sharing to the age of selfishness

492
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,710
and gradually once one
creatures stopped sharing,

493
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,650
pretty soon the others followed and
then more and more did the same thing.

494
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,880
And now for the first time in the
history of life, finally we get Darwin.

495
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:30,580
Now we get species. Now we see

496
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,280
differences. Yes, it's the age
of identity of individualism.

497
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,400
It's also the age of, of
stasis. Things change,

498
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:40,820
but they change much more slowly.
And any great thing, you know,

499
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:44,570
like you are a bat and you've figured
out sonar. I don't have sonar,

500
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,350
I can't get sonar. I mean
I used to have sonar.

501
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,530
Like you're at a little electric fish
that lives in the muddy waters of the

502
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:54,020
Amazon. You don't care. It's
totally dark. You can see,

503
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:57,830
because you can see with electricity,
I can't see with electricity.

504
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,780
If I'm in the dark, I'm bumping my head.

505
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,443
[inaudible]

506
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,300
okay, so here's go.

507
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:10,680
We end up chapter one one a greed
orgy of genes swapping chapter two,

508
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,460
do your g ends. We passed genes. Now,
not two other guys, not randomly,

509
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:18,330
but just to our own children.
And finally here comes

510
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,940
chip proposed by Freeman
Dyson, the physicist in Dyson.

511
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,130
After 3 billion years of life,

512
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:30,330
slowly evolving through random
mutations who bumps in the night?

513
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,520
One species. Jad Human beings, you and me,

514
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,900
we have become so smart,

515
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,170
so well some of us so advanced
that we can swap genes.

516
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:47,261
We now decide who gets what genes and
thanks to us evolution as Darwin described

517
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:53,531
it is beginning to end and now we
welcome evolution as described by Freeman

518
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,410
Dyson to the graduating class at
University of Michigan. I see it.

519
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Bright future for the biotech industry
becoming small and domesticated rather

520
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,920
than big and centralized

521
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,160
Freeman thinks that in the
future everybody means everybody.

522
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,510
They will all be creating new life
forms and why? Because they can. Yeah,

523
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,660
that will be do it yourself kits for
gardeners who will use genetic engineering

524
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:21,370
to breed new varieties of roses and
Dawkins kits for lovers of pigeons and

525
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:26,371
parrots and lizards and snakes
to breed new varieties of pets.

526
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,390
Genetic engineering.

527
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:33,100
Once it gets into the hands of housewives
and children will give us an explosion

528
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:35,170
of diversity of new living creatures.

529
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,710
[inaudible].

530
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,360
The final step in the domestication
of biotechnology will be biotech games

531
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,010
designed like computer games for
children down to kindergarten age,

532
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,490
but played with real eggs and
seeds rather than with images.

533
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:56,550
On the screen playing such games,

534
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,720
kids will acquire an intimate feeling
for the organisms that they're growing.

535
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,630
The winner could be the kid who is seed
grows the picklist cactus or the kid

536
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,060
whose egg hatches the cutest dinosaur

537
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,643
[inaudible].

538
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,380
So there's your future. I'd like to
make it your future for the moment,

539
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,610
but it doesn't sound that bad. I mean,
maybe a little cy fi. Well, actually the,

540
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,520
here's the interesting thing is that
what he's describing has already begun.

541
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,310
There are kids doing this right
now or something very close to it.

542
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,170
How old were you when you did this?
I guess I was 20 and 21 right now.

543
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,150
Okay. Who are you, what's your name and
what do you do? Uh, I'm Steven Payne.

544
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm a senior in biological
engineering at MIT. Oh,

545
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:55,380
here's the thing about Steven.

546
00:34:55,381 --> 00:35:00,270
He like most kids who are in the sciences
in college had to spend hours and

547
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,860
hours and hours in the lab waiting for
eco lie slowly grow in a petri dish.

548
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,750
Eco Lie, like the stuff that gives
you food poisoning, it's the stuff,

549
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,010
it's common bacteria that lives naturally
in your gut. And it's, by the way,

550
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:14,760
a big laboratory favorite.
And the problem is,

551
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,860
has Rashman said he was
a grad student at MIT.

552
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,130
Is He [inaudible] in the Ra
actually smelled really bad.

553
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,490
What does it smell like?
I actually kind of smell,

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,470
I guess maybe like
pool. What do you think?

555
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:30,810
It smells like feces. Anyway,

556
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,860
Steven and his friends got into their
heads that they could make Nike colada

557
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:36,870
smell no nicer, nicer,

558
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,380
like cinnamon or cherry
or I like minty fresh.

559
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,050
We ended up deciding on
Wintergreen, wintergreen. Oh,

560
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:44,970
you've got something against
wintergreen. Let me know.

561
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,140
In the real world who has winter
green? Ah, it's the Petunia plant.

562
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,630
Petunias have wintergreen. I have no idea.

563
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah. A lot of folks study.
Why plants make nice smell.

564
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:57,900
So why do roses smell nice?
Why do Petunia Smell Nice?

565
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,320
So what we did was we were requested
from one of these folks and Italia Dude

566
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,660
River from Purdue university.

567
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,510
We asked her to send us a sample of
one of the genes she had studied that

568
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,050
produces this winter green smell.
Oh, she mailed it through the mail.

569
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,260
We opened it up. They took it.

570
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,590
What were you taking out? A little bit
of gum. It's actually living cells.

571
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,910
Living dried cells. Yeah.

572
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,600
We pulled out the DNA,
put it into a new cell

573
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,890
and once the new DNA had done its thing,
Steven called everybody into the lab

574
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,640
and then we all came over and
were like, Whoa, these, you know,

575
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:29,190
the sea cola culture actually
does smell like mint.

576
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,340
And we were like, Yay, that's crazy.

577
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,390
And so instead of smelling pool all
day, they get to smell a winter green.

578
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,830
Well actually there was more than that
because after their winter green success,

579
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,530
Steven and Rashman decided, you
know, why should we stay in the,

580
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,640
in the lab all day,

581
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:47,330
even though it smells nicer now because
we have to sit there and watch these

582
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,230
ecol I grow and grow and grow until
they are ready to be experimented on.

583
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,890
We could be outside playing Frisbee.

584
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,810
So they decided to put a little
trigger inside the ecollege.

585
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:56,300
So when it's done growing,

586
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,570
it switches from winter
green to banana. Banana,

587
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,620
yeah, the banana show. But yeah, it
smells like a banana milkshake. I mean,

588
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
and it smells more like a
banana than a banana does.

589
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,590
So winter green means it's still growing
and banana means we're done. Yep. Wow.

590
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,890
That's kind of awesome. Awesome
is a word I want to discuss.

591
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:17,750
The awesome question here. Okay.

592
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,400
Were you at all intrigued by the
idea is that, as far as I know,

593
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:23,840
and I'm maybe as far as you know,

594
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,620
maybe as far as anybody know in the
history of the eco-line creature,

595
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,680
there has never been an eco lie
that smelled like winter green.

596
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,770
Yeah. You made it yourself.

597
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,910
Well, with the help of my
team members, yes ma'am.

598
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,110
Did you feel a little spooked by the fact
that you just created a life for them?

599
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,620
New to new to creation? Um,

600
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,330
I mean at least we're doing something
that's, you know, smells pleasant,

601
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:59,290
but you didn't feel like a doctor
Frankenstein or a god or a not at all.

602
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,610
What does it feel like to make
something that's never existed before?

603
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,960
Just feels like basic engineering, right?

604
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,340
Yeah. Or engineers. I would say we're
engineers. We're building stuff,

605
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:14,450
building stuff, building
[inaudible] stuff,

606
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,750
stuff, stuff, living stuff. The Rhoda

607
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,063
Dan

608
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,190
[inaudible] will fix the problems of
today by building stuff with [inaudible].

609
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,430
We're slicing genes,

610
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,240
we're building creatures that being extra
useful features more waiting daughter

611
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,400
when styling and slopping
jeans as long as small

612
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,080
stuff building stuff.

613
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,550
[inaudible] goes whereby

614
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,470
it's mankind's only fighting chance
designer jeans, not Denny bites.

615
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,830
We'll stop disease and greenhouse
gases when seeing nucleic acids.

616
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,430
We've seen the light where the

617
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,150
[inaudible] is fried and clear.

618
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,333
[inaudible]

619
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,360
thanks to Josh curves and Shane Winter
for that music radio lab will continue in

620
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,840
a moment. My name is Alyssa Hargrave
and I'm calling from Shakopee,

621
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:32,140
Minnesota where it is currently
negative 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

626
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,620
hello, I'm Chad and I am Robert.

627
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
This is Radiolab and today
our topic is tinkering,

628
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,220
tinkering with nature or life.
Yes, but don as we know it. No,

629
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,680
because before the break we heard about
some kids doing something that they call

630
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,360
directed evolution.

631
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,600
By sticking wintergreen into a place
where wintergreen has never been before,

632
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,050
which definitely qualifies
as life, not as we know.

633
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,530
Now let's get into the true grit of this
because those kids are looking at life

634
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,040
in a, in a fairly different
way than most of us do. Yes.

635
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,070
It's very interesting that the people
who are creating these living systems are

636
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,260
engineers. This is Lee silver from
Princeton University. I mean, they,

637
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:34,261
they really look at a living system
as no different than a computational,

638
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,320
uh, electronic device. And you, your
hunches there, right? Am I have,

639
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,780
they're wrong. I don't know quite why
by hunches. They're right. But, um,

640
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,150
most of the world doesn't believe that,

641
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,360
which would include me because I just
make it very hard to imagine that I've got

642
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:56,800
a life form talking.

643
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,820
This animal leaves for a span of
years and then dies. You know,

644
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,910
it's like when they die and
the spirit kind of goes on,

645
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,150
it's hard for me to believe that that is
just a chemical machine of several from

646
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:11,320
parts. Really. Yeah. Well, okay. I
mean, I guess I can understand that,

647
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:14,770
but let me introduce you to
a guy now who's whole. Uh,

648
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,300
admittedly young career is based
on the idea that life is a machine,

649
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,380
that it's made of parts, parts that
he can build and sell. Okay. So I'm,

650
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,720
I'm Brian Bains. Brian,

651
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,010
we met actually just down the street
from those MIT kids. He is 31.

652
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,070
That's right, just 31 and he
runs his own biotech company,

653
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,300
one of the founders of
caught on devices here.

654
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,190
We make custom synthetic genes from
scratch and he's doing pretty well.

655
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,070
The industry is gray, sickly doubling
every two years at this point. I mean,

656
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:46,260
just to give you a sense of what
Brian does, you with me? Yep.

657
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,650
Just take your example. Those MIT kids,

658
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:51,700
let's say I'm one of those kids or
someone else who's heard about them and I

659
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,640
want to take my stinky bacteria
and make it smell better.

660
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,190
Or maybe I want to make it glow. All
I have to do is call Brian. Sure.

661
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,960
Cause he'll sell me a simple gene
like that for about 1500 bucks.

662
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:07,160
I just have to go online. Look
up the chemical recipe for

663
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,600
darn yes. Here it is. 1200 letters, t, G,

664
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,440
Z, Cesar, letters of DNA, g,

665
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:22,550
a t and a c of for fundamental
building blocks of DNA. The next step,

666
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,700
just list out those A's, g's and t's
and C's. Just type them into an email.

667
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:28,970
Generally they're not typing at themselves
and imagine trying to type in 2000

668
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,610
letters by hand without making a mistake
and it would take too long. All right.

669
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,580
Just copy and paste them into
an email. Send them to Brian.

670
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,490
When we get that in house, we, um,
we're going to take that into our facts.

671
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,390
Brian then plugs the string
of letters into this machine,

672
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,640
which is about the size
of a desktop computer.

673
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:51,270
We have a census system where it literally
has a bunch of little A's and a jar

674
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:56,190
and a bunch of g's in a jar and t's
and C's. These chemicals are inert.

675
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,340
They are store bought hundred
dollars a bottle. The machine,

676
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:02,460
they're all connected to reads all
the letters that Brian plugs in

677
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,850
and when, if he's in a
machine, squirts out some pay.

678
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,620
Duck is a t

679
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,820
words out some t test,

680
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:19,850
we can add an a or a g or a t or
a c to a growing strand of DNA.

681
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:24,300
And so we literally adding
one base at a time fee fees.

682
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,360
So what starts as one letter pieces
then grows to 50 then grows to maybe 500

683
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,990
then it grows to be 5,000 and at a
certain point all of these inner chemicals

684
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,500
hold hands.

685
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,030
And that's literally how
you make DNA chemically.

686
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,620
That is how you go from dust to
something that is not exactly alive.

687
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,360
But if I take this little speck of DNA
and stick it into my cell, amazingly,

688
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,770
it will start to glow or smell better
or whatever it is that I want it to do,

689
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,640
it will do it.

690
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,990
It's almost as if the cell is a
computer and this little bit of DNA is a

691
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:06,540
software program. That's the way
synthetic biologists think about hm.

692
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,650
And what synthetic biologists are hoping
for us as leads that the software,

693
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:15,140
quote unquote will get standardized.
It will come down in price.

694
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,710
So that one day installing
new features into organisms.

695
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,030
We just as easy as when you install
new software on your home PC,

696
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:26,450
but a word processor, you put a
spreadsheet program user friendly.

697
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,240
That's kind of the logic. Yeah,
but that's not that. That's that.

698
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:32,820
We're talking about life here. Life
like you know, a game of Lego's.

699
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,893
What if it is,

700
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,030
I mean I know it's weird to think it's
wrong in other words to describe it,

701
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,330
but what if it's not wrong?

702
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,300
Just imagine you can start to look
at things in a completely new way.

703
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:43,740
You can look at that
creature over there and say,

704
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:48,460
that creature right there has a talent
that I really like and that one over

705
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:50,650
there. The second one, it
also does something cool.

706
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:53,350
Maybe if I take talent one and
talent to stick them together,

707
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,580
put 'em into a third creature.

708
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,350
Then I've got a little factory that can
do really cool stuff for gait living,

709
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:03,430
things that have very important
functional values. As an example,

710
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:05,080
in our earlier conversation
with Lee silver,

711
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:07,720
he brought up a guy named George Church,

712
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:10,390
George Church as a scientist
at Harvard medical school.

713
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,530
He's thought to be absolutely brilliant
by everybody that knows him. Well.

714
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,170
He actually happened to have a picture
of Georgia on him and he and he showed

715
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:20,200
us. Oh, is that he does. He
does look like a radical.

716
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,760
Describe him. He's wearing
an army shirt of some kind.

717
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:28,880
He's got a nice bushy
beard and a spit curl. Oh,

718
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,580
was Santa Claus played
by Clark Gable? Well,

719
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,580
we had to visit him

720
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,730
and George is unusual as scientists go.

721
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:43,930
I'm George Church professors genetics
at Harvard Medical School in the last 20

722
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:44,261
years.

723
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:48,920
He's been going further and further and
further in terms of synthesizing life.

724
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,090
Okay, I'll slide. You know what
I'll do? I'll slide. He he's,

725
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,680
he's stuffing some kind of big black
rod up my nose. That would be the Mike.

726
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,940
Now the kind of creatures,

727
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,920
the George Church engineers are the
same kind of those MIT kids use eco lie.

728
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:08,010
By taking these little tiny Nikolai and
adding a few genes from other organisms

729
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,750
and and tweaking the internal chemistry.

730
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:13,300
He has gotten the
Nikolai to suck in sugar,

731
00:46:13,301 --> 00:46:17,440
which is what they normally like to
eat, poop out all kinds of things.

732
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:21,490
Most notably drum roll please. Diesel

733
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,320
for real. Oh yeah.

734
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,930
And the company I co founded
has produced hydrocarbon status.

735
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:32,770
Just a fancy way of saying
among other things, diesel,

736
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,120
three different kinds to run in
three types of engines, cars,

737
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,620
trucks and planes. I was
curious to see how it all works.

738
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:45,700
So he took me to a room at the back of
his lab where he's perfecting the process

739
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:47,590
and he pointed to a small container.

740
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,620
So here's an example where we might
grow up a large batch of of cells in a,

741
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:57,480
in a fermenter. So this big Vat right
here, which is, I don't know how,

742
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,300
what's the size of a couple
of leaders? Pretty small.

743
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:02,590
It's about the size of a coke bottle.

744
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:04,540
And right now he can
only make a few drops.

745
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:07,000
So there are some scale issues to solve.

746
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:09,790
But I asked him you to close
your eyes and you know,

747
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,090
where does he imagine this stuff going
and project forward into the future?

748
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,730
And he painted. Describe it for
me. What would it look like?

749
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,910
An amazing picture of
huge bodies of water.

750
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,470
Giant pawns or lakes of gas. I mean,

751
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:24,700
just imagine we could take a boat,

752
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,930
paddle around and be beautiful birds
chirping except under the surface.

753
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,220
Trillions of bacteria, gloomy,
busily eating plant life,

754
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,110
burping out diesel fuel,

755
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,670
which they float to the surface
as this kind of gassy foam.

756
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,890
And you can skim it off, skim it off,
throw into a pipe. There you have it.

757
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,790
I mean, this could be the
oil refinery of the future.

758
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:53,140
No more pumping out of the ground and
fighting wars. Forget that. That's old.

759
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,180
Now we're talking to
Mike Robes and Mike Rose.

760
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,700
And this could be just the beginning.
I mean, according to Lee silver,

761
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:03,050
people are hoping that this kind of
bioengineering can produce all kinds of

762
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:07,490
stuff. You know, a drug that cures
malaria. Something that makes plastic,

763
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,360
I mean, anything. Well I,
they would be good. Yeah.

764
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,070
But there is part of it that makes me a
little uneasy. Why? And, and then, well,

765
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,170
I wanna introduce you
to another bioengineer.

766
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:21,170
He's often called the leader
of the pack, like the rat pack.

767
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,120
Sort of like the rat pack. His name is
Craig Venter and like the Red Peg folks,

768
00:48:26,121 --> 00:48:28,970
he's very talented. He very
ambitious. He's very driven.

769
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,160
He's also working on a bug for fuel.

770
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,000
He also thinks that the earth is in
trouble. We're messing our nests,

771
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,050
something terrible. And when we were
at the 92nd street y in New York,

772
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:42,000
he said to just right
out loud bio engineering,

773
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,440
creating new life is our last hope.

774
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,480
It's probably our one major chance of
having our species survive on this planet.

775
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,250
I mean this is the engineering of the
rest of this century and that's a little,

776
00:48:55,251 --> 00:48:57,110
I mean, stand beside young lamb.

777
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,520
I'll rescue now with my magical scientific
ability and my natural engineering

778
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,930
skills. Kids saved the world that stand
aside and throw them a parade. Well,

779
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,270
except that you don't realize just
how ambitious these these guys are.

780
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,090
What's wrong with
ambition? Nothing really.

781
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:13,850
But what you don't know is
just how bold this guy is.

782
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:18,260
He not only wants to mix and match
traits that already exist in, in,

783
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:23,000
in life to make new funds or life,
he wants to do original design.

784
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,640
He wants to think of things
that life is never done before.

785
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,640
Things that are in his
head that are entirely new.

786
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,140
He even dreams of life life
form from scratch, from scratch,

787
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,730
completely, like 4.1 billion years
ago. Kind of like in Genesis.

788
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,390
It'd probably take a little longer, but

789
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,100
I think there will be new life forms.

790
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,670
You think it will be possible in your
lifetime that someone will go into a

791
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:50,780
store, buy dust,

792
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,080
figure out what it is that they have to
do with that desk so that what they make

793
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,370
will be unmistakably alive,
not alive than alive.

794
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,170
Yes. Yes,

795
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,200
but using the knowledge that we have
from studying this 4 billion years of

796
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:07,500
evolution. What?

797
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,110
What if I told you that I thought no,

798
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,880
I don't know why. Just know.
I think you reviewed my grant.

799
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,280
Nobody. There's a, there's a
candidness to scientists that I,

800
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,820
that puzzles me a little bit. Isn't
there something that you think,

801
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:26,960
and this would be really close,

802
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,820
it creating life that just
might be out of our grasp.

803
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:35,500
It might be forever and
mysterious and yet you guys like,

804
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,770
is there anything in the
way of engineering life?

805
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,710
Is there anything that
you think is not doable?

806
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,920
Do you think it's never going
to happen, that you'll meet,

807
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,930
create a conscious life form from scratch
or it will never happen that you will

808
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,890
create a morally, you know,

809
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,400
a sense of a creature with moral sense
of right and wrong, but I don't know.

810
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,270
I think you think that everything
is possible. Everything.

811
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,273
I think you're right.

812
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,830
[inaudible]

813
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,580
okay. I get that Craig and people
like him might have a little bit of a,

814
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,130
of an attitude about
what they can accomplish,

815
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:20,640
but is that your problem that hit that
he, it's his attitude? No, no, no, no.

816
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:23,100
It's a sense of life,
I think is wrong here.

817
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,340
I really appreciate because of
Darwin and Darwinian evolution,

818
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,230
that it takes 100 million,

819
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:31,980
200 million a billion years for creatures
to figure out how to live in the

820
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:35,970
neighborhood of life, how to know what
to eat, what to avoid, how to fit in,

821
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,890
how you, you know, if
you're going to sustain,

822
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,400
you've got to learn how to live
harmoniously with the rest of nature.

823
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,743
It takes awhile,

824
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,250
but here come these engineers over
some weekend think I have a new ideal,

825
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,000
maybe the lead oil or audible and then
you stick it into the world and you've

826
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:56,001
just stuck something into a rich fabric
of life and you have no idea of all the

827
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,750
different consequences that could
follow from that decision. I look at,

828
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,700
look at what happens right
now with antibiotics.

829
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,460
That scientist Nigel Goldenfeld,
who we heard from, you know before,

830
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,220
50 years ago we declared war on microbes.

831
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:13,080
We fed antibiotics to cattle, to
kids when they had virus infections.

832
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,350
We put so much antibiotics into
our bodies and into our food,

833
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:21,351
but the bacteria we were trying to kill
figured out a way to avoid our medicines

834
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:24,510
and now they're stronger
than ever. Melt smart.

835
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,110
We didn't know there were things that we
didn't really understand that we didn't

836
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,260
know that we didn't understand and
we're paying the place for that now.

837
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:36,240
I am frightened that these people have
so much ambition and so much certainty in

838
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:37,360
them that frankly they

839
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,890
don't fear what biologists
don't know about life.

840
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,420
It's a really a Frankenstein
story that is there.

841
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:46,620
So much hubris in this and as
Steve Strogatz will tell you,

842
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,100
biologists and pic scientists
in general, no veer.

843
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,140
We now know how much we
don't know about life.

844
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,930
If biology really is
about collective behavior,

845
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,440
the interaction of billions of
molecules, billions of species,

846
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,180
and this network of of life we
barely understand. You know,

847
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,040
we keep being surprised about life.

848
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:08,640
On the one hand we can tinker in this
engineering way like the MIT students do

849
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,130
or like venter is doing.
But on the other hand,

850
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,140
the best biologists are still mystified
that we only have that about the same

851
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:17,790
number of genes as a worm.

852
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:22,320
We're really still missing
99% of the picture, literally.

853
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,340
So it's a scary time today to start
playing doctor given how ignorant

854
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,870
do you know that it
Stony Brook University,

855
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:32,230
where your mom worked for all
those years, there was a scientist,

856
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:35,640
maybe a few doors down from your mom who,

857
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,950
who made from scratch
using the dust particles.

858
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:41,260
We've talked about the polio virus,

859
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,240
which the whole world has
been working to eliminate.

860
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,590
Polian made a new polio
virus. Why? I don't know. I,

861
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,170
there was a lot of controversy about it,

862
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,760
but there is a guy could perhaps in a
cave somewhere in Afghanistan who wants to

863
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:59,200
make a polio virus and who will use it
against this technology. You're right,

864
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,700
you are right that there is, there
are some bad things that can happen.

865
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:06,370
Very bad. So the question is then what?

866
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,610
Like what do you do in the face
of that risk? How do you proceed?

867
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:11,260
Do you say to these guys, stop.

868
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,530
Would you have these guys
stop doing what they're doing?

869
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:17,740
Stop doing their experiments.
Asking questions, being curious. Oh,

870
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:21,490
that'd be ridiculous to tell a science
not to do science. So what then

871
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,610
I, I don't know. I have to, I
don't, I don't know exactly,

872
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,690
but do I want them to,
to not do experiments?

873
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,330
No, I'm not saying don't know.

874
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,240
So I'm not going to be a troglodyte
and say we shouldn't play with these.

875
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,390
And Steve Strogatz agrees. I think
it's great to play with them.

876
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,100
But I'm scared too. I Dunno. I'm confused
about it because we have to play.

877
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,060
That's how we make all science, you know,

878
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,420
they speak of Homo Lutens human
beings as the player that we,

879
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:53,460
we are what we are because we like
to play with nature, with ideas,

880
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:56,580
with language. This is how we
learn things. So we're gonna play,

881
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,940
but we have to be very
careful about how we play.

882
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:04,440
And we don't want to fall into the
idea that we know more than we, we do.

883
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,180
[inaudible]

884
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,610
we have a vast ocean to
discover it before us.

885
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,063
[inaudible] [inaudible]

886
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,070
[inaudible]

887
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,780
okay, well, I guess that's
all the time we have. Um,

888
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:42,280

you want to hear again, more information.

889
00:55:42,281 --> 00:55:44,710
It's all on our website, radio lab.org.

890
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,980
Any creature you'd like to build already
designed for creature that you'd like

891
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,660
to build or any monster that you have
in your head that you'd like to make a

892
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:55,210
real living flesh, send that to us
too. Yes. While you're on our site,
