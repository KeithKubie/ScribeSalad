they're building up this one thing and
 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.999 align:start position:0%
they're building up this one thing and

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
how much they really sort of like these
 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.129 align:start position:0%
how much they really sort of like these

00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:55.789 align:start position:0%
stuff like that that's the guess I'm
 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:01.209 align:start position:0%
stuff like that that's the guess I'm
going<00:07:56.030><c> with</c><00:07:56.330><c> um</c><00:07:56.800><c> so</c><00:07:57.800><c> again</c><00:07:58.789><c> I</c><00:07:58.820><c> sort</c><00:07:59.270><c> of</c><00:07:59.740><c> the</c><00:08:00.740><c> few</c>

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:01.219 align:start position:0%
going with um so again I sort of the few
 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:02.980 align:start position:0%
going with um so again I sort of the few
episodes<00:08:01.400><c> I've</c><00:08:02.000><c> seen</c><00:08:02.240><c> again</c><00:08:02.630><c> I'll</c><00:08:02.719><c> point</c><00:08:02.870><c> them</c>

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:02.990 align:start position:0%
episodes I've seen again I'll point them
 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
episodes I've seen again I'll point them
out<00:08:03.139><c> when</c><00:08:03.289><c> I</c><00:08:03.320><c> see</c><00:08:03.590><c> them</c><00:08:03.740><c> uh</c><00:08:04.150><c> the</c><00:08:05.150><c> show</c><00:08:05.360><c> does</c><00:08:05.599><c> I</c>

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:05.930 align:start position:0%
out when I see them uh the show does I
 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
out when I see them uh the show does I
say<00:08:06.500><c> two</c><00:08:06.560><c> million</c><00:08:06.770><c> times</c><00:08:06.919><c> but</c><00:08:07.130><c> it</c><00:08:07.250><c> really</c><00:08:07.490><c> does</c>

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:07.729 align:start position:0%
say two million times but it really does
 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:09.909 align:start position:0%
say two million times but it really does
interesting<00:08:08.210><c> things</c><00:08:08.389><c> with</c><00:08:08.539><c> identity</c><00:08:09.020><c> and</c><00:08:09.349><c> if</c>

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
interesting things with identity and if
 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.709 align:start position:0%
interesting things with identity and if
that<00:08:10.099><c> is</c><00:08:10.340><c> the</c><00:08:10.610><c> route</c><00:08:10.789><c> they're</c><00:08:11.060><c> going</c><00:08:11.419><c> I</c><00:08:11.539><c> think</c>

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
that is the route they're going I think
 

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
that is the route they're going I think
that'd<00:08:11.810><c> be</c><00:08:11.840><c> like</c><00:08:12.020><c> a</c><00:08:12.080><c> fascinating</c><00:08:12.440><c> route</c>

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
that'd be like a fascinating route
 

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.890 align:start position:0%

that'd be a really interesting route um
 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.529 align:start position:0%
that'd be a really interesting route um

out just how much of a person is passed
 

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
out just how much of a person is passed
on<00:08:21.650><c> to</c><00:08:21.830><c> the</c><00:08:21.919><c> child</c>

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.490 align:start position:0%
on to the child
 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.180 align:start position:0%
on to the child
how<00:08:23.240><c> much</c><00:08:23.419><c> is</c><00:08:23.539><c> nature</c><00:08:23.960><c> and</c><00:08:24.259><c> nurture</c><00:08:24.409><c> and</c><00:08:24.949><c> stuff</c>
