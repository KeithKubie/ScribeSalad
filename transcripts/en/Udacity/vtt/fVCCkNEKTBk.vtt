00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.771
Sometimes, though, the equation of a circle won't appear in this form. It could

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.997
appear like this. When we see an equation with an x squared term, a y squared

00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:13.657
term, and other terms that have x and y at a constant, we want to re-arrange

00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:20.140
this so we can put it in this form. Notice that we have a perfect square of an

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.531
x term, and a perfect square of a y term. If this is the case, we want to

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:29.627
re-arrange this equation so we can group the x terms together and we can group

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:35.828
the y terms together. We'll also want to move this constant to the right hand

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:40.125
side of our equation. We do this so that we can complete the square for the x

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:45.202
terms and for the Y terms. So what do we need to add to the left hand side of

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:50.686
our equation to complete the square for these X terms. Keep in mind if we add

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:54.468
an amount to this side we need to add the same amount to the right hand side of

00:00:54.468 --> 00:01:00.392
our equation so we keep the equation balanced. And, what do you think we would

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:05.407
need to the y terms in order for this to become a perfect square. Again,

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:09.640
whatever we add to the left, we need to add to the right.
