[Music]

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.420
The year was 1997.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.600
Bill Clinton was sworn in for
the second time as U.S. president.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.740
The United Kingdom transferred
the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China -

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.920
effectively ending the British Empire.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.260
Scientists cloned a sheep
at the Roslin Institute in Scotland,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.080
and Catherine Hettinger,
an inventor from Tulsa, Oklahoma,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.460
filed a patent in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.160
for what was then called the "Spinning Toy".

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460
- It defined us, and it opened us
to being what we became:

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.160
good and bad things.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.080
What the world knows now
as the Fidget Spinner

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.580
was an invention born out of pain.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.560
In the early '90's, living in Florida,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.020
Hettinger was suffering
from Myasthenia Gravis;

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.340
a neuro-muscular disease that
causes weakness in the skeletal muscles.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.320
"I couldn't pick up her toys or
play with them at all,"

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.440
Hettinger says of her then young daughter.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.280
"so I started throwing things together
with newspaper and tape, then other stuff.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.320
It wasn't really even prototyping,
it was some semblance of something..."

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.120
It wasn't long until that semblance
began to take shape.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.440
Hettinger flew with her daughter to our
nation's capital to patent her new invention

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.040
with the anticipation, perhaps, of a gold rush.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.700
- Shopping for the next Furby;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.220
that was the goal of the sixth annual
toy and decoration fair

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.380
at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.720
Our own young at heart reporter,
Brian Hatchel, stopped by.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.880
[Newscaster] Say hello to Crazy Bones.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.640
These small plastic figurines
come in dozens of shapes and sizes

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.540
and cost about a buck each.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.260
[Nerdwriter1] The 1990's were, of course,
no stranger to toy crazes

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.120
whether it was Crazy Bones, or Pogs,
Furbies or Tamagotchi.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.260
Every year, the world was once again possessed

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.740
with a new favourite toy.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.720
No one could guess
what was going to be next;

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.400
toy-makers would have payed handsomely
to anybody who could,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.060
but each time the new craze seemed to sync
poignantly with the national character.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.760
- GAK is great stuff!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.040
- Oozy!

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.260
- Eugh!

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.680
[chuckle]

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.660
- I don't think there is anything
tremendously philosophical about it.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.960
I don't think there is
anything meta-physical.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.920
I think it's so much fun to watch.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.700
Suck it up and squirt it out
with the GAK Vac.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380
Pump it up and blow it up
with the GAK inflator.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.460
- Disgusting!

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.460
[Aeroplane engines]

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.100
If Catherine Hettinger returned from Washington, D.C.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.260
with magnificent images of GAK
swirling around in her head...

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.920
who could blame her?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.520
And for a while,
it looked like those GAK-soaked dreams

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.940
would become a reality.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.080
The mammoth toy company Hasbro

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360
agreed to test Hettinger's finger spinners.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.400
Unfortunately, in the end, they decided
not to move forward with the production.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.360
And somethings that should not
have been forgotten, were lost.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.480
History became legend.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.020
Legend became myth.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.840
And for two decades,
the spinning toy passed out of all knowledge.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.740
Until...
when chance came...

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.280
it ensnared a new generation.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.120
- They are popping up
more and more in schools

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.420
and stores are really having a hard time
keeping them on the shelves.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.520
I'm talking about fidget spinners.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.360
- They're called fidget spinners.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.500
- Well call them fidget spinners,
fidget widgets or whatever you'd like...

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.780
- Fidget spinners

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.180
- The fidget spinner

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.940
- It's called a fidget spinner,
my daughter has one.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.120
You just kinda put on your finger
and spin it around like this.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.720
Though no one can say when, exactly,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.680
the fidget spinner came to America
in late 2016.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.460
Reality TV star Donald Trump
had been elected

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.480
the 45th president of the United States.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.420
All cell phones had lost physical buttons
in favour of touchscreens.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.320
And two brothers, Mark and Matthew McLaughlin,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.820
had just unexpectedly raised $6 million

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.600
for a trinket called the fidget cube.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.540
- It's a great story.
It's a human story.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.480
It's a story of those who went first.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.140
They were first.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.440
They led the way.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.920
They opened the trail.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.100
It's obvious to everyone that
the fidget cube is fun.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.060
I mean, just look at it.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.760
But it was much more than that.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.300
Citing a study from the Australian Journal
of Learning Difficulties,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.180
a claim was made that these game-changing toys

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.640
could actually help those afflicted with ADHD
to focus better.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.620
And then, two days before Christmas,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.760
fidget spinners, dormant for almost two decades

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.520
except in certain underground fidget circles,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.260
exploded, like lighting, onto the scene.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.980
It's more exciting than this makes it seem.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.580
These days fidget spinners are everywhere.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.080
They're in office cubicles and playgrounds,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.040
in hospitals and locker rooms...

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.260
even in the White House.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.920
- Everything must be perfectly done.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.100
And they weren't working on a production line.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.540
And you didn't have to get
so many pieces done per hour,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.900
but it all had to be perfectly done.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.400
And it does extend to you, as you look at it,
the sense of serenity.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.000
For months, the spinners medical benefits
were hotly contested by news websites

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.740
with nothing better to do apparently.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.180
They were banned from classrooms
across the globe.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.080
You could find them everywhere...

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.540
and nowhere.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.700
And what about Catherine Hettinger?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.960
That, of course, is the great tragedy
of this story.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.140
In 2005 in the long, dark calm
before the fidget storm

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.380
Hettinger was forced to let her patent expire

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.960
because she couldn't afford the $400 renewal fee.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.180
Since then, the inventor of the fidget spinner

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.740
hasn't seen a dime of the profits...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.480
of the most successful product of all time.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.580
- Anything really new
in thought and in material life

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.160
has to have its source in something

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.140
that you have to call spiritual.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.880
Nobody can be really creative

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.720
unless there's something spiritual behind it.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.560
Whether it goes by that name or not.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.480
I mean who invented the house?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.440
Or who invented any of the things we have?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.880
Probably someone engaged in some kind of search.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.060
