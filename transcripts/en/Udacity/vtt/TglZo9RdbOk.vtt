00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The mean is still at 0,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but for the variance we now need to add up 10 individual variances.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There is one each time.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Since all of these are equal to 1, adding them is the same as saying 10  1,

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which just equals 10.
