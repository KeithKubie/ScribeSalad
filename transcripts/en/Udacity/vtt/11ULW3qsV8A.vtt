00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.300
Based on this data, they make
a preliminary diagnosis if possible, and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.840
order laboratory imaging and

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.590
other tests to obtain as much
objective data as possible.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.740
&gt;From this aggregated database of
subjective information from the patient

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.640
and objective data from their own
observations and their tests and images,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.240
they assign the patient with one or
more diagnoses, and develop a plan for

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.160
managing them that usually
involves prescribing medications.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.110
In subsequent visits,
they follow up and make adjustments.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.490
The treatment plan may involve
referral to specialists,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.830
requiring coordination with providers
working at different care venues, and

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.690
possibly in different communities and
health systems.
