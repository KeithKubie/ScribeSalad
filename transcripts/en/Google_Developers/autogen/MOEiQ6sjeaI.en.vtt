right so we're going to talk about a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
right so we're going to talk about a
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.349
right so we're going to talk about a
little bit about optimizing network

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359
little bit about optimizing network
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.420
little bit about optimizing network
performance and specifically some of the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
performance and specifically some of the
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.980
performance and specifically some of the
things that we've been doing on the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
things that we've been doing on the
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.470
things that we've been doing on the

apps and I guess the first thing that we

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
apps and I guess the first thing that we
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830
apps and I guess the first thing that we
should ask is doesn't matter all right

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
should ask is doesn't matter all right
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.030
should ask is doesn't matter all right

just random to chrome and looked at

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
just random to chrome and looked at
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.920
just random to chrome and looked at
where do we spend our time like

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
where do we spend our time like
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620

internally the actual main blink red

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
internally the actual main blink red
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080

where is the time going and the big

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
where is the time going and the big
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789
where is the time going and the big
takeaway here is that said approximately

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
takeaway here is that said approximately
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.039
takeaway here is that said approximately
seventy percent of the time we're just

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
seventy percent of the time we're just
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.020
seventy percent of the time we're just
basically idling on the network right

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
basically idling on the network right
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670
basically idling on the network right
that's that big chunk right here in the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
that's that big chunk right here in the
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.830
that's that big chunk right here in the
blue and then after that you you have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
blue and then after that you you have
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.690
blue and then after that you you have
all of your usual offenders things like

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
all of your usual offenders things like
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399
all of your usual offenders things like
well we gotta execute a JavaScript we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
well we gotta execute a JavaScript we
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.219
well we gotta execute a JavaScript we
gotta paint pixels in all the rest to do

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
gotta paint pixels in all the rest to do
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230
gotta paint pixels in all the rest to do
layouts so this should not be surprising

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
layouts so this should not be surprising
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789
layouts so this should not be surprising
right this is specifically for the first

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
right this is specifically for the first
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679
right this is specifically for the first
page load there's a very different

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
page load there's a very different
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.969
page load there's a very different
profile of course once the page is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
profile of course once the page is
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410
profile of course once the page is
loaded and you're interacting with the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
loaded and you're interacting with the
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630
loaded and you're interacting with the
page that's a different problem but this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
page that's a different problem but this
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.929
page that's a different problem but this
in part is one big problem that we're

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
in part is one big problem that we're
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.160
in part is one big problem that we're
trying to solve right like how do we

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
trying to solve right like how do we
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.219
trying to solve right like how do we
make this blue part smaller or just go

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
make this blue part smaller or just go
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499
make this blue part smaller or just go
faster so there's two takeaways that you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
faster so there's two takeaways that you
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840
faster so there's two takeaways that you
can take from this one is page loads and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
can take from this one is page loads and
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.539
can take from this one is page loads and
network are a problem right that's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
network are a problem right that's
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010
network are a problem right that's
seventy percent of loading the page

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
seventy percent of loading the page
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.639
seventy percent of loading the page
today but the good news is that if we

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
today but the good news is that if we
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889
today but the good news is that if we
can do anything to the network stack in

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
can do anything to the network stack in
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.300
can do anything to the network stack in
terms of improving that latency

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
terms of improving that latency
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.069
terms of improving that latency
improving performance it's going to have

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
improving performance it's going to have
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.600
improving performance it's going to have
a significant impact on how we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
a significant impact on how we
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.969
a significant impact on how we
experience the web so even small

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
experience the web so even small
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.339
experience the web so even small
fractional wins in the space will in

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
fractional wins in the space will in
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.309
fractional wins in the space will in
fact have a huge performance impact

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
fact have a huge performance impact
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.349
fact have a huge performance impact
so kind of with that in mind what I

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359
so kind of with that in mind what I
 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.800
so kind of with that in mind what I
wanted to do is actually take a look at

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
wanted to do is actually take a look at
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.550
wanted to do is actually take a look at
some of the things that we've been

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
some of the things that we've been
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500
some of the things that we've been
working on internally in Chrome's is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
working on internally in Chrome's is
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.059
working on internally in Chrome's is
kind of looking under the hood this is

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069
kind of looking under the hood this is
 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.770
kind of looking under the hood this is
not perhaps something that you would be

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
not perhaps something that you would be
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.229
not perhaps something that you would be
as a developer looking at api's or

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
as a developer looking at api's or
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.670
as a developer looking at api's or
trying to figure out how to optimize

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
trying to figure out how to optimize
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.899
trying to figure out how to optimize
this is the kind of stuff that chrome

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909
this is the kind of stuff that chrome
 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.940
this is the kind of stuff that chrome
does internally but we have a very

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
does internally but we have a very
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.220
does internally but we have a very
dedicated and awesome performance team

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
dedicated and awesome performance team
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.929
dedicated and awesome performance team
working on the stuff and I wanted to

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939
working on the stuff and I wanted to
 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.699
working on the stuff and I wanted to
highlight some of the winds that we had

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
highlight some of the winds that we had
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.449
highlight some of the winds that we had
over the last year and also kind of such

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
over the last year and also kind of such
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.860
over the last year and also kind of such
that you know what we're working on and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
that you know what we're working on and
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.830
that you know what we're working on and
also highlight the potential areas for

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
also highlight the potential areas for
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.379
also highlight the potential areas for
improvement in the future and after that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389
improvement in the future and after that
 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.610
improvement in the future and after that
we're going to look at some of the new

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
we're going to look at some of the new
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.770
we're going to look at some of the new
additions specifically kind of low-level

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
additions specifically kind of low-level
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.869
additions specifically kind of low-level
Network plumbing stuff that we support

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879
Network plumbing stuff that we support
 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.550
Network plumbing stuff that we support
in chrome so things like speedy some

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
in chrome so things like speedy some
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.129
in chrome so things like speedy some
knows about quick and other things and

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139
knows about quick and other things and
 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.689
knows about quick and other things and
then finally we talked about measurement

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699
then finally we talked about measurement
 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.789
then finally we talked about measurement
right of course performance is a big

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799
right of course performance is a big
 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.890
right of course performance is a big

we want to make sure that we give you
the tools to measure performance in the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400
the tools to measure performance in the
 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.770
the tools to measure performance in the
best way possible right you should be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780
best way possible right you should be
 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.879
best way possible right you should be
much you should be able to measure

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889
much you should be able to measure
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.659
much you should be able to measure
anything you need in the stack so first

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669
anything you need in the stack so first
 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.360
anything you need in the stack so first
let's actually do a quick survey this is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
let's actually do a quick survey this is
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.219
let's actually do a quick survey this is
going to be kind of all over the map but

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229
going to be kind of all over the map but
 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.409
going to be kind of all over the map but
I want to highlight a few things first

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419
I want to highlight a few things first
 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.129
I want to highlight a few things first
and chrome 26 we lon we landed the new

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139
and chrome 26 we lon we landed the new
 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.069
and chrome 26 we lon we landed the new
asynchronous DNS resolver which is kind

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079
asynchronous DNS resolver which is kind
 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.990
asynchronous DNS resolver which is kind
of low level plumbing stuff so we're not

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
of low level plumbing stuff so we're not
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.819
of low level plumbing stuff so we're not
no longer relying on the operating

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829
no longer relying on the operating
 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.439
no longer relying on the operating
system dns resolver we actually have our

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449
system dns resolver we actually have our
 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.469
system dns resolver we actually have our
own this is available on today it's

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479
own this is available on today it's
 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.219
own this is available on today it's
available on windows mac and chrome OS

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229

so this is not yet on mobile hopefully

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259
so this is not yet on mobile hopefully
 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.429
so this is not yet on mobile hopefully
it will be so why do we why don't we

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439
it will be so why do we why don't we
 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.659
it will be so why do we why don't we
want to do this well first of all it

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669
want to do this well first of all it
 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.909
want to do this well first of all it
gives us a lot more control we can do a

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919
gives us a lot more control we can do a
 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.129
gives us a lot more control we can do a
lot smarter strategies for how we

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139
lot smarter strategies for how we
 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.559
lot smarter strategies for how we
resolve names and other things and here

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569
resolve names and other things and here
 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.780
resolve names and other things and here
are some numbers performance numbers in

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
are some numbers performance numbers in
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.449
are some numbers performance numbers in
terms of what we've seen based on the

terms of what we've seen based on the
 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.490
terms of what we've seen based on the
since we've landed m26 it took us a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
since we've landed m26 it took us a
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.319
since we've landed m26 it took us a
couple of tries to actually kind of get

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329
couple of tries to actually kind of get
 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.119
couple of tries to actually kind of get
the performance numbers as good as they

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129
the performance numbers as good as they
 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.140
the performance numbers as good as they
are but you can see that there's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
are but you can see that there's
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.209
are but you can see that there's
significant winds across the board and

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:08.219
significant winds across the board and
 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.029
significant winds across the board and
for things like Chrome OS we've reduced

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:11.039
for things like Chrome OS we've reduced
 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.089
for things like Chrome OS we've reduced
the dns resolution time significantly

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
the dns resolution time significantly
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.559
the dns resolution time significantly
thirty-six percent and not only that but

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569
thirty-six percent and not only that but
 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.300
thirty-six percent and not only that but
we're also measuring the resolve plus

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
we're also measuring the resolve plus
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.860
we're also measuring the resolve plus
CCP connect and you can see that it's

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
CCP connect and you can see that it's
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.539
CCP connect and you can see that it's
you know their winds across the board

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
you know their winds across the board
 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.319
you know their winds across the board
and of course some of these are

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329
and of course some of these are
 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.600
and of course some of these are
platform-specific some platforms just do

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
platform-specific some platforms just do
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.399
platform-specific some platforms just do
a better job of implementing their dns

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409
a better job of implementing their dns
 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.570
a better job of implementing their dns
resolvers in a first

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
resolvers in a first
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.999
resolvers in a first
but the cool thing is that we can

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009
but the cool thing is that we can
 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.619
but the cool thing is that we can
actually now kind of take control now

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629
actually now kind of take control now
 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:31.820
actually now kind of take control now
that we've got the basic plumbing

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
that we've got the basic plumbing
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.129
that we've got the basic plumbing
working we can take control and do

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139
working we can take control and do
 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.469
working we can take control and do
smarter things so for example we can

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479
smarter things so for example we can
 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.469
smarter things so for example we can
race different resolutions for ipv6 and

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479
race different resolutions for ipv6 and
 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.899
race different resolutions for ipv6 and
ipv4 we are now actually doing adapt

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909
ipv4 we are now actually doing adapt
 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.670
ipv4 we are now actually doing adapt
retries so we actually remember which

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
retries so we actually remember which
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.700
retries so we actually remember which
the NS servers we've used so we can do a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710
the NS servers we've used so we can do a
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.300
the NS servers we've used so we can do a
better job of making these resolutions

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310
better job of making these resolutions
 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.749
better job of making these resolutions
faster in the future and this is

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759
faster in the future and this is
 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.730
faster in the future and this is
definitely a space for a lot of

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740
definitely a space for a lot of
 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.649
definitely a space for a lot of
improvement and also kind of you know

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659
improvement and also kind of you know
 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.320
improvement and also kind of you know
subtle things like providing better use

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330
subtle things like providing better use
 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.469
subtle things like providing better use
user error pages right before we would

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479
user error pages right before we would
 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.110
user error pages right before we would
just get a failed timeout from the dns

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120
just get a failed timeout from the dns
 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.760
just get a failed timeout from the dns
resolution and we just kind of like we

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
resolution and we just kind of like we
 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.499
resolution and we just kind of like we
give up we have no idea we can give any

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509
give up we have no idea we can give any
 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.570
give up we have no idea we can give any
useful feedback to the user now we can

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580
useful feedback to the user now we can
 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.100
useful feedback to the user now we can
go much much further so that's pretty

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
go much much further so that's pretty
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.089
go much much further so that's pretty
cool moving on in m27 we landed this big

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099
cool moving on in m27 we landed this big
 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.950
cool moving on in m27 we landed this big
and important improvement which is we

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
and important improvement which is we
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.659

completely rewrote how we schedule

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669
completely rewrote how we schedule
 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.249
completely rewrote how we schedule
resources right it's one thing for us to

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259
resources right it's one thing for us to
 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.860
resources right it's one thing for us to
get the HTML bytes we then discover the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
get the HTML bytes we then discover the
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.629
get the HTML bytes we then discover the
resources and then we need to figure out

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639
resources and then we need to figure out
 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.429
resources and then we need to figure out
how do we schedule them efficiently on

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439
how do we schedule them efficiently on
 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.529
how do we schedule them efficiently on
the wire like we care about JavaScript

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539
the wire like we care about JavaScript
 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.890

before images and and other things and

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900
before images and and other things and
 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.149
before images and and other things and
the big change that we've done in there

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159
the big change that we've done in there
 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.800
the big change that we've done in there
in EM 27 is we replace that scheduler

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810
in EM 27 is we replace that scheduler
 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.450
in EM 27 is we replace that scheduler
and we also started focusing on

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460
and we also started focusing on
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.879
and we also started focusing on
perceived performance so instead of just

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889
perceived performance so instead of just
 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.499
perceived performance so instead of just
measuring the page load time we started

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509
measuring the page load time we started
 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.629
measuring the page load time we started
measuring things like speed index so

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639
measuring things like speed index so
 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.249
measuring things like speed index so
what kind of optimizations we can do in

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259
what kind of optimizations we can do in
 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.170
what kind of optimizations we can do in
resource scheduler to improve speed

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180

index in fact you know we've made
decisions where we've intentionally

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440
decisions where we've intentionally
 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.700
decisions where we've intentionally
chosen speed index over page load time

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710
chosen speed index over page load time
 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.010
chosen speed index over page load time
or on load so there are changes that

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020
or on load so there are changes that
 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.050
or on load so there are changes that
have gone in where we regressed in some

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
have gone in where we regressed in some
 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.450
have gone in where we regressed in some
cases on load time but we've improved

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460
cases on load time but we've improved
 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.040
cases on load time but we've improved
speed index because we think that

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050

user and one interesting take away from
this work that was done and I'm 27 was

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819
this work that was done and I'm 27 was
 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.240
this work that was done and I'm 27 was
that we realized that a lot of pages

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250
that we realized that a lot of pages
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.189
that we realized that a lot of pages
were actually competing for bandwidth

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199
were actually competing for bandwidth
 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.719
were actually competing for bandwidth
unnecessarily so they were trying to

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729
unnecessarily so they were trying to
 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.119
unnecessarily so they were trying to
download too many things we've gotten so

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129
download too many things we've gotten so
 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.309

good at charting our assets that it's

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319
good at charting our assets that it's
 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.430
good at charting our assets that it's
actually backfiring on a lot of sites so

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440
actually backfiring on a lot of sites so
 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.730
actually backfiring on a lot of sites so
in particular one big interesting change

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740
in particular one big interesting change
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.129
in particular one big interesting change
that when in in that iteration was that

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139
that when in in that iteration was that
 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.200
that when in in that iteration was that
the new scheduler would only down

the new scheduler would only down
 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.360
the new scheduler would only down

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880
to we do another jump we would always do
 

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.199
to we do another jump we would always do
a check on the file system which in

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:09.209
a check on the file system which in
 

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.840
a check on the file system which in
itself can take quite a bit of time and

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:10.850
itself can take quite a bit of time and
 

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.460
itself can take quite a bit of time and
the idea behind simple caches to try to

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:13.470
the idea behind simple caches to try to
 

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.480
the idea behind simple caches to try to
simplify that as the name implies to the

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.490
simplify that as the name implies to the
 

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.480
simplify that as the name implies to the
extent that we can and ideally avoid any

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:20.490
extent that we can and ideally avoid any
 

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.610
extent that we can and ideally avoid any
context switches on going to disk so

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620
context switches on going to disk so
 

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.320
context switches on going to disk so
that should help quite a bit in terms of

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.330
that should help quite a bit in terms of
 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.530
that should help quite a bit in terms of
the actual performance of the simple

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540
the actual performance of the simple
 

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.050
the actual performance of the simple
cash and here's some early numbers these

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060
cash and here's some early numbers these
 

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.750
cash and here's some early numbers these
look very very good the blue line on the

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760
look very very good the blue line on the
 

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.260
look very very good the blue line on the
bottom is the original and what you see

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.270
bottom is the original and what you see
 

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.850
bottom is the original and what you see
here is the latency right so he kind of

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860
here is the latency right so he kind of
 

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.440
here is the latency right so he kind of
had this like long tail distribution

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.450
had this like long tail distribution
 

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.360
had this like long tail distribution
where basically every request incurred a

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.370
where basically every request incurred a
 

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.850
where basically every request incurred a
minimum of several milliseconds but then

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860
minimum of several milliseconds but then
 

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.650
minimum of several milliseconds but then
you have this long tail where it wasn't

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660
you have this long tail where it wasn't
 

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.720
you have this long tail where it wasn't
a typical for a request to take 50

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:47.730
a typical for a request to take 50
 

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.340
a typical for a request to take 50
milliseconds right before we could even

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:49.350
milliseconds right before we could even
 

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.530
milliseconds right before we could even
dispatch it because we have to kind of

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540
dispatch it because we have to kind of
 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.389
dispatch it because we have to kind of
do a couple of thread hops and then

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399
do a couple of thread hops and then
 

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:55.850
do a couple of thread hops and then
check disk or check flash in this case

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860
check disk or check flash in this case
 

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.910
check disk or check flash in this case
and kind of bubble that back up with a

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920
and kind of bubble that back up with a
 

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.040
and kind of bubble that back up with a
new simple cash basically we can just

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.050
new simple cash basically we can just
 

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.390
new simple cash basically we can just
complete it immediately most of the

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.400
complete it immediately most of the
 

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.370
complete it immediately most of the
requests every once in a while you know

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380
requests every once in a while you know
 

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.680
requests every once in a while you know
we still have some delays but

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:06.690
we still have some delays but
 

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.990
we still have some delays but
it's the this is no type of line where

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000
it's the this is no type of line where
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.700
it's the this is no type of line where
you want to see on all of your

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:10.710
you want to see on all of your
 

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.190
you want to see on all of your
performance charts and this is quite

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200
performance charts and this is quite
 

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.700
performance charts and this is quite
amazing because once we have the simple

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:16.710
amazing because once we have the simple
 

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.150
amazing because once we have the simple
cash this is based on our measurements

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160
cash this is based on our measurements
 

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.610
cash this is based on our measurements
this has improved all HTTP transfers the

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620
this has improved all HTTP transfers the
 

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.200
this has improved all HTTP transfers the
speed of these transfers in terms of the

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.210
speed of these transfers in terms of the
 

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.120
speed of these transfers in terms of the
time from the first request bite that we

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.130
time from the first request bite that we
 

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.890
time from the first request bite that we
want to send to completion by ten

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:27.900
want to send to completion by ten
 

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.140
want to send to completion by ten
percent which you think about it is

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.150
percent which you think about it is
 

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.840
percent which you think about it is
massive right and not only that but in

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:32.850
massive right and not only that but in
 

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.630
massive right and not only that but in
m31 we're seeing seven percent page load

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640
m31 we're seeing seven percent page load
 

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.520
m31 we're seeing seven percent page load
time improvement so this is simply

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.530
time improvement so this is simply
 

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.320
time improvement so this is simply
eliminating that extra latency at the

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.330
eliminating that extra latency at the
 

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.160
eliminating that extra latency at the
beginning of each and every request and

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.170
beginning of each and every request and
 

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.750
beginning of each and every request and
once again there is more work going into

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760
once again there is more work going into
 

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.670
once again there is more work going into
m32 and we hope that we can improve this

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680
m32 and we hope that we can improve this
 

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.160
m32 and we hope that we can improve this
even further so this is this is huge and

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
even further so this is this is huge and
 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.100
even further so this is this is huge and
this isn't be a an awesome when for

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.110
this isn't be a an awesome when for
 

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.040
this isn't be a an awesome when for
mobile browsers and then finally one of

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.050
mobile browsers and then finally one of
 

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.390
mobile browsers and then finally one of
the last things that we started

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:56.400
the last things that we started
 

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.950
the last things that we started
iterating towards the end of the year

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:57.960
iterating towards the end of the year
 

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.150
iterating towards the end of the year
here and something that I'm really

00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160
here and something that I'm really
 

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.490
here and something that I'm really
really excited about is focusing on

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500
really excited about is focusing on
 

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.420
really excited about is focusing on
improving the speculative optimizations

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.430
improving the speculative optimizations
 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.190
improving the speculative optimizations
that we already doing chrome we do a lot

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200
that we already doing chrome we do a lot
 

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.930
that we already doing chrome we do a lot
of speculative optimization as it is

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940
of speculative optimization as it is
 

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.630
of speculative optimization as it is
today but now we're also looking at how

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640
today but now we're also looking at how
 

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.430
today but now we're also looking at how
do we refine these how do we expose the

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440
do we refine these how do we expose the
 

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.570
do we refine these how do we expose the
right primitives and how do we make

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:14.580
right primitives and how do we make
 

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.430
right primitives and how do we make
better use of them one example is

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440
better use of them one example is
 

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.170
better use of them one example is
something like a prefetch right so if

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180
something like a prefetch right so if
 

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.450
something like a prefetch right so if
you're familiar with a link rel prefetch

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:20.460
you're familiar with a link rel prefetch

you right please fetch this for me such

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660
you right please fetch this for me such
 

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.170
you right please fetch this for me such
that I don't have to fetch that or i can

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180

just fetch it out of the cash when the

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:35.340
just fetch it out of the cash when the
 

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.160
just fetch it out of the cash when the
user initiates that load one of the

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.170
user initiates that load one of the
 

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.530
user initiates that load one of the
gotchas there was if that requests did

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540
gotchas there was if that requests did
 

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.910
gotchas there was if that requests did

not complete in time for the next
navigation you would get cancelled so

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720
navigation you would get cancelled so
 

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.120
navigation you would get cancelled so
you kind of incurred a double download

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.130
you kind of incurred a double download
 

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.520
you kind of incurred a double download
and it like it just didn't make sense so

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:46.530
and it like it just didn't make sense so
 

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.200
and it like it just didn't make sense so
for example we have this new patch

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.210
for example we have this new patch
 

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.420
for example we have this new patch
that's that's in its not available in

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.430
that's that's in its not available in
 

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.820
that's that's in its not available in
Canary yet but it's coming soon called

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:52.830
Canary yet but it's coming soon called
 

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.530
Canary yet but it's coming soon called
detachable prefetch which will actually

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540
detachable prefetch which will actually
 

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.420
detachable prefetch which will actually
keep the prefetch alive even as you

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.430
keep the prefetch alive even as you
 

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.820
keep the prefetch alive even as you
navigate away such that you can still

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:58.830
navigate away such that you can still
 

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.410
navigate away such that you can still
make use of that resource once you get

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420
make use of that resource once you get
 

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.090
make use of that resource once you get
to your destination so that's pretty

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100
to your destination so that's pretty
 

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.040
to your destination so that's pretty
awesome and this will also apply to

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.050
awesome and this will also apply to
 

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.220
awesome and this will also apply to
other things like pre renders and other

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:07.230
other things like pre renders and other
 

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.500
other things like pre renders and other
types of improvements so this is pretty

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:09.510
types of improvements so this is pretty
 

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.420
types of improvements so this is pretty
cool and this is how it basically it

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:11.430
cool and this is how it basically it
 

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.140
cool and this is how it basically it
looks chrome allows you to actually

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.150
looks chrome allows you to actually
 

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.700
looks chrome allows you to actually
dynamically create these hints so for

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:16.710
dynamically create these hints so for
 

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.160
dynamically create these hints so for

like they click on the checkout button

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:21.950
like they click on the checkout button
 

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.010
like they click on the checkout button
or they click on add to cart button and

you know that they're going to go to the
 

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.860
you know that they're going to go to the
checkout page at that moment you can

checkout page at that moment you can
 

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.500
checkout page at that moment you can
actually inject one of these link

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:29.510
actually inject one of these link
 

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.150
actually inject one of these link
elements and say hey I would like you to

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160
elements and say hey I would like you to
 

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.940
elements and say hey I would like you to
prefetch that asset for me because now i

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:33.950
prefetch that asset for me because now i
 

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.190
prefetch that asset for me because now i
know i will need it and vice versa you

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.200
know i will need it and vice versa you
 

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.140
know i will need it and vice versa you
can actually delete this element out of

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.150
can actually delete this element out of
 

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.390
can actually delete this element out of
the other the dom and we will cancel the

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.400
the other the dom and we will cancel the
 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.310
the other the dom and we will cancel the
prefetch as well so you can dynamically

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320
prefetch as well so you can dynamically
 

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.950
prefetch as well so you can dynamically
script how in basically drive chrome to

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:44.960
script how in basically drive chrome to
 

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.260
script how in basically drive chrome to
do these pre fetches for you so this

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.270
do these pre fetches for you so this
 

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.650
do these pre fetches for you so this
pretty cool stuff and i think this is a

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.660
pretty cool stuff and i think this is a
 

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.420
pretty cool stuff and i think this is a
place where we can do a lot more in the

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.430
place where we can do a lot more in the
 

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.540
place where we can do a lot more in the
future as well so that's a little bit

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:55.550
future as well so that's a little bit
 

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.520
future as well so that's a little bit
about kind of the low level guts and

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:57.530
about kind of the low level guts and
 

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.100
about kind of the low level guts and
improvements in chrome now let's take a

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.110
improvements in chrome now let's take a
 

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.230
improvements in chrome now let's take a
look at some of the protocols that we've

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240
look at some of the protocols that we've
 

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.340
look at some of the protocols that we've
been working on so back in 2009 roughly

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:06.350
been working on so back in 2009 roughly
 

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.070
been working on so back in 2009 roughly
actually four years ago almost on a dot

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:09.080
actually four years ago almost on a dot
 

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.260
actually four years ago almost on a dot
we announced our work on speedy or

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:11.270
we announced our work on speedy or
 

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.540
we announced our work on speedy or
initial efforts around speedy and since

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:13.550
initial efforts around speedy and since
 

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.370
initial efforts around speedy and since
then we've gone I think quite a long way

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:15.380
then we've gone I think quite a long way
 

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.110
then we've gone I think quite a long way
we've had several iterations of the

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120
we've had several iterations of the
 

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.990
we've had several iterations of the
protocol itself so be to v3 3.1 now

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000
protocol itself so be to v3 3.1 now
 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.720
protocol itself so be to v3 3.1 now
we're working on version 4 and that

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.730
we're working on version 4 and that
 

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.340
we're working on version 4 and that
actually became the foundation of HTTP

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.350
actually became the foundation of HTTP
 

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.830
actually became the foundation of HTTP
to which is pretty exciting and HP to

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:26.840
to which is pretty exciting and HP to
 

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.290
to which is pretty exciting and HP to
work in itself is progressing quite

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:29.300
work in itself is progressing quite
 

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.910
work in itself is progressing quite
rapidly and I'm really excited about

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920
rapidly and I'm really excited about
 

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.070
rapidly and I'm really excited about
that so today we actually have both

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.080
that so today we actually have both
 

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.760
that so today we actually have both
speedy in HP to support in Chrome

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:36.770
speedy in HP to support in Chrome
 

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.520
speedy in HP to support in Chrome
although HP to is under a flag but it is

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.530
although HP to is under a flag but it is
 

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.870
although HP to is under a flag but it is
there it's something that we're

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880
there it's something that we're
 

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.210
there it's something that we're
iterating on and then once HTTP to I

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:43.220
iterating on and then once HTTP to I
 

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.580
iterating on and then once HTTP to I
know this is a common question once hp2

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:45.590
know this is a common question once hp2
 

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.190
know this is a common question once hp2
is marked as ready as a standard we will

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.200
is marked as ready as a standard we will
 

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.140
is marked as ready as a standard we will
just switch over to http too so speed

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:50.150
just switch over to http too so speed
 

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.370
just switch over to http too so speed
think of speedy as kind of like an

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.380
think of speedy as kind of like an
 

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.890
think of speedy as kind of like an
experimental ground for us to try

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:53.900
experimental ground for us to try
 

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.750
experimental ground for us to try
different ideas and feed them back into

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760
different ideas and feed them back into
 

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.640
different ideas and feed them back into
the HTTP to spec rights like it'd be

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:57.650
the HTTP to spec rights like it'd be
 

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.470
the HTTP to spec rights like it'd be
great if we had this feature let's go

00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480
great if we had this feature let's go
 

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.540
great if we had this feature let's go
and try and implement that future we try

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:01.550
and try and implement that future we try
 

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.480
and try and implement that future we try
it we discover the rough edges and then

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:04.490
it we discover the rough edges and then
 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.870
it we discover the rough edges and then
we kind of feed that back into HTTP two

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880
we kind of feed that back into HTTP two
 

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.580
we kind of feed that back into HTTP two
so earlier in the year we actually

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:09.590
so earlier in the year we actually
 

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.300
so earlier in the year we actually
deployed speedy 3.1 across all of our

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:13.310
deployed speedy 3.1 across all of our
 

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.620
deployed speedy 3.1 across all of our
google servers and of course added

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:14.630
google servers and of course added
 

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.290
google servers and of course added
support in chrome firefox also supports

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300
support in chrome firefox also supports
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.350
support in chrome firefox also supports
speedy 3.1 and here are some numbers

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360
speedy 3.1 and here are some numbers
 

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.210
speedy 3.1 and here are some numbers
we've actually we've never released as

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.220
we've actually we've never released as
 

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.120
we've actually we've never released as
before but these are the performance

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.130
before but these are the performance
 

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.400
before but these are the performance
numbers that we see for speedy across

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.410
numbers that we see for speedy across
 

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.560
numbers that we see for speedy across
some of the major Google properties and

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:29.570
some of the major Google properties and
 

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.390
some of the major Google properties and
these are consistent across all the

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.400
these are consistent across all the
 

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.530
these are consistent across all the
different Google Sites so you

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540
different Google Sites so you
 

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.850
different Google Sites so you
kind of looking at the right order of

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860
kind of looking at the right order of
 

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.410
kind of looking at the right order of
magnitude anywhere between twenty to

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420
magnitude anywhere between twenty to
 

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.900
magnitude anywhere between twenty to
forty to fifty percent improvement in

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:38.910
forty to fifty percent improvement in
 

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.490
forty to fifty percent improvement in
latency as compared to HTTPS and in some

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500
latency as compared to HTTPS and in some
 

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.800
latency as compared to HTTPS and in some
cases were actually so this even despite

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:45.810
cases were actually so this even despite
 

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.370
cases were actually so this even despite
the fact that we have these extra

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:48.380
the fact that we have these extra
 

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.569
the fact that we have these extra
handshake round trips and all the rest

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579
handshake round trips and all the rest
 

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:52.819
handshake round trips and all the rest
and CLS oftentimes we actually end up

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:52.829
and CLS oftentimes we actually end up
 

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:55.129
and CLS oftentimes we actually end up
going faster than just vanilla HTTP as

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139
going faster than just vanilla HTTP as
 

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:58.699
going faster than just vanilla HTTP as
well which is of course the point of

00:15:58.699 --> 00:15:58.709
well which is of course the point of
 

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.829
well which is of course the point of
this whole exercise to begin with so

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839
this whole exercise to begin with so
 

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:03.259
this whole exercise to begin with so
this is really exciting and I guess the

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:03.269
this is really exciting and I guess the
 

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:05.870
this is really exciting and I guess the
important bit here is also that not only

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880
important bit here is also that not only
 

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.430
important bit here is also that not only
is it helping the median which is of

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440
is it helping the median which is of
 

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.870
is it helping the median which is of
course we'd like to see but it's also

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880
course we'd like to see but it's also
 

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.519
course we'd like to see but it's also
consistently helping all of our users

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:10.529
consistently helping all of our users
 

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:12.379
consistently helping all of our users
the ones on fast connections and

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:12.389
the ones on fast connections and
 

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.509
the ones on fast connections and
especially so for the ones that are in

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519
especially so for the ones that are in
 

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.069
especially so for the ones that are in
the slow connections are the ones with

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079
the slow connections are the ones with
 

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.019
the slow connections are the ones with
the hierarchy tee times which is

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:18.029
the hierarchy tee times which is
 

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:19.370
the hierarchy tee times which is
especially relevant for things like

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380
especially relevant for things like
 

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.259
especially relevant for things like
mobile right where our tee tees are

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:21.269
mobile right where our tee tees are
 

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:23.360
mobile right where our tee tees are
definitely higher so this is really

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.370
definitely higher so this is really
 

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.090
definitely higher so this is really
exciting this was very promising and I

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100
exciting this was very promising and I
 

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.980
exciting this was very promising and I
hope that this will help kind of drive

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:27.990
hope that this will help kind of drive
 

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.370
hope that this will help kind of drive

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.819
support speedy so that's that's pretty
cool and as I mentioned we also do have

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:51.829
cool and as I mentioned we also do have
 

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:54.590
cool and as I mentioned we also do have
HP too if you're if you're curious if

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600
HP too if you're if you're curious if
 

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.290
HP too if you're if you're curious if
you want to play with it we do have HP

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300
you want to play with it we do have HP
 

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.819
you want to play with it we do have HP
to support under flag so you can

00:16:58.819 --> 00:16:58.829
to support under flag so you can
 

00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:00.949
to support under flag so you can
actually enable that and then you know

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959
actually enable that and then you know
 

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.319
actually enable that and then you know
run it against your local server I think

00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:03.329
run it against your local server I think
 

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:05.449
run it against your local server I think
the only big public site that supports

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459
the only big public site that supports
 

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.569
the only big public site that supports
HTTP to today is twitter com so in

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579
HTTP to today is twitter com so in
 

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.130
HTTP to today is twitter com so in
theory you can you can test it on that

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140
theory you can you can test it on that
 

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.970
theory you can you can test it on that
but there are also open source servers

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980
but there are also open source servers
 

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.949
but there are also open source servers
that speak HP today that you can play

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959
that speak HP today that you can play
 

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:19.280
that speak HP today that you can play
with so speedy is kind of a production

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:19.290
with so speedy is kind of a production
 

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.049
with so speedy is kind of a production
version if you will HP two is coming

00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:21.059
version if you will HP two is coming
 

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:23.140
version if you will HP two is coming
soon and hopefully in fingers crossed

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.150
soon and hopefully in fingers crossed
 

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:30.260
soon and hopefully in fingers crossed
sometime in 2014 so that's speedy you

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:30.270
sometime in 2014 so that's speedy you
 

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.570
sometime in 2014 so that's speedy you
may have caught the wind of some other

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580
may have caught the wind of some other
 

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.340
may have caught the wind of some other
protocol that we started working on

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.350
protocol that we started working on
 

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.049
protocol that we started working on
earlier in the year which is quick which

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059
earlier in the year which is quick which
 

00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:37.970
earlier in the year which is quick which
is quick UDP internet connections and

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980
is quick UDP internet connections and
 

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.010
is quick UDP internet connections and
the idea here is actually to kind of

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020
the idea here is actually to kind of
 

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.560
the idea here is actually to kind of
take what we've done with speedy and go

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:42.570
take what we've done with speedy and go
 

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.960
take what we've done with speedy and go
one step beyond and this was actually

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:44.970
one step beyond and this was actually
 

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.190
one step beyond and this was actually
our intent right

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200
our intent right
 

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.799
our intent right
the very beginning when we started

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:47.809
the very beginning when we started
 

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:50.330
the very beginning when we started
thinking of speedy but it was just too

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340
thinking of speedy but it was just too
 

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.519
thinking of speedy but it was just too
much of a leap to change both the

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:52.529
much of a leap to change both the
 

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:54.830
much of a leap to change both the
protocol kind of the application

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840
protocol kind of the application
 

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.840
protocol kind of the application
protocol and the transport protocol so

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:56.850
protocol and the transport protocol so
 

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.610
protocol and the transport protocol so
it kind of decoupled those and quick is

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620
it kind of decoupled those and quick is
 

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.350
it kind of decoupled those and quick is
basically that we're trying to go one

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360
basically that we're trying to go one
 

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.029
basically that we're trying to go one
step further and say well could we

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039
step further and say well could we
 

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.730
step further and say well could we
rebuild or could we build a better

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740
rebuild or could we build a better
 

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.250
rebuild or could we build a better

of UDP could we experiment with new

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:08.909

the secure tunnel can we do better

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.130
the secure tunnel can we do better
 

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.279
the secure tunnel can we do better

for that and this question comes up

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.570
for that and this question comes up
 

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.029
for that and this question comes up
quite frequently which is like what

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039
quite frequently which is like what

what's the point like what are you
trying to do here and the answer is very

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:54.750
trying to do here and the answer is very
 

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.480
trying to do here and the answer is very
simple we just want to make faster

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:56.490
simple we just want to make faster
 

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.210

internet for for everybody to use and

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220
internet for for everybody to use and
 

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.680
internet for for everybody to use and
there are two ways that this will happen

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:00.690
there are two ways that this will happen
 

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.750
there are two ways that this will happen
one is we end up building a really

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760
one is we end up building a really
 

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.220
one is we end up building a really
awesome protocol that everybody loves

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.230
awesome protocol that everybody loves
 

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.259
awesome protocol that everybody loves
and we take it to ITF and just like with

00:19:06.259 --> 00:19:06.269
and we take it to ITF and just like with
 

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:09.350
and we take it to ITF and just like with
HP too and speedy you know we work with

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360
HP too and speedy you know we work with
 

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.269
HP too and speedy you know we work with
the community and kind of make that the

00:19:11.269 --> 00:19:11.279
the community and kind of make that the
 

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:13.399
the community and kind of make that the
standard that's plausible and maybe that

00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:13.409
standard that's plausible and maybe that
 

00:19:13.409 --> 00:19:16.549
standard that's plausible and maybe that
will happen the alternative route is we

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559
will happen the alternative route is we
 

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.320
will happen the alternative route is we
just experiment with quick we experiment

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.330
just experiment with quick we experiment
 

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.330
just experiment with quick we experiment
with different ideas and those ideas get

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340
with different ideas and those ideas get
 

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.769
with different ideas and those ideas get
adopted you know the good ones get

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:21.779
adopted you know the good ones get
 

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:23.419
adopted you know the good ones get
adopted into existing protocol stacks

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:23.429
adopted into existing protocol stacks
 

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:25.519
adopted into existing protocol stacks
like TCP and TLS and actually we're

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:25.529
like TCP and TLS and actually we're
 

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:27.740
like TCP and TLS and actually we're
already seeing some of that we're based

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:27.750
already seeing some of that we're based
 

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.019
already seeing some of that we're based
on our experience with the encryption

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:30.029
on our experience with the encryption

looking at improvements in terms of can

00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799
looking at improvements in terms of can
 

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.649
looking at improvements in terms of can
we eliminate some extra round trips so

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:36.659
we eliminate some extra round trips so
 

00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:39.080
we eliminate some extra round trips so
in either case the point is no matter

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.090
in either case the point is no matter

which one of these happens the users
 

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:42.950
which one of these happens the users
will win will get faster internet and

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960
will win will get faster internet and
 

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.669
will win will get faster internet and
that's that's our intent with quick so

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679
that's that's our intent with quick so
 

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.110
that's that's our intent with quick so
that's pretty awesome we don't have any

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120
that's pretty awesome we don't have any
 

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.680
that's pretty awesome we don't have any
benchmarks for it as of today we're

kind of all the all the edges around it
but you can

00:19:59.620 --> 00:19:59.630
but you can
 

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.150
but you can
actually play with quick today we

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.160
actually play with quick today we

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:49.100
already have the code in chrome you can
 

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.150
already have the code in chrome you can
actually negotiate the deflate

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:52.160
actually negotiate the deflate
 

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.040
actually negotiate the deflate
compression to apply in both directions

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.050
compression to apply in both directions
 

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.260
compression to apply in both directions
and the server can selectively compress

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:56.270
and the server can selectively compress
 

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.170
and the server can selectively compress
any given frame and a client or as of

00:23:59.170 --> 00:23:59.180
any given frame and a client or as of
 

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.880
any given frame and a client or as of
today chrome will compress every single

today chrome will compress every single
 

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.500
today chrome will compress every single
frame going going out from your mobile

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.510

I'm not going to go into details here

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:10.160
I'm not going to go into details here
 

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.610
I'm not going to go into details here
but we also actually the spec provides a

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:12.620
but we also actually the spec provides a
 

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.960
but we also actually the spec provides a
number of different parameters to

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970
number of different parameters to
 

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.730
number of different parameters to
customize how the compression will be

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:15.740
customize how the compression will be
 

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.980
customize how the compression will be
done for example the size of the sliding

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:17.990
done for example the size of the sliding
 

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.600
done for example the size of the sliding
windows such that you can control the

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:19.610
windows such that you can control the
 

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.270
windows such that you can control the
resources used on your server and on

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:22.280
resources used on your server and on
 

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.640
resources used on your server and on
your client plus some other flags so

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:24.650
your client plus some other flags so
 

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.870
your client plus some other flags so
this is really really exciting because

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880
this is really really exciting because
 

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.350
this is really really exciting because
the

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360
the
 

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.900
the
definitely been a sore point for for web

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:28.910
definitely been a sore point for for web
 

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.040
definitely been a sore point for for web
sockets we heard about WebRTC and data

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.050
sockets we heard about WebRTC and data
 

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.870
sockets we heard about WebRTC and data
channel the way I think about data

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880
channel the way I think about data
 

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.910
channel the way I think about data
channel is basically WebSocket but over

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:36.920
channel is basically WebSocket but over
 

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.700
channel is basically WebSocket but over
UDP and p2p right so we can communicate

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:39.710
UDP and p2p right so we can communicate
 

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.980
UDP and p2p right so we can communicate
directly between devices we don't have

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:41.990
directly between devices we don't have
 

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.050
directly between devices we don't have
to go through an intermediary like like

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:44.060
to go through an intermediary like like
 

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.100
to go through an intermediary like like
a server and data channel and m31 has

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.110
a server and data channel and m31 has
 

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.070
a server and data channel and m31 has
now officially switched to sctp protocol

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080
now officially switched to sctp protocol
 

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.140
now officially switched to sctp protocol
so previously we're using we were using

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.150
so previously we're using we were using
 

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.350
so previously we're using we were using
RTP data channels and you know that was

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360
RTP data channels and you know that was
 

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.250
RTP data channels and you know that was
the reason for some of the

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.260
the reason for some of the
 

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.870
the reason for some of the
incompatibilities with some of the other

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880
incompatibilities with some of the other
 

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.200
incompatibilities with some of the other
vendors but as of m31 sctp is the

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.210
vendors but as of m31 sctp is the
 

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.090
vendors but as of m31 sctp is the
default and we will aggressively remove

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:04.100
default and we will aggressively remove
 

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.050
default and we will aggressively remove
support for RTP data channels so if

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:08.060
support for RTP data channels so if
 

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.510
support for RTP data channels so if
you're using data channels today this is

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520
you're using data channels today this is
 

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.760
you're using data channels today this is
something you want to revisit and if

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:12.770
something you want to revisit and if
 

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.380
something you want to revisit and if
you're not familiar with data channels I

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:14.390
you're not familiar with data channels I
 

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.900
you're not familiar with data channels I
encourage you to check out the link so

encourage you to check out the link so
i'll post the slides later for you know

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:18.530
i'll post the slides later for you know
 

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.200
i'll post the slides later for you know
how this works and why this is awesome

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.210
how this works and why this is awesome
 

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.940
how this works and why this is awesome
because it allows you to define things

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:21.950
because it allows you to define things
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.180
because it allows you to define things
like fire-and-forget semantics you know

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.190
like fire-and-forget semantics you know
 

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.250
like fire-and-forget semantics you know
don't retransmits oh it's a really nice

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.260
don't retransmits oh it's a really nice
 

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.730
don't retransmits oh it's a really nice
transport for doing low latency data

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:30.740
transport for doing low latency data
 

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.200
transport for doing low latency data
exchange and then finally let's talk

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.210
exchange and then finally let's talk
 

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.180
exchange and then finally let's talk
about measurement right so there's a lot

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.190
about measurement right so there's a lot
 

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.770
about measurement right so there's a lot
of kind of protocol improvements that

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:38.780
of kind of protocol improvements that
 

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.680
of kind of protocol improvements that
are going on but as we know we need to

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:41.690
are going on but as we know we need to
 

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.090
are going on but as we know we need to
be able to measure things in order to

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.100
be able to measure things in order to
 

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.460
be able to measure things in order to
improve them so of course we're all

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:45.470
improve them so of course we're all
 

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.050
improve them so of course we're all
familiar with navigation timing or I

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:47.060

own resources you need to add this
header and then if you're using

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:18.020
header and then if you're using
 

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.460

and you saw the speedy ones right so all

00:28:59.320 --> 00:28:59.330
and you saw the speedy ones right so all
 

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.909
and you saw the speedy ones right so all
of these things are incremental right

configured correctly and in other cases
 

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.549
configured correctly and in other cases
it's just also doing a better job of

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559
it's just also doing a better job of
 

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.289
it's just also doing a better job of
scheduling this kind of stuff and then

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:23.299
scheduling this kind of stuff and then
 

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:24.730
scheduling this kind of stuff and then
finally you know if you haven't already

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:24.740
finally you know if you haven't already

finally you know if you haven't already
I definitely encourage you to look at

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:26.510
I definitely encourage you to look at
 

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.510
I definitely encourage you to look at
things like NAFTA I mean user timing and

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:28.520
things like NAFTA I mean user timing and
 

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.639
things like NAFTA I mean user timing and
resource timing so I talked about

00:29:30.639 --> 00:29:30.649
resource timing so I talked about
 

00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:32.649
resource timing so I talked about
resource timing user timing allows you

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:32.659
resource timing user timing allows you
 

00:29:32.659 --> 00:29:35.740
resource timing user timing allows you
to measure any chunk of code and just

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:35.750
to measure any chunk of code and just
 

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:40.000
to measure any chunk of code and just
get high resolution time stamps for you

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.010
get high resolution time stamps for you
 

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.350
get high resolution time stamps for you
know this is one I started this is going

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360
know this is one I started this is going
 

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.210
know this is one I started this is going
to end it and be can come back to your

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220
to end it and be can come back to your
 

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.740
to end it and be can come back to your
server so all of these things are

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:44.750
server so all of these things are
 

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.860
server so all of these things are
supported in chrome and you know what

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:47.870
supported in chrome and you know what
 

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.830
supported in chrome and you know what
you can measure you can optimize so with

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840
you can measure you can optimize so with
 

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.210
you can measure you can optimize so with
that I'll leave you the link to the

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.220
that I'll leave you the link to the
 

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.299
