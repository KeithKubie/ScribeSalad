00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.880
If you've decided your
app will be monetized

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.350
with in-app advertising,
it's essential to plan

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.410
for this early in
your design process.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.320
Ads should fit seamlessly into
the experience of your app

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.750
and not interrupt its flow.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.420
The ad type you choose should
depend on the type of content

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.350
you're offering and how
your users engage with it.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.620
In this video, we'll
look at your options.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.950
And remember, don't
settle for just one.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.030
Consider mixing and
matching ad types

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.270
to fit the structure of
your app and the audience

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.200
to provide the best
user experience.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.350
Don't worry, using
AdMob is easy.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.710
To get started, all you
have to do is sign up

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.060
on google.com/admob.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.000
Then integrate the
Google Mobile Ads SDK

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.842
with three simple steps
from developers.google.com.

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.460
And finally, create
your first ad unit code

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.160
from your AdMob account.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.520
Next, we'll go over the
variety of innovative ad

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.560
formats available to you,
showcasing their features,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.600
and when and where
you'd want to use each.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.760
Let's start with
the smart banner.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.930
This is an ad format that spans
the entire width of the screen

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.560
and varies in height, depending
on the size of your screen

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.530
device.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.800
Why smart banners?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.490
Well, as people engage with
a wider array of devices,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.470
you will have to adapt to a
multitude of screen sizes.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.480
With smart banners,
these units smartly

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.310
detect the width of
your phone or tablet

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.830
in its current
orientation and adjust

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.370
to the size for
best presentation,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.870
giving users an engaging
experience regardless

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.800
of the device they're using.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.650
Next are full-screen
interstitial ads.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.300
They fill the
screen immediately,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.360
presenting rich experiences
at natural app transition

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.880
points such as the
end of a game level.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.960
They offer an immersive
experience for users

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
to see the most engaging
content from advertisers.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960
They also provide a
simple close button

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.030
so that users can easily
return to the app content.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.360
Trueview ads are video ads that
appear in interstitial slots.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
Trueview ads have been a
staple of YouTube advertising

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.670
for a while now but are now
available for mobile ads.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.020
Once a Trueview
ad appears, users

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.780
have the option to watch the ad
or skip it after five seconds.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.729
This is great for advertisers,
publishers, and users.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.290
Users only see the
ads they want to see,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.440
advertisers are connected
with a truly engaged audience,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
and publishers get the
benefit of giving their users

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.800
a positive user experience
while still making money

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.300
from ads that are watched.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.370
What if you want to take
a little more control

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.580
of your own inventory and
promote your own products?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130
You can do that, too.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.430
AdMob's house ad
features give you

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.360
a way to grow your in-app
purchasing revenue for free.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.920
You can show users customized
text or display ads promoting

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.680
the items you want to sell.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.330
Not every user is going to
make a purchase in your app.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860
So AdMob automatically figures
out which of your users

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.140
are likely to buy based on
Google's advanced data models.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.930
AdMob will then show
those users not likely

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.640
to convert regular ads
instead of your house ads.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.160
Native ads are another
innovative ad format

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.700
offered in AdMob.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.090
They allow you to match
the formatting, style,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.350
and content of your
app, making for a better

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.120
overall experience.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.710
You can customize the form
and function of native ads

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.370
to match your app by
implementing the AdMob SDK.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.851
We pay close attention
to user experience.

00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.350
so our native ads
are designed to be

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.060
clearly identifiable as ads
to users, but not intrusive

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.040
to the experience of your app.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.090
Thanks for watching.
