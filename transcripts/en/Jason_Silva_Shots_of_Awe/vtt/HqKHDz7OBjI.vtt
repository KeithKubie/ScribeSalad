00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.980
SUBJECT: So we've had this
ongoing debate, right, nature

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.930
versus nurture.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.830
And it asks the question are
we pre-written beings, are we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.270
pre-determined beings,
do our genetics dictate

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.830
our fate, right, or are we
made by our environment,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.509
are we molded by our experience,
does language structure how

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.370
we see the world, does
culture dictate who we become,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.020
are we molded and shaped
by the unfolding dynamics

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.250
of interfacing with
our environment?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.450
This is sometimes
known as epigenetics,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.830
how literally things
that happen to you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.420
during your formative
years can transform

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.230
how your genetic
structure is expressed.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.390
Experience can
change biology, OK.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.410
But recently this debate
has taken on new heights

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.249
because some of
the new science--

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.540
there's an article called
The Social Life of Genes that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.110
talked about this, which said
that the idea of epigenetics

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.190
actually goes much farther,
and that experience

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.420
throughout our lives affects
our genetic expression.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.650
And the doctor, the researcher
quoted in the piece, actually

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.180
the best way to describe it.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.770
He basically says, that our
cells, compose our bodies,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
are a technology for turning
experience into biology,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.230
that even the cognitive framing
that we give to an experience

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.720
can change the
physical expression

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.540
of our cellular biology.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.630
So that consciousness itself,
interpretation, storytelling,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.800
and framing, how we give
meaning to our lives,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.840
can actually have a real
effect at our genetic level,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.370
at the way our genetic
software expresses itself.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.470
And we've always heard
the bumper stickers that

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.700
talk about the
power of the mind,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.650
or the power of
positive thinking,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.740
or the fact that we
can shape our reality,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.160
but this notion not just
effects genetic expression

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.700
at one point in your life,
but throughout your life,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.310
means that you're
constantly composing

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.070
your own biological unfolding.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.725
I design, therefore I become.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.350
I've said it before,
I'll say it again,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.090
but we are as god's, my friends.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.210
And we might as
well get good at it.
