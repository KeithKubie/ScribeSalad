00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.831
Volcanoes are unpredictable forces of nature
and there are about 1,500 geologically active

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.749
ones around the world.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:07.749
Let that sink in.

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:12.300
This one, Bárðarbunga in Iceland, spewed
thousands of cubic feet of molten lava from

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.770
a crack in the earth’s crust back in 2014.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.320
But by volcanologists standards, that was
considered a peaceful eruption.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.430
Peaceful…

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.540
Huh.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.950
Bárðarbunga could erupt explosively again
one day, shutting down air travel and unleashing

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.120
a level of environmental destruction that
would wipe out roads, homes, and daily life

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.820
as we know it.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.210
Active volcanoes like this one exist all over
the world, but “active” is sort of a misnomer…

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.080
An active volcano can erupt at any time, but
it could also not.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.220
That’s the nature of these bubbling cauldrons.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.469
They’re incredibly dangerous and mystifying...
and so hard to predict.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.149
Scientists are working hard to figure out
when a volcano is going to erupt .So the best

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.879
we can do now is whittle a prediction down
to a series of probabilities and best guesses…

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.000
And to do this, volcanologists have a few
things in their tool kit: seismometers that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.490
can pinpoint the rise and fall of magma, thermal
imaging to detect the heat around a volcano,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.490
and chemical sensors that sniff for volcanic
gases like sulfur and CO2.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.560
Even with all of these data points, there’s
still no volcano forecast.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.110
No one can say “this will erupt in X days.”

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.281
As they work toward getting a forecast, scientists
are adding another tool to their kit: seismic

00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:26.820
noise interferometry.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.800
It’s like listening to the “whispers”
of a volcano.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.820
[VOLCANO SOUND]

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.400
Let’s break that down.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.380
In a study, researchers analyzed seismic noise
moving through the volcano Kilauea in Hawaii

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.350
over a four year period.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.009
Seismic noises are low-level vibrations in
the Earth; they come from earthquakes, ocean

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.860
waves, or in this case, magma swirling inside
a volcano.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.320
By using seismic noise interferometry, the
researchers measured the speed of seismic

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.270
activity moving through a volcano.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.240
They were able to record how fast the vibrations
were traveling and isolated the noise or “whispers”

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.310
coming from inside.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.969
By isolating the seismic noise, scientists
were able to identify the sounds that indicate

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.529
an increase in internal pressure, which is
a warning sign for a future eruption.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.930
Going one step further, the researchers compared
those results to a second set of data which

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.650
measured the bulging and shrinking of a volcano’s
summit over time.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.969
Kilauea is a very active volcano.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.340
As the pressure in its magma chamber increases
and decreases, it is constantly bulging and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.340
shrinking.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.909
This makes it a prime candidate for this kind
of research.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.909
The researchers found a correlation between
the speed of this volcano’s seismic energy

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.629
and its bulging and shrinking.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.269
As the magma fills up, it causes an increase
in pressure, which produces much faster seismic

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.269
waves.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.959
And volcanoes tend to bulge up and out before
an eruption.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.510
So, by combining these two data sets, researchers
were able to more accurately predict when

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.629
an eruption could happen.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.790
Technical improvements like these are bringing
volcanologists one step closer to understanding

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.879
the inner workings of these explosive mountains
and the behaviors that lead to a massive eruption.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.760
We’ve still got more work to do, but predicting
chaos is getting that much more precise.
