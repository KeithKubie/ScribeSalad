00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:08.590
So what else do we to tell the students, James?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.460
&gt;&gt; Just how we'll be working in this course.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.750
We'll be using two main tools, a text editor to code and

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.210
a browser to inspect our work.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.930
All modern browsers include a powerful set of tools.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.920
Commonly referred to as Developer Tools.

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:29.610
Which let's Developers inspect the way a website loads and runs.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.590
Dev Tools also includes a console that allows you to

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.370
issue JavaScript commands against your website.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.160
Let's give it a try.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.200
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.300
What do you have in mind?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.490
&gt;&gt; Let's open up developer tools right now and run a command.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.851
Let's say console.log();.

00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:45.850
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.990
This sounds like a good time for a quiz.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.720
Let's find out what console.log(); does.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.620
I want you to pull up the console and type console.log("Hello world!");.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.440
What happened when you ran the command?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.060
Type it in here.
