00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.700
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.860
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.770
There are lots of seats out front
folks, if you'd like to come on up.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.130
I won't point you out at all.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.430
I'm John Cole.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.640 position:56%
I'm the Director of the Center for
The Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.210
which is the part of the library
that promotes books and reading

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.410
and literacy in libraries.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.280
We are really in the educational
outreach business for the library

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.080 position:56%
and part of a newly organized
department that talks about national

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.570
and international outreach.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.000
We have affiliates at very state,
and they help us promote books

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.550
and reading, often through
statewide book festivals.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.290
Sometimes through author
awards programs.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.920
Other ways that are local.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.180
And the business they're really in
is promoting writers and authors

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.890
and book things in their states.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.970
And so we enjoy having
those state contacts.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.380
And it's important for the work
that we're doing in other areas.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.360
Another major involvement
for us is with the Library

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.900
of Congress National Book
Festival, which has existed.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.200
We had our 15th anniversary
this year.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.380
It was created for with
the library by Laura Bush

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.290
when she was the first lady.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.930
And she stuck with us, thank
goodness, for all eight years

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.820
that the Bushes were here.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.770
And President Obama and Mrs.
Obama became our honorary chairs

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.470
after the Bushes left.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.290
And we have picked up steam.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.070
We were, the first 13 years
on the National Mall and sort

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.980
of got moved off as the mall
underwent renovation last year.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.440
And we grew rather large.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.390
And we've moved into the
Washington Convention Center

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.600
where we have been very happily
ensconced the last two years

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.290
and in the future.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.820
The book festival is a
wonderful public outreach event

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.570
for the Library of Congress.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.890
And one of the best parts is all of
the Library of Congress volunteers

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.590
and others from throughout the
library and our friends help out.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.020
And the Convention Center put
out a statistic last year,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.820
which we didn't do the counting,
nor did we ask for the publicity.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.100 position:56%
But they said that the National Book
Festival last September 5th was the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.310
largest single event ever held at
the Washington Convention Center.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.130
And they estimated a crowd
between 125 and 150,000,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.600
which was really wonderful.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.010
Well that was, I'll thank you
on behalf of the library and all

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.330
of the people who worked on it.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.460
Because it was, it's
just a wonderful event.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.420
Here at the library, to
get down to business,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.630
of one our major programs is the
one you're attending called Books

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.930
and Beyond.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.350
And these are book talks by
authors of relatively recent books.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.860
And each of the books has something
to do with the Library of Congress.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.620
And we co-sponsor these often

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.290
with our custodial divisions
needing manuscripts or prints

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.650
and photographs where very
often the book, the speaker,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.670
the author has done
their work in the Library

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.380
of Congress' collections.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.240
Other talks, such as the one today,
have a very obvious connection

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.800
with the library in
a functional way.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.330
Often, also, we work with the
Folk Life Center or others

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.350
on special projects that
have been of interest

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.650
to the Center for The Book.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.310
One example that comes to
mind was the WPA arts projects

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.020
and the various books that
have come out relating

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.080
to the WPA arts projects.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.060
These programs are all filmed for
the Library of Congress' website.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.440
So I ask you to turn off
all things electronic.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.660 position:56%
The format will be a presentation by
our speaker, who will be introduced

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.890
by a distinguished member of the
congressional research staff.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.950
He will speak for 30 to 40 minutes.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.960
We'll have a chance for
questions and answers.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.670
And we'll have a book signing here
in the back of the room that needs

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.980
to start no later than 1:00.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.650
And, of course, our book
today is Underdog Politics.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.870
Our author is Matt Green.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.280
I want to say a couple of
things about the Center

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.900
for The Book, a couple more things.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.260
The schedule of future talks
is on the back, in the back.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.070
We also have an evaluation
form, which really focuses

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.280
on how you learned
about the program.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.290
So we're trying to coordinate
with the other Library

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.940
of Congress programs,
including author programs,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.560
to learn more about
how that happened.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.250
Finally, I would like to
introduce Walter Oleszek,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.370
who is from the Congressional
Research Service.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.530
Walter is a senior specialist,
he said, in congress in general.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.720
He's a generalist who's
been at the Library

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.830
of Congress for a number of years.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.550
We actually have rediscovered
our long friendship.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.550
I started in the Congressional
Research Service my first two years

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.130
at the library between 1966 and
1968, beating Walter by two years.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.030
But I left CRS, then called
Legislative Reference Service

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.420
in 1968, the year that
Walter arrived.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.390
But we had overlap, and we've
said hello to each other

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.820
and known each other
in an informal way

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.670
for what amounts to
be several decades.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.490
So it's a special pleasure
to introduce Walter,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.650
who will carry on with our program.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.510
Let's give Walter a hand.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.920
&gt;&gt; Walter Oleszek: Well thank you,
John, for that kind introduction.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.270
You know I've got to thank John
not only personally, but of course,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.220
the Center for The Book which
sponsors these kinds of programs,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.550 position:56%
which is really a tremendous
educative event for all LC employees

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.170
who are interested in
attending these kinds of forums.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.120
Now we're going to have an
intellectual treat today,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.590 position:56%
a feast over this lunch hour because
we have Professor Matthew Green

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.910
with us, who as we all
know will talk about,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.270 position:56%
when he gets the podium momentarily,
about underdog politics.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.620
Just a little about Matt is
he's a PhD from Yale University.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.780
He's a very busy and active
researcher at Catholic University

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.840
where he's been since he
started his academic career.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.180
He is, in terms of
business, I would commend

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.600
that you go look at his website.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.690
Because his website lists his
numerous publications, you know,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.220
all of his articles,
convention papers, blogs,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.860
CSPAN interviews, and it goes on.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.760 position:56%
So he's going to expand our
horizons in a lot of ways by talking

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.940
about this issue of
underdog politics.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.680
Now I also want to highlight

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.980
that Matt has published
two very important books

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.450
on the United States House, one
in 2010, and that was The Speaker

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.170 position:56%
of the House, a Study in Leadership.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.310
And, of course, now five years
later we have Underdog Politics.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.980
It's an interested
title because generally,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.150
that's the way the
minority party often feels.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.920 position:56%
That it is the underdog in the House
of Representatives particularly.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.810
It varies over time,
but I'm fond of a quote

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.770
by former Speaker Thomas
[inaudible] Reed of Maine

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.510
in the late 19th century
when he was speaker.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.350
And he had a comment that
sometimes resonates even today.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.870
And he said that the job of
the minority party is two-fold.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.440
Number one, make a quorum.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.370
Number two, draw your pay.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.850
And the rest of your time, leave
governance to the majority party,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.970
which happened to be the
Republicans at that time.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.800
So without further ado,
because time is limited,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.090
let me now welcome Matt Green
to the podium where he'll speak

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.920 position:56%
for whatever length of time he needs
to run through the PowerPoints.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.220
And then take Q&amp;A.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.520
And then we'll have to break.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.510
So with that, Professor Green.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:52.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.120
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Thank you
Walter for that kind introduction.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.100
I have many people to
thank for being here.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.970
I want to thank Mr. Cole
for having me come to speak

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.930
to you today about my book.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.910
I also, in addition to
this book being relevant

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.210
because it's about Congress.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.000
Can people hear me, or
should I talk in the mike?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.300
The mike. Mike better?

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.070
Okay. In addition to the
book being about Congress,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.050
I also took advantage of the
Library of Congress and did some

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.370
of the research for
this book at the Library

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.750
of Congress' various
collections, newspaper collections

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.050
and also some congressional
record analysis.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.980
And then in addition to that, in a
very early stage of this project,

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.740
Colleen Shogan invited me to
present a portion of my research

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.290
to the Government and
Finance Division of CRS,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.280
which was extremely helpful
and got a lot of excellent

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.470
and helpful feedback and advice
and suggestions for the project.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.030
And actually it was there that
someone from CRS, Jim Saturno,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.110
suggested why don't
you make this a book.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.250
And I hadn't thought about that.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.690
I just thought this was going
to be a little fun project.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.990
And I thought, you know,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.910
that actually would be
quite a lot of fun to do.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.280
And so I ended up several years
later publishing this book.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.080
So I have Mr. Saturno to thank
and also the folks at CRS

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.090
and the Library of Congress.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.790
So let me start by, to
introduce this subject,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.590
talk about three policy
changes of varying significance

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.190
that have happened in the last
30 years in the United States.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:26.930
The first is the passage
of the 1981 budget proposal

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.740
by President Ronald Reagan,
which dramatically reduced taxes.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.290
The second is the closure of
hundreds of military bases

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.600
across the United States in
the last several decades.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.950
And the third is the fact, this
is a little bit more minor,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.360
that the House of Representatives
starts each day

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.680
with the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.880
Now the reason why I
start with these three is

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.210
because they have something
in common.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.720
It's not that they have
a president behind them.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.020
It's not that a majority party

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.930
in the House and/or
Senate were behind them.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.580
But that they took place in
part because of the initiatives

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.670
and efforts of members
of the minority party

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.180
of the House of Representatives.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:09.350 position:56%
The Reagan budget got its start with
tax reduction proposal introduced

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.710
by then Congressman Jack Kemp, a
Republican from New York who was

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.520
in the minority, along with
Senator Roth from Delaware.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.530 position:56%
BRAC got its start with an amendment
that was proposed by then minority,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.870
member of the minority
Dick Armey of Texas.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:29.470 position:56%
And the Pledge of Allegiance got its
start during the 1988 presidential

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:34.460
campaign when the issue of the
constitutionality of the Pledge

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.040
of Allegiance became an issue with,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.490
there was a bill the
Dukakis had vetoed.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.420
So Bush was saying
what's your problem

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.720
with the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.840 position:56%
So House Republicans started
saying, we should require the Pledge

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.240
of Allegiance when the House meets.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.340
And Democrats tried to sort of
hold them off but ultimately agreed

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.120
to do it at least informally.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.840
So these are examples of ways
in which we had policy changes

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.120
or procedural changes
because of the minority party

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.810
in the House of Representatives.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.720
Now I think this is important
for a number of reasons.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.350
One is that the conventional
wisdom is that the minority party

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.240
in the House doesn't really matter.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.170
If you have to be in the minority,
it's the Senate where you want

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.150
to be, not the House
of Representatives.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.110
It's a majoritarian institution.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.500
The majority sets the rules.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.410
And the majority sets
the agenda, etcetera.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.120
The other thing too, which is what
got me interested in this as well,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.700
is not just contributions to
policy and procedure by members

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.570
of the minority, but that even when
the minority party doesn't seem

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.670
to have much influence,
it still is active.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.960
It doesn't give up.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.740
And that got me thinking about why
minority parties do what they do.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.060
There were a couple actually
specific incidences in recent years

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.760
that piqued my curiosity.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.500
One was the frequent use by the
minority Democrats in the 1990s

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.890
and early 2000s of procedural
motions, particularly the motion

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.220
to rise and the motion to adjourn,
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.360
Which slow things down, but
they're not exactly a filibuster.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.430
So I started thinking, why would
a minority be doing these things,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.290
just to cause a little bit
of difficulty I suppose.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.810
And the other was in 2008
I was fortunate enough

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.240
to bring my then three-month
old daughter to the House floor

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.710 position:56%
in the summer of 2008 when the House
Republicans were staging this sort

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.380
of mock session talking
about oil prices.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.030
And it was not televised.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.500
And it was sort of fun to watch.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.050
But I thought, now why are
these folks doing this?

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.550
It's not on TV.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.300
Why would they stay here instead
of go home for the summer and talk

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.520
to a chamber full of tourists,
if anyone, about oil prices?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.620
So that got me thinking about
the minority party some more.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.720
And I started to do more research

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.260
and ultimately ended
up with this book.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.470
So the book addresses, or at
least raises four questions.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.280
The first is why doe the
House minority party,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.270
or what does the minority
party do, right?

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.950
There are categories of
activities that they do.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.470
The second is why.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.820
Why do they do the
things that they do?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.220
The third is have the things that
the minority party, does the things

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.650
that they do, has it
changed over time?

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:14.260
And the fourth is whether it has
any effects on politics or policy.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.830
Now I am not going to answer
all four questions in my talk.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.390
Some of those are answered in
the book, and in the interest

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.300
of time I don't want
to go through each.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.770
I should also, as a caveat,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.330
mention the last question
is the hardest to answer.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.660
And in the book I suggest an
answer to it, and it may vary

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.520
by the tactic that's used.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.510
But I don't have a
definitive answer.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.380
It's very hard to draw
causal connections

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.250
between the things a
party does in the minority

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.480
and the political outcomes
that they may be seeking.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.900 position:56%
Alright, well let me start actually,
and I'll just go back just a second,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.410
the order in which I'm going
to tackle these questions.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.000
I'm going to start with number two,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.680
talk about why the minority
party does what it does.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.150
Then I'll talk about what
the minority party does.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.720
And I'll give some examples.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.020
The book is chocked full of
these things that they do.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.020
And I'm not going to
talk about all of them.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.600
And then I will, in doing so,
talk a little bit about four

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.490
and maybe touch on three at
the end, time permitting.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.010
And I should mention one other
thing too about the presentation.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.580
You're going to see some graphs.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.300
You're going to see some tables.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.320
But this book is I would
say relatively unusual

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.340
for a political science book,
particularly about Congress.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.440
There's no formal models,
no mathematical models.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.210
There's not a single regression
equation in it anywhere.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:34.880
My purpose was to make it
readable and interesting.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.560
And, you know, so I
hope I succeeded.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.780
Okay. So let me start by talking
about what the minority party,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.060
why the minority party
does what it does.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.840
Well the obvious and most important
thing to a minority party is

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.190
to not be a minority anymore.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.720
It is not fun to be in the minority
in the House of Representatives.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.310
So their primary goal is to
be a majority, to win seats,

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.780
to win seats from the majority
and to be a majority party again.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.980
Now, the conventional
wisdom would stop there.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.080
That's what the minority
cares about.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.540
But what I argue in the book
is that that's incomplete.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.000
That doesn't help us
explain things that they do.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.790
They may be out of the public eye,
or they are relevant to voters.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.090
Other things going on there.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.680
So there's three other
important collective goals

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.010
to the minority party I argue.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.600
The second is a policy.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.100
Because even though
they're in the minority,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.300
members of the minority
party are law makers.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.730
They want to make the law.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.730
They want to influence legislation.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.880
And so to the extent that they
can do that, it's important

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.940
to the party collectively.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.270
The third important goal of the
minority party is the protection

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.130
of its procedural rights.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.330
Now for the most part, these
rights are a necessary precondition

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.630
to do other things.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.850
You've got to have
certain powers in order

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.050
to influence policy for instance.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.770
But I argue that these
rights are also important

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.650
to the minority in
and of themselves.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.240
They're especially sensitive to it

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.910
because they have fewer
rights under the rules.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.460
And so they want to protect the
prerogatives that they have.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.770
And they can get quite
passionate about it if they feel

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.160 position:56%
that those rights are being violated
or their powers are being mitigated.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.940
And the fourth thing that matters

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.520
to the minority is a
successful presidential party.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.140
Now this matters to the
majority party too, of course.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.570
But especially to the
minority because you want

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.100
to have some allies somewhere
in the national government

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.070
who can help you, can carry
out your policy goals.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.060
If you are in the so-called deep
minority, so you don't have,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.490
your party does not have the
Senate or the White House,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.500
then you are truly powerless.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.460
So I argue these are four very
important things to the minority.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.950 position:56%
Now an important thing to note here,
these aren't all equally important.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.930
Most of the time this
is in the order

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.830
in which they matter
to a minority party.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.990
But it will also vary
by circumstances.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.090
So in the 1970s, for instance,
many House Republicans saw no way

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.390
to get into the majority.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.270
They just could not
see a way to do it.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.480
So for many of them, the second
goal was the primary goal.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.940 position:56%
Well if we can't win back the House,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.300
let's at least try
to influence policy.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.550
And this became a major conflict
when Newt Gingrich was elected

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.340
to the House because he was
trying to convince the party

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.420
that majority status should
be number one versus others

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.390 position:56%
who were there saying, that's silly.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.300
We should be number two.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.010
One other thing I want to note
before I talk about some things

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.120
in particular that the
minority party does.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.380
That table, it's sort of a,
kind of what you might call

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.690
in political science a
rational choice approach.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.650
So the idea is that the
party is calculating.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.380
They think about what
matters most to them.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.450 position:56%
And they figure out how to get them.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.460
Well something that's important
that I discovered in my interviews

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.970
that I did for this book
and other research is

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.690
that that's a little simplistic.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.360
That other things matter
as the minority too.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.690
And I open the book
with these two quotes.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.710
And I highlight two key words there

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.490
to underscore an important common
sense that the minority party has.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.880
Frustration and freedom.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.180
So on the one hand it's very
frustrating to be in the minority

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.470
and to lose over and
over and over again.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.220
On the other hand, you
have no obligations.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.520
You're not governing.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.820
You can do what you like.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.590
And so because these are two
important characteristics of life

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.390
in the minority, there's
some consequences

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.990
to how a minority party behaves.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.050 position:56%
Morale. Morale is very hard to keep.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.200
It's very hard to keep good morale
when you're in the minority.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.350
And it's a constant struggle
for leaders to keep the morale

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.660
of their fellow partisans high.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.880
If you can't, they may leave.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.380
They may not cooperate or work with
the party on things that they need.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.510
So this is often a sort
of an underlying theme

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.700
of minority party politics is
keeping people's morale high.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.040
Emotion also matters.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.230
Sometimes the majority does
something that's so infuriating

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.340
to the minority that they
just do something, alright.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.980
They stage a protest,
or they try something.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.320
More out of anger and
frustration than out

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.500
of a calculate analysis
of what will work.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.120
And then also action
is its own reward.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.600
A couple of folks I talked
to said that, you know,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.610
leaders felt the need
to do something.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.970
You got to show the troops
that you're doing something,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.330
even if it's not going
to bring you back

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.170
into the majority any time soon.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.300
And that can be inherently
rewarding,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.600 position:56%
and there are certainly some members

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.210
of the minority who
just like the fight.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.060
They just enjoy the
battle for its own sake.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.630
And then uncertainty.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.930
So there's a lot of uncertainty.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.110
Sometimes the people in the
minority just try things.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.600
They don't know if it's
going to work or not.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.760
If it doesn't, it probably
won't make a difference.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.920
So these are four important
themes of the book,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.500
or sort of late motifs of the book.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.810
Okay, what I'd like to
do now is talk about each

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.010
of these four categories of tactics
that the minority party uses.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.710
Now here on the slide I
show all of the things

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.460
that I discuss under each headline.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.270
I'm not going to talk about all
of those in my presentation.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.850
I'm going to highlight
one as an example for each

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.430
of these four categories.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.400
So electioneering, messaging,
obstructing and legislating.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.790
Let me start with electioneering.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.080
And the example I want to give is
the use, by really both parties,

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.930
of a technique to identify
strong candidates and help them

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.280
with training and fundraising.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.880
So this is one way
a minority can try

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.390
to get back the majority
is find people running,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.320
particularly if they're
running against incumbents

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.070
in the other party and
say, you're promising.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.670
We're going to help you raise
more money and help you succeed.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.350
So these are, for instance,
the red to blue program

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.880
that the Democrats
started in the early 2000s.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.730
And the young guns program the
Republicans started in 2010.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.190
And they've been fairly successful.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.760 position:56%
So, you know, Kirsten Gillibrand was
elected as a red to blue in 2006.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.310
Allen West from Florida was
elected in the young guns program.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.650
But what I want to talk about is
not whether it led to Democrats

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.640
or Republicans winning
but a more immediate goal.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.220
Did it actually help these
candidates raise more money?

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.850
Was it successful?

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.820
So let me just show
one example of this.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.970
I've got more examples in the book.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.850
This is early 2006.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.500
This is the year the
Democrats retake the House.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.430
And the red to blue program is
targeting a number of Democrats

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.730
that they find promising.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.350
So what I have here on the table,
the blue are Democrats running

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.160
who get put into or accepted
into the red to blue program.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.380
And the first set of bars
are before they are put

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.680
in the program or allowed in.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.820
And then the second
set are afterwards.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.710
And I compare each of those
red to blue candidates

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.590
with another Democrat running from
a similar district who has showed

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.160
at least some degree
of fundraising acumen.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.870
So not extremely minor
candidates but fairly strong ones.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.190
The first thing to see, of course,
is that you don't get into the red

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.280
to blue program unless you're
already good at raising money.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.050
That shouldn't be a surprise.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.760
But, what I show here, and I also
show elsewhere in the book is

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.110
that after they're in one of
these programs like red to blue,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.180
these candidates do better
at raising money than those

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.000
who are not in the program.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.240
In this case, the red to
blue candidates raised

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.160
about $120,000 collectively over
and above what they had raised

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.890
in the first quarter of 2006,
whereas the matched pairs,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.200
the ones in red, only raised
about half that much, 60,000.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.740
So it's an example of ways in
which the minority party tries

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.040
to win seats.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.810
And of course, again, the
majority party does this

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.410
as well you should know.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.730
Alright, next I want to
talk about messaging.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.410
Messaging is something that you
see all the time in Congress.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.800
And it's something that is
particularly emphasized,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.760
or at least has been
recently by minority parties.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.530 position:56%
So John Boehner, for instance, after
Republicans lost the house in 2006,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.890
was quoted as saying, you know,

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.050
we have to forget that
we're legislators.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.340
But we can be communicators.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.170
That's what we have to do.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.470
And both parties when they're

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.480
in the minority have emphasized
communication and messaging.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.050
So there's all kinds of ways that
you can get your message out.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.280
And what I want to talk about today
is just one kind of messaging tool

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.350 position:56%
which are one-minute floor speeches.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.050
So this is at the beginning
of each session when a number

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.900 position:56%
of members prepared to give their
speeches, they ask unanimous consent

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.880
to address the floor for one
minute, and they can talk

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.090
about really whatever they want.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.390
Although, as I discuss in the book,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.980
it's becoming increasingly the
party agenda what they talk about.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.150
So I usually, I like to have one
Democrat and one Republican here,

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.450
but I couldn't help myself.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.250
I had to put Jim Traficant
on this because he was

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.510
such a colorful speaker
in his one minute,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.240
both in them majority
and in the minority.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.130
So what I do in the book
is I look at whether

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.010
or not these things might
influence public opinion.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.850 position:56%
I mean messaging can have all kinds
of effects that are hard to measure.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:58.380
But one immediate possible effect
would be does it move the public

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.190
in the direction that
the party wants it to?

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.220
So I looked at, there's so
many of these one minutes,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.520
and I could not code them all.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.550
So I took samples every five
years and coded them for content.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.490 position:56%
And then I'll talk about a case
study involving really a sort of use

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.110
of these and whether
it moves the public

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.640
in the direction that
the party wanted.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.070
So this is a chart that shows
the percent of one minute given

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.890
by the minority and majority party
that talked about the president

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.750
or the presidential candidate.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.570
The circles are the majority party.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.330
The squares are the minority party.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.490
In addition, if they're hollow,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.330
it means that the party does
not control the White House.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.800
So it's the opposite party
that's in the White House.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.450
And what I found, I sort of thought
well maybe the minority would be

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.200
biased towards the president
or something like that.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.780
What I actually found is both
parties care about the president,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.070
but really only when the
president is of the opposite party.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.860
That's when you see
a larger percentage

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.410
of their one minutes
talking about the president.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.390
So, for instance, in 1990, for
example, I want to say 1985.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.160
It doesn't really matter,
1985, the Republicans are

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.480
in the minority, and
Reagan is president.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.470
But it's the majority
party, Democrats,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.480
that are talking about
the president.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.460
So there's a way in which both
parties sort of see their roles

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.340
as oppositional in their messaging
with respect to the president,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.490
depending on who that president is.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.200
There is, however, a
definite difference

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.520
between the majority/minority
party on partisanship.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.890
The majority tends to talk more
about party and partisanship

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.160
than the majority party does.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.200
And, and here's where one of those
other collectively goals comes

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.500
into play.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.470
The minority talks a
lot more about procedure

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.220
than the majority does
in their one minute.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.110
Now they don't talk
that much about it.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.080
No more than about 5 1/2 % of their
one minutes are on that subject.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.340
But that's something that
also matters to the minority.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.170
It's procedure and how
the House is working.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.860
And most of these speeches
are, unsurprisingly,

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.630
complaining about procedure

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.150
and the way it's being
misused by the majority party.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.110
So do these have any effects?

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.540
Well, as I said, what I
do in the book is I look

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.670
at the relationship
with public opinion.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.810
So let me give a case study
here of a use of one minutes

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:17.750
by House Republicans in
mid-2009, July, 2009.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.320
The Republicans decide their
big theme is going to be jobs.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.520
So they have everybody go to the
floor and give one minute speeches

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.600
and use the same phrase,
where are the jobs?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.760
They repeat that over
and over and over.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.060
Where are the jobs?

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.360
Where are the jobs?

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.240
That's in every one-minute
speech practically.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.850 position:56%
So there's a Republican polling firm
that asked the question of folks,

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.970
what matters most to
you when you're thinking

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.270
about your vote for Congress?

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.340
And they asked this
question in early June, 2009.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.550
And they found out 37% that
responded said the economy.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.310
And 5% said jobs.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.030
After Boehner had the, Majority
Leader Boehner, another Republican,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.640
had done this where are the jobs,
campaigned the same polling firm,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.710
asked the same question,
and this was the result.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:13.120
Yeah. Exact same percentage
on the economy and 1% increase

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.240
in those same jobs, which of course
is well within the margin of error.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.160
And I discuss in the
book other cases

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.780
in which you don't see the
public moving as a result

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.080
of these kinds of messaging.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.950
Now does that mean
messaging doesn't work?

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.410
Not necessarily.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.370
It could have longer term effects.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.840
It could also do some of the
things that I talked about earlier.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.500
It could boost morale for the
party, make some members feel

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.050
like they're doing something to try
to get out of the minority status.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.560
But if the goal is to move
the needle of the public,

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.420
public opinion, in one
direction, it doesn't seem

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.720
to have much of an effect.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.330
Okay, third category of tactics
is delaying and obstructing.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.760
This is one that I,
this is a chapter

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.590
that I particularly enjoyed
writing because it just strikes me

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.070
as peculiar to think about
the minority in the House

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.830
as trying to delay and obstruct.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.130
This is not the Senate.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.710
They don't have a filibuster.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.920
So what kinds of things can
they do to slow things down?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.670
There are things, in fact, that
they can do to slow things down.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.840
And I talk in the book about
some notorious examples

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.890
which I can discuss in Q&amp;A later.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:19.870
One of my favorites
involved Don Rumsfeld in 1968

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.820
and something that he led.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.320
But, I'm going to talk
instead today about motions

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.230
to rise and motions to adjourn.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:32.740
So these are procedural motions
in the House of Representatives.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.430
The motion to adjourn is a motion

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.420
to basically end the session,
to be done for the day.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.880
Motion to rise is if the House
is meeting and the committee

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.270
as a whole to consider amendments.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.870
And then you rise, this would be to
end that portion of the discussion

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.710
and leave the committee as a whole.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.700
So I ask two questions in the book.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.910
One is, why are they being done?

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.590
And second of all, do
they yield results.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.060
So let me just first show a chart
demonstrating how often these

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.360
are done.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.660
You can see they were very rare.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.820
These were done by, this is
minority party motions to rise

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.290
and adjourn I should say.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:07.590
Very, very rare.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.720
Became more popular in the early
90s, really took off a couple

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.340
of key Congresses,
and it sort of died

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.500
down again in terms of popularity.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.750
These are useful for slowing
things done, not a whole lot

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.660
because you do one,
you have a roll call.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.220
That takes 15 minutes.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.700
But sometimes the minority
does them over and over

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.550
and over and over and over again.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.230
That can slow things
down considerably.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.730
So what I did for these motions
is I looked to see if the member

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.910
of Congress who offered
them gave an explanation.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.600
So went to the floor and said,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.420
you know I'm really mad you
wouldn't let me offer my amendment.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.090
I move we adjourn.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.340
Or, it's ridiculous we're
debating gun control.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.920
We should be debating
something else.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.920
I move that the committee rise.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.430
Now only about half of these
motions is there an explanation.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.890
But of those half,
this is the percentage

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.360
that fall into each category.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.730
I categorized them based on
the general concern, complaint,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.330
comment that was being made.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.060
And just the takeaway point
from this is that some of these,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.620
yeah they could be explained by the
minority caring about reelection,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.040
because if you can't
offer your amendment

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.130 position:56%
because of an unfair floor rule,
then you can't get your message out.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.900
You can't change a bill the way
you want, so also policy concerns.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.510
But some of these things
are very arcane, you know,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.710
violation of regular order.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.030
Some other abusive power.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.370
And I would hear quote
Robert Michael,

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:35.040
former Republican minority
leader who called of these kinds

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.430 position:56%
of debates MEGO, my eyes glaze over.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.100
And this is boring
stuff for most people.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.980
They don't care about
motions to, they don't care

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.200 position:56%
about the restrictiveness of a rule.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.500
So here's where it's important

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.510
to understand the minority
caring about how it's treated.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.810
About its procedural rights.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.280
And here's something that I
found interesting that it's hard

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.990
to necessarily trace the causal
connection that these motions

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.250 position:56%
to rise are generally used, and then
this change happened as a result.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.410
But nonetheless, a good percentage
of these were then followed

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.250
by some kind of change,
either a bill being changed

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.430
or amendments being allowed,
or the agenda being altered,

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.060
to help the minority party.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.600
So this at least suggests
that these can effective.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.320
Not in the majority of times,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.080
but they can be effective
in helping the minority.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:29.670 position:56%
Alright, the last subject that I
want to talk about, or last category

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.020
of tactics, is legislating.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.680
So this is one in which I actually
originally wasn't, I wasn't going

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.470
to have this in the book.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.530
I thought, well the minority
doesn't really legislate that much.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.570
But the reviewer said you've
got to talk about legislating.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.670
Surely that, it's Congress,
right, okay.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.560
So I did. So I added a
chapter about legislating.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.350
And I look at different ways
the minority can legislate.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.390
Can influence legislation.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:58.460 position:56%
Yes the minority is outnumbered, but
that doesn't mean that it can't win.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.330
The most common way of measuring if
a minority wins in a floor vote is

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.970
through what's called
a majority roll.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.540
That's if a majority,
the majority party,

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.880
votes against something,
but it still passes.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.680
We colloquially call this a
violation of the Hastert Rule.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.010
And we've seen that
violation a number of times,

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.350
so it's not technically
a rule, more of a norm.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.030
So we've seen that this can happen,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.480
and it can happen on
really big bills.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.900
But a lot of scholars say, well
this doesn't happen that much.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.020
So really minority doesn't
have that much influence.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.780
One of the things that I argue in
the book is, besides these happen

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.480
on pretty important things,

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.640
is that there are other
ways the minority wins

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.680
on floor votes besides these rolls.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.700
So this chart shows
three kinds of votes.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.990
The blue line shows the percentage
of votes on final passage

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.650
in which the majority was rolled,
a violation of the Hastert Rule.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.670
So you can see it doesn't
happen very often.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.850
However, if you include
amendments, that's the red line,

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.840
it does happen more often.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.760
And then if you look at the times

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.520
that the majority either
loses a bill it wants to pass,

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.570
or a bill passes that
it wants to lose.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.100
In other words, the majority
votes for it, but it fails.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.960
The majority votes
against it, or it succeeds.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.450
You see even more frequently
that happens.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.180
It's still not that much.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.900
I mean it's still under 20%.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.550
The point is that the minority
party can win floor votes,

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.570
and does win floor votes.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.360
I would note on this chart

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.200
that there might be a slight
downward trend going on there.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.340
And that's an important
theme of the book.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.850 position:56%
One of the things that I should have
mentioned is that this is talking

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.720
about the minority party, but
I take a historical approach.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.780
So I start from 1970 and
go through 2010, 2012.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.850
And so part of the book is about
how things have changed over time.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.230
So let me talk about
that in just a sec.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.080
This chart, this slide just
summarizes what I said.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.700
The minority party cares
about more than just power.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.850
And its actions, things it does
are at times associate success.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.530
Not always, but at times.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.990
But things have changed.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.290
No doubt about it.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:04.940
In 1970 the minority party had
more opportunities to legislate.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.230
Most, or a majority of
floor rules for the rules

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.420
for considering bills were
open, or largely open,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.580
so that you could offer amendments.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.830 position:56%
There was more of a focus on
legislating arguably than messaging.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.570
What's happened is, for a number
of reasons I discuss in the book,

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.510 position:56%
opportunities for the minority party
to legislate directly have shrunk.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:28.180
And so, if you think about a
stream and block that stream,

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.430
the water still has
to flow somewhere.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.140 position:56%
So the minority party either finds
other ways to influence legislation,

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.020
or it finds other avenues for,
or outlets for its energy.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.440
And one of the biggest
ones is messaging.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.030
Messaging is very important.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.620 position:56%
So now amendments aren't necessarily
offered to influence a bill

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.240
but rather to send a message.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.180
Roy Blunt, who is, when he was
in the House of Representatives,

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.020
after the 2006 elections and the
Republicans were in the minority,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.660
he wrote a memo to
Republicans saying look,

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.010
we need to offer key amendments
or motions to recommit,

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.680
which is the guaranteed
amendment to the minority party,

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.360
that will either win, they'll pass,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.550
or they'll make Nancy Pelosi
and Democrats look bad.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.340
Either way, we win, right.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.130
So messaging becomes central
to what the minority party does

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.260
with the more classic legislative
tools that are at its disposal.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.560
And at the end of the book I talk

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.860
about whether I think
that's good or bad.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.620
It's my chance to get on the
soapbox and give my two cents.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.590
But I'll refrain from doing that,
not unless people want me to.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.890
So that's the book, and I'm happy

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.510
to answer any questions
that you may have.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.160
Yes. Rochelle.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.910
&gt;&gt; This might be a little off-base,
but could you make an argument

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:53.090
that in this part of Congress,
the majority party is acting

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.710
as if it almost were
still in the minority.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.870
That because it's so splintered,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.730
it's having difficulty
moving its agenda.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.850
And especially how it
deals with the White House.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.200
That it acts as if it
were in the minority.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.490
And its basic tactic
is one of obstruction.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:13.790
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: I'm glad
that you mentioned that.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.090
Because I think you're right.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.880
I think there's two
specific aspects to that.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.500 position:56%
So part of it is about the divisions
within the Republican party.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.370
And as I discuss in the book, unity
for a minority is really important.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.370
Especially relative
to the majority party.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.000
Because if they're more unified,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.380
they can really put the
majority party on the spot.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.580
If you imagine the House
Democrats being more divided

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.510
than House Republicans, then
perhaps, you know, Boehner

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.940
and now Ryan would have
an easier time of it.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.610
But because the Democrats
stay unified,

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.350
it really forces the
Republicans to have to deal

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.690
with the conservative
wing of their party.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.810
It makes it difficult
for them to govern.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.170
Now whether they're acting
as a minority in that respect

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.530
or just a very frustrated
majority, I'm not sure,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.340
but unity is an important
theme for a minority.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.640
They've got to stay unified.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.550
You see Nancy Pelosi say
that, John Boehner say

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.850 position:56%
that when they were in the minority.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.750
You've got to be unified to
exploit those opportunities.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.180
But the other thing you mention
about their strategic approach

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.230
to Obama is a theme that
I touch upon in the book,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.890
probably not as much as I should,
which is that a party can be

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.190
in the majority but still act
like they're in the minority.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.740
And likewise, a party can be
in the minority but still act

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.340
like they're in the majority.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.870
So some of the interviews I did
for the book were with Democrats

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.980
who had been in the House after
1994, and they were frustrated

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.650
that no one there, almost without
an exception, knew what it was

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.950
like to be in the minority.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.440
So they were saying,
well we'll just work

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.990
with Gingrich, and we'll figure.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.870
And their leaders said
no, we can't do that.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.520
We're not legislators anymore.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.090
We're not going to get anything.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.200
Particularly with Gingrich
and the leadership.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.160
So we have to be more oppositional.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.470
And I've heard the same
argument with Republicans,

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.050
that even though they're in the
majority, they were in the minority

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:00.830
for so long that there's still
legacy, there's still a legacy

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:05.260
from that, you know, from 30
years ago now, 20 years ago.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.530
Still acting as if they need to
message and they need to oppose,

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.000
and supposed to legislate.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.230
So there is a way in which how
many seats you have is not,

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.980
it's necessary, but not
sufficient condition

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.480
to having the mentality you need.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.210
Yes sir.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:29.090
&gt;&gt; I'm particularly struck by your
findings on one minute speeches.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:37.150
I'm going to keep that in mind
the next time my boss asks me

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.150
to write one.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:51.500
But, I was wondering, in which way
is the minority party has been most

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.110
effective at leveraging the
[inaudible] the narrative.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.900
Where is the correlation
in the various things?

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.410
Whether it's one minutes
or special orders

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.890
or anything else that [inaudible].

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.450
&gt;&gt; Matt, could you
repeat the question?

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.750
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Yes, right.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.540
So the question is, did I find
any examples or incidences

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.550
in which messaging in
general was most effective.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.850
Is that correct?

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.150
Well the short answer is in the
contemporary congress, not many.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.450
The best examples that I
could find are from times

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.750
when new messaging tactics
were first developed.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.330
So the use of one minutes in a
partisan fashion, which really came

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.920
about in the late 70s,
Republicans started doing it.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.220
That really, really, Democrats
really didn't know what

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.520
to do about that at first.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.820
And said why are you so
angry at us and talking

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.120
about Ronald Reagan all the time?

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.410
And then again, Republicans
in the 1993, 94,

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.460
they were still in the minority.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.940
They had developed, Robert
Michael had developed this in part

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.730
because he was concerned
about Newt Gingrich possibly,

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.030
you know, being so assertive.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.800
He wanted to show he was
also a leader of the party.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.980
So he set up a team of Republicans
who would use one minutes.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.320
But they used them
in a different way.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:51.080
They did sort of top ten
lists and catchy song tunes.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.670 position:56%
And that got the press' attention
more than the previous use had been.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.990
So there's a way in
which now it's hard

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:03.140
to see standard messaging
tactics having much of an effect,

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.960
or at least getting much attention.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.130
But as I argue in the book,
innovation and, well innovation,

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.850
coming up with new ideas,
new ways of doing things,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.150
can be more effective, at
least in the short run.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.450
Yes.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.750
&gt;&gt; Did you look at
the committee process

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.750
and the minority's [inaudible].

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.000
&gt;&gt; Repeat again.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.300
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Yes.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.570
Did I look at committees in
the book, and the answer is no.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.780
I, it was really about, it
was really sort of the scope.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.750
I had to limit it at some point,
which is a shame because I think

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.540
that itself could be
a whole other book.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.610
There are, first of
all on the one hand,

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.210
ways in which minority party
members can have more influence

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.660 position:56%
in a committee, depending on who the
chair is and the balance of power

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.970
and what the issues are,
if it's transportation

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.680
versus let's say, judiciary.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.320
At the same time, some of the best
examples I found of obstruction

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.340 position:56%
and messaging were in committees,
which I just didn't use in the book.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.930
But so in some ways,
committees can be a model

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.610
for more collaborative
governance and less partisanship.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:09.000
On the other hand, they
can be just a microcosm

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.600
of the way the House
is as a whole operates.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.560
But maybe that will
be my next project.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.860
Yeah.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.010
&gt;&gt; I can think of a lot of things
to say, which is a compliment.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:24.650
But just to limit myself to
maybe one thing that's more

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.950
of a comment than a question.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:34.180
Number one, I think that
you, in stating what's,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.070
we talk about obstruction by
means other than filibustering,

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.140
and I think that I will
caution [inaudible],

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.260
any use of the word filibustering

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.250
and it would make it essentially
synonymous with obstruction.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.930
And it would not include
only extended debate,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.460 position:56%
which the possibilities of which are
limited by the rules of the House.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.700
And there are other
uses of the term too.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.240
So, I wouldn't even have made
the remark about whether,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.260
what they do [inaudible]
filibustering or not.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.950
But the point about it being
obstruction stands on its own.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:13.680
More as a query, I
was a little surprised

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.700
that in discussing
messaging tactics,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.560
you didn't include
amendment as a possibility.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.270
Certainly, putting up an
amendment, you did talk about that

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.810
in effect later on in terms of,
well we'll put up this proposition

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:36.860
that you're either going to have
to vote in favor of or look bad.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.160
That's essentially the message,

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.900
the kind of activity
I would have thought.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.230
So it doesn't even come
under that category or fall

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.530
under that class as well.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.830
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Right.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.640
So I had to be, first of all, the
first point is very well taken.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.730
And I guess I used the word
filibustering because that is sort

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.250
of the understand, oh it's
the Senate doing [inaudible].

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.630
But obviously, it's
more than just that.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:59.320
I appreciate that point
of clarification.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.290
With regards to amendments
as messaging, yes.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.910
I mean I talk about
that in the book.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.180
But I had to be careful in
creating these categories

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.160
between the vehicle,
the actual thing, right.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.320
Is it an amendment or is it
a speech, and its intent.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.500
So if I put amendments
into messaging,

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.480
then that I was worried
would confuse things.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.260
Because that's not the same thing
as giving a one-minute speech,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.590
which is clearly messaging.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.930
Or press conferences,
which I also talk about.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.300
But I do discuss that in the book
and in the legislating chapter,

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.890
as well as in the conclusion,
that these legislating tools,

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:36.540
whether it's amendments, motions
to recommit, discharge petitions.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.540
These have become effectively
messaging tools.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.630
So actually, for instance, I
think it was in the 2008, 2007,

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:48.610
2008 Republicans wanted
a bill to be considered

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.040
that would have eased
regulations on oil drilling.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.490
And they did at least two or three,
maybe four discharge petitions

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.370
on the same bill basically.

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:00.050
What they were doing was saying,
this is how much we care about it,

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.790
and those Democrats
are bottling it up.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.210
That's a messaging tool, right.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.440
So I'm glad you raised that.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.970
But I did want to distinguish

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.390
that so it didn't get
confusing for the reader.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.690
Yes sir.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:16.870
&gt;&gt; How prevalent was the Hastert
Rule philosophy before Hastert.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:23.110
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: So before
Hastert, there was an understanding

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:28.900
that you avoided bringing bills
to the floor that would pass

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.030
because of the minority party.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.490
But it was never discussed
as an actual rule.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:39.420 position:56%
And so before Hastert, and certainly
before Gingrich, there were speakers

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.520
who did quote/unquote
violate the Hastert Rule.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.170
Tom Foley did it, for instance,

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:45.720
with the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.860
The majority of Democrats voted
against it, but it still passed.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:55.960
And it was seen then as some kind
of vote of no confidence, right.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.510
You did it sparingly.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.650
But if it was important to you
or to the party or the country

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.190
or the president, then you would do
it, and it was sort of understood.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.760
I think what's interesting now
that not only is it called a rule,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.430
which is somewhat confusing
to people,

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.760
but that some Republicans have
actually wanted to make it a rule

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.720
and change the House Republican
rules so that you can't do that.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.890
But I think we've seen in
recent years if you do that,

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.150
that really ties the
hands of party leaders.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.430
Sometimes you just got
to get something passed.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.110
And you know your party's
not going to like it.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:30.550
But it's got to get done.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:36.520
So there's a way in which it's a
useful tool or useful technique

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.730
for party leaders, albeit
one that is used sparingly.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.030
Yes.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In terms of tactics, did you look

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:51.480
at all new [inaudible] not new
anymore, communication technologies

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:57.680
and the ability of the minority
party develop constituencies beyond

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.990
their traditional district
[inaudible].

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.290
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat that?

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question is did I
look at novel forms of communication

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.750
and technology by lawmakers.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.410
Short answer is no.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.980
But it is a really
important topic actually.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:18.050
Because the book takes a 40-year
span, I kind of wanted to kind

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.730
of control it for as
many things as possible.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.510
And at the time I started doing
this, it was still pretty new,

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.020
the use of Twitter and
Facebook by the minority party.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.840
So I opted to kind of leave that
off the, you know, leave that out.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.920
Having said that though, I think
it'd be, it's a great subject,

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.800
and it's clearly being used.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.330
And I would not be
surprised if the data shows

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.060
that the minority party
has done it first.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.910
In fact, I, my guess would
that's absolutely right.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.680
So if you're in the minority, how
do you get the word out to people.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.980
Well, you Tweet.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.280
Oh those Democrats, look
what they did today.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.480
Oh I can't get to the floor,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.010
And then what happens, again,
is you have innovation.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.720
And then you have replication.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.410
So the other party says oh,
well we should do that too.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.790
You do the majority in the morning,
and then they start doing it.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.050
A lot of innovation of tactics come

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.740
from the minority party
in the House.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.040
Because they have fewer options.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.710 position:56%
They got to come up with new things.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.440
So I didn't look at it,
but it's really important

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.500
and would be a good project.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.200
Yeah. Yes.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.500
&gt;&gt; On the motion to adjourn

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.850
where you found there
had been some success,

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.170
what was the mechanism for that?

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:30.980 position:56%
And was there negotiation during the
[inaudible], or how did that happen.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Yeah, because it's
aggregate, we're talking a number

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.250
of cases, so I couldn't
do a case-by-case analysis

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.550
to figure it out.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.850
Sometimes there were news reports

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:42.230
where they said, you
know, this happened.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.830
A lot of it was just kind
of behind closed doors.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.180
That's why I say, inference.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.120
It's hard to know for sure.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:53.400
But it certainly seemed to be the
case that you would have someone

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.240
in the minority complain
and do one of these motions.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.180
And especially if they kept doing
them over and over and over.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.110
And sometimes the majority would
just pull the bill from the floor

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.900
and say we're done for the day.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.560 position:56%
And then the next day they would
come back and something had changed.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.490
So it certainly would
suggest there was some kind

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.070
of negotiation going on.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.880
&gt;&gt; Is the speaker [inaudible]
delay [inaudible].

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.180
&gt;&gt; Aha, right.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.640
So it's a privileged motion,
but the House rules also say

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.120
that the speaker does not have
to entertain dilatory motions.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.500
I can't think of an example
of a speaker refusing,

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.630
at least in modern era, recognizing
someone to do a motion to rise

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.580
or adjourn for that purpose.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.310
Usually what happens is they
just, the Speaker just adjourns,

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.250
goes into recess kind of thing.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:46.870
So for instance, Republicans
did this on an agriculture bill,

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.080
ag spending bill in early 1990s.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.380
They were upset about
something else,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.040
but they introduced an amendment
that would cut spending by 50,

00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.830
I think it was $50,050, which
was exactly 1% of the budget.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.220 position:56%
And then they just got up and talked
and talked about child healthcare.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.830
And then that amendment failed.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:10.700
And then someone introduced an
amendment that cut $100,100.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.600
And then they just
talked more about.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.460
Now at that point I suppose
the speaker could have said,

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.770
I'm not going to recognize
the next amendment.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.850
But instead they just
adjourned for the day.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.510
Yeah. I think we're out of time,
so thank you all very much.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:32.190
[ Applause ]

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.490
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you Matt.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:34.790
&gt;&gt; Matthew Green: Thank you.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.090
&gt;&gt; John Cole: That was great.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.390
Well I want to thank Matt.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.690
His presentation is
as clear as his book.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.530
He really worked hard at
making this understandable.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:46.240
One of the things I liked best
was all this positive talk

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.420
about government and politics.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.150
It really is refreshing
in many ways.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:55.970
And it gave us some nice insight
into CRS and a very important,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.040
obviously an important part of
our library and one that I hope

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.300
that we'll participate in
helping us co-sponsor other books

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.870
and be on programs.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.200
There's going to be a book
signing for Matt right in the back.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.300
Please buy the book at the
Library of Congress discount,

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.240
and let's close by giving
Matt Green another round

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.040
of applause for a great job.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.580
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
