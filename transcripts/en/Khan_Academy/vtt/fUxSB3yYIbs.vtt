I want to clarify a little

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.743
bit about why we calculate
the percent changes

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:06.607
when we're thinking about elasticity

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:07.897
the way that we do.

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:09.495
So just to remind ourselves,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.572
a little focus on price
elasticity of demand,

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:13.314
although we've been exposed to other

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.338
types of elasticities already.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.079
Just as a review, price
elasticity of demand,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.546
so the elasticity of demand,

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:23.614
is defined as the percent
change in quantity

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:29.114
demanded over the percent change in price.

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.149
So first I'll calculate
it the conventional way,

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.863
the way you would do it in a traditional

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:34.123
microeconomics class.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:36.090
Then I'll calculate it the way

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.739
that you would just based on how you would

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.113
traditionally calculate percentages

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:41.063
and we'll see why microeconomists

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:43.245
like to do it the way that they do.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:46.496
First we'll talk about the "correct" way.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:48.408
I'll put it in quotes because correct

00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:51.039
is by definition really
just by convention.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.020
But when we first think about
the percent change in quantity,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.150
percent change in quantity
and we're going to assume,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.199
we're going to calculate the elasticity

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.935
of demand between point A over here,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:05.239
point A and point B over here.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.417
So what is our percent change in quantity?

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.024
Well, our absolute change in quantity

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:14.431
going from A to B we have increased by 2.

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.633
So we have increased by 2.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.050
I'll write it down here.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.461
This is going to be 2 over and then this

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:22.558
is kind of the slightly strange thing

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:24.410
that we do when we
calculate our percentages.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.141
We don't say 2 over 4.

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:29.090
We say 2 over the average of 4 and 6.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.612
It's 2 over the average of our starting

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:32.535
point and our ending point.

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.604
The average of 4 and 6 is 5.

00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:36.170
So this is going to be ...

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.248
We have a 40% change based on how

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:40.562
we calculated the percentages

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:42.615
in our quantity demanded,

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.351
and then let's do our
percent change in price.

00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.210
So this is all going to be over

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.138
our percent change in price.

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.508
Our absolute change in
price is negative 1 dollar.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:56.038
Negative 1 dollar and
then instead of doing it

00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:58.634
over our starting point over 2,

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:03.954
we do it over the average
of the 2, over 150.

00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:08.143
Negative 1 over 150 is
negative two-thirds,

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:14.569
or right about negative
66.7% if we say roughly.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.564
So this right over here ...

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:19.063
so based on how we calculated percentages,

00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:20.710
and I want to make it clear,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.703
this is kind of a strange way,

00:02:22.703 --> 00:02:24.165
when we do it over the midpoint

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:25.950
of the starting and ending points,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.544
but we're saying that our percent change

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:29.687
from A to B in quantity,

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.610
so our percent change in quantity,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.885
this right over here we
are saying it is 40%,

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.715
and then we are saying that this percent

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:43.703
change in price right over
here is negative 66.7%.

00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:46.074
Now, the reason why this is valuable,

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.199
and then obviously if you
do the math right here,

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.933
40% over negative 66.7% percent,

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.695
you're going to get some

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:54.180
let's see you're going to get something.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.388
I think it's going to be in the 6s.

00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:56.730
Point 6 something but let's actually get a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.019
calculator out to calculate it.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.023
It would be 40 divided by 66.7 gives you,

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:07.533
it's almost 60 so it's roughly point 60

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.051
if we were to round.

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.812
This is approximately 0.60.

00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:14.401
It was 597 something.

00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:17.173
Actually I'll just leave
it that way at point 60.

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:19.399
Now, what's cool about this

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.763
or what's useful about this,

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:23.335
and this is the reason why
we kind of mis-do it is,

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.154
you would get the same answer

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:26.568
whether you're going from A to B

00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:28.532
or whether you're going from B to A.

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:32.174
This is the situation where
we're going from A to B,

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.013
but if we were to go from B to A,

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:37.071
if we were to go from B to
A it's the exact same thing.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.311
If we go from B to A what
is our change in quantity?

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.220
Our change in quantity is negative 2.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.772
It would be negative 2 over,

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:48.149
now you wouldn't do it
over your starting point.

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.170
You do it over the average.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.868
This is why we will get the same value

00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:54.268
regardless of what direction we go in.

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.277
We get the average of 4
and 6 is going to be 5.

00:03:57.277 --> 00:03:59.207
That's going to be over.

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:01.604
Now going from B to A what
is our change in price?

00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:04.094
Our change in price is now plus 1.

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:07.635
It is plus 1 over the
average of our starting

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:10.384
point and our ending point, over 150.

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.477
Now these are the exact same quantities.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:14.412
Both are going to be a negative number.

00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:16.324
Here the negative is on the bottom.

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.150
Here the negative is on top.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.144
Either way and actually
this was a negative

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:22.158
point 60 because you have a positive

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:23.318
divided by a negative.

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:25.091
This too when you evaluate it,

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:26.666
is going to turn out to
be the exact same thing.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:30.286
It's going to be negative 0.60.

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.004
Now if you calculated percentages
in the traditional way,

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:35.208
you would not get the same value for the

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.263
price elasticity of demand,

00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:39.666
whether you go from A to B and B to A.

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.792
Just to show that to you,

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:44.135
I will put this in quotation marks.

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:46.867
It's not the "wrong"
way to do it in general.

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.800
In fact, this is how you would calculate

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.037
price changes traditionally,

00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:52.004
but it's not how you do it in kind of a

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:53.739
microeconomic sense.

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:56.743
If you did the wrong way
... If you said from A to B

00:04:56.743 --> 00:05:05.953
your absolute change in quantity
is plus 2 and your base ...

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:08.402
Remember this is the way
that it's done outside

00:05:08.402 --> 00:05:09.913
of microeconomics.

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:14.778
Your base is 4 and then
your change in price,

00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:17.795
you went down 1 and your base,

00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:19.715
you started at A,

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.328
so your base is 2.

00:05:22.328 --> 00:05:24.275
This is the way you do it
outside of economics class.

00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:27.208
This would be equal to

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:34.843
50% plus 50% over negative 50%,

00:05:34.843 --> 00:05:37.070
over negative 50%.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.116
You essentially get negative 1.

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:41.408
Going from A to B using a traditional way

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:43.133
of calculating percent change.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.493
What happens if you go from B to A?

00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:48.198
What happens if you go from B to A?

00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.744
Now, all of the sudden, your
change in quantity is negative 2.

00:05:50.744 --> 00:05:54.296
Your base is now ...
the starting point is 6.

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:56.803
Your starting point is 6.

00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:58.632
Then your change in price,

00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:00.735
once again you're increasing in price by 1

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.381
going from B to A,

00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:04.069
so this is plus 1.

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.046
Your base is now 1.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:07.824
You will get,

00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:09.898
this is negative 33% roughly,

00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:13.227
that's negative a third, so 33.333,

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:18.803
it keeps repeating over 100%.

00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:22.716
This will be equal to negative point 33.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.562
Notice when you calculate percentages

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.028
in the traditional way,

00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:28.080
you get a different answer
whether you're going from

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.843
A to B or whether you're
going from B to A.

00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:33.336
The whole reason why when
we take the percentages,

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:35.018
we take it over the average of our

00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:36.565
starting and our ending points,

00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:38.623
over the average of our
starting and ending points.

00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:41.222
is so we get the same
value for the elasticity

00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:43.195
of demand along this portion of the curve.

00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:44.964
You can really view it as the average

00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.970
elasticity of demand over
this portion of the curve

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.162
and if you calculate it this way,

00:06:50.162 --> 00:06:52.160
it doesn't matter whether you're going

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000
from A to B or B to A.
