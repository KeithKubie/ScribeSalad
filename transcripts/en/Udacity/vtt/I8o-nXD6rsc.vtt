00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.110
Determining the probability that a child will inherit

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.210
a particular trait is what genetic counselors do for

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.670
a living. And sometimes all they have to rely

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
on, is pedigree information. This is tricky business. This

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.040
means they've got to calculate probability over multiple

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.860
generations without knowing the genotypes for sure of everybody.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.530
But only knowing whether or not a trait was

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.319
present in a family. For example take a look

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.792
at this pedigree here, it represents an autosomal recessive inheritance

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:34.520
pattern. What is the probability that these two people indicated

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.960
by the arrows, will have an effected child for this

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.520
particular trait? Now I'm not going to give you options

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.080
for this question. This is going to be tricky and possibly

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.220
really hard for you to come up with. But I

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.820
want you to see what it's like a little bit

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.200
to try to do the job of a genetic counselor.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.940
Calculating probabilities from a limited amount of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.770
information. I want you to feel comfortable putting

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.020
in a percentage, a decimal, or a fraction,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.110
whatever answer you can come up with. Remember,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.340
you're probably going to have to think backwards about.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.680
Whose genotype is what, based on the phenotypic

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.260
information that you have in front of you. Go ahead and give it your best shot.
