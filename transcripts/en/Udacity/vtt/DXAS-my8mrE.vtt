[Dave] Welcome back for Unit 2!

00:00:02.051 --> 00:00:05.336
I hope everyone enjoyed the first unit, and was able to do the homework.

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:09.519
What we're going to do in this unit, is take the next big step in building our search engine,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.167
which is, instead of just having the crawler find the first link in the page,

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.117
to find all the links in the page.

00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:18.444
That's going to involve two very big new concepts in computer science.

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:21.959
The first thing is turning things into procedures, and the second is control.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.301
We need a way to make decisions, as well as a way to keep going.

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:30.825
What we saw at the end of Unit 1 was a way to extract the first URL from a web page--

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.450
that's great--we could find the first target.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.457
But if we want to build a good crawler,

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:38.099
we don't just care about the first one,

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:40.505
we care about all of the links on the page.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.172
We need to extract all of those links--

00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:44.305
figure out where all of those links point to--

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.702
so we'll find many more pages that crawl than just the first one.

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.940
So, that's the goal for this class as far as building a web browser.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.967
To do that, we're going to learn two really big ideas in computer science.

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:55.699
The first is about procedures,

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.640
and that's a way to package up code so we can use it

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.952
in a much more useful way than we could before.

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:04.083
The second is about control.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.958
Control structures will give us a way to keep going

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.190
to find all the links on a page.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.040
So, let's remember the code we had at the end of Unit 1.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.907
We solved this problem of extracting the first URL from the page--

00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:20.688
we assumed the page was initialized to the contents of some web page.

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:24.825
We initialized the variable "start_link"

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:27.322
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:30.354
passing in the start of the link tag.

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.839
Then, we initialized the variable "start_quote"

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:35.867
to the result of finding, in the page,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.400
the first quote following that link tag.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.000
Then, we initialized the variable "end_quote"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.470
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.169
to find the first quote following the start quote.

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:51.444
And, then, we assigned to the variable "url"--

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.689
extracting from the page--

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.820
from the character after the "start_quote,"

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.168
to the character just before the "end_quote,"

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:00.666
we could print out that URL.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:05.423
This worked to find the first URL on the page.

00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:08.455
If we wanted to find the second one,

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:10.222
we could do it all again.

00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:12.990
We could say, now we want to advance

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.918
so we're only looking at the rest of the page.

00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:18.917
We could do that by updating the variable "page,"

00:02:18.917 --> 00:02:25.335
assigning to it the result of the rest of the page, starting from "end_quote"--

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:29.124
and, remember, when there's a blank after the colon

00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:32.188
that means select from this position, to the very end--

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:34.491
and then we can do all the same stuff.

00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:39.072
We'll do "start_link" again; ...

00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:48.383
we'll do "start_quote" again; ...

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:50.486
Now we've got code that's going to print out the first URL--

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.674
keep going, updating the variable "page"--

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.184
and then doing the exact same thing--

00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:57.000
printing out the second URL.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.866
If we wanted to print out the first three,

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:20.671
we could do it again...

00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:24.473
So now, we've got code to print out the first three

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.291
URL's on the page--

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.066
let's scroll all the way up--so you've got--

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:32.657
print out the first one--keep going--

00:03:32.657 --> 00:03:36.886
print out the second one--keep going--

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:39.354
so this can go on forever.

00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:41.909
The reason we have computers

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.252
is to save humans from doing lots of tedious work.

00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:47.523
We don't want to make humans do lots of tedious work--

00:03:47.523 --> 00:03:50.469
certainly, typing this out, over and over again,

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.405
would be really tedious,

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:54.699
and it wouldn't really even work that well.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.409
We have pages with hundreds of links,

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.992
but there are other pages with only one or two links.

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:01.908
So, it wouldn't make sense to copy this hundreds of times.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.803
There's always going to be some web page that has more links

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:06.621
than we have copies of it--

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.619
and any page that has fewer copies, we're going to run into problems

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.756
because we're not going to be finding any of those links.

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:17.756
So, our goal today is to solve all of those problems.
