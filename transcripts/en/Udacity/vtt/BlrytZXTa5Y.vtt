00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's go through it. If you had a regular expression like a+,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I could rewrite that as aa*, so I never actually need plus. It's just convenient.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There is no regular expression for a^n. There is.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It is a+, and this recognizes a, aa, aaa, so this is misleading.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
However, for this one, there is no regular expression for a^n b^n.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is the same as the language of balanced parentheses

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
except we're using a's in b's instead of open and close parenthesis.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There is no such regular expression. We need a context-free grammar.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Finally, every regular expression has an associated finite state machine

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that recognizes the same strings--yep--and we saw a little bit of how to do this.
