00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.040
Sperms aren't the mindless, flagellum-wielding,
dolts you thought they were. They are wily

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.490
little devils with war on their nuclei.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.120

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.230
Hey dudes, Trace here with the lowdown on
your sperms' struggles for DNews. Sperm

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.470
are the male gamete, the counterpart to the
female's egg. When a sperm reaches the inside

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.560
of an egg, a zygote is created -- the first
step on the path to a fetus. But to reach

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.260
that goal, a sperm have to overcome a lot of different problems - one being there are millions

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.290
of other sperm. They're like, WATCH OUT
DUDE. Imma tryin' to get to the egg!

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.910
 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.950
For instance, we've evolved what science calls
sperm allocation. As the point of sex is to

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.329
get your sperm to the egg first and thus spread
your genes, sperm allocation was one of nature's

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.430
ways of getting the most bang for your ... buck...
IF a male believes his female sexual partner

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.579
has committed infidelity, or if he's simply
spent a long while away from the partner,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.719
his sperm count will increase when they pair
up! The authors of a study published in Current

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.679
Directions in Psychological Science believe
this is why males get lustful feelings after

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:11.090
being away from their partner; they want to
make sure they can get as much sperm in there

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.529
as possible to compete.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:17.259
Once inside the woman, sperm continue the
struggle. This has to do with that creation:

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.649
sperm are formed based on HOW the species
fertilize AND how much sexual competition

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.380
is present. It was assumed that the bigger
the sperm, the faster they are. Bigger and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.009
stronger is better? Right? Wrong. A study
published in the journal Evolution uses Bonobos

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.939
as an example. These apes share almost 99-percent
of their DNA with humans and have a lot of

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.969
sex with lots of partners. The competition
has evolved sperm with bigger head and a smaller

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.939
tails. The larger sperm were actually SLOWER.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.219
The researchers found only animals who fertilize
OUTSIDE of their bodies have a large sperm

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.779
advantage. The shorter head and longer tail
of fish and squid sperm were super fast and

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.689
thus got to the egg first. Yah bro!

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.039
Then there's the theory that there are two
kinds of sperm - the goal scorers, and the

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.679
ones who play defense. &nbsp;Of the 250 million
sperm cells released into the female reproductive

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.469
system, 27-percent are defective, right off
the bat. The normally oval-shaped head is

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.950
spherical or quite pointy in parts, the tails
are malformed or whatever. This theory of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.890
so called "kamikaze sperm" also comes
back to competition between mates. The idea

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.370
is that these malformed sperm hang back to
block those from competing mates, thus ensuring

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.290
the first male's DOMINATION OF FERTILIZATION!!!

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.590
Since the hypothesis was proposed in the 80s,
scientists have tried and failed to reproduce

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.159
their findings, so while we're pretty sure
this isn't real, it's still being tested.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.129
Most scientists now believe the 27-percent
defect rate occurs because of poor quality

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.120
control in sperm creation... Which... is a
little embarrassing. Dudes, this is our big

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.400
moment and we're half-assing it out there!
110-percent, c'mon!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.959
Of the millions of sperms released, remember you were the fastest.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:55.250
