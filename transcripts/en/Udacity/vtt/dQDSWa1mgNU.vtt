00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.180
So this, is my exposure triangle, shutter speed, aperture, ISO.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.590
By changing the aperture,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.240
we can actually can impact the depth of field, increasing ISO,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.010
we get more grain, and decreasing the shutter speed, we can get motion blur.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.370
So, it's a combination of these three things,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.690
that allows you to explore how we can actually, best take the pictures we want.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.703
So, aperture opening, is one of the parameters we want to to control,

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:30.990
shutter speed, that is how long do I want to keep the shutter open to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.870
get the amount of light in, to my sensor is something I want to do, and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.820
once it hits the sensor, I want to actually know more about the sensitivity of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.220
the film, or, the digital sensor that we're using.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.650
And again, photographers basically optimize these based on

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.850
their experience to get a desired exposure.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.060
On the website for this class,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.920
I'm going to put a small applet that actually people at Stanford built,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.730
that will let you explore, the variability of the these three to be able to

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.070
get the best exposure in a synthetic kind of a play around mode.
