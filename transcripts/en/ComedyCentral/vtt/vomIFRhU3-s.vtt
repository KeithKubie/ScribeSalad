00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.928
I've done interviews in
the bed, I said guys.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.864
- Why do you have
this chair here?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.132
- Well, Joe, I'm a drummer.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:32.966

you drum on a chair

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.770
at South by Southwest.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.204 align:start size:81% position:19%

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got jumped by a
bouncer, how dare he,

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.009
I remember you buddy.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.012
I was hosting an afternoon
show with different bands,

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.415
and this rock or heavy--

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.716
- Dirty type.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.886
- Yeah, wearing a denim
jacket and Doc Martins.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.387
- Yeah you scumbag.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You jerk, Doc Martins,
what is this, '89 in London?

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:58.825
Are you listening to Madness?

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.027
I'm real and here
with Joe DeRosa.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.529
- That's right.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.498
- So he grabbed the mic and
goes, 'this guy's not funny,'

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.133
you don't grab the
mic from somebody,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.334
and he threw the mic.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The bouncer didn't
take your side?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.107
- He saw fighting and he jumped
on me, and I kicked his ass.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.442
- Can I do somethin' real quick?

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.276
- Yeah.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.710
Fuck yeah!

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.512
You turn over that chair.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Because you want that
to be the Doc Martins man.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.049
- Mhm.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.652
- Y'know what, let's go another.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.387
- You're taking your shoes off?

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.955
Representing Doc?

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.659 align:start size:88% position:13%
- For our exercise,
they can be Doc Martins.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.628 align:start size:94% position:6%
Let's put 'em on the chair
to represent the man.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.729
- Who attacked me.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.331
- Not we stand it up.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.699
- And I drum on him.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.768
- And you drum on
the man's dick.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.837
- Watch this, here we go.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.672
One, two, three, four.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.977
One, two, three.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:51.945
- Four.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.482
What do the hits represent?

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.318
- South by Southwest,
that jerk who hit me

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
and jumped me and the
bouncer, I kicked his ass,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.623
I work with kettle bells.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:05.658
- Yes, yes!

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.329
You got extra sticks?

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.864
- I, y'know what I
knew you were here,

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.899
I got extra sticks, I
say we drum together,

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.400
I'll follow your lead.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.703 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Right, and y'know who
I'm gonna pretend this is?

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.607
A guy, today, accused me
of spamming on Twitter.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.142
- Block 'em.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.612
- I blocked 'em, I blocked
'em, block you block you.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.382
- Let it out Joe, wow.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:33.820
Fuck yeah.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.024
See ya' later jerk.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.093
I'm gonna sit back and relax.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.461
- I don't feel good right now.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.595
I feel like I'm gonna
throw up a little bit.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.030
- Are you serious?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.498 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I ate a bunch of doughnuts
before I came in here.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:49.736
- You want me to put the
drumstick down your throat?

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.570
Gag on it.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.607
He went there.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.942
- It went there.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.378

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.212
