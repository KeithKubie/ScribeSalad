00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.109
When the sexual revolution began in the 1960s,
there was a standard understanding of what

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.400
should happen: ‘sexual liberation’ would
mean that people would be freed to have more

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.700
of the sort of sex they really liked, that
is, with more partners and with less embarrassment.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.250
But what was overlooked is that this kind
of sexual liberation might, along the way,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.580
create its own restrictions, taboos and, so
to speak, varieties of imprisonment. The people

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.170
targeted would not be those who wanted to
have more sex but those who – for a variety

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.620
of reasons – either didn’t want to, or
weren’t able to, have the amount of sex

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.290
now strongly deemed so-called ‘normal’.
Sexual liberation, while driven by a desire

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.610
to free us of moralistic judgement, ended
up – quite unwittingly – putting us in

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.680
a new kind of straightjacket, insisting not
that we have no sex, as moralists of old had

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.129
thundered, but that we feel wholly at ease
around the prospect of making love frequently

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.040
and diversely. It now became as shameful to
admit that one wasn’t having sex as it had

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.120
once been shameful to say, outside of marriage,
that one was. Stigma continued, shame too,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.659
they just changed their targets. At the heart
of this newly stigmatised group, there was

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.020
a figure of particular mockery and opprobrium:
the belated virgin, someone who has by accident

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.380
or design reached their 20s and still not
yet been to bed with anyone. This shame has

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.750
nothing to do with statistics. Surveys estimate
that as many as 15% of the population between

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.680
20 and 25 remain virgins. The point isn’t
how many virgins there are – there are clearly

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.020
many – but rather the extent to which they
have been made to feel wretched and inadequate.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.939
The goal of true sexual liberation, the sort
we should all be interested in, is not to

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:09.051
shift stigma around, it is to remove all stigma
around all consensual sexual choices. True

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:14.020
liberation means liberating us not just to
have sex a lot, with different partners, in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.519
ecstatic clinches, but also to not have sex
or to have sex quite late on or, for that

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.940
matter, to have bad or inept or clumsy sex
– and never to feel bad on this account.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.030
True sexual liberation should liberate us
not just to be athletic and tantric and polyecstatic

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.959
– but also to be weird, reclusive, interestingly
shy, intelligently embarrassed and about as

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.419
peculiar as we want to be – and still retain
the right to honour and like ourselves.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.329
What we should aim for is to build a society
where we finally stop suffering so intensely

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.279
around our sexuality, even if that sexuality
means we don’t want to, or haven’t yet

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:59.840
managed to, have sex. That, and only that,
will mean true liberation.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.560
Did you know that The School Of LIfe is  actually a place?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.280
10 places in fact; campus' all over the world from Melbourne to London, Taipei to Istanbul.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.160
With classes and books and much more...
