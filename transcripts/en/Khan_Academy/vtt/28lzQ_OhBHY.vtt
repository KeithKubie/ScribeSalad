00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.971
- [Instructor] We have some
type of study described here.

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:03.794
I encourage you to pause this video,

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.242
and think about whether this
is an observational study,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:10.667
it's an experiment, or
it's a sample study.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.243
And also think about whether
it was conducted well.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.472
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:18.364
A group of doctors was
interested in comparing

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:21.569
the effectiveness of
placebo pills and real pills

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.136
in treating migraines.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.073
Placebo pills are pills that look

00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:27.304
just like the regular pill,

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:28.535
and from a patient's point of view,

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:29.986
they don't know which on they're getting.

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.041
The reason why we do this in studies

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:36.244
is because there's something
called a placebo effect.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.577
Often times, just by taking something

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:39.808
that you think is good for you,

00:00:39.808 --> 00:00:41.700
some medicine that you
think might help you,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.205
it actually does help you.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:46.594
We can think about why the
placebo effect happens,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:48.289
but this is well documented.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.878
So when people are
trying to test medicine,

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.782
they wanna say, well,
does this have an effect

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.621
above and beyond the placebo effect.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.795
That's why they are
putting them in these two,

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:00.628
that's why they're comparing

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.701
the real pills to the placebo pills.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.840
They randomly assigned
a group of 300 patients

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.185
suffering from migraines into two groups.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:10.496
So they have their 300,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:14.362
they have their 300
patients right over here.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:18.065
And they're randomly putting
them into the placebo group.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.232
Placebo group, or the real pill group.

00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:26.181
One group was given a real pill,

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:29.298
oh no, we already read that.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.931
Both groups were told which
kind of pill they got.

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.134
That is sketchy because the
whole point about a placebo

00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:40.164
is that you think you got the real thing,

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:41.964
or you think you might
have gotten the real thing.

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:43.163
If you're told you got a placebo,

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:45.308
that tends to undermine
the placebo effect.

00:01:45.308 --> 00:01:47.281
If you're just told
you're given a sugar pill,

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.045
well, then the impact, well anyway.

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:54.212
This is, that right over there
is definitely bad practice.

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:57.614
So let's keep going over here.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:00.052
Before taking the pills,
and a day afterwards,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:01.910
the patients were asked
to fill out questionnaires

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.292
regarding their condition.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.230
Then, the doctors analyzed
the overall changes

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.912
in questionnaires for each
group and compared them.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:08.771
All right, so first of all,

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:10.609
what type of study is this?

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.022
Well, we're taking our groups,

00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:15.285
we are randomly putting them
into two different groups.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:18.617
You can call the placebo
group maybe the control group.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.068
And then you're putting the real pill

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:22.088
as you're actual experimental group.

00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:24.577
So this is a classic experiment.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.474
This is a classic experiment.

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:29.933
You're trying to establish
a causal relationship.

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.988
You wanna see whether this real pill

00:02:31.988 --> 00:02:34.655
actually makes migraines better.

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:37.930
Migraines better.

00:02:39.053 --> 00:02:40.365
So does it actually do it,

00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:43.035
and does it actually do
it better than a placebo?

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:45.136
And you're randomly putting
the people in both groups

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:48.468
to try to distribute any
confounding variables

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.605
that there might be there.

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:52.381
This is clearly an experiment.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.605
Now the other options,
you might have said,

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:55.735
well, this may be an observational study?

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:59.764
Remember, an observational
study, observational,

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.865
that's more of where you
look at a population,

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:02.698
you look at a group,

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:04.083
you ask them a bunch of questions often,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:08.250
and you see if they're
correlations between two variables.

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:12.129
So variable one, and variable two,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.486
and you're able to make

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:17.919
some type of correlational statement.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.836
You're not trying to get at causality.

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:23.506
In a sample study, a sample study,

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:27.245
this is just you trying
to estimate a parameter

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:28.975
for the entire population.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.642
So a sample study might of been,

00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:37.067
of the entire population what
percentage gets migraines.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.029
You can't talk to the entire population,

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.771
maybe the entire population
is millions of people,

00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:43.313
so you take a sample of say 100 people.

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:45.287
And you ask them, do you get migraines?

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:47.713
Then you say, okay, that
percentage of our sample

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.490
that get migraines, that's a good estimate

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.395
for the parameter.

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:52.853
What percentage of my entire population

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:54.343
actually gets migraines?

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:56.490
So this was clearly an experiment.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.559
Now the next question is, well,

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:59.544
was this experiment conducted well?

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.889
Even when I read it, I was
bothered by both groups

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.410
were told which kind of pill they got.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.243
That completely defeats
the purpose of a placebo.

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:08.507
The placebo effect is, hey,
I think I'm taking something

00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:10.237
good for me, and it's been
documented that when you

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:11.595
think you're taking a pill that helps you,

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:13.685
it often times does help you.

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.124
And so when someone's coming
up with a new medicine,

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:21.005
it better perform, or it
better be more effective

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:22.922
than just that placebo.

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:25.582
I don't like the fact that,

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.397
this is a very bad study
to tell both groups

00:04:28.397 --> 00:04:29.964
what kind of pill they got.

00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:31.485
You actually should tell neither group

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:33.818
which type of pill they got.
