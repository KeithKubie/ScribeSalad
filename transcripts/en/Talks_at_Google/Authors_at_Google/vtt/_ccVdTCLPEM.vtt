[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:07.520
AUSTIN WILKINS: We're
very privileged to have

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.950
Chris Cheng with us.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.190
Chris Chang worked at
Google, starting in 2007

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.309
doing technical support for
the Google Apps for Business,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.500
now known as G Suite.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.340
Chris trained and competed in
History Channel's "Top Shot"

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.340
season 4 while at
Google, and ultimately,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.712
leaving Google upon
completing that challenge

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:28.920
right there that we just saw.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.070
That's pretty awesome.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.160
Previously, he spoke
with Google in 2014,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.040
when Ars Technica co-founder
Jon Stokes interviewed him

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.730
upon release of the first
edition of his book,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.590
"Shoot to Win."

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.820
In the year since he's
traveled the country,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.740
doing lots of
speaking engagements

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.190
and sharing his passion
for the shooting sports.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.948
Now, he's back to
speak at Google

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:54.490
about the second
edition of his book,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.980
his new life in shooting sports,
and his outreach on behalf

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.345
of LGBT and Asian communities.

00:00:59.345 --> 00:00:59.970
Welcome, Chris.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.700
CHRIS CHENG: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.325
AUSTIN WILKINS: Very
great to have you.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.570
So we just saw a little
clip, for those just watching

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.360
the video, from Top Shot.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.410
Why don't you to explain
what Top Shot is for us?

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.920
CHRIS CHENG: Top Shot is
a competitive marksmanship

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.060
challenge, where 18 competitors
from all walks of life

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.840
across our country were
selected to compete

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.520
in a series of challenges.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.797
And the cool dynamic about
the show is every episode,

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.880
there are a number of
weapons that are introduced.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.700
But the competitors, we
don't have any idea what

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.220
the weapons are until,
literally, we're standing there

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.160
on the range and
the hosts usually

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.880
take a tarp off and says, all
right, here are the weapons.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.170
We get a little bit of
training with a weapons expert,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.710
and then Top Shot creates
these incredible challenges

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.340
that are unique and are
really not available anywhere

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.750
else in the world.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.510
What you saw was
the final challenge.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.952
It was a seven station
final gauntlet.

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:03.160
We saw the last few stations.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.560
It's an incredibly fun show
that immerses the viewer

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.370
into the action.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.930
You probably saw a lot of
in slow motion footage,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.500
seeing bullets leaving the
barrels and just explosions.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.110
And what is really
exciting about Top Shot

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
is it tests competitors
ability to adapt

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.960
to unfamiliar situations
and to adapt to ambiguity.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.520
And when I look back at
the competition and things

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.430
that prepared me
for the competition,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.310
when I look back at my time
at Google, everybody here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.610
at Google, there's lots
of ambiguity that we

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.800
deal with every single day.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.080
And in a moment's
notice, you're expected

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.400
to either think creatively
to solve a problem

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.280
and to move as fast you can,
shore up all your resources.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.800
So Top Shot, I was on season
4, so there were three seasons

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.400
before me.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.810
And I was just a regular
guy, watching it on TV,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.090
and decided to apply and
throw my hat in the ring.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.673
AUSTIN WILKINS: It
was pretty awesome.

00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:19.570
Yeah, you went on as
the IT professional,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.110
kind of the underdog, and went
on to win the competition.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.660
So you're here on the heels of
releasing the second edition

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.110
of your book, "Shoot to Win."

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.150
Well, I'll get right into it.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.350
Why do a second edition?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.792
What was wrong
with the first one?

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.250
CHRIS CHENG: So
thankfully, there's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.260
nothing wrong with
the first edition.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.520
It's sold really well.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.560
And so I had an opportunity to
launch a second edition, which

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.240
is the paperback version.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.780
The first edition
was a hardcover.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.790
And so with a paperback edition,
it's a lower price point.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.100
More people can afford it.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.690
But I also had Katie
Pavlich write the forward

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.520
for the second edition.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.260
Katie is editor of Town
Hall, also a Fox News Channel

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.710
contributor, also a
gun owner as well.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.450
And so for "Shoot to Win,"
it is a book about everything

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.560
that I studied and
trained to win Top Shot.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.350
And another big thing
about the second edition

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.260
of "Shoot to Win" is I've
included a bunch of references

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.640
to free YouTube videos that
are instructional videos

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.810
complementing shoot to win.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.610
So that's kind of the
summary of the second edition

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.740
that we cover, and I'm very
excited for the second edition

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.380
launch here.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.550
AUSTIN WILKINS: Cool.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.633
So you mentioned that
this was the summary

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:42.550
of all your learnings.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.133
Is this the book
that you wish you had

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:46.150
while training for Top Shot?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.230
CHRIS CHENG: Absolutely.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.860
And so for background,
I'm a self-taught amateur,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.230
and I did grow up with guns.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.290
I was born in Orange County and
my father was in the military.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.950
He didn't shoot guns
as part of his service.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.510
He was a navigator in P-3
Orions during the Vietnam War.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.850
But the military
was his introduction

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.660
to firearms during
basic training.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.270
And so when he taught
me how to shoot,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.690
that was a very formative
experience for me.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.510
I was six years old.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.520
He taught me the
safety fundamentals

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.060
of how to handle and
operate a firearm.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.770
And so fast forward to when
I was working here at Google,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.550
training for the show, I was
looking at all the resources

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.540
that were available to me.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.910
And at the time, since I didn't
have a lot of gun friends--

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.670
I mean, I had some
gun friends, but I

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.770
didn't have a ton of
instructors who could teach me

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.590
all these things.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.923
AUSTIN WILKINS: You lived in OC.

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:48.860
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.550
was mostly relying on
the internet for advice,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.210
for guidance to
help me understand

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.710
certain tactics, certain
firearms, certain

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.980
marksmanship fundamentals.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.410
And I remember reading
about even something

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.225
as basic as caliber.

00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:09.350
It's like, what is caliber?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.780
And why are some of
these bullet measurements

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.230
in the imperial system, others
are in the metric system?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.070
And everyone has their way of
explaining certain concepts.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.630
But "Shoot to Win" is
my way of explaining

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.560
things in the most
simple terms possible.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.380
"Shoot to Win" is
for the layman.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.410
It's for the beginner,
someone has no idea

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.750
about anything about firearms.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.810
Because like with anything
new, if a topic is confusing,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.860
it can be intimidating.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.880
It can be off-putting
if you start getting,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.200
I don't know, too
technical or too deep

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.690
in the weeds about
certain concepts.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.910
And so I wanted to
really just whittle this

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.200
down to the basics.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.620
And for me, when I think about
firearms, a firearm is a tool.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.060
There's many, many
tools out there.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.510
And just like any tool,
once you understand

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.260
how to operate it
safely, naturally, you

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.890
gain confidence in
how to use the tool.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.830
If we need to chop down some
trees, I'm like, hey, Austin.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.008
We need to use a chainsaw.

00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:18.800
And if you've never
used a chainsaw before,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.842
I'm not just going to put
a chainsaw in your hand

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:22.250
and be like, go to it.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.500
We would need to talk
about, all right, safety,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.260
handling for the chainsaw, and
how to turn it on and safely

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.220
cut wood.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.150
So for me, a firearm is very,
very similar in that regard,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.070
that it's a tool that when
the operator and the user

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.500
how to safely use
it and handle it,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.590
then it becomes more
approachable and usable

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.252
for the average person.

00:07:44.252 --> 00:07:45.710
AUSTIN WILKINS:
Yeah, that's great.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.930
And I noticed that,
while reading this book,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.430
it really intrigued me how not
only the book an incredibly

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.390
detailed book
about how to start,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.630
but it also, in
the introduction,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.470
really went over your philosophy
for how you won Top Shot

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.430
and how to kind of win
at life, in general.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.660
Can you tell us more
about the philosophies

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.560
that you've implemented when
on the show and in the book?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.310
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.640
So as the title
implies, shoot to win.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.210
But for me, it's not just
about shooting to win,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.410
it's about winning in life.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.950
And a big part of that for
me is my personal philosophy

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.580
and attitude towards whatever
it is that I'm working at.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:33.350
So for example, when I
was training for the show,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.440
I was putting in about 50
hours a week, here at Google,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.270
as a normal work week.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.929
But on top of that, I was
putting in 20 to 25 hours

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:42.750
a week.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.080
I basically was
treating training

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.472
like a part-time job on
top of my full-time job.

00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:48.680
AUSTIN WILKINS: That's a lot.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.740
CHRIS CHENG: And
so winning, to me,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.350
requires dedication,
focus, and sacrifice.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.140
A big part of my training, I
remember sending an email out

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.270
to my family and to my friends.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.230
And I remember
saying to them, hey,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.710
I'm training for this TV show.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.672
Most of my friends and family
had no idea what Top Shot was.

00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:11.630
But I told them, hey,
I'm training for the show

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.740
and I want to win.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.450
And in order for
me to win, I need

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.790
to go off the grid
here and just fully

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.900
dedicate myself towards
learning as much as I can about

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.830
marksmanship, because I knew
how far behind the curve I was.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.130
Most of the Top Shot
competitors are law enforcement,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:35.330
military, Olympics shooting
champions, lifelong hunters,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.570
people who are like this
is not just a craft,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.880
but it is their life
and their lifestyle.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.450
And then here I am, just
the self-taught amateur

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.690
who occasionally goes to
the range on weekends.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.680
So I really needed to catch up.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.580
And I told my
friends and family,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.650
I appreciate all
the invitations,

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.320
family dinners to
birthday parties.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.260
But unfortunately, I'm not
going to be able to make it.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.072
I won't be attending.

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:04.280
After this whole Top Shot
thing is over, though, yes.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.860
I will resume my
regular social life.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.160
So winning requires
sacrifice and hard work.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.110
And very rarely in life do
things come free or easy.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.130
And that is a big part
of the philosophy.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.960
The philosophical
part of "Shoot to Win"

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.860
is that when we talk about
firearms safety and education,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.420
you can't just buy a gun
and expect that it's just

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.790
going to protect you.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.270
The user needs to
train him or herself

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.510
on how to safely
operate and use it.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.190
And then beyond just
the usage, there

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.910
are additional layers
of training and tactics

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.450
around home defense,
personal protection.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.850
But it does require
effort and time

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.560
and sacrifice and dedication
to a craft in order to win.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.170
And that's not just for
learning how to shoot guns.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.870
It's about the work that
we do in our daily careers.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.640
It's whatever personal goals
that we set out for ourselves

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.630
and that we want to
accomplish in our lives.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.500
Winning is what makes
us better because it's

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.860
that competition
of ideas, and it's

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.560
the competition of
people and companies

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.983
that, ultimately, it
makes everything better.

00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:30.858
AUSTIN WILKINS: That's
some heavy philosophy.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.040
Within that
philosophy, I remember

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.040
reading about using
a mental checklist

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.800
to keep yourself calm.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.550
Do you use checklists in
other parts of life as well?

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.050
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.620
So a big part of
"Shoot to Win," for me,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.760
it was about taking
skills that I

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.210
had developed in
other parts of my life

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.640
and applying that to the show.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.950
And I really have
to credit Google

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.000
for a lot of the
skills-based mindset.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.250
When we talk about
personal development plans

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.290
and what do you want
your career to look like?

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.070
One approach to one's
career could be, well, I

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.700
want to become an insert title.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.750
I want to be a director.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.480
I want to be a VP, or
I want to be a manager.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.920
Well, that's all good and
all, but how do you get?

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.590
How do you actually
achieve those goals?

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.500
And the answer is you
need to have the skills.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.590
You need to have the
skills, and then you

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.320
need to actually
accomplish the work

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.380
to earn the title of
whatever it is that you want.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.730
So the skills piece
here is something

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:57.640
that when I think about this
mental checklist concept--

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.300
so when I was younger, I
played a lot of baseball.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.850
My father taught me
how to play golf.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.620
I'm also a musician.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:12.490
And so when I learned how
to play baseball and golf,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.530
it's all about a checklist.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.150
So everything from throwing a
ball to swinging a bat for me

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.180
on a double basis.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.180
So how do you
properly plays scales,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.622
execute certain types of
attacks on the string?

00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:32.080
That's all in the
checklist, that I

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.610
have to have proper hand
positioning, feet positioning,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.760
motion in my hips,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.130
And shooting, for me,
it's an easy way for me

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.740
to overlay an
existing framework,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.180
this checklist framework.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.830
I overlay that
checklist framework

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.013
when I'm shooting as well.

00:13:52.013 --> 00:13:53.680
AUSTIN WILKINS: I was
watching the show,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.780
and I think you
talked about as well,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.240
I noticed how it kind
of helped you overcome

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.640
the ambiguity that you mentioned
earlier, because you had

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.760
this checklist, especially with
the atlatl competition you did.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.510
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.320
So for those of you who don't
know what Austin just said,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.080
the word was "atlatl."

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.410
It is man's prehistoric
weapons system.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.200
It's basically a spear chucker.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.870
And I had never, ever
heard of this weapon.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.040
And I ended up in an elimination
challenge going head to head,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.345
and I had one hour with
an atlatl specialist.

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:28.720
And believe it or
not, yes, there

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.100
are atlatl specialists
who are quite skilled.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.060
And I had to create a
checklist for myself, because

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.000
for me, that's just the
way that I learn things

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.820
right to bring
clarity and structure

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.220
to ambiguous situations.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.660
And then it's about repeating
the checklist and the steps

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.650
over and over and
over and over again.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.780
And a quick reference
point, Malcolm Gladwell,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.300
in one of his books,
famously stated

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.620
it takes 10,000
repetitions in order

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.990
to even begin to be a master
of that particular skill.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.670
And so I remember having
kind of that 10,000 number

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.190
just ingrained in my
head and thinking,

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.650
OK, with this
atlatl challenge, I

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.120
need to at least get like 1,000
repetitions of my checklist

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.440
in my framework.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.400
And I only had maybe 12 hours.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.930
Basically, it was like,
3:00 PM that afternoon,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.320
where I got one hour of
training with the atlatl expert.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.440
And then that next
morning at 11:00 AM,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.820
I was going into the challenge.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.220
And of course, I had to sleep
during that time as well.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.530
But that mental
checklist, I've developed

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.830
that skill set of
having a checklist,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.050
adhering to the checklist.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.930
And when things
start to go wrong,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.605
I fall back on the checklist.

00:15:57.605 --> 00:15:58.480
AUSTIN WILKINS: Yeah.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.022
I feel that's actually
been something

00:16:00.022 --> 00:16:01.870
that's helped me to a degree.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.790
When I'm doing any type
of competition now,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.890
I've tried to implement
having a checklist.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.440
Because I've definitely
been in several situations

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.440
where I'm about to compete
and, all of a sudden,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.280
everything I know just
goes out the window.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.070
So I appreciate that.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.180
And you mentioned to me that you
were doing a bit of outreach.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.660
Tell us more about that.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.780
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.470
When I won Top Shot in 2012,
I thought that was just

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.850
going to be the end of it.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.700
And I kind of
acknowledged that there

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.440
be maybe a few you five
seconds of fame kind of thing,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.020
and then I'd maybe come back
to Google or come back to tech.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.790
But I ended up spending
3 and 1/2 years full time

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.000
in the firearms industry.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.690
And I was looking
for opportunities

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.910
where I can make a difference.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.730
And a big opportunity
for me has been

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.090
about diversity and
inclusion, specifically

00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:00.450
around LGBT and Asian
outreach and inclusion.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.270
And what has been such
a pleasant surprise

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.950
for me is having my own
negative stereotypes

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:13.000
and preconceptions about
gun owners just bursted.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.599
So when I came in the
firearms industry,

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:21.520
I was ready for a lot of
anti-gay comments and people.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.050
Would I be shunned in the
farms industry because I'm gay?

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.369
Is that going to be a problem?

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.710
And I was kind of
gearing up in my head

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.530
for, I'm going to go
to battle with any

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.910
of these bigots and stuff.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:39.610
But to my pleasant
surprise, those

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.870
fears that I had in my head,
they never materialized.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.560
And I can tell you that
the firearms industry,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.520
both at the executive level
and also just your average gun

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.050
owner, your average gun owner--

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.950
I mean, I've just interacted
with thousands and thousands

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:02.170
and thousands of gun owners
all across the country who they

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.550
could care less that I'm gay.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.270
And that, I believe,
is a huge mark

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.950
of success of diversity and
inclusion, where, ultimately--

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.510
I don't really want to be
special because I'm gay.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.060
I just want to be treated
equally, like everybody else.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.080
And for me, equality
and equal treatment

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.250
means that I'm just treated
like everybody else.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.920
And when I say I'm
married to my husband,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.690
I don't want anybody to flinch.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.220
It should just
be, oh, all right.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:33.430
Great.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.450
You're married to your husband.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.090
What's his name?

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.757
What does he do?

00:18:35.757 --> 00:18:39.130
All your typical,
natural questions

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.440
that come with a
generic conversation

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.850
of talking about your spouse.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.750
AUSTIN WILKINS: You
just want to be normal.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.583
CHRIS CHENG: Mm-hmm.

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:46.010
AUSTIN WILKINS:
Yeah, I get that.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.385
And so you don't
feel like you've

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:48.960
had to fight against
any stereotypes

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.440
during your shooting career?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.190
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.840
I mean, to be real,
it hasn't been

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.000
all rainbows and
butterflies, if you will.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.060
But the overwhelming
reception has been positive.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.860
And so, of course,
sure, you're always

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:11.880
going to have some amount
of anti-LGBT sentiment.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.110
But for me, I see that that
that's the opportunity.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.300
It's the opportunity for
me to engage, at minimum,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:26.740
to be present, to be vocal
and advocate for LGBT rights,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.880
advocate for safety,
LGBT safety, as well.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.510
Obviously, the gay community
were a marginalized group

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:38.590
that is, at times,
targeted for violence.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.600
If you take--

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.190
I don't want to
get too deep here,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.560
but there's been
a lot of shootings

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.490
targeting LGBT community.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.120
And you know the firearm
is a great equalizer,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.700
whether we're talking
about the LGBT community,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.230
the Asian community.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.420
To touch a little bit
upon Asian advocacy,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.540
there are so many Asian-American
shooters in the gun community,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.630
way more than I realized.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.170
My home range in
Richmond, California,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.890
up in the Bay Area,
every weekend,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.720
I would say probably 30% of
the shooters there are Asian.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.110
And then out of that 30%, about
half of them are Filipinos.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.610
There's just like Filipinos
all over the place.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.350
And it's so cool to see that.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.050
One thing I think that's
really been interesting

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.130
for me to learn
through my experience

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.140
is that gun ownership,
for gun owners,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.930
is not always about the gun.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.330
It is about freedom and
values, like self-reliance

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.930
and independence, and then
this piece about community.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.540
A lot of gun owners, they go
to the range, yes, to shoot,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.070
but it's almost as much as
for the social interaction,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:09.310
the community aspect of knowing
that I have a group of people

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.090
who I can rely on,
either just for fun,

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.430
for support, et cetera.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.650
But that's been a really
eye-opening experience for me,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:26.730
to see the Asian Community
be such actually prominent

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.080
component of the community.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.070
And the second thing I want
to mention really quick

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:38.980
is in 1992, here in LA, we
had the Rodney King riots.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.810
And I was 12 years old at the
time, living in Orange County.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.310
I'm living at home.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.320
And I remember seeing
the riots on TV.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.950
And as a 12-year-old,
you only take in so much

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.630
of certain experiences.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.520
And all I remember
was LA was on fire.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.410
Rodney King, Reginald Denny,
some of the big moments--

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.320
Mark Fuhrer, et
cetera, or Fuhrman.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.850
But anyway, the piece that
I've learned as an adult

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.490
was Koreatown.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:15.210
So during the Rodney
King riots, Koreatown

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.850
was very near all the rioting
and the looting and violence.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:29.100
The Korean-American community
contacted LAPD to say,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.840
the riots coming our way.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.370
We need help.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.670
Please send your
officers and barricades.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.340
And the LAPD at the time,
they were overwhelmed.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.590
I mean, the National
Guard was coming in,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.000
and there were other priorities.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.640
And so Koreatown basically had
to take care of themselves.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.060
And Korean-Americans were
using their personal firearms

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.190
to protect their businesses,
their personal property,

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.180
and themselves.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.380
AUSTIN WILKINS: Yeah,
I've seen videos.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.422
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, right?

00:22:59.422 --> 00:23:03.060
So if you google Koreatown
Rodney King riots,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.980
and go to Google
Image search, you

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.960
will see these images of
Koreans, Korean-Americans,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.010
patrolling on the roofs
of their businesses,

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.960
right down across the way here.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.570
So firearms ownership
and usage, when

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.810
it comes to
Asian-Americans, it's

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.882
been another kind of fascinating
experience to look into.

00:23:28.882 --> 00:23:30.090
AUSTIN WILKINS: That's great.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.670
Thank you.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.120
And one thing you're
heavily involved in

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.750
is safety and education
with the NSSF.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.930
Why don't you tell us a
little bit about that.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.000
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.910
So with the industry-- so
I'm a safety ambassador,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.770
or I'm very much promoting
safety and education.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.340
And so with the industry,
we created a whole set

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.760
of 25 YouTube videos
that I mentioned earlier,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.300
where it's all about the basic
fundamentals of marksmanship

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.860
that complement the
book "Shoot to Win."

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:09.420
So if we want to organize
the world's information

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.830
and make it universally
acceptable and useful--

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.350
accessible, there we go,
accessible and useful.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.170
Remembering my Google days here.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.400
It's about generating
useful content.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.490
And for me, because I
attribute the internet

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.330
to teaching me so
much about safety

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.030
and about marksmanship
fundamentals that I

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.440
want to give back.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.440
I think each of
us, as individuals,

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.010
we have a duty to share
information, to make it useful,

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.380
to make it accessible.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.820
And so these YouTube
videos, yeah, they're.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.150
They're two to four
minute long segments.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.530
And I acknowledge that we
all learn in different ways.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.020
So while some people
like reading a book,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.590
other people need
to see a video.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.700
And so ultimately,
it's about I want

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.860
to let users choose
how they want

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.952
to consume the information.

00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:11.160
AUSTIN WILKINS: That's great.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.300
And should people that have
never, or never, may never

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.300
shoot be interested in
learning about firearm safety?

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.050
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.060
It's an interesting question.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.110
I would say, look.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:27.000
Even if you are never interested
in learning how to shoot,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.370
I still think it's
important to just understand

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.300
the safety fundamentals.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.760
And some of the basics are don't
put your finger on the trigger

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.530
unless you're ready to shoot.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:42.100
Don't point a gun at something
you don't intend to destroy.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.260
And so if you are a non gun
owner, a non-shooter, that

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.680
if you see, if you just happen
to be in an environment,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.370
where maybe it's a family member
or a friend who maybe is just

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.470
showing off some
of their collection

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.450
at home over a
Thanksgiving dinner,

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.450
or something like that,
that at a minimum,

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:06.500
you can recognize what safe
gun handling looks like.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.180
AUSTIN WILKINS: And
should beginners,

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.980
people who are likely
reading your book,

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.380
should they be scared of
any particular weapon when

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.900
they're starting out?

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.650
CHRIS CHENG: It's an
interesting question.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.630
I mean, the short answer is no.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.190
The new shooter
shouldn't be scared

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.230
of any particular weapon,
because the basics of firearm

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:29.940
safety, they cut across all
different makes and models.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.230
I would say the nuance
to this question is back

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.170
to this caliber conversation.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.960
To really simplify,
caliber is the diameter

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.540
of the bullet at
its widest point.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.960
And generically speaking,
the larger the caliber,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.910
the larger the boom.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.970
The larger the boom, the harder
the gun can be to control.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.270
So for a new
shooter, for example,

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.250
I'm not going to
put a large caliber

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.420
firearm in a new shooter's hand
and be like, here, go at it.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.120
Just like anything,
you've got to start small.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.860
It's all baby steps.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.975
Hey, let's start with
a 22 caliber firearm.

00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:08.600
Once you're more
comfortable with that,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.340
we can move our way up into
9 millimeter, et cetera,

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.310
et cetera.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.890
AUSTIN WILKINS: And how
safe our shooting sports?

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:16.640
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.020
The shooting sports are one of
the safest sports out there.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.900
There aren't many gun deaths
related to the shooting sports.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.080
It is our dedication to safety.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.990
So the shooting sports, of
course, it's a competition.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.480
It's supposed to be
fun and friendly,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:41.240
but that needs to be supported
with safety as the core

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.130
fundamental.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.910
You can't have fun
unless you're safe,

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.870
and that the people
participating in the activity

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.370
are safe.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.730
It's interesting to
think about other sports,

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:57.440
where there are people who die
in football and other sports.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.990
But the shooting sports
is incredibly safe,

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:05.540
and I don't know anybody who's
died or has been seriously

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.580
injured as a result
of participating

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.665
in the shooting sports.

00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:09.540
AUSTIN WILKINS: Yeah.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.998
You'll have to
fact-check me on it,

00:28:10.998 --> 00:28:12.680
but I heard that it
was, statistically,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.950
one of the safest
sports, injury-wise.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.620
So how do you get started
safely with a firearm

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.720
if you don't know anyone, if you
don't have any kind of mentor

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.540
in the business?

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.290
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.660
I mean, that's basically kind of
where, in some ways, I started.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.720
If you don't have any
friends or family members,

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.190
I would say go seek
out the information,

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.490
whether it's my
book, "Shoot to Win,"

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.160
or whether it's finding other
authoritative resources online.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.070
Most local gun
ranges have some kind

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.570
of beginners shooting seminar.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:57.580
Or if you go rent a gun at a
range, pretty much every range,

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.200
as long as you
acknowledge yourself,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.480
or identify yourself
as a new shooter,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.970
they are more than
happy to help walk you

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.840
through the basic fundamentals.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.600
Because they want
to make sure you're

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.000
safe, that the people
around you are also safe.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.290
And so yeah, those are
some very basic ways

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.217
to get involved, if
you're interested.

00:29:16.217 --> 00:29:18.550
AUSTIN WILKINS: I've noticed
that both rifle and archery

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.190
ranges, that everyone is
always right there to help you

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.350
if you need help, if
you're asking for it.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.850
So I just have a
couple of questions

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.225
that are miscellaneous
questions,

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:28.340
and we'll hand it
off to the audience.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.883
So number 1, as a
shooting competitor,

00:29:30.883 --> 00:29:32.800
or someone who's getting
into shooting sports,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.390
how do you pay for ammo?

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.140
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:40.360
So ammunition is usually
a considerable cost.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.920
AUSTIN WILKINS: Yeah.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.570
CHRIS CHENG: Some competitors
actually make their own ammo,

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.450
either through buying
the different components.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:55.060
So you've got a cartridge, which
is basically like a metal tube.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.610
You've got a primer, which
is basically a snap cap that

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.900
goes in the back.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.945
Then you have gun powder,
and then you have the bullet.

00:30:01.945 --> 00:30:04.570
So a lot of competitors will buy
all those separate components,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.330
and then you have a machine
where you can basically

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.420
load all the components
and make your own ammo.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.550
If you get super advanced--

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.050
but it's funny, being advanced
is actually very basic,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.930
where there are some competitors
who will go get lead.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.480
They'll reclaim
lead from a range

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.520
and they will melt it down.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.660
Then they will literally
cast their own bullets.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.210
And that's a way to save
money, but obviously, that

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.960
requires a lot more work.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.170
For sponsored shooters,
like I was, Bass Pro Shops,

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.930
they paid for all my ammunition.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.750
And it was pretty
incredible, I got to say,

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:49.840
to have that kind of logistical
and financial support

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.030
from a national sponsor.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.560
But what's really
interesting is to become

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.710
a really good marksman
actually doesn't

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.730
require shooting a lot of
live rounds out of a gun.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.450
One thing that I learned
when I was training

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.580
is you can perform
what's called dry firing.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.710
So dry firing is when you're
just shooting an empty gun.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:20.240
You can either put plastic or
a kind of inert bullet-shaped,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.160
or cartridge-shaped objects into
the gun to simulate the action,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160
but it doesn't
actually fire anything.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:34.150
So back to repeating a motion
10,000 times before you begin

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.660
to become a master,
dry fire is a way

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.510
that I was able to
practice in my own home

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.370
with an unloaded
firearm with what

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.620
are called snap caps, which,
again, are like fake inert

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.340
rounds.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.540
And I'd just be watching
TV and just practicing

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.730
the fundamentals.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.100
Alternatively, there
are laser guns.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.090
So it's literally like a
plastic or metal-shaped gun.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.270
But it doesn't shoot
anything, other than a laser,

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.710
every time you pull the trigger.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.770
So it's a big way to
save money and to train,

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.320
pretty much, literally
anywhere, where you

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.332
can just a shoot a laser gun.

00:32:16.332 --> 00:32:17.540
AUSTIN WILKINS: A laser beam.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.010
CHRIS CHENG: Mm-hmm.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:18.310
AUSTIN WILKINS: Cool.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.060
Well, I think I've
asked enough questions.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.450
Let's pass it off
to the audience.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.970
We've got a box here.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.095
You can catch it and throw
it around to each other.

00:32:28.175 --> 00:32:29.550
AUDIENCE: So when
I'm practicing,

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.270
which, clearly, I need more of--

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.588
AUSTIN WILKINS: You came close.

00:32:34.588 --> 00:32:35.630
AUDIENCE: Not that close.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.350
AUSTIN WILKINS: Not that close.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.767
AUDIENCE: There's
always some sort

00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:42.050
of trade-off between practicing
enough and then fatigue,

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.080
where your technique gets really
bad as you practice too much.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.890
What are your techniques or
approach to managing that?

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.430
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.430
At a certain point, there's
diminishing returns when

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.790
you're practicing anything.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.510
I think when I am
experiencing fatigue

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.940
towards the tail end
of a practice session,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.190
it's a question of,
do I need to stop?

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.120
So I guess what, in my
mind, back to the checklist,

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.510
if my fatigue is, in
any way, compromising

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.910
me being able to safely
handle a firearm,

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.970
then I just need to stop.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.550
So that's kind of core
principle number 1.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.220
If I'm just too tired and
exhausted, my legs are tired,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.200
or my eyes are tired, or if
I'm losing too much focus,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.570
then I just need to stop.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.600
But I think right there
are other moments where

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.470
you need to ask yourself,
I am fatigued and tired.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.150
Is this a moment
where I can push?

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:43.250
Because to build
up your endurance,

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.230
ultimately, we all
need to learn, hey,

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.250
when we're up against
the wall and we're tired,

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.792
you've been programming
for 10 hours,

00:33:48.792 --> 00:33:52.190
or whatever, do you stop
or do you keep on pushing.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.590
Because I think,
ultimately, if you

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:59.570
want to be really good
at a craft, I would say,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.860
generically speaking, it's
about how long can you

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:10.230
execute the task at a high
caliber and high competency,

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:14.219
and improving your endurance is
obviously a big part of that.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.219
AUSTIN WILKINS: I noticed
during our competition

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.718
here that while, overall, you're
hitting the center targets

00:34:19.718 --> 00:34:22.010
most of the time, you had a
tendency towards the higher

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.270
side.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.995
Is that an explicit
aiming strategy?

00:34:25.995 --> 00:34:27.120
CHRIS CHENG: Good question.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.540
I'll be honest to say, no.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.210
But to your point,
every firearm,

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.250
every weapon system is
a little bit different.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.278
So naturally, with
like Nerf darts,

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.820
there's going to be
some kind of arc.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.463
It depends on how far you are.

00:34:42.463 --> 00:34:43.880
Clearly, there's
not-- well, there

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.560
is some wind blowing
around, but not

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:52.384
enough wind to really knock
the projectile off course.

00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:55.760
And one thing that I've
learned in competition

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:03.670
is sometimes when we're under
stress, the adrenaline rush,

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.670
it shuts off the thinking
part of our brain

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.290
and we sort of revert back to
dumb amphibians and just sort

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.570
of trying to do the
same thing, expecting

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.530
a different result, which is
just, obviously, not logical.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.700
And so I actually wasn't even
paying attention to that,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.430
because I was amped
up for the challenge.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.440
So if I had noticed
what was happening,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.900
I would have taken a beat,
a pause, and said, OK, wait.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.412
My shots are landing high.

00:35:32.412 --> 00:35:33.495
What do I need to do here?

00:35:33.495 --> 00:35:35.828
And it's probably just I need
to aim a little bit lower.

00:35:35.828 --> 00:35:39.420
But obviously, things worked
out for me in this challenge.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.680
AUSTIN WILKINS: Killed it.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.130
And those targets
are regulation,

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.020
so you don't have to worry.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.960
AUDIENCE: With all the news
of gun violence and gun

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.670
control being around
lately, I'm just

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.610
wondering what your
thoughts are around those.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.510
AUSTIN WILKINS: Yeah.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.360
Clearly, it's such
a top of mind topic

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.000
for not just Americans, but
really, across the world.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.440
And I think my comment here
is it goes back to education,

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.120
that often, we have either
decision-makers that they

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.500
aren't educated enough.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.800
They don't really
understand what

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.520
reasonable or
effective solutions

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.910
might be available for us.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.990
And I think when you read
headlines, the media,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.480
just in general, they
oversimplify everything.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.570
It doesn't matter
what the topic is.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.060
But what I've learned is that
there are a lot of nuances.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.490
And it's often not
as simple as saying,

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.830
hey, we just need to ban
the thing, or restrict it.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.060
Now, not to say that
that can't be effective.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.880
But the problem
is certain actions

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.530
have either unintended
downstream consequences,

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.530
that if we think, oh, the
shortsighted solution might

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.910
be to ban the thing.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.640
But then downstream--

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.587
I think about prohibition,
when our country decided,

00:36:59.587 --> 00:37:00.170
you know what?

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:01.790
We're going to ban alcohol.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.740
And what happened?

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.860
It just gets driven underground.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:12.080
When it is so easy
to make a thing,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.947
whether we're talking
about alcohol,

00:37:13.947 --> 00:37:15.530
whether we're talking
about a firearm.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.750
A firearm is not
that hard to make.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:22.320
Americans have been making
their own guns for centuries.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.780
And so when we talk
about gun violence

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.400
and possible solutions,
it is much more nuanced

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.390
and complicated.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.820
So one thing that I
really want to share,

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.810
and a kind of a pretty deep
insight that I've learned over

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:46.910
the years that touches upon this
topic, is back to the concept

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.480
that, for a lot of gun owners,
it's not always about the gun,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.760
but it's about
what it represents.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.210
And it comes back to
identity and it comes back

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.510
to safety, personal safety.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:04.460
For many gun owners, I own a
gun, I feel safe with my gun.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.970
I see my gun as the thing
that will protect myself,

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.740
my family, my
property, et cetera.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.830
So when we have
these conversations,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.195
when we talk about gun violence,
naturally, the conversation,

00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:19.790
at some point, will lead to
some kind of conversation

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.360
around restrictions, banning.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.580
Those conversations
strike deep, deep, deep

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:34.670
into the heart of gun
owners' personal identity.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.880
Many gun owners, they
see this chatter.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.930
And basically, the
interpretation is these people,

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:47.180
they don't want me to
exist, that they don't agree

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.430
with the fact that I
own a gun, that they

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:54.050
don't want me or my lifestyle
or my philosophy to exist.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.170
And for me, when I
think about being gay,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.910
I know what that sensation
is like, that there

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.480
are people out there who
are vehemently anti-gay.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.680
They wish I was dead.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.930
They wish all gay people
were dead and disappeared off

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.190
this earth.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.175
And so as a gun
owner, I mean, I also

00:39:09.175 --> 00:39:11.550
know what that sensation is
like, too, for people to say,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:18.170
oh, I think guns are bad, that
gun owners shouldn't own guns.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.970
But so it comes back to
education and research

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:27.530
and really understanding not
just the technical mechanics

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.180
around firearms,
but there's also

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.870
the political and the policy
mechanics around firearms laws

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:41.600
and how they're enforced, or
not enforced, in many ways.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.840
At a high level, to
really, I think, address--

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.920
the heart of your
question is probably like,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.220
how do we fix this problem?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:54.440
I mean, I'm saddened and
shocked and horrified every time

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.520
there's yet another
instance of gun violence.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.240
Nobody wins.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.920
Nobody wins when
people are dying.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.340
That's a sort of
core basic tenant.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.900
So for me, I think back to,
how can I make a difference?

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.655
And for me, my small part
is education and training

00:40:16.655 --> 00:40:19.370
and to really
highlight that look.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.290
Your average gun
owner, we're just

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.070
regular people who want
to protect ourselves,

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:30.230
our loved ones, our
communities to make sure

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.120
that we all feel safe.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.730
So it's complicated.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:41.060
But I'm also confident that,
ultimately, we'll get there.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.890
I mean, things are
pretty bad right now.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.010
They seem to only
be getting worse,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.570
but there was a
time in our country

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.780
where things were better.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.320
And I think most
things go in cycles,

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.920
whether we're
talking about this,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.690
the political
environment, et cetera.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:03.020
So it's a matter of time, but
if we engage on the topic,

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.390
we can't be scared.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.050
We can't be afraid to
talk about these issues,

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.750
because running
away from problems

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.948
is not the way to solve them.

00:41:13.948 --> 00:41:16.240
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
about that really bizarre

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.800
spear.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.610
What's some of the
other weapons that you

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:23.050
were able to get exposed
to that you had never

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.315
seen before that we're just
like, wow, what is this?

00:41:26.315 --> 00:41:27.590
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:31.360
I mean the atlatl was definitely
one of, probably, the biggest

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.590
like, whoa, what is this thing?

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.860
But I think another
weapon that comes to mind

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.130
is the M1919 machine gun.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.920
So what's so cool
about Top Shot is

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.100
since it's on the
History Channel,

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.720
all the challenges
are rooted in history.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.680
So the M1919 machine gun, it's
a World War I, World War II

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.430
machine gun.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.170
And this challenge
that I competed in,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:02.200
they found a half track,
which it's a big army

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.380
truck with wheels on the
front, but tank treads

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.080
in the back with an open bed.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.000
And they mounted this
machine gun right

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.170
into the open bed of
the truck and they

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.900
sped us competitors at 30
miles an hour down a pathway.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.810
And there was a simulated war
field of mortar explosions.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.750
And so we had to shoot right
at these exploding targets.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:29.210
And I mean, that was just like
an experience of a lifetime.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.020
And I don't know if I'm ever
going to have an opportunity

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.900
to do that again.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:41.270
I think another weapon that
was truly fun and unique,

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:45.250
it's a pistol called the FN57.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.510
So it's a 5.7
millimeter round that

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.550
screams at super high velocity.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:53.180
So it's a small round--

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:53.680
yeah.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.480
It's a super fun gun to shoot.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.760
And the challenge
that I was in, it

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.320
was a SWAT rappelling challenge.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.410
So there was a custom
three-story kind of facade

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.050
that the Top Shot
team built. We're

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:16.120
strapped in with the carabiner,
with a rope, and a pulley kind

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:21.460
of device, and shoot
targets through windows,

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.000
unload holster, rappel
down to the next level,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.230
engage more exploding targets.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.190
And so that was just
another great challenge,

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:35.830
where I did very well, and
had no rappelling or SWAT team

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.720
experience.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.930
That was great.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:38.300
AUSTIN WILKINS: Thank you.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.440
We have time for
one more question.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.140
I think we had a
hand up over there.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.080
AUDIENCE: What age do you
think is appropriate for maybe

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.060
starting education on guns?

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.530
For example, I grew
up in the South

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.790
so I was surrounded by guns.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.248
It was much more available and
you develop a different kind

00:43:51.248 --> 00:43:53.950
of respect for the safety
and the treatment of guns

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.430
than you might otherwise would.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.180
I kind of feel that
it's important, now

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.270
that I have children,
to start teaching them--

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.310
basically, a lot of
gun safety things,

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.050
don't play around
with these things.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.610
Don't put your finger
on the trigger.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.480
Yeah, I was wondering what
your thoughts were on that.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.940
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah,
great question.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:18.020
It is never too young to learn
the basics of firearm safety.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.170
So for young children, the
industry has a simple framework

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:28.450
for young kids, which is
basically, look, don't touch,

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.850
tell an adult. That's it.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.930
So there's an ambassador.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.580
His name is Eddie Eagle.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.950
So there's children's
books that just

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:40.240
reiterate those core
steps, which is actually

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.440
great for adults, too.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.500
Like, look, don't
touch, go tell an adult.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:49.540
Or go tell a gun owner, hey,
there's this gun over here.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.940
Don't touch it.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.637
The next step, though,
is it's kind of natural.

00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:56.470
Well, if you want to
teach your children how

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.000
to shoot, what's the right age?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.340
And the answer is
it always depends.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.620
I mean my father
taught me how to shoot

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.290
when I was six years
old, and he decided

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.320
that me being six years
old was sufficient,

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.090
but not all six-year-olds
are created equal.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.340
And so it's really,
I would say--

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.650
I mean, I'm not a
parent, but I would

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.630
say that each
parent needs to make

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.690
his or her own
determination as to when

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.690
your child is ready to
learn how to actually shoot.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:33.090
But the basic fundamentals of
safety can start at any age.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.370
AUSTIN WILKINS: I think I got
my first rifle in fifth grade.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.870
CHRIS CHENG: Very cool.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:38.080
AUSTIN WILKINS: All right.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.413
Well, I think that's all the
time we have for questions.

00:45:40.413 --> 00:45:42.110
A big round of
applause for Chris.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:45.160
[APPLAUSE]
