Congratulations, you've reached
the end of this course.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.890
Like an otter,
you too can rock the shell.

&gt;&gt; Now you're ready to go on to any
number of subjects that depend on

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.230
the command line interface.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.330
If you're interested in running Linux
servers, take a look at out Linux for

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.010

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.910
&gt;&gt; Another command line
tool to learn is Git.

version control system.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.120

resources in the instructors notes and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.610

forums to share your questions, and

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.170

&gt;&gt; We hope you enjoyed this course.
