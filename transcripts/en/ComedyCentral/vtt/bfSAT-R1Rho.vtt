Boom boom sauce, cookie wrappers

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:08.274
I live a very interesting life-
Coffee tea water milk.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:12.812
I'll tell you this my life is
filled with sauce and sweet.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.247
It's like you opened a hello
fresh box 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.182
and you have no clue
what you're making.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.284
I think this thing makes a pipe
bomb I don't know.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.525
It's the Bonfire, Comedy
Central Radio, Sirius XM 95.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.627
Big Jay Oakerson.
That's Dan Soder.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.730
Hi. The whole crew is here
joining us in the studio today.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.098
You know him, everyone.
You love him.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.366
There's no need
for introduction anymore.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.568
People just say to throw him
the third mic.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.439
It's Shane Gillis, everybody.
Yo. Some call him the ...

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.809
He's the Benjamin Franklin
of Sheetz nation.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.179
I do declare.
He goes,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.649
"I've traveled far, wide,
Mechanicsburg, Harrisburg ..."

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.386
Shippensburg. Rainsburg.
Stroudsburg Carlsberg.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.255
Hell yeah, dude.
We could spend two hours

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.724
just naming all the burgs
of Pennsylvania.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.593
Hey it's the Aaronburgs
of Pennsylvania. Fuck yeah.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.629
The people love and we love when
Shane Gillis is here, of course.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.132
You came in on a day we-
He moved the noodle.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.733
The reason Shane's
on the show today

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.869
is 'cause he fucking moved
the needle,

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.104
and he got us in touch.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.639
We got a styrofoam box
of Sheetz.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.843
Could this be
a fucking explosion?

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.978
Maybe.
We have Shane here today

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.781
for the unveiling
of an offering.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.383
What else do you call it?
I mean a temptation.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.852
I just want to say real quick,
Wa-

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.753
From the fine people
at Sheetz themselves

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.755
Wow.
Yeah. Don't talk about Wawa.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.424
Wawa hasn't
acknowledged us at all.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.960
You want to open this up?
You mentioned Sheetz name next-

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.928
Oh my god,
it's the head of Nikki Glaser.

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.364
Holy shit. They sent a message.
They did it.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.967
They send us...
with a note that says,

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.137
"Sorry this isn't
more official yet.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.841
I would have sent some boneless
wings or popcorn chicken over,

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.978
but I'm guessing you probably
don't have a deep fryer

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.379
in the studio of your offices."

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.448
He's right,
but we are working on that.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.919
"We'll figure something
better out soon.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.454
In the mean time,
I'll keep those packages

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.489
coming with different food.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.791
In this package,"
Here's what we have right here,

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.593
and Shane break this out
if you know these things here.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.596
Yeah, Shane what are these?
Those are your typical sauces.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.331
No, no. I have the list here
of what they are,

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.500
so I can tell you,
but you can tell us

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.736
if these things are good,
you tell me Shane.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.039
There's reverse
chocolate chip cookies.

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.841
Yep, there we go.
They're good.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.509
You can see them. It looks good.
I've never had one.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:26.646
You can see it though.White
chocolate macadamia nut cookie.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.147
Great choice. Phenomenal.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.815
Reese's peanut
butter cup cookies.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.117
Shut up!

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.686
Oh god, let's all get
fat together and mush.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.087
Peperoni rolls that need to be

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.522
heated up in the oven
or toaster oven.

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:37.723
Fuck that.
Pepperoni rolls!

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.058
I mean those
are gonna be unreal.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.227
Eat those pep rolls straight
out of the garbage bag

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.029
that they mailed them to us in.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.698
What's this?
That's the way to keep it cold.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.635
Dan's never seen things.
Ice is cool.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.237
Here's the three
other things they sent,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.139
they answer your question.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:58.511
There's jalapeno ranch sauce,
there's Boom Boom sauce ...

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:00.346
That's the go-to.
That's their thing.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.547
Boom Boom sauce, dude.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.549
This is Boom Boom obviously.
I don't want to ...

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:06.319
by the way, there's secret
recipe next to Boom Boom sauce

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.954
that I'm not gonna
read out loud.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.255
It- What it is.
Wait, they got it in there?

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:10.489
It just says ...

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:12.225
He says more or less what it is.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.426
And what is-

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.660
It's sort of
like going like,

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:17.129
if someone says
McDonald's secret sauce,

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:18.764
and you go,
it's basically Thousand Island."

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.032
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.334
That's got to be the
secret, right?

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.069
No.
Do you know what that is at all?

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.270
Barbecue.

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.972

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.378
Sheetz, it's been nice
doing business with you,

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.280
but you take your circus
fucking flavors out of here.

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.481

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:37.016

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.851

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.186

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.454
Oh,

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:21.527
That means we know the guy,
at least who's next to the guy,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.762

[shaneinculous@gmail6].

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:56.722
It was pretty adorable.

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:57.923
All the kids,

00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:00.159
especially if you're
in your bathing suits-

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:01.627
Don't tell your 
mommies or daddies

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.629
or we're both going
to be in trouble.

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.131
Just send it.
Come on, you're big now.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.432
Dude. Boom.
Boom sauce.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:07.733
That's the
sauce dude.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:08.934
I kind of want to take this
home.

00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:09.835
That's not boom boom.

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:10.636
Oranges.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:11.871
That's jalapeno ranch.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.105
This is jalapeno ranch?

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:13.906
Yeah.
I kind of

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.107
want to take
this boom boom home.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.642
Black Lou, how do we split it
between the two of us?

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:17.943
Oh no, you-

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:19.178
Nah. I mean,
I gotta go to spots.

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:20.379
You ain't split no 
sauce with a black man.

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.680
You take it. I just
wanted to taste it.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:22.882
Yeah, well I mean

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.150
I would like to take it home.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.152
But I imagine you have
to keep it cool.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.853
And I have to go do spots
so I can't.

00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:29.188
Want me to take it?

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:30.956
I bring these cookies with me.

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:32.625
Want me to take it?
You get it later.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:33.893
No. It's alright.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.127
We have a fridge 
here I can-

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.796
Gay.
Yeah Dan.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.531
Me and Kristine
will be your camel.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.732
Cool dude.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.668
I know factiousness
when you say it.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:44.804
Being a sheets sauce mule

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.906
was actually a pretty
respectable profession

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.174
when I was growing up.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:51.244
I have held many sheets
bottles for people.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.679
There's nothing wrong
with being a sheets mule-

00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:54.914
Sheets mule.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.148
Oh, Mr.
Big Shit

00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.349
thinks being a sheets mule

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:58.884
is all of the sudden
an honest way to make a living.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.119
He goes,
"Hey, I'm sorry.

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:01.921
You haven't been home
in a while."

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.289
The flip chocolate 
chip cookie is-

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.523
Unbelievable

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:05.758
Pretty impressive.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.026
I'm going to do
what Jacob's doing.

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.329
I going to try a little bit
of this bar-be-que sauce.

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:12.031
Do you think it's like
Cosby's bar-be-que sauce.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.432
Does it get the ladies
[hibby jibby?

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:14.800
Now is that
what he said?

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.068
Something like that right?

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.269
What
did you think?

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:18.504
Find Bill Cosby-

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:19.705
Fantastic.

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:20.940
Oh.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.875
Find Bill
Cosby defends rape

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:25.277
on Cosby Show.
My bar-be-que sauce-

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.545
Oh, I know
which one you mean.

00:07:26.578 --> 00:07:27.746
Yeah,
don't you.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:28.981
That's all
it takes.

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:30.516
Everybody
gets a drop of my barb

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:32.351
and they get all hibby jibby.

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:33.686
Yeah. And then I rape them.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.954
It's just-

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.288
I'm a rape them as soon as

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:37.556
they eat that sandwich.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:38.791
They fall
asleep come in

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:40.025
and take sex from them.

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:41.260
Then I come
and rape 'em.

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:42.628
I'm going to trick 
her in drinking that.

00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:44.363
I'm Bill Cosby.
I'm going to rape her.

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.298
Hey Bill.
This seems real raw.

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.267
Do you want massage
the language a little bit.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.668
No, I feel
like this bar-be-que sauce

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.237
could be used in a marinade
or just straight up.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.171
Dude.
He just took-

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:53.105
Wow.

00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:54.340
Black Lou
just took a shot of it.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.274
Black Lou
I swear to you-

00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:56.175
Everybody.

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.276
I'll give
you twenty dollars right now

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:58.177
if you just fucking chug it.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.378
You just
did that.

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:00.579
Chug it
like a forty.

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:01.447
He just-

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.748
he just went back
and took a shot.

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:03.983
Like a forty.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.184
No shit.

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:06.385
I mean
straight up.

00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:08.787
You're not
one of those slam dunking kinds.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.122
You drink like it's a forty.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:11.690
Wait, do we
have a brown paper bag

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:13.058
we could wrap it in first?

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.061
I want to wrap it
and have him chug it.

00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:16.829
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:19.298
culinary development.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.799
Is there a
peanut butter cup cookie?

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:22.067
I was about
to break into one.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.335
You want to-
I'll go halves on one.

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:24.603
Oh.

00:08:24.636 --> 00:08:25.804
If you could
find a way to reach

00:08:25.837 --> 00:08:27.806
into Dan's bag and grab it out,
that'd be great.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.108
White
chocolate macadamia dude.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.911
I've been handing out macadamia.
Yo, I'm about to flip out.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.245
Yeah, you guys are-

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:34.613
Yeah, dude chill, dude.

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:35.948

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:37.149
Dan, dude
chill, bud.

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:38.384
Dan you're too wired up.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.753
Why don't you try a little bit
of my barbecue sauce?

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.054
I got one.

00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:44.256
You know you'll try 
the barbecue sauce,

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:45.658

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:48.227
Huggy buggy,
that's what I want.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.461
It's
funny that-

00:08:49.494 --> 00:08:51.530
Huggy buggy.

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:53.265
This is what he though 
being romantic was.

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:54.500
Yeah.

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:55.935
They were
like no you act like this

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.469
is a sexual scene
and they were like, alright,

00:08:57.502 --> 00:09:00.005
maybe a little less rapey.
Being real rapey.

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:01.273
Hey, Bill-

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:02.908
You know how
many karate chops

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.310
to the carotid artery
I've saved?

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:05.511
Yeah.

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.246
With my
barbecue sauce?

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.882
Hey, Bill,
we were over in video village,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.886
comes off real rapey
what you say to your wife.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:18.190
I just want to know if you're,
I mean, it's your show, but-

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:20.492
We saw you

00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:21.927
over at Crafty

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.897
trying to put something
on all of the crispy treats.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.198
That's
my barbecue sauce.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.800
That ain't nothin'
that's just how I fart.

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.034
Just tryna

I'm tryin' to get
everyone huggy buggy.

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:34.974
On Friday evenings

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:36.709
I like to be the Zamboni

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:39.612
and clean up all the dead
bodies around Crafty.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:42.414
I come through and I make sure
the ice is smooth.

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.049
Dawg.
Dawg.

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.250

we have to take
our second break?

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.853
Yeah, but I want to
keep eating cookies.

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:49.088
Well that's,
what better time?

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.422
You gotta

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:51.657
Yeah, yeah
I can-

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.491
Not 'til 8,

00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:53.726
Yeah,

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.927

00:10:24.823 --> 00:10:26.492

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:41.573
Let's do it.

00:10:41.606 --> 00:10:42.808
Oh, dude,
Christine warmed up

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.009
some of the peperoni.

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:45.310
Oh, really?

00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:46.512
Mother
fucking pep rolls,

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.681
fresh out of the mic.

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:49.882
I just want
to say,

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.950
for the record, I want to say,
before we try these,

00:10:51.983 --> 00:10:53.152
I want to be fair to Sheets

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:56.722
and say we were told
to toaster oven or oven.

00:10:57.355 --> 00:10:59.158
They do not say microwave.

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.893
I worry about how
this is gonna come out.

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.494
Do you thing
this is going to greatly effect

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:03.729
how you judge them?

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:04.930
I might
judge harshly.

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:06.365
Look at all
these cookies, though.

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.633
God, we have so much.

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.268
Christine
went to go cook.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.602
What a bountiful expedition.

00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:11.536
You gonna out

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.638

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:13.472
Oh, hell yeah.

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:14.339
Are you really?

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.507
That doesn't sound
like a good idea.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.775
I don't think
that's what it's for.

00:11:16.808 --> 00:11:18.310
Boom boom and pep
might not mix.

00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:20.245
This is you living dangerously
but that's what cheese

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:22.381
is all about
is innovating and expanding.

00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:24.149
That's the
type of attitude

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.885
that'll get you into Altoona.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.987
I'm sorry,
I'm a creative type.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.756
Well, it's
the Silicon Valley

00:11:30.789 --> 00:11:33.559
of gas station food.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.029
It literally
tastes like the Stromboli

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:38.764
I make.
That's a compliment.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:44.870
I make a mean ass Stromboli.
It's good.

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:46.138
Sheetz.

00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.440
I think you might be
looking at a new member.

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:49.742
You're just
jumping over.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:50.943
Of Sheetz Nation.

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:52.211
You know.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.545
I mean, we had this
conversation.

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:54.880
You're just gonna
jump over.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.649
[inaudible]

00:11:57.549 --> 00:11:58.751
jump over.
Wow.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.052
I mean, we move
as a family.

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:01.353
We all know that.
We move as a family.

00:12:01.386 --> 00:12:02.554
We're a Wawa family.

00:12:02.587 --> 00:12:04.456
Well, no.
Now we're in between people.

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.658
Just sending these in alone.

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:08.026
With
the sauces.

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.361
It's huge.

00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:11.664
From the research and
development  sector,

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:14.066
it's really ja-
That's like, you know.

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:15.334
It's just
people who give a shit.

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:16.568
Dude,
there's guys

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:17.770
in camouflage lab coats,

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:20.005
right now, working
so fucking hard

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.341
to figure out how to get the new
Pep Roll out.

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:24.143
There's
someone right now,

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.879
busting his ass,
in rural Pennsylvania,

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.081
deep, deep in a lab.

00:12:29.114 --> 00:12:31.583
Guys.
How 'bout two cheeses?

00:12:31.616 --> 00:12:33.252
I'm sorry, man, I'm just
the janitor here, but ...

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.453
No, no, no, no, no.

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:35.721
That's interesting 
you say that.

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.022
What's your name?
Derek.

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:38.257
Derek,
come here.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.458
How long you been here?

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.994
Not long. I was a Sheetz mule
for ten years.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.629
Man, why
don't you tell me

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:47.533
how a fucking boom boom
sauce mule could come in here

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:50.035
and work as a custodian and have
better ideas than you, Rick?

00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:51.370
Why don't you tell me
how that's possible?

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.604
This is like
Good Will Hunting

00:12:52.637 --> 00:12:54.940
but with sandwiches
that'll kill you.

00:12:54.973 --> 00:12:56.642
They won't
kill you.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:57.910
What?

00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:59.111
Shut your
fucking mouth,

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:00.379
[inaudible].
Don't say it again.

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:01.613
For
real though,

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.315
you guys have to make
the switch now.

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.050
Look at this.
It's good.

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:07.085
It's obvious
what's happening here.

00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:09.721
One doesn't give a fuck,
the one that was there

00:13:09.754 --> 00:13:11.790
in front of your face
the entire time does.

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:13.125
This is like
a Rom Com

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:14.359
with gas station sandwiches.

00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:15.661
I'm just
a boy,

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.963
standing in front of
a convenience store sandwich,

00:13:17.996 --> 00:13:19.298
saying "I love you."

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.699
Wawa's
the pretty rich girl

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:22.000
that wants nothing
to do with us,

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.836
and then Sheetz
is just a best friend

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.137
that's been there
the whole time.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.639
Kiss me down
by the bearded barley.

00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:29.575
Or it goes,
Sheetz goes like this,

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.909
"I don't know, I know

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:33.011
I gotta go to riding camp
this summer, but-"

00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:34.246
He'll
hold you in his arms.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.447
Sheetz
is like,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.549
"Yo, what are you doing, dude?
Come over here.

00:13:37.582 --> 00:13:39.952
Why don't you come over
behind this dumpster.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.221
Dude, I got pep rolls,
I'll fuck you.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.589
I ended up raping you, my bad."

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:44.790
Sheetz is like,

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.625
"Want me to gobble you
in the parking lot?

00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:48.460
Why don't you gobble me
in the parking lot?"

00:13:48.493 --> 00:13:49.828
Yeah, just
don't finger me

00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:51.564
with your fucking greasy hands.

00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:53.732
Hey, wipe
your hand off on your jeans

00:13:53.765 --> 00:13:54.933
before you go for it.

00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:57.069
That's Wawa,
dude. Wawa's out there,

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:59.705
"I'm going down the shore.
We aint talking no more.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:03.809
Fuck you." And Wawa's like,
"Yo dude. Fuck that bitch.

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:05.911
I saw you talking to that
bitch earlier. Come over here."

00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:07.112
"Do you
like video games?"

00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:08.380
"I got
cookies for you."

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:10.015
"I got
so many cookies and sauces."

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:11.650
"I'm gonna
FedEx some cookies over to you.

00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:13.051
Where do you live?
What's your address?"

00:14:13.084 --> 00:14:15.020
"Can I mail sauces to you?"

00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:16.488
Jacob, did you try one of these
yet?

00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:17.823
Jacob.

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.024
I'm not eating one.

00:14:19.057 --> 00:14:19.858
Jacob.

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:20.659
I'm not either,

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:21.894
but we have to make
a decision

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.095
on who we're going
to put our heart into.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.329
It's, Jacob,
it's a family decision.

00:14:24.362 --> 00:14:25.564
Wait,
you haven't tried one of these?

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:26.798
Yeah,
it's fan-

00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:28.166
... I tried one.

00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:29.501
Jacob do it.
Jacob.

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:30.802
I'm not eat
...

00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:32.471
I'm sure it's great,
I can't eat one right now.

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:33.639
Why?

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.307
Well that's
not a good way to do business.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.642
Did you say
you had wawa?

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:37.843
No.

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:39.044
I'll fucking
put you through

00:14:39.077 --> 00:14:40.345
a fucking window dude.

00:14:40.378 --> 00:14:45.617
I'm full, I had wawa.
I left the city to get it.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.885
I will
fucking find

00:14:46.918 --> 00:14:48.520
[crosstalk].

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.022
Dude,
Jacob's got a set of broken ribs

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.323
from Shane.

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:52.557
You want
to find out

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.759
what studio four looks like?

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.193
He goes,
"Oh my God,

00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.229
he just commandoed him
through the wall.

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:58.764
Holy shit.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.132
It's crazy.

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.467
He just wouldn't try a pepperoni
roll, and Shane just went-

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.604
Sorry,
outlaw, country, 90, whatever.

00:15:05.637 --> 00:15:07.606
Yeah, Shane
went full left tackle,

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.541
and just blasted him
through the wall.

00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:11.610
Why can't
you have a piece Jacob?

00:15:11.643 --> 00:15:12.844
I can,
I'm just-

00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:14.179
Can you have
a bite?

00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:15.414
Just take
a bite.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:16.114
Have a bite.

00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:17.349
I don't
want it.

00:15:17.382 --> 00:15:18.617
It's for business.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.818
You're bad
at business.

00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.019
You're bad at business dude.

00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:22.321
That's not
a good feeling.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.522
I'm sure it's great.

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:24.756
The cookies are great.

00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:26.191
The sauce is great.
I've had enough.

00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:27.426
So you had a cookie?

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:28.660
Did everybody else

00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:30.028
try the pepperoni roll?

00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:31.730
I didn't get
to try the peanut

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:33.332
butter cup cookie.
Is there one of floating around.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:34.566
Oh yeah,
of course.

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:35.801
Yeah, goes
really good if you're

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.502
just eating pepperoni roll.

00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:38.770
Yeah, good.

00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:40.806
I mean you want heart
burn immediately?

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.074
Something
sweet.

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.308
You wanna
get hurt?

00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.744
I think Shane just dipped
his cookie in the oil.

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:48.080
Yeah, Shane
just took bam boom boom sauce.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.482
Yeah, peanut
butter cup, boom boom sauce.

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:54.152
Jalapeno ranch.

00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:56.254
I'll tell
you this

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:58.890
bad for the reflux,
great for the taste buds.

00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:00.092
What is?

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.460
I'm getting
some real chest heat right now.

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.661
Pepperoni roll?

00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:03.895
That's gonna fire
back up on you buddy.

00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:05.163
Fire down
two of those things,

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:06.665
I'm gonna ...
Fuck, I'm breathing acid.

00:16:06.698 --> 00:16:08.700
That's why
I had one little slice there,

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:10.102
because I'm like it's gonna-
Wow-

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.837
That got
greedy quick.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.038
I gotta
do a-

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:15.040
It kicked
back up pretty God damn fast.

00:16:15.073 --> 00:16:16.308
I'm gonna do
podcast and stand up

00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:17.576
show after this so-

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.144
Oh dude,
I'm gonna be doing a benefit

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:20.379
fucking just burping.

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:21.713
I'm gonna be like [crosstalk].

00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:23.015
Even one of
those is like 10 Slim Jims.

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.216
Huh?

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.450
They put ten
Slim Jims

00:16:25.483 --> 00:16:27.186
into each one of those.

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:29.488
That's right.

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:31.156
You man,
don't pull the curtain.

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:32.925
Don't pull the sheet.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.262
Yes.

00:16:37.295 --> 00:16:38.630
I'm glad you
guys are talking

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:40.499
because seriously, I'm dealing
with a lot of fucking-

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.800
It'shurting you right now.

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.135
I'm getting through it.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.336
You wanna glass of milk?

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:45.570
I would
love one. Do you have one?

00:16:45.603 --> 00:16:46.772
Maybe like-

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:47.572
There's milk upstairs.

00:16:47.605 --> 00:16:48.807
Yeah, I got milk on me.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.875
I don't know ...

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:50.909
Why are you going around
offering glasses of milk,

00:16:50.942 --> 00:16:52.144
if you ain't got
one on you dude?

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.345
Well Christine went upstairs

00:16:53.378 --> 00:16:56.315
to prepare peperoni rolls,
I'm sure she'll make a milk run.

00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:58.150
I got sweet
bottled water dude.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.117
That's not gonna help,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.352
that makes things worse,
you know that.

00:17:00.385 --> 00:17:01.553
No it doesn't,

00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:02.821
no it cuts right through it.

00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:04.322
This jalapeno sauce is a good
base.

00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:06.058
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:07.392
It's a great base,

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:08.927
after you have peperoni rolls.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.629
You want to
eat that ass? You want to-

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:13.298
He goes, as
Winston Churchill once said,

00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:15.567
"When going through hell,
keep going."

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.802
Take a shot.

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:18.670
Jalapeno
rancho hit the spot.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:20.038
Just go
all the way through.

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:21.540
Has [Sheets]

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.642
got the cure
for what ails you.

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:26.411
Take a little swig of that,
right there.

00:17:26.444 --> 00:17:27.846
Put gas
on the fire.

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:29.381
Wait, did we
get an official,

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:31.983
Black Lou took
a swig of barbecue sauce.

00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:33.518
Did you give
a review overall?

00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:34.820
What'd yeah think?

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.021
Honestly?

00:17:36.054 --> 00:17:37.289
Yeah.

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:38.523
It's very nice.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.559
It's definitely a white guy
in a kitchen put that together.

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:41.960
A white guy in the kitchen.

00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:43.161
Oh, how dare you.

00:17:43.194 --> 00:17:44.429
That's basically,
you know what he's saying,

00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:45.864
there's no soul
in that barbecue sauce.

00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:47.165
It was a white guy.

00:17:47.198 --> 00:17:48.500
But while he was cooking,
he was going,

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:50.168
"Mama's in the kitchen
getting huh huh.

00:17:50.201 --> 00:17:51.369
Mama's in the kitchen."

00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:52.604
He was
racist as fuck when he made it.

00:17:52.637 --> 00:17:53.839
Yeah.

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.340
That's got
to count for some soul.

00:17:55.373 --> 00:17:56.541
You can't
taste a little bit

00:17:56.574 --> 00:17:57.776
of the hate in that?

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:00.178
There's just a guy
pounding on a door to get in.

00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.081
He's going, "What?"
as he's making the sauce.

00:18:03.114 --> 00:18:04.616
He's going,
"Take this out to the workers

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:06.218
and have them tell me
they think it's good.

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.753
The white workers."
Thank you.

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:10.489
The ones
that drive trucks.

00:18:11.222 --> 00:18:13.391
Dee.
Yo.

00:18:13.424 --> 00:18:14.793
Yeah.
Boom boom sauce.

00:18:14.826 --> 00:18:16.094
Boom boom
sauce is good.

00:18:16.127 --> 00:18:18.530
And I like this,
the ranch combo.

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:19.898
[Christie],

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:21.199
you're a sauce person.
Boom boom sauce good?

00:18:21.232 --> 00:18:22.434
I've not
tried the boom boom

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:23.668
or the barbecue.

00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:24.903
I went straight
for jalapeno ranch.

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:25.804
You love
what boom boom sauce is.

00:18:25.837 --> 00:18:26.738
You know
what boom boom

00:18:26.771 --> 00:18:27.973
...
you love what it is.

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:28.874
Can
I try it?

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.108
Ingredients-wise.

00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:31.343
Dan can't figure out
what boom boom sauce is.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:32.744
You shut
your mouth, dude. I nailed this.

00:18:32.777 --> 00:18:34.146
It looks
like it's [crosstalk]

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.780
Delete the footage. Delete the
footage.

00:18:35.813 --> 00:18:37.249
Delete the footage of me
grabbing the wrong one.

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.817
It looks
like it's chili garlic sauce

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.018
mixed in with mayonnaise.

00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:41.253
You're
guessing that by look?

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.454
Yeah.
No.

00:18:42.487 --> 00:18:43.922
What are you, a detective?

00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:46.224
She goes, "This sauce died
five days ago."

00:18:46.257 --> 00:18:47.959
Tastes like
that's what it is, too.

00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:49.895
What?

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:52.130
She goes, "There was a struggle
when the sauce was made.

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:53.365
I can taste it."

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.800
That'd be
great if Christie nailed that.

00:18:55.833 --> 00:18:57.068
I saw
the peppers.

00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:59.104
There was
divorce in the air.

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:00.906
She goes,
"One of them is jealous.

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.342
The other tried to run.
This sauce ..."

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:07.379
It ended
in a murder-suicide.

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:08.747
Wow.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.749
It's all true.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.117
How did you
know that?

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.019
One bullet
to his wife,

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:17.956
one bullet to his own head.
Hence the name, boom boom.

00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:20.725
And also,

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:22.461
pairs well
with a turkey sandwich.

00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:24.596
That's awesome.

00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:26.331
Ordered on
a computer.

00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:28.166
Dealing
with reflux?

00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:29.434
I've got the cure

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:30.669
Ah, dude.

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:33.138
That reflux?
That's nothing, dude.

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:34.372
Reflux nation.

00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:35.707
You've just
got a small case of

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.908
[Sheets] gut.

00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:38.109
[Sheet] gut.

00:19:38.142 --> 00:19:39.344
It happens
to the best of us.

00:19:39.377 --> 00:19:41.413
Two liter of Mountain Dew.
Put that down.

00:19:42.013 --> 00:19:44.282
Get some Citrus Skoal.
Get some Skoal.

00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:45.584
Take it
to the face, dude.

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.952
Take it to the face.
Yeah.

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.753
He goes, "I don't even know
what you're doing.

00:19:48.786 --> 00:19:50.989
A whole bag of tasty cakes?"
[inaudible] donuts.

00:19:51.022 --> 00:19:52.224
Mountain Dew

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.459
probably to some degree
flushes you out.

00:19:54.492 --> 00:19:55.961
Oh yeah,
I think what it does,

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:59.031
it's like chlorine in a pool,
because keeps everything clean.

00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:01.266
Burns your eyes.

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:03.134
Yeah like,
too much mountain dew

00:20:03.167 --> 00:20:04.669
in the system.

00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.371
I opened my eyes while
I was drinking mountain dew.

00:20:06.404 --> 00:20:07.606
Another already...

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:09.808
And your eyes are 
all spiderwebs

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:14.045
with bloodshot.
Did I just cranked that a dew?

00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:17.182
Because, i almost
canoed here on dry land.

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:19.351
Because I took a code 
red to the dome.

00:20:22.587 --> 00:20:24.289
Extreme!

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:29.394
Affects fertility,

00:20:29.427 --> 00:20:31.730
the Diet Mountain dew
it's a theory.

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:32.998
Yeah, we use that.

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:37.168
I'm sorry. It affects fertility.
That's plan B where I'm from.

00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:39.704

Knock that kid right out of you.

00:20:44.742 --> 00:20:45.977
You make your 
squat over it

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.479
and dropped
a couple mentos in it,

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.214
then you fire up everywhere?

00:20:50.815 --> 00:20:52.150

00:20:54.952 --> 00:20:56.321
It's called
a DELCO abortion.

00:20:56.354 --> 00:20:58.056

Wait, mountain dew or you just

for making me with the leader

00:21:12.603 --> 00:21:14.806
The kid air guitar is

or while doing
the Angus young step...

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.777

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.179
What's up, my name's Colby

00:21:21.212 --> 00:21:22.781
on a 50cc dirt bike.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.115
Producer
Jacob always distracts me

00:21:24.148 --> 00:21:25.350
with like, I can't.

00:21:25.383 --> 00:21:27.285
We can't talk
about ACDC like that.

00:21:27.318 --> 00:21:28.520
He just storms off.

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:29.821
We can't?
You got to leave?

00:21:29.854 --> 00:21:31.022

[crosstalk]

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.592
No, I know.
Jacob never gets up like,

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.328
"Ah, this is fun so far can
I go do something."

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:37.595
He always goes,
it's always like,

00:21:37.628 --> 00:21:38.830
"Gosh shit, there is a problem."

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:40.065
You know
what he does,

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:42.100
he gets up like a parent
or a little kid grab something.

00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:43.468
Then he goes,
[crosstalk]

00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:44.703
Yes, exactly.

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:45.937
Owen...

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.372
You see it,
here in the airline right?

00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:48.640
I'm always like,
what's going on?

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:49.841
We said something wrong?

00:21:49.874 --> 00:21:51.576
I would say
he's mad at me.

00:21:52.543 --> 00:21:53.978
I was just
trying to pull something...

00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:55.213
He can't
talk about a 

00:21:55.246 --> 00:21:56.481
coming out of a pussy, man.

00:21:56.514 --> 00:21:57.716
Because,
that guy is illegal.

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:58.983
Jacob,

00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:00.752
why are they
doing this to you, Dude?

00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:02.087
It was
actually the opposite

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.888
of marking something
very funny for a promo.

00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:05.156
Oh, okay.

00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:06.391

Oh yeah,

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.705
My sister tried to take,

00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:22.941
just like Shaniqua.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:26.778
On Catholic confirmation,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.782

You're going Kenny?

00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:38.957

Okay. Yeah,
Daryl's not a bad one at all.

00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:47.165
Actually,

00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:51.603
Oh, yeah,

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:52.804

00:22:56.741 --> 00:23:00.412
He was going send a fat kid
in the world with double O.

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:02.147
Oscar Oakerson.

00:23:05.716 --> 00:23:07.085
You're dad almost really
set you up

00:23:07.118 --> 00:23:08.386
for being a life of fucking ...

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:09.821
You'd be the toughest
human being on earth.

00:23:09.854 --> 00:23:11.122
You'd be like a 
[crosstalk].

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:12.390
Like a Boy 
named Sue.

00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:13.591
Like a boy named Sue.

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:14.859
Oh dude,
yeah, I'd have fucking tattoos

00:23:14.892 --> 00:23:16.361
going from my neck
to my forehead.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.029
Ah Dude,
you'd start off with double

00:23:18.062 --> 00:23:19.230
O, then Oscar the Grouch.

00:23:19.263 --> 00:23:20.698
Man, you woulda been
dragged through the dirt.

00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:21.900
Oh,
I would've been

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:23.134
the meanest kid in the word.

00:23:23.167 --> 00:23:24.502
By the way,
there was a super heavy

00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.172
set black kid in my school
named Oscar.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.641
So he went through it,
but it was Oscar Brown.

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:31.776
It was a good last name.

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:33.912
Oscar Oakerson,
it just sounds like ...

00:23:34.712 --> 00:23:37.249
It sounds like words
you could say with tuba notes.

00:23:39.183 --> 00:23:40.418
And Buck

00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:42.454
Soder is the name
of a young father.

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:44.622
Buck

00:23:44.655 --> 00:23:46.858
Soder for sure carries
a knife in his boot.

00:23:46.891 --> 00:23:48.059
And he has
kid at 14.

00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:49.260
Definitely.

00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:51.362
He drove way young, everything
was too young for you.

00:23:51.395 --> 00:23:52.597
I'd go,

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.932
"Well, my dad will let me drive
when I was 11.

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.133
Take the truck out."
You gotta leave?

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:56.401
I gotta get
the fuck outta here boys.

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:57.635
Gotta head
