00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.650
This is Cardboard, a virtual
reality viewer anyone can make.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.570
Just insert your phone and
immerse yourself in 3D.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.550
In fact, it is so
simple, you can even

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.780
make it out of a cereal box.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.330
My name is Shanee,
and in this series

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.660
we're going to find out what is
Google Cardboard, how it works,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.740
and how to make virtual
reality applications.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.520
Virtual reality in a cereal box?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.090
How do you do that?

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.240
It all starts with a box.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.150
These cardboard pieces
assemble into the viewer.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.256
Add in your everyday
phone, acting as a screen.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.240
Two plastic lenses focus
your wide field of view

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.350
into the screen, putting you
inside the virtual world.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.500
You interact with the game
using a magnet on the side.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.040
The components are so simple.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.770
You can make your own Cardboard
viewer out of almost anything.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.680
To make your own, just
download the blueprint,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.800
get the basic components,
cut, and assemble.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.620
Check out the link
below for instructions.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.510
Or, if you're like me, and
don't like cutting things,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.170
then why not get one online?

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.060
To learn more about
how Cardboard works

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.360
and how to develop for
it, check out the rest

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.300
of the videos or the docs.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.690
So until next time.
