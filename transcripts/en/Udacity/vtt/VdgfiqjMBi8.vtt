00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, let's see. We want a period of 1 second.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's convert this to an angular frequency ω using this equation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, we want an angular frequency of 2π, an I know that ω²

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is equal to whatever this thing is, the minus something times x.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this case, ω² is equal to g/L.  Let's solve this for L.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This gives me a length of 0.25 meters.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, it turns out that for pendulum clocks, actually, we might want a period of 2 seconds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The reason is because let's say we had a pendulum with a period of 1 second.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That means that it takes 1 second for when I pull it back to go

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
over here and then all the way back.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's actually quite a bit of motion and a period of 2 seconds is actually a little bit better,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because then every time the pendulum reaches one if its extrema,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
either all the way over here or all the way over there,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we know 1 second has passed--half of the period.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I wonder what would be the period for a 2-second pendulum.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Why don't ask Tjeerd the clockmaker what he thinks.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Tjeerd ] When you design a pendulum or pendulum clock,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the thing that mostly influences the period of oscillation is the length of the your pendulum.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you have an ideal pendulum, a fictional pendulum,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
made out of no materials as a mathematical piece,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the pendulum of a second, oscillating in a second,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
will have a length of about a meter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
A pendulum is made out of materials, and the rod, for instance, is made out of steel or brass,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which brings the center of oscillation up.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's why you need a heavy pendulum bulb underneath the pendulum--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to bring the center of gravity in the pendulum down

00:01:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to have your proper theoretical length.
