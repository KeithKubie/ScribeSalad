00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
In the video today, we're looking at why vultures
don't get sick when they eat dead animals.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.960
While it's important to note that many animals
eat carrion, vultures are fairly unique in

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.839
that they're able to eat carrion that has
succumbed to the effects of decay and disease,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.869
a feat few stomachs in the animal kingdom
can match.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.570
As an idea of just how ridiculously hardy
vultures are, experiments have shown that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.710
they are all but immune to botulism and that
they can happily chow down on the flesh of

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.890
an animal coated in Bacillus anthracis which
is better known as the bacteria that causes

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.890
anthrax!

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.140
They also have no problem eating an animal
infected with rabies, hog cholera and numerous

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.150
other diseases that would ultimately be lethal
to most other scavengers.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.620
So how do they do it?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.620
Vultures are able to comfortably eat diseased
carrion thanks in large part to their highly

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.260
acidic gastric juices which are sufficiently
strong enough to kill most bacteria before

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.610
they ever become an issue.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.579
For example, as you probably remember from
high school chemistry, the pH scale goes from

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.420
0 to 14, with 0 representing a highly acidic
substance, 7 representing an approximately

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.280
neutral one, like pure water, and 14 representing
a highly alkaline one.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.820
While the pH of human stomach juice can vary
quite dramatically depending on what you've

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.420
eaten, it tends to stay between around 1.5
and 3.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.360
In contrast, the stomach acid of a turkey
vulture (one of the hardiest members of the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.890
vulture family) has a pH of almost 0.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.640
It should be noted here that the pH scale
is logarithmic, which means "each whole pH

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.980
value below 7 is ten times more acidic than
the next higher value."

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.049
In other words, in the extreme a turkey vulture's
stomach acid could technically be in the ballpark

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.610
of 1000 times more acidic than yours at a
given instance.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.880
In fact, it's so acidic that it can dissolve
many metals.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.020
For further reference, battery acid has a
pH of about 0.8.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.020
Even when bacteria does survive the gauntlet
that is the turkey vulture's digestive system,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.850
it then has to compete with its amazing immune
system.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.770
In regards to the latter, vultures are noted
as having one of the "strongest immune systems

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.590
of all vertebrates" and there are few food-borne
diseases that truly pose a threat to it.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.260
As for why humans don't have the same abilities,
vultures spend almost all of their eating

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.170
time in close proximity to decaying, sometimes
disease filled flesh, so it's understandable

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.630
that members of their ancestry who could handle
these sorts of things better would, over time,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.010
dominate the species' gene pool and be able
to eat progressively more decayed flesh without

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.010
consequence.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.900
Humans, on the other hand, spent many thousands
of years using their brains to develop ways

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.040
to avoid long dead, uncooked, rotting flesh.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.010
That said, humans can eat raw meat provided
it's very fresh and human gastric acid is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.489
strong enough to kill many types of microbes,
but there are some bacteria that have no problems

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.870
surviving our digestive juices, such as the
kind that causes ulcers see our video on the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.150
subject here which covers the Fascinating
Saga of Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Barry Marshall

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.260
and His decades long Fight to Convince the
Medical World What Actually Causes Ulcers.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.790
Of course, there is a point at which even
a vulture will say no and flesh will be deemed

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.760
too putrid or foul to eat.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.360
However, this doesn't necessarily stop the
vulture from eventually eating some of the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.360
remains.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.120
For example, the bearded vulture can live
on a diet of 70%-90% bone if it needs to.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.680
In fact, the ability to thrive on this diet
is a huge boon for them in lean times as bones

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.730
contain a significant amount of calories and
will last indefinitely, unlike flesh.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.910
So long after the flesh has gone, the remaining
bones are still fair game for the bearded

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.910
vulture.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.910
Perhaps the most surprising fact about vultures
is that despite their near-universal reputation

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.870
as disease carrying pests, they are considered
by experts to be the exact opposite and it's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.590
observed that when vulture populations decline
in an area, the rate of disease will usually

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.670
go up, sometimes dramatically.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.670
Why?

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.380
As we've already covered, vultures' digestive
systems kill off most microbes present in

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.770
carrion making them "dead-end hosts".

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.819
So if a vulture eats a diseased animal, the
spread of the disease ends there because it

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.290
will likely be neutralised by the vulture's
body.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.379
This, combined with the vulture's propensity
for picking carcasses completely clean, means

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.730
that in areas with a lot of vultures, the
risk of disease spreading from dead bodies

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.100
is relatively low.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.459
However, when a vulture population is displaced,
the rate of disease will climb as the bodies

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.970
of animals are inevitably left to rot and
are consumed by, not dead-end hosts, but potential

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:11.970
carriers.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.800
Further, vultures notably urinate and defecate
all over themselves while they eat which,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.130
thanks to the highly acidic nature of their
bodily waste, kills most bacteria that makes

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.079
its way onto the vulture's legs.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.240
This also has the side effect of sterilising
the area around the carcass, also stopping

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.590
disease from spreading.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.560
To illustrate what can happen without the
vultures in some areas, in India, a massive

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.810
decline in vulture populations (such as 80
million white-rumped vultures in the 1980s

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.040
vs. only a few thousand now) led to an explosion
in the population of feral dogs (estimated

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.660
to be about 18 million today in India) and
rats with whom the vultures formerly competed

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.810
for carcasses.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.700
These animals, unlike the "dead-end" vultures,
are vectors for numerous diseases including

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700
rabies.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.560
The remains of the carcasses that were formerly
picked clean by the vultures are also now

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.300
contaminating water supplies causing further
disease issues.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.560
This is more of a problem in India than it
would be in many other nations as only about

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.669
4% of their 500 million or so cattle are eaten
by humans when they die, with the rest in

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.190
the past primarily being eaten by vultures.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.820
This has become such a widespread issue that
significant research was done to determine

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.430
why the vultures were dropping dead.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.520
In the end, it was determined by Dr. Lindsay
Oaks et al in 2003 that it was the anti-inflammatory

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.040
drug diclofenac that was highly toxic to vultures.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.020
This drug was relatively commonly given to
livestock, the carcasses of which the vultures

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.350
would eventually eat.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.410
Given the many thousands of extra human lives
lost per year in India due to the vulture

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.450
population decline, diclogenac was banned
in India in 2006 with a substitute being developed

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:56.990
called meloxicam that is not toxic to the
vultures.
