so obviously when you put all of those

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
so obviously when you put all of those
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649
so obviously when you put all of those
numbers into context the scale of the

challenge that we're looking at extends
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940
challenge that we're looking at extends
to well over a billion young people and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
to well over a billion young people and
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.060

is accelerating away from us so the time

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
is accelerating away from us so the time
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130
is accelerating away from us so the time
to act is now from our perspective what

to act is now from our perspective what
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320
to act is now from our perspective what
you realize very very quickly is that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
you realize very very quickly is that
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870
you realize very very quickly is that
governments on their own cannot cater to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
governments on their own cannot cater to
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429
governments on their own cannot cater to
this requirement you know that the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
this requirement you know that the
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140

their own cannot cater to their space
 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.390
their own cannot cater to their space
private sector on its own can't do this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
private sector on its own can't do this
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030
private sector on its own can't do this
either what we absolutely see is that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
either what we absolutely see is that
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.550
either what we absolutely see is that
for us to address that the size of the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
for us to address that the size of the
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.910
for us to address that the size of the
challenge you have to look at much more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
challenge you have to look at much more
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800
challenge you have to look at much more
collaborative powerful partnerships

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
collaborative powerful partnerships
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800
collaborative powerful partnerships
between those three sectors in order to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
between those three sectors in order to
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660
between those three sectors in order to
address the challenge I think the scale

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
address the challenge I think the scale
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.920
address the challenge I think the scale
of the challenge essentially means that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
of the challenge essentially means that
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.039
of the challenge essentially means that
we have to find rapid solutions to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
we have to find rapid solutions to
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.609
we have to find rapid solutions to
scaling

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619

a quality education so it isn't just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
a quality education so it isn't just
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.630
a quality education so it isn't just
about access but it's about attainment

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
about access but it's about attainment
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999
about access but it's about attainment
as well I think one of the things that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
as well I think one of the things that
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.420
as well I think one of the things that
private sector with certainly the right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
private sector with certainly the right
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.819
private sector with certainly the right
values and the right objectives does

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
values and the right objectives does
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560
values and the right objectives does
have the incentive and the opportunity

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
have the incentive and the opportunity
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.460
have the incentive and the opportunity
to scale a sustainable solution at pace

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
to scale a sustainable solution at pace
 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.740
to scale a sustainable solution at pace
but again private sector on its own will

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
but again private sector on its own will
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730
but again private sector on its own will
only be able

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
only be able
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980
only be able
to cater to one small component of the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
to cater to one small component of the
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.050
to cater to one small component of the
demand I think governments and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
demand I think governments and
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.650
demand I think governments and
especially what we would consider

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
especially what we would consider
 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.880
especially what we would consider
governments that have the foresight and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
governments that have the foresight and
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.280
governments that have the foresight and
the vision specifically to kind of throw

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
the vision specifically to kind of throw
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.880
the vision specifically to kind of throw
aside the old intellectual debates about

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
aside the old intellectual debates about
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.120
aside the old intellectual debates about
public versus private or just where the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
public versus private or just where the
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.670
public versus private or just where the
voluntary sector gets involved they

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
voluntary sector gets involved they
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.780
voluntary sector gets involved they
actually have the ability to encourage

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
actually have the ability to encourage
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880
actually have the ability to encourage
and nurture these powerful partnerships

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
and nurture these powerful partnerships
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.190
and nurture these powerful partnerships
so from our perspective private sector

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
so from our perspective private sector
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.260
so from our perspective private sector
on its own can't cater to this challenge

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270
on its own can't cater to this challenge
 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.630
on its own can't cater to this challenge
we do need the support of visionary

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
we do need the support of visionary
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.630
we do need the support of visionary
governments but actually the one group

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
governments but actually the one group
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.250
governments but actually the one group
that needs to perhaps do more is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260
that needs to perhaps do more is
 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.950
that needs to perhaps do more is
actually industry and today if we think

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960
actually industry and today if we think
 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.700
actually industry and today if we think
about global aid there goes to various

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
about global aid there goes to various
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.550
about global aid there goes to various
initiative actually aid towards

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
initiative actually aid towards
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.940
initiative actually aid towards
education still represents a fraction so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
education still represents a fraction so
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.410
education still represents a fraction so
six hundred million dollars only

six hundred million dollars only
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.290
six hundred million dollars only
globally and today when you address the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
globally and today when you address the
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.050
globally and today when you address the
challenge that young people are not

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
challenge that young people are not
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.570
challenge that young people are not
coming out with the skills that they

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580
coming out with the skills that they
 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.290
coming out with the skills that they
need in order to be able to access

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300
need in order to be able to access
 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.210

employment that is actually a challenge

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
employment that is actually a challenge
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.610
employment that is actually a challenge
that private sector with an industry

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
that private sector with an industry
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.480
that private sector with an industry
needs to pick up the reality is without

needs to pick up the reality is without
that support you were still going to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
that support you were still going to
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.930
