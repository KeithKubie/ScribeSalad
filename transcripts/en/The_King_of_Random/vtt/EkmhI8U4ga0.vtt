00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.900
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Guys, today we're here
with my new friend Matt,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.580
who's going to be showing
us some of the steps

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.880
in how to make some
bezel set infinity rings.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.520
[Music]

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.900
Some of you may have seen a while
back Grant's story on Instagram

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.560
where he came and
he made a ring here at this shop,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.140
and he thought it was so cool that
we're going to make a few more,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.300
and what he really wanted to do
was make sort of an Infinity Gauntlet.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.600
But rather than a gauntlet,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.689
just make a different
ring for each finger,

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.360
and so we've got a whole bunch of stones,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.500
and Matt is going to show us how
to take the rest of the raw materials,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920
and put everything together
to turn them into rings.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.720
&gt;&gt; Okay. So the first thing
we're going to do

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.900
is we're going to working
with this red stone first.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.700
This is the pinky stone for Grant.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.200
We are going to be grinding the
back down and making it a bit flatter

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.140
so it's going to sit inside
of the setting a bit better.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660
So first, we're going to [inaudible] 
with the lapidary machine.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.960
What it does is it spins really really fast,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.500
sand paper that keeps wet,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.320
and we're going to grind down the back.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.560
&gt;&gt; Interesting. Thing is
grinding down the stone.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.860
It's really flattening it out.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560
But it's not something that's like really
wearing away at my fingers,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.480
which means it has
very very hard grinding

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.580
but it's such a low grip that it's
not really doing anything to my skin.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.200
[Music]

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.580
Now, I've got this stone
ground down on the back.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.580
What's the next step?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420
&gt;&gt; Okay. So now what we're going
to be doing is getting the bezel.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.180
So we're going to be using this
thin brass sheet as our bezel,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.360
and we're going to wrap it around
the stone as tightly as we can,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.180
and figure out exactly how long
this brass wire needs to be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.360
to hug that stone just perfectly.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.120
So now, go ahead and
use these flush cutters

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.040
to cut just a little bit extra.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.880
and make sure you're
cutting at a 90 degree angle.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:55.700
[Music]

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.320
&gt;&gt; All right, we've got our little band

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.660
cut in pretty exactly
sized around the stone.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.320
What do we do?

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.500
&gt;&gt; Okay so, we always double check it,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.640
and make sure that
it really does hug it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.940
and it looks like it's perfect.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.440
So now what we want to do
is we want to make sure

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.180
that these ends are flat.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.460
When you cut metal,
rarely does it ever cut clean.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.280
It usually pinches it off at the tip.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.200
So we're gonna use a file
to file down those tips

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.320
to make it more flat.
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.140
&gt;&gt; And when we're filing, we want
to keep that at a perfect angle.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.120
So we're not filing any--

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.000
anything off that.
&gt;&gt; You don't lose any distance.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.120
&gt;&gt; Okay. So this is where
it gets a lot more fun.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.340
We are going to solder
these ends together.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.460
So the first step is going to be
making them what we call kissing.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.020
So you want to get
them right matched up.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.909
So what I usually do is I go over,

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.160
and I go under to create
some springiness to it,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.120
and then I try and get them
matched up just right

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.220
so I'll have you work on that.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.879
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.060
&gt;&gt; We have our two ends
matched up perfectly.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.580
And now we're going to use
this thing called third arm,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.660
which is just some tweezers that
are held out of this platform.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.840
&gt;&gt; It's like reverse tweezers.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.440
And it's going to hold these in place

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.660
and then we're going to apply flux.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.120
And what flux does is as it heats up,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.400
it cleans the surface of the brass,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.760
and tells the solder where to go basically.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.540
Without flux, the solder
would just ball up,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.280
and it wouldn't melt into the crack.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.580
It will just end up overheating,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180
and it potentially could
end up damaging the brass.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.980
So we add flux every time
we do any soldering.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520
Solder comes in three different heats.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.440
We have hard medium and easy,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.940
and it's basically all that is
is that it is a solder

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.320
that is mixed with different
amounts of alloys.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.520
So the less alloys there are,
the hotter it needs to be the melt.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.560
The more alloys there are,
the less heat we need to make it melt.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.920
This is 0.925 sterling silver,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.980
but what it is it's mixed with
I think zinc and tin,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.580
and zinc and tin are metals that
melt at a much lower temperatures.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.680
So, we're gonna start
working out with hard solder,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440
then work our way down to easy.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.560
[Music]

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.980
&gt;&gt; We took our soldering bar
and we just laid it right across the gap

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.340
which is currently closed together nicely.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.560
Having the flux on there also helps
just keep that right where we put it.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.240
It's obviously not rolling off
because the flex is kind of a goo.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.580
So I'm gonna take this torch,
and start kind of far away,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.540
let it heat up,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.960
be moving in closer and closer,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.400
and the goal is to get the
little piece of solder to melt.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.520
What is it I'm looking for?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.580
&gt;&gt; What you're going to see is once
you reach that magic temperature,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.620
you're going to see that bar of
solder just like melt into the crack,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.800
and once it melts,
that's when we want to back up.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.260
We don't wanna keep on there too long

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.080
because we don't want
the solder overflowing,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.280
and going to different parts of the brass.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.220
And we also don't want it to bubble out.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.440
&gt;&gt; And so, once it starts to puddle,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.420
what are we-- are we talking like
half second, three seconds...

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.780
&gt;&gt; Probably around half second.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.060
&gt;&gt; Okay so like it'll go
and just sort of that---

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And do I stop the heat?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.760
Or do I just back up so it's still...
&gt;&gt; I say back up.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.180
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just back up.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.800
And we're using butane torches.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.960
&gt;&gt; Butane.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.240
[Music]

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.680
&gt;&gt; Brass is a bit more...

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.980
&gt;&gt; That's our--
Our flux starts bubbling up.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.360
&gt;&gt; Pretty easily.
&gt;&gt; Flux is gonna go all white and crusty,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.040
and then when you move in a little closer,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.360
and we're going to see kind of bubble,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.220
and eventually it's gonna go clear,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.980
and when it goes kind
of dark then clear...

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.260
&gt;&gt; Oh, and the whole ring
just changed colors.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.560
&gt;&gt; This is all oxidizing.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560
[Music]

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.060
&gt;&gt; Our solder has moved.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.580
Is that a problem?
&gt;&gt; No, it's fine.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Move a little closer,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.120
and I'm making sure that we're
heating up this whole top surface.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Cause brass is conductive.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.660
[Music]

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.380
Alright now, you're going
to watch that melt in a second.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.750
And brass is forgiving.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.600
There we go.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.780
Let's go back and forth one more time,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.180
and have that flow tiny bit more.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.300
&gt;&gt; Just puddle a little more than it did.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.540
&gt;&gt; I was--I was too quick.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.920
&gt;&gt; And that's it.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.120
Great!

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.500
Cool.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.760
So now what we have here,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.140
is we have our brass then
we have our silver solder

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.120
that covered that whole crack.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.060
So now, I'm gonna have you
grab that and quench it in the water.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.500
&gt;&gt; Quenching.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.320
[Music]

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.220
And once it's been underwater
for even a second,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.620
It's fine to [inaudible]

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.880
&gt;&gt; It's thin enough that
it's just cooled off that quickly.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, now we're gonna
see if our bezel fits our stone.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.240
That should fit snug.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.420
&gt;&gt; Right now, you'll notice
that the brass is all black.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.420
&gt;&gt; Very discolored.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.400
&gt;&gt; Very discolored and that's gonna
be that way until the very very end.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.040
&gt;&gt; That's when we polish it.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.080
&gt;&gt; We actually we'll
put it in acid for a while,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.279
and that will help kind of soften it
and clean up a little bit,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.240
and then we'll polish it.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.240
Now that we have our stone in our bezel,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.180
the next step is in to getting the sheet.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.020
And the sheet we cut from just 
a 26 gauge piece of brass sheet,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.880
and we're going to measure it out,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.960
and just cut a little more than enough

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.020
so we have something that
we can attach the bezel to.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.180
and this will be the backing
that goes against your finger.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.700
[Music]

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.180
One thing you're going to notice about
this sheet is it's kind of crazy looking.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.140
&gt;&gt; It's a little warped.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.180
&gt;&gt; It's really warped.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.380
&gt;&gt; So we are--
&gt;&gt; I assume we want it flat.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.240
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.220
So we need little anvil
and  our rawhide hammer.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.600
We like using a rawhide hammer
when we work with metal

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.900
because it does not do any real dents.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.980
[Music]

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.940
&gt;&gt; Is that flat enough?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.700
That's perfect!
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.440
&gt;&gt; Probably spent twice
as long on that as I needed to.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.740
&gt;&gt; Okay. so now we're going to be
soldering the bezel onto the sheet.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.920
So that means that on this solder, we're
going to go ahead and use medium,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.100
and medium melts a little bit lower...

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.240
&gt;&gt; Because this way,
we won't melt the first solder joint

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.160
but it will still bond to the brass,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.620
so we don't lose what we've already done.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.220
&gt;&gt; So go ahead and just
&gt;&gt; So we just grab pieces

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.900
&gt;&gt; line the inside.
&gt;&gt; and sort of line the inside.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.160
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.360
The important part about this solder

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.280
is that if you think about
these two pieces of metal,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.250
you have the brass here 
and you have a sheet here,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.340
The brass bezel is going to get
hotter a lot faster than a sheet.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.310
It's less dense.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.460
There's less metal there.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.400
So that means that what
you don't want to have happen

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.440
is for the bezel to get hot,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.680
and then have all the solder
stick to the bezel

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.900
but have the sheet still cool
and have it never stick to the sheet.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.700
Okay, let's aim down and go in circles.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.800
So we're going to see--

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.260
We're gonna see the flux bubble,
which is totally normal,

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.260
and I'll come in here,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.620
and kind of push those
solder bits close to the edge.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.460
Right now, we're pretty hot.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.780
So we're gonna focus on
getting the sheet hot.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.280
So I want you to aim right in the center,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.800
and then I want you to go
circles around the outside.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.340
[Music]

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.960
Perfect.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.460
Now, what we're looking for now
is if there's any light gaps.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.200
So it looks like over here,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.320
that's haven't quite melted.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.140
So kind of go up and down on this end,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.060
and big circles again.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.400
Solder goes where it's hottest.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.560
So what we're doing is
we're heating the inside,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.960
and then going to the
outside and sucking it out,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.080
and you are good.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.340
So put the flame down.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.560
[Music]

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.980
So now we have this piece of brass.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.580
The bezel is soldered down to the sheet.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.700
and an important part about this step

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.100
is we actually do not want
to shove our stone in there.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.420
It's tempting but it will get stuck.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.800
So we can kind of place it in there,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.200
get an idea of how it's going to look,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.360
we don't have to shove it into the--
into the actual bezel until the very end,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.740
after it's all polished.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.780
So  what we always do is
we're going to use scissors

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.140
just to cut as close as we can to the bezel

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.100
and then we're going to use
an actual lapidary machine grinder

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.840
to get right up against the edges.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.240
[Music]

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.760
&gt;&gt; Definitely got some of
the brass color showing up

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.880
now that we've been grinding away
the oxidized layer on the outside.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.040
&gt;&gt; That looks great.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.760
So we have these nice curved
edges all the way around the outside.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.260
My fingernail can't catch
any of these edges,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.060
and we're not worried
about color quite yet.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.660
Right now you'll see
it is brassy on the bottom half

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.320
because we just grinded that
and it's all right on the top half

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.000
but on the next solder
it's gonna be all red again.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.620
So this is exactly what you want to see,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.740
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.600
Now comes time to do the ring band.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.839
So the ring band is going to be the
part that goes around your finger.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.000
That's actually gonna hold
the stone in place.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.980
So we are going to be
sizing this one to a 5.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.820
&gt;&gt; Size 5 and that would
be Grant's left pinky finger.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.820
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; I believe.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.360
&gt;&gt; So the way we get the
right size is we use a ring mandrel.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.280
It has different numbers on here
gauging what size it is.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.500
So we're aiming for that size 5 right there.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.520
So begin wrapping your silver
band around the ring mandrel,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.380
and trying to get to that size 5.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.960
Once you kind of have the rough shape,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.040
go ahead and just cut it.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.240
Cut it like right here.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.140
&gt;&gt; We still have a little more
material on there than I need, huh?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So now what we do,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.340
is actually slide it down
on the ring mandrel,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.950
and use this rawhide hammer
just to make it into a circle.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.460
We don't really worry about size as much.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.260
[Music]

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.100
Now, we have the
ring band to the correct size,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.260
and what we want to see is a really
good connection between the ring band

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.060
and this-- and the brass sheet.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.660
So we're actually going to grind
a flat spot across top of this

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.120
so it lays flat.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.840
So, that's perfect!

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.020
Now it's flat and it's
going to lay right on there.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.440
Like I said earlier, the more connection,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.180
the better for a solder.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.920
So we're going to flux this up, as always,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.580
and then we're actually use a third arm
to hold that in place right there.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.660
&gt;&gt; Easy solder this time?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.560
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.514
The goal with this solder

00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:40.860
is to get it just hot enough
for the easy solder to melt,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.060
and make that connection strong.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.960
But we do not want to get too hot

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.240
because if we get it too hot...
&gt;&gt; We'll lose the other two bonds.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.160
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.580
So with this solder what we're focusing on
again is getting that sheet nice and hot.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.120
We do want the band to be hot as well.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.040
So it has something that the solder will
have something to connect to.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.820
A little closer...

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.500
[Music]

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.260
And if you watch closely,
you're gonna see that brass turn all black.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:16.580
[Music]

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.200
That's great! Perfect!

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.040
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.520
&gt;&gt; All right, go ahead and quench it.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.780
[Music]

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.080
That looks like a ring.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.960
So we always check those solders,
make sure that they're nice and secure.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.060
I kind of wiggle it a little bit
and these aren't going anywhere.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.240
So now comes the next step,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.720
and we're going to drop
this at Crock-Pot full of acid.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.040
&gt;&gt; We've got our slow cooker full
of acid and then we just drop the ring in.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.050
How long do we leave it in there?

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.840
&gt;&gt; We leave it in for like 5-10 minutes,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.360
and then once it's gonna go,
it's gonna go in looking pretty black,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.300
but it comes out brass
its gonna look kind of light red.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:13:03.300
[Music]

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.980
Okay, so we pulled it out of a Crock-Pot,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.680
and now you're going to notice
that there's a bit of a red hue

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.220
across all of the brass.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks more
like Copper at this point.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.600
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.680
So now we're going to do is we're
going to grind away all of that red,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.540
and underneath that,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.660
you're going to see a lot
of really pretty brass color.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.180
So we're gonna use the
lapidary machine one more time,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.620
and we're going to use some 
of the softer grinding wheels,

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.820
they're more like sandpaper.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.100
Now ground down pretty much all
of the red surfaces that I can get to,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.400
and it's time to move on
to the polishing wheel.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.060
This is a very very fine grit
stuff that sticks to our wheel,

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.640
and then it polishes the brass
just by being very slightly abrasive.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:53.280
[Music]

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.240
Our ring is all cleaned, polished
and cut and ready to go,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.460
and for the most part,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.040
the bezel should do its job
and hold the stone in.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.380
All right, the stone is set.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.180
This was a pretty tight fit.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.080
And now do we want to bend the bezel
in over it just a little bit to hold it better.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.560
&gt;&gt; So, this is call it burnishing tool,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.580
and what we use this
for is to bend that brass

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.860
over the top of the stone like that

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.920
all the way around.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.750
Put your whole strength into it.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.180
We want to bend that brass
as closely to the stone as possible.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.680
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.100
Now some of my fingernails
may have some black metal polish

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.120
under them at the moment.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.540
But there you go, the five rings,
and this are not size for my hands.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.600
I can't quite get them on all of the fingers.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.440
I've just got them set up like this.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.160
But they're looking pretty nice.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.880
We've got some great colors
and some very shiny brass.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.440
We've got five rings
and a bracelet made.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.720
That I think makes us
as powerful as Thanos.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.760
Powerful as Thanos.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:15:18.040
