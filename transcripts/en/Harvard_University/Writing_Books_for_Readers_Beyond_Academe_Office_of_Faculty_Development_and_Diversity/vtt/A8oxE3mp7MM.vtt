00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.050
DAN GILBERT: Well, I have to
say, I feel like the odd man

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.390
out here, because
on my left I have

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.910
two people who have dedicated
their lives to the publishing

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.440
industry.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.731
On my right, I have one of
America's most distinguished

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:22.600
writers.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.850
And I'm a scientist.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.220
I mean, I wrote one book.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.270
I got really lucky.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.960
It became a bestseller.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.830
And I write better than
most scientists do,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.040
which means it's like
being the tallest jockey.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.530
So I won the lottery,
and everybody thinks

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm an expert on finance.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.755
But it turns out
that rich people

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:45.880
get to talk about how you
should invest your money,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.210
even if they inherited theirs.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.490
So take this with
a grain of salt.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.310
I ask myself, what
are the things

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.740
that I have learned as a result
of the process of writing

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.640
my book, that I wish I
had known when I started?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.760
And I thought of three of them.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.644
So the first one is
going to be quite-- I'm

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:04.894
going to be a little contrary.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.690
My observation is that
some people really

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.430
want to get married, and so
they go out and find somebody.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.930
And then there are other
people who find somebody,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.940
and it makes them
want to get married.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.230
I think the latter is a
better model for marriage,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.901
and I think it's the right
model for writing a book.

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.400
If you're asking yourself, what
should I write a book about,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.790
the answer is nothing.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.150
In other words, you should
be inspired to write a book.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.280
In fact, you should think,
if I don't write this book,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.240
I'm going to continue
to bore everyone

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.460
I know by telling
them this thing

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.290
that I can't stop thinking
and talking about.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.010
A book should be welling
up inside you to get out.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.480
If you're starting
with, I'd like

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.280
to be a writer, that's
the wrong place to start.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040
Harlan Ellison, a
science fiction writer,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.500
once said, "Anybody who wants
to be an aspiring writer

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.980
should ask themselves, if I
couldn't do that, what would

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.559
I do?"

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:59.100
And if they can
answer that question,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.970
they should do the other thing.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.110
I think, actually, the
world would be better off

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280
if fewer of us wrote
and more of us read.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.630
There are just a lot of
crummy books out there.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.784
You shouldn't write one.

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:12.200
So if you're
thinking, wouldn't it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.220
be nice to have my
book on a shelf,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.260
and my picture in
the New York Times?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.300
Yeah, that is nice.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.230
But that's not a
reason to write a book.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.380
Passion comes first.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.310
I am constantly reminded of this
because I wrote a bestseller,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.590
which means my agent
and my editor--

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.030
at least for a couple of
years-- called every few months

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.279
and said, so, what's your
next book going to be about?

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.770
To which I replied, I spent
15 years studying one thing,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.070
and I wrote a book about it.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.535
15 years from now, maybe
I'll write another one.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.910
Maybe I'll know something and
be interested in something,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.400
and I'll want to
open my mouth again.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.180
They're stunned by this answer.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.760
Wait a minute, you
have an audience.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.690
Shouldn't you just keep talking?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.220
The answer's no.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.519
They said, well, you could
write that book again.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.310
You could just say it
a little differently.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.980
I said, why do I
want to do that?

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.700
So I don't know.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.080
OK.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.815
So point number one
is, probably, you

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:05.840
shouldn't write a book.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.135
Now, assuming that
you are not going

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:10.260
to listen to point number
one, because you came all

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.040
the way over here
pretty convinced

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.000
that you do want
to write a book,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.730
I would say two things I've
learned about it that I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.960
would like to share with you.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.720
The first is that the main
way in which trade writing, as

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.460
far as I can see, differs
from academic writing

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.702
is that with academic writing,
or reader naturally shares

00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:31.160
our interest,
because we're writing

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.845
for people who do what we do.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.470
So when I sit down
to write an article,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.664
I know that the
reader already thinks

00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:38.580
that the role of the
ventral medial prefrontal

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.440
cortex and temporal discounting
is an earth-shattering topic.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.040
What I have to do is
convince him or her

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.390
that what I'm going to say about
it is original and correct.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.260
When a trade reader picks
up a book, first of all,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.760
they don't care if
it's original, as

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.800
long as it's original to them.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.050
I have a friend who is a
writer for New York Magazine.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.924
She once asked me, would
you write an article

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:02.250
on x topic for our magazine?

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.000
I said, you know, there
was just something

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.166
published on that last year.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.070
She said, if it wasn't
published this month,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.690
it was never published.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.800
That's the rule in journalism.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.460
Well, in fact, your
reader has to be stumbling

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.175
on your message
for the first time,

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:17.550
but you don't have to be the
first person to ever say it.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.060
Furthermore, you're the expert.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.640
They already trust that
what you're saying is right.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.050
What are they, going to
read my book and go, well,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.350
what does this guy know
about psychological science?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.810
I'm a professor at
Harvard, for God's sakes.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.905
What I have to
convince them about

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:33.280
is the one thing you never
have to convince your audience

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.860
about in academics, which
is that what you have to say

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.930
is interesting, and important,
and worth listening to.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.490
These are people with options.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.010
OK?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.468
They could be doing something
other than reading your book.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.480
They could be in the bath tub
with macaroons and a party hat.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.020
They could be reading
one of Luke's books.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.800
You have to convince them that
every page should be turned,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.733
and that they are not wasting
their money or their time.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.900
Third, I really think
that readers may not

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.650
know what's right.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.840
They may not know
what's original.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.050
But they smell
bullshit a mile away.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.630
They have a nose
for authenticity.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.200
And I think your book-- a good
book is written in your voice.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.772
I had a colleague who once told
me-- after my book came out,

00:05:24.772 --> 00:05:25.480
his wife read it.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.150
He said, you know, she came
to me and she said, my god.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.067
Reading this book is like
having a conversation with Dan,

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:33.400
except you don't get to talk
back-- to which, of course,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.480
he said, how is that unlike any
other conversation with Dan?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.680
But I actually took that
as a great compliment--

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.460
that, in fact, when
she read my book,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.810
she heard me talking like
I'm talking to you now.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.600
Now, you may think your
academic voice isn't your voice.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600
You may think your academic
voice is your voice.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.460
It isn't your voice.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.880
You don't go home and talk
to your spouse like that.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.200
If you do, you don't have one at
home, waiting to listen to you.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.240
Right?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.830
You have a real
voice in which you

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.150
communicate the things
you care about with people

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.090
you care about.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.490
And I think that's the voice in
which you have to write a book,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.550
if you want people to resonate
to what you have to say.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.180
I think along with
that, as we all

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.064
laughed when Betsy
said something

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:19.730
about tickling the
public's imagination,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.130
but you know the public.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.600
I think you can't have
contempt for your readers

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.562
or, again, once again--
no point in writing.

00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:28.020
There are a lot of
people out there

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.854
who are every bit as
smart as your students,

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:31.853
and they're more motivated
to hear what you have

00:06:31.853 --> 00:06:33.210
to say than your students are.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.600
They really want to learn
what you have to teach them,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.509
and they're smart.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.050
Your job isn't to show them that
you're a little bit smarter.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.510
Your job, as a writer,
is to show them

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.150
that they are very
smart, and they

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.810
may even have kind of known
what you're telling them,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.520
but couldn't quite put it
into the words you can.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.280
You're sharing a
journey with them.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.020
You're taking them someplace.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.500
You're not leading them
and impressing them.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.190
The one caveat I
would warn you is

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.350
that if you do write a book
that sells a lot of copies,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.890
you will be asked to blurb
books for the rest of your life.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.380
So I can only imagine I
get a small smattering

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.230
of what Luke does.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.620
But I would say
10 books a week--

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.010
somebody sends me and says,
could you say something nice?

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.510
I'm at the point
where, basically, I

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.599
can't blurb a book-- and
I'm actually saying this,

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.140
in case any of you
think you're going

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.140
to send me an email-- I can't
blurb a book unless you're

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.207
a member of my immediate
family, you've seen me naked,

00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:36.790
you've pulled me from a burning
jeep and given me your kidney,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.090
or you're Bob Dylan.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.880
Any of those, I will probably
be able to blurb the book.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.780
Yeah, so there's two errors
you can make in writing.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.787
One is to stop before
you're really finished,

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:52.120
and the other one is to stop
long after you're finished.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.070
So I think I'm going to
err towards the positive

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.160
and stop before I'm done.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.060
Thanks.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.410
[APPLAUSE]
