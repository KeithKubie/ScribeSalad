(upbeat jazzy music)

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.746

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.319
- We've got nothing to report.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.390
(slow jazz music)

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.506
(firecrackers blasting)

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.041
- Hey, hey take it easy!

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.043
- Calm down Chance, it's
just Broadway and Hawk.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.644
- Son of a bitch!

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.047
- Oh I'm sorry, did we wake you?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.849
Oh look Broadway, we woke up
a couple of diaper babies.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.418
- We weren't sleeping.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.453
We thought someone was trying
to murder us and we screamed.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.488 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh I'm sorry Moses,
are you afraid a

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.058
big scary bad guy is going to
come shoot you in the head,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.826 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then (imitating
splat) out the other side?

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.029
- Yeah, yeah we should all
be scared of that scenario.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.998
- You know I thought
it was childish myself.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.300
But Hawk really wanted
to do it so you know.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.501
Partners.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.936
- Alright day shift's
here dick lickers.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start position:0%
So take you beef jerky wrappers
and your sad little farts

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.506
and exit the vehicle.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.278
- I hope you choke on
our sad little farts.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.213
- That's not possible
you fucking idiot.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I wanted to ask you about
this thing on Saturday.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.183
Am I supposed to
bring anything, or?

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.452
- Just a bottle of wine
and your lovely wife.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.352
(laughing)

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.620
Just playing.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.089
- You're having a
thing in Saturday?

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah his wife invited
Rashida and I over for dinner.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.059 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's not a big deal,
it's just a couples thing.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.327
I didn't think you
would want to go.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:35.495
- You invited him
- You know I don't

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.796 align:start size:81% position:19%
like eating alone.
- to a thing

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you didn't invite me?
He's a jerk!

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.398
- Guys it's not a big deal.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.332
Take it easy.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.300
- Look if I'm being honest,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.534
you make my wife uncomfortable,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.470 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I can't invite
you to dinner.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.572
- You make your wife
uncomfortable, Moses.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:46.806
- You're right, I'm sorry.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Don't apologize,
stand up for yourself.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.710
- No he can talk to
him like if he wants!

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.911
- Yeah!

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:52.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Get in the fucking
car, Broadway!

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.414
- Alright, I'm sorry.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.018
- Farts!

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.820 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Get your crap, get in here.
- I'll cut you!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.989
(slow jazz music)

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.390
- So I've been taking
some typing classes

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
at the learning annex.
- That's good,

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:06.860
you can probably get your work.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.694 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- Oh, what's up guys?

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:08.962
- Hey.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.831
- Enjoy the night
shift shit birds.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.765
- Be a grown up.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.067
Count to three, our exercises.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.568
Our exercises.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.203 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hey, my wife's going to make
some pie for this Saturday.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.005 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh wow.
- Talked her into it.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:22.142 align:start position:0%
I had to do a lot of oral
activity to get her to say yeah.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.610
- You mean talking.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.477 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah, I just had
to talk to her.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.712
- Yeah, and ask her.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.846
- I asked her to do
it and she said yeah.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:27.680
Hey Tim.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.583
- Hi?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.992
(slow jazz music)

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.977 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Should we put the game on?
- Want the game on?

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:58.811
- Yes.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.550
(radio playing Ranchera music)

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.784
- Turn that off.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.019
- I'm trying to,
it's not working.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.353
- Hawk and Broadway must
have rigged the radio.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.322
Listen, I can't listen
to Ranchera music, okay?

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.857
It's a trigger for me.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.126
I was in Tijuana when Terissa
served me with divorce papers.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.827 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm know I'm trying,
the knob came off!

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:15.695
I can't turn it off!

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.930
- The knob came off,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.831
I can't fucking listen
to Ranchera music, man!

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.766
- I know, I know.
- Turn it off!

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.800
- I'm trying to!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.569 align:start size:75% position:25%
Chance, I need.
- Fuck!

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.403
- Chance, I need
you to calm down.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.237
- Get me out of here!

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.171
I need you to calm down!

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.673
- Stop yelling at me, Terissa!

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.507 align:start size:75% position:25%
(shouting)
(glass breaking)

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.175
- Come on, Chance.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.009
Come on!

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.279
Don't, hey help, get back!

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.351
- So let's say next time
we're on the shooting range

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
that maybe my aim isn't
so good and, boom!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.056
Hawk's head explodes.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.724
What is that?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.793 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hawk and Broadway
Photoshopped Denise's head

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.995
on one of those hooker
flyers you get downtown.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.663
- First of, you don't really
get them downtown anymore.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.599
It's more like on fair grounds.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.935
Listen, for one thing you
can't stand for this, okay?

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.337
- I know, I know.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:00.940
- We got to kill 'em.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.308
- Just take it easy, Chance.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.142
- I'll help you kill them.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.344
- It's not a big deal.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.113
- It's kind of a
big deal, you know?

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:10.917
- You know, I didn't
need to mention this

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
during marriage
counselling on Thursday.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.321
This could actually
be pretty funny.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.756
- That does it.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.025 align:start size:97% position:3%
Nobody messes with my
partner and his stupid wife

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.960
who doesn't invite me to things.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.794
Nobody!

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.367
- Hey, hold on, hold on.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.569
I rigged the radio to give them
a shock when they answer it.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.070
Here, check this out.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.873
Hey car 67, come in please.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.075
(slow jazz music)

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.977
Car 67, come in please.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:45.451
- Car 67, got a question
for you , come in please.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.719
- [Man On Radio] This is car 67.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.388
Hey, oh my god!

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh my god, my skin's burning!
(yowling painfully)

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.427
- Oh shit!
- Oh my god!

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.895
They're not even
trying to get out!

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.597
My wife was going to make a pie
to take over to their house.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:58.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now I'm going to
have to take a badge

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.300
and a folded up flag!

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.501 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It was just
supposed to shock 'em.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.435
- No!

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.603
You stop right now, okay?

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.505 align:start size:84% position:16%
You stop, I am
done with you Hawk!

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.973
I'm telling the
chief everything!

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.942
The cars, the women, the men.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.144
Yeah, everything, okay?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.178
You are finished!

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.646
- Don't you dare!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.049 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you go to the chief I will
hang out out to dry like.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.985 align:start position:0%
- So what, you think I'm scared
of being hung out to dry?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.454
This is so stupid, why
do you do this crap?

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.689
- Hey Broadway.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.657
Lick it up, Hawk!

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.892
Lick it up!

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:26.793
Lick it!

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.627
- Moses!

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.295
- You know, partners.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.129
Sorry.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Can I come to
your party, please?

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.600 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I'm a party guy.
- Dinner.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.436 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, it's a party.
- Chips, the last time you.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.071
- I can be a charades master.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.572
(everyone arguing)

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:42.275
- Slapped 'em with a good time.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:43.343
Come on, man.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:52.085
(upbeat jazzy music)
