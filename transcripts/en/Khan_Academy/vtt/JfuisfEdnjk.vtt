00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:02.663
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out what

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:06.842
x plus three times

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.106
x minus three is, and I encourage you

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:10.290
to pause the video and see if you can

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.380
work this out.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.842
Well, one way to tackle
it is the way that we've

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.025
always tackled it when
we multiply binomials,

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.730
is just apply the
distributive property twice.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.760
So first we can take this
entire yellow x plus three

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.602
and multiply times each
of these two terms.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:28.203
So first we can multiply it times this x.

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:32.972
So that's going to be
x times x plus three.

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:36.158
And then we are going to

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:39.455
multiply it times, we can
say, this negative three.

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:42.636
So we could write minus three times,

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:44.575
now that's going to be multiplied by

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.446
x plus three again.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.632
And then we apply the
distributive property

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.968
one more time.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.849
Where we take this magenta x and we

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:55.569
distribute it across this x plus three

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.045
so x times x is x squared,

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.516
x times three is three x, and then

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.826
we do it on this side.

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:07.957
Negative three times x is negative three x

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:11.253
and negative three times three

00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:13.586
is negative nine.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:15.235
And what does this simplify to?

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:17.185
Well, we're gonna get x squared,

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.008
and we have three x and minus three x

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:20.889
so these two characters cancel out,

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.592
and we are just left with x squared

00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:26.472
minus nine.

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:27.773
And you might see a little pattern here,

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.745
notice I added three and
then I subtracted three

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:35.284
and I got this, I got the x squared

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.826
and then if you take three and multiply it

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.310
by negative three, you are going to get

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.703
a negative nine.

00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:43.247
And notice, the middle terms canceled out.

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:44.374
And one thing you might ask is,

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:46.406
well, will that always be the case, if we

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.971
add a number and we subtract that same

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:50.410
number like that?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.292
And we could try it out.

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.672
Let's talk in general terms.

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:55.959
So if we, instead of doing x plus three

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.270
times x minus three, we could write

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.417
this same thing as, instead of three,

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:04.771
let's just say you have x plus a

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.602
times x minus a.

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:10.926
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:12.772
and work it all out, just assume

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.525
a is some number, like three

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.835
or some other number, and apply the

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:20.144
distributive property
twice and see what you get.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:21.432
Well, let's work through it.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:25.194
So first we can distribute
this yellow x plus a

00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:27.608
onto the x and the negative a.

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:29.466
So x plus a times x,

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.252
or we could say x times x plus a,

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:36.861
that's going to be x

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.761
times x plus a,

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.420
and then we're going to have

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.185
minus a, or this negative
a, times x plus a.

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.617
So minus, and then we're gonna have

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:53.782
this minus a times x, plus a.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.493
Notice, all I did is I distributed

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:05.511
this yellow, I distributed this big chunk

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:08.078
of this expression, I just distributed it

00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:10.969
onto the x and onto this negative a.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.233
I'm multiplying it times the x

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.591
and I'm multiplying it by the negative a.

00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.306
And now we can apply the
distributive property again.

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:20.593
X times x is x squared,

00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:24.890
x times a is ax,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.267
and then we get

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:32.192
negative a times x is negative ax,

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:35.522
and then negative a times a, is negative

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:37.044
a squared.

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:39.609
And notice, regardless of my choice of a,

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.163
I'm going to have ax and then minus ax.

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:44.229
So this is always going to cancel out.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.865
It didn't just work for
the case when a was three.

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:49.292
For any a, if I have a times x and then

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:53.483
I subtract a times x, that's
just going to cancel out.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.130
So this is just going to cancel out,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.871
and what are we going to be left with?

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:01.365
We are going to be left with x squared

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:03.530
minus a squared.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.966
And you can view this as a special case.

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:10.066
When you have something, x plus something,

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:12.656
times x minus that same something,

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.676
it's going to be x squared minus that

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:16.347
something squared.

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:20.236
And this is a good one to know in general.

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.625
And we could use it to quickly figure out

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.971
the products of other binomials that

00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:25.922
fit this pattern here.

00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:28.546
So if I were to say, quick, what is

00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:33.383
x plus 10, times x minus 10?

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.948
Well, you could say, all right

00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.992
this fits the pattern, it's x plus a

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:39.743
times x minus a,

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:42.704
so it's going to be x
squared minus a squared.

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:46.201
If a is 10, a squared is

00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:48.450
going to be 100.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.703
So you can do it really quick once you

00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:52.075
recognize the pattern.
