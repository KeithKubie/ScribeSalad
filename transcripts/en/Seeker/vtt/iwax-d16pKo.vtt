00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.530
Atomic Oxygen sounds like an element that
was exposed to radiation in the 1930s and

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.810
became a comic book superhero... but that’s
MY idea, OK?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.210
I could make millions...

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.390
Hey Atomic Avengers, Ian here for DNews.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.420
So scientists recently spotted atomic oxygen
on Mars.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.990
Though the Mariner and Viking missions also
discovered the stuff in the 1960s and 70s,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.080
this time it was detected from EARTH by an
awesome flying telescope.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.230
The SOFIA telescope is a partnership between
NASA and the German Aerospace Center; it’s

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.219
basically a converted Boeing 747-SP with a
2.5 meter diameter infrared telescope poking

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.219
out the back.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.420
Yes, a telescope, about the same diameter
as the Hubble Space Telescope, flying on a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.190
jumbo jet high above most of the Earth’s
atmosphere.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
So.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
Cool.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.429
But, what is atomic oxygen and why does it
matter that it's on Mars?

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.269
Well, oxygen is highly reactive, so it tends
to bond to other molecules.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.479
When we breathe oxygen, we’re actually breathing
the most common form of oxygen “O-two”…

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.379
But when oxygen atoms exist by themselves,
chemists refer to it as “atomic oxygen.”

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.189
Atomic oxygen is formed when ultraviolet radiation
from the sun hits water molecules on Mars’

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.189
surface.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.939
The energy of this impact spits out the oxygen
atom from the H2O molecule and sends the hydrogen

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.229
component high into the atmosphere which is
eventually lost to space.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.060
It can also be produced from interactions
with carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
These free oxygen atoms quickly grab onto
lots of other different chemicals, like carbon,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.850
chlorine, nitrogen and even other oxygen atoms,
creating breathable O2 molecules.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.710
Atomic oxygen is rare at sea level on Earth,
because it will quickly bond with pretty much

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.710
anything.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.009
But, if we look at Low Earth Orbit, at around
400 kilometers high… atomic oxygen makes

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.340
up 96 percent of the atmosphere.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.520
Though very thin at these altitudes, the atomic
oxygen gas is so reactive that during the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.810
first shuttle flights, it was eroding and
damaging the orbiters’ hull coatings, forcing

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.319
NASA to use a different formula that was less
reactive.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.500
Anyway, detecting atomic oxygen on Mars can
tell us a lot about its atmosphere, its history

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.149
and, possibly, provide clues as to whether
or not Mars can sustain microbial life on

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.460
its surface, or if it ever did.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.130
Also, you know why Mars’ surface is so rusty?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.759
The red color is created by a coating of iron
oxide -- nope, even iron isn’t safe from

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.160
the atomic oxygen’s passion to bond.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.299
SOFIA is now giving us a global view of the
whole of Mars, and by taking many 8-hour flights

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.739
to stare at the planet, we’re able to understand
how atmospheric atomic oxygen changes with

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.739
time.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.480
In addition, SOFIA has detected ozone in the
high Martian atmosphere -- which is a molecule

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.989
of THREE oxygen atoms and a gas that is really
good at blocking ultraviolet light that can

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.040
damage life.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.330
For any possible Mars microbes, the more ozone,
the better.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.250
Ozone was actually detected on Mars in the
70s, and more recently by the European Mars

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.290
Express mission.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.540
In a paper published by Nature Geoscience
researchers found that an ozone layer occasionally

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.800
forms over the southern pole.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.920
Atmospheric currents and complex chemical
interactions are at play on Mars that don’t

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.040
occur on Earth.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.459
These findings are not only useful for understanding
the diversity of atmospheric chemistry on

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.019
planets in our solar system, it provides a
wonderful insight to the possible interactions

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.250
on very alien worlds orbiting other stars.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.550
And that’s not all.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.879
Mars used to be a lot warmer and wetter than
it is now, conditions that scientists think

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.150
were habitable for microbial life.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.880
So by understanding how the different types
of oxygen evolve over time, we can gain an

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.819
insight as to how much breathable oxygen (O2)
and how much ozone (O3) was around in Mars’

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.150
past, and, possibly help us understand if
life as we know it could still be hiding under

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.610
the red planet’s rusty rocks.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.549
So, could aliens be living on Mars?

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:35.560
