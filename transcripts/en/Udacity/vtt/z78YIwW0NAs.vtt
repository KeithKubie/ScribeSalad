00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.596
When we use the Pythagorean theorem to solve, we'll find that this distance,

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:08.349
from the top of the ladder to the base of the building, is 15 feet. Great

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.215
solving if you found it. But when you use the Pythagorean Theorem, we'll have x

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:18.904
squared plus x minus 7 squared equals 17 squared. We'll square these legs and

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:23.903
take the sum of the squares to get the square of the hypotenuse. Squaring these

00:00:23.903 --> 00:00:29.029
expressions, we get this equation. We'll add the like terms together here to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.295
get 2x squared minus 14x plus 49 equals 289. Then, we'll subtract 289 from both

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:40.869
sides to get our quadratic expression set equal to 0. Each of these terms is

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:46.062
divisible by 2, so we can divide our equation by 2. We take our quadratic

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.897
expression, and we factor it by finding the factors of negative 120 that sum to

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:56.412
negative 7. Those factors are negative 15 and positive 8. We set each of these

00:00:56.412 --> 00:01:02.569
factors equal to 0, and then we solve for values of x. So x can equal positive

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:07.536
15 or x can equal negative 8. We know that the distance cannot be negative 8

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:12.380
feet, since distance is always positive. So instead, x is going to equal 15

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
feet. This is the distance from the top of the ladder to the base of the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.900
building.
