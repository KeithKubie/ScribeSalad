00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.071
And now it's time to play
Talk Birdy To Me.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.406
Talk Birdy To Me.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.843
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:13.447
Talking to animals isn't just
for your jade-wearing aunt

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.082
who has a pet psychic business
on the side.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.451
I think anyone can do it.
So comedians, I'm gonna show you

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.454
a video of a chatty animal and
for 250 points, please tell me

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:24.224
what they are saying.
First up, this howling husky.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.193
(howling)

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.399
(bell dings)

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.600
Chelsea.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.037
Where are my balls?!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.507
That... Absolutely.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.642
Sean.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.945
Why do seals keep trying
to (bleep) me?

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.813
Points.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:50.217
Next up, this pissed-off puss.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.186
(moaning)

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.257
(bell dings)

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.159
Oh, my God, I should watch these

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.896
before we do the show--
they're (bleep) terrifying.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.300
What in the holy living (bleep)?

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.269
Jesus Christ.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.105
What sort of weird
Egyptian mummy's curse

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.943
(bleep) that out on the...
the material plane?

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:19.913
Oh, I don't feel good.
Chelsea.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.617
Why am I made
entirely out of taint?

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:26.320
-Jesus Christ.
-Points.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.788
Sean.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.391
She's clearly saying,
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.960
Oh, no, you didn't."

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.461
All right. Points.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.563
What, did you just
get cheated on?

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.699
I got this pussy waxed for you.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.268
And you cheat on me?
It's like...

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.705
All right, next up,
this pathetic panda.

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.673
(whimpering)

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.215
(bell dings)

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.817
Sweet perm.
Adam.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.785
Where do you
want me to (bleep)?

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.055
Points.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.423
Uh, Sean.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.726
Uh, make sure
to try the orange chicken.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.394
-That's what it's saying.
-Great.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.329
Points.
All right.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.931
(applause)

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.266
More points.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.801
All right, next up,
this pig with the munchies.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.770
(squealing)

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.112
-(bell dings)
-Uh... Sean.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.881
Sorry, I'm being
a real me right now.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:27.981
Oh, nice. It's, like, yeah,
it's coming back around.
