What advice would you give to your 16-year-old self?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.351
It is hugely helpful to love what you do

00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.901
and to do something that you're interested enough in

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.662
that you can keep doing it forever

00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:16.126
and not get bored with it.

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:20.171
But even things that you really love

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.380
are going to have hard, weird, lost moments

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.765
as you go through.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:28.845
And so it's important to just,

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:29.536
as I said before,

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:30.561
just keep moving

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.565
and get through those moments

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.568
and realize that everybody has them.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.579
And it's not because there's something the matter with you,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.641
but just because you're doing something hard

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:47.060
and hard things are hard sometimes

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.619
but still worth doing.
