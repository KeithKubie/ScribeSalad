00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.960
In my mind nothing is as synonymous with hospitals
as a bag of intravenous saline hanging from

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.330
a little metal tree.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.330
They’re practically ubiquitous in emergency
rooms and it’s a serious problem when they’re

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.750
in short supply.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.030
Normal Saline, as it’s called, is incredibly
simple, it’s mostly just sterile water and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.109
about point-nine percent good old fashioned
sodium chloride, aka table salt.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.729
When injected intravenously it’s used to
help deliver drugs or rehydrate patients.

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:28.029
Doctors prescribe it to treat a variety of
symptoms.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.529
Headache?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.220
Saline.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.760
Vomiting?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.280
Saline.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.040
Lightheaded?

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.620
Saline.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.600
It’s like Salt Bae became a doctor, just
sprinkling a little salt into everyone’s

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.610
veins.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.691
But for something so vital to modern medicine,
it’s surprisingly under studied, and there

00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:43.700
may be something better out there.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.010
The practice of saline injection is rooted
in the 1830s, when cholera was booming worldwide

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.420
and everyone was pooping themselves to death.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.190
Scottish doctor Thomas Latta started treating
the severe dehydration caused by fluid loss

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.790
in the most direct way possible, by pumping
fluid right back into the bloodstream.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.710
Physicians back then didn’t know too much
about what was in blood but they knew it tasted

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.710
salty.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.700
Which is a weird thing to know, but moving
on.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.659
So, Latta’s first intravenous solution had
a mix of salt and sodium bicarbonate, better

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.609
known as baking soda.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.539
Apparently doctors back then just rummaged
through their kitchen for medicine.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.270
It’s ok though, Dr. Latta said the
first person he tried it on was practically

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.899
dead anyway so NBD.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.659
The point-nine percent saline solution we
use today stems from an 1883 experiment by

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.490
Dutch scientist Dr. Hamburger.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.069
I love that name.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.060
Dr. Hamburger concluded that was the concentration
of sodium and chloride in human blood and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.780
so an intravenous solution should have the
same levels to be normal.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.770
Hence the name, “normal saline.”

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.869
Somehow, and no one’s quite sure how, Dr.
Hamburger’s results became the basis for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.389
IV fluids that we still use to this day.

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.590
But Dr. Hamburger was wrong.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.349
His estimates were a little too high for sodium,
and much too high for chloride.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.869
Still it wasn’t until the 80s that scientists
started studying possible downsides, and found

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.970
that normal saline caused kidney damage in
dogs and later that it could turn blood acidic.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.630
But there may be a better solution.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.180
See what I did there?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.750
Because solution can mean- forget it.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.990
A contemporary of Dr. Hamburger, Sidney Ringer,
concocted a fluid with levels of sodium, chloride,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.270
and potassium that are similar to blood’s.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.610
It’s called lactated Ringer’s solution,
and only in 2018, 135 years after Dr. Hamburger’s

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.610
incorrect conclusion, were the two IV fluids
compared in a randomized trial.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.340
Researchers tested the two fluids on over
15,000 ICU patients, and the results aren’t

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.670
mind-blowing at first glance.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.180
Patients who received a balanced solution
like lactated Ringer’s fared a tiny bit

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.560
better, with one percent fewer either dying
or suffering kidney problems.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.100
One percent, big whoop right?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.490
Until you remember just how ubiquitous normal
saline is, how many millions of adults receive

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.040
it each year.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
Considering lactated Ringer’s costs about
the same as normal saline, it looks like there’s

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.210
no reason not to prescribe it instead, and
this is a helpful reminder to reexamine what

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.320
we accept without second thought just because
it’s the way we’ve done things in the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
past.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.980

Put a little bit of salt water in your veins
and you’re fine, but put the wrong type

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.670
of blood in and you’re in trouble.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.390
Why our our bodies compatible with some blood
types but not others?

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.570
Check out this video of a little baby me to
learn more.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.870

out already, but you can actually make your

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.720
own saline at home!

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.750
But, y’know, don’t.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.360
