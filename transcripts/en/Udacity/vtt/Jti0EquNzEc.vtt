00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.240
So, in this final sub-mar, sub-lecture about cameras,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.970
I just wanted to showcase to you the importance of different types of sensors.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.560
We discussed the photographic process that was applied to both digital and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.960
film capture.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.523
Also discussed how sensors work in a camera.

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:19.850
We looked at different types of color filters.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.094
Talked about their filtering.

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:25.520
Discuss in brief CCD and CMOS sensors.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.710
And also discussed a little bit about the camera raw format.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.510
The goal, of course, of all of this was for us to now learn as much as we could,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.860
about what a camera is, and how rays of light are converted into pixels.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.310
We have looked at how to do pixel-based processing before.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.880
We know how light is captured, in this instance.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.129
So now we will take a little bit more deeper look at

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.596
doing computational photography.

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:53.589
So in the next class we

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.583
will actually get into doing some computational photography.

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.904
We'll start with learning a lot about things like blending and fading.

00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:02.729
Eventually we'll come to look at things like oh,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.769
how can we actually build panoramas and high-dynamic range imaging,

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.420
some of the well known examples of computational photography.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.250
Of course, I'll be exploring and actually also showcasing to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.070
you a wide variety of other sets of examples in the same way.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.850
Again, just wanted to list a few examples of books that you could look at that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.200
give you more details about both cameras, the processing pipeline,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.420
and also, you know, how photography really works.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.930
While this class is not really about photography, these are foundational things

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.330
that we will actually be playing around with a lot.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.670
Again, look for additional details on the website for the class.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.300
And remember, always have fun computing with photographs.
