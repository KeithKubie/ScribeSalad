00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.754
The original texture is just fine, it's a square. Even if it were distorted in

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.778
some funny way, why the upper left of the texture would be different than the

00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:11.798
lower right isn't clear. The second answer is incorrect. Three JS may have some

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:15.328
bugs in it but this is not one of them. The third answer is interesting. In

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:18.056
fact if the square was made out of a fine mesh of triangles, depending on how

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.608
the triangles were created when the square was worked, could make the

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:25.470
distortion look more natural. The fourth answer is indeed the reason. If you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.815
tried the show polygon option in the demo, you'd see the two triangles. Since

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.116
the square is made of two triangles, moving the corner of the upper left

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:36.510
triangle has no effect on the triangle in the lower right. I highly recommend

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.602
reading the article that is listed in the additional course materials. It

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:43.239
discusses this and a number of other common rendering problems.
