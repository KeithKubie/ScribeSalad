00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay, this is looking pretty good. We've got our Bin

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.430
object. We've got all these fields on it what is next?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.740
&gt;&gt; And so it's great we're almost done but as you can kind of see in

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.940
the schema builder, band is sort of a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.600
lonely Allen right now and not really connected

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.290
to anything. And the way that we're going to get the most out of that data for

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.190
tracking it and being able to really understand.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.890
Where the bands are playing at our festival,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.050
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.690
&gt;&gt; We're going to need to relate it to another object.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; Which object do you think we need to relate it to to make logical sense?
