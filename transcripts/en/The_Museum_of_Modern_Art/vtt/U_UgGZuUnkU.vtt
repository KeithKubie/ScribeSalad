- Hi, my name is Lisa Libicki,

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm a School Programs
Educator here at MoMA.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.552
This is Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing #1144,

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.339
Broken Bands of Color in Four Directions.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.476
Looking at this work, it's obviously

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.332
really eye-catching and visually dazzling,

00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:26.538
and kids really get excited to see it

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:28.024
when we turn the corner.

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:32.125
They immediately notice the
four-panel construction.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.469
Oftentimes they've studied
tessellations in class

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.116
and they'll say, "These
are four tessellations."

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.298
And then maybe that same
student and another student

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:42.109
will refine that observation and be like,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.197
"Wait a second, these
aren't identical rectangles.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:48.076
"They shift in scale and length."

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:51.548
I love immediately introducing the idea

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:54.357
that Sol LeWitt didn't paint this himself,

00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:56.946
and I think students are really

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.002
sort of generally taken aback,

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.070
whether they're kindergartners
or twelfth graders.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.467
And it's fun to watch that reaction.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.183
Usually it immediately
generates questions,

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.075
like "How do they know what to do?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.943
"Where was the connection between
the artist and the people?

00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:14.010
"Was the artist here to watch them do it?"

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.819
I say that this drawing or painting

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.397
is based on a set of instructions

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.208
that usually comes along with a diagram,

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:23.831
and that's what the museum purchased,

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:25.770
or in this case actually was given.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.301
I think oftentimes when students react,

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.414
"Wait a second, this is unfair,"

00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:34.199
it oftentimes leads to the musicians

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:35.908
in the group that are
in their school's band

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:40.747
to be like, "Oh wait, someone
else composed this music,

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:43.579
"we all play it and let
the audience experience it,

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.647
"but we're not gonna claim

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:46.551
"that we wrote that Beethoven song.

00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.849
"He gets the credit, and
he deserves the credit."

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.796
I often bring students here
as a last work in a tour

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:55.026
no matter what the theme might be,

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:57.441
because I feel like it
adds a new dimension

00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.252
that usually hasn't been grappled with,

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.367
with any other object.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.946
But sometimes I feel
like I like to end tours,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:03.919
rather than tying everything together,

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.614
like, exploding everything,

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:09.493
and leave students like craving

00:02:09.493 --> 00:02:12.027
more answers, more questions.
