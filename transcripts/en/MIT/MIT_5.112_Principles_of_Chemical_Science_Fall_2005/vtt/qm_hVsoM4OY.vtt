00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.464
I am going to continue our
blitz through a review of

00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:24.857
thermodynamics.
And we are going to start,

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:30.000
right now, talking about
spontaneous change.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.113
And you all know what
spontaneous change means.

00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:38.853
It means some change that
occurs without intervention.

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:42.878
Spontaneous change has a
directionality to it.

00:00:42.878 --> 00:00:46.723
For example,
if you put a rock at the top of

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:49.943
a hill and you let go,
it rolls down,

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:54.325
it doesn't roll up.
If you put a warm body next to

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:59.780
a hot body, the heat flows from
the hot body to the cold body,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.521
and not the other way.
If you, for example,

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.856
have a bulb of gas here and a
stop-cock and an empty bulb,

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:12.736
you open the stop-cock,
that gas flows from the high

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:15.930
pressure region to the low
pressure region,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.364
and it does not go the other
way.

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:22.319
However, spontaneous change
does not have to be fast.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.742
You know that if you take a
bottle of ketchup,

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.545
when it used to be a glass
bottle that you couldn't

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:34.109
squeeze, and you turn it over,
that ketchup has a spontaneous

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.317
tendency to flow out.
But it does not have to be

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:42.527
fast.
What is, in chemical reactions,

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:46.717
the key to spontaneity?
Is it the exothermicity?

00:01:46.717 --> 00:01:51.709
Well, certainly iron rusts.
You don't have to do anything

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.542
to make it rust.
A very exothermic reaction.

00:01:55.542 --> 00:02:00.000
Delta H is about 824 kilojoules
per mole.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.353
If you have an acidic stomach
and you then ingest something

00:02:05.353 --> 00:02:10.615
that is a little bit more basic,
well, this reaction goes.

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:15.507
It neutralizes that acid,
also an exothermic reaction.

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:21.230
You did not have to do anything
other than drink the more basic

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.353
solution.
This reaction,

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:28.707
here, this hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP, adenosine diphosphate,

00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:32.427
--
-- proceeds in every cell of

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:37.630
your body, and you don't have to
do anything to make that go.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.832
That is an exothermic reaction.
But what about an endothermic

00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:45.693
reaction?
How about this reaction?

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:50.115
This is ammonium nitrate
dissolving in water to make

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:55.317
ammonium ions and nitrate ions.
The delta H for this reaction

00:02:55.317 --> 00:03:00.000
is positive, plus 25.7
kilojoules per mole.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.077
It is an endothermic reaction.
Is this reaction spontaneous?

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:07.744
Well, yes.
We are going to do an

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:11.961
experiment anyway.
And the experiment we are going

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:17.038
to do is, you are going to be
given one of these cold packs.

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:20.394
And the TAs can start
distributing them.

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:25.471
What you have to do is find the
little pouch inside the cold

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:31.220
pack that contains the water.
You have to press on that,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.148
allowing the water to disperse
in the material,

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.308
and you will see if the
reaction goes.

00:03:38.308 --> 00:03:43.176
If it goes, that cold pack
better get cold because this is

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:47.873
an endothermic reaction.
It is going to remove some heat

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:52.314
from the environment.
Some of you will get hot packs,

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:55.559
and we will see if that is
spontaneous.

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:00.000
Is an endothermic reaction
spontaneous?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.640
Yes.
Is an exothermic reaction

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.527
spontaneous?
Yes, right.

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:10.669
Is delta H the key to
spontaneity?

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.050
No.
What is?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.071
Delta G, right.
So, delta G is the key to

00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:21.841
spontaneity.
You already know that when

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:27.112
delta G is negative,
you have a spontaneous

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:32.179
reaction.
When delta G is positive,

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:35.230
you have a non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.892
And very importantly,
when delta G is zero,

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:41.943
that is when you are at
equilibrium.

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:47.000
That is what we are going to be
talking about in just a few

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.312
minutes, when delta G is equal
to zero.

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:54.497
These are the conditions,
of course, for constant

00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:59.379
temperature and pressure.
Delta S, in this expression for

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:04.000
delta G, is the change in the
entropy.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.953
It is a measure of disorder.
When delta S is positive,

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:12.224
we have an increase in the
disorder.

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:16.897
When delta S is negative,
we have a decrease in the

00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:20.542
disorder.
Where do these conditions come

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.532
from?
You are going to talk about

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:28.859
that in exquisite detail in
5.60, but I want to give you a

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:34.000
physical understanding for what
delta G is.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.006
And that is this.
Suppose you have an exothermic

00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:41.160
reaction.
It turns out that not all of

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.911
that exothermicity,
not all of that enthalpy,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:49.514
can be released to the outside
world to do useful work.

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:53.691
Some of that enthalpy is
actually caught up in the

00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:57.442
product molecules,
or can be caught up in the

00:05:57.442 --> 00:06:02.283
product molecules.
Some of that enthalpy gets

00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:07.728
stuck in the product molecules.
It gets stuck in the vibrations

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:12.382
and rotations of the product
molecules in the internal

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:16.597
degrees of freedom.
It is that energy that is not

00:06:16.597 --> 00:06:21.691
available to do useful work.
For some exothermic reactions,

00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:27.048
here, the amount of energy that
is available to do useful work

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:31.000
is something smaller than delta
H.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.181
It is delta H minus T delta S,
where T delta S,

00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:40.818
then, is a measure of how much
of that enthalpy is stuck in the

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:44.727
internal degrees of freedom of
the molecule.

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:50.272
And so, this delta G is called
the free energy because this is

00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:54.909
the amount of energy that is
free to do useful work.

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:59.106
That is what delta G is.
For example,

00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:04.916
if you go home and turn on your
gas stove, oxidize some methane,

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:10.172
burn some natural gas to heat
up the water for your pasta,

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:15.613
that delta H is very negative.
But let's now calculate delta

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:17.365
G.
Well, to do that,

00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:20.224
we need to know what delta S
is.

00:07:20.224 --> 00:07:24.005
Delta S, I will show you in
just a moment,

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:30.000
is the change in the entropy.
We can calculate that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.451
But knowing delta S then,
we can plug in the delta H and

00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.813
the temperature.
What we find is that delta G

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:43.183
here is less negative than delta
H.

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:48.139
Not all of this enthalpy,
not all of that energy is

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.897
available to the outside world
to do useful work.

00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:58.647
Some of it, in this reaction,
gets trapped or caught in the

00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:04.000
internal degrees of freedom of a
molecule.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.013
And it is not available to do
that useful work.

00:08:08.013 --> 00:08:12.550
Delta G, in this case,
is less negative than delta H.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.953
But let's take the eat,
breathe, exhale,

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:19.268
pee reaction.
The oxidation of glucose,

00:08:19.268 --> 00:08:24.416
going on in every cell of your
body, this reaction also very

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:27.731
exothermic.
Let's calculate delta G for

00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.773
this reaction.
Well, first of all,

00:08:31.773 --> 00:08:35.788
we need delta S.
From that, we can calculate

00:08:35.788 --> 00:08:38.216
delta G.
And, in this case,

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:40.923
what do you see?
In this case,

00:08:40.923 --> 00:08:45.592
you see that delta G is more
negative than delta H.

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:51.007
In this exothermic reaction,
we are getting back all of the

00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:55.955
enthalpy and then some.
We are getting back even more.

00:08:55.955 --> 00:09:01.744
And that extra energy is coming
from the energy that is tied up

00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:08.000
in the internal degrees of
freedom of the reactants.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.814
In this reaction,
here, delta S is positive.

00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:17.048
We are increasing the disorder.
If we increase the disorder,

00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:22.370
there are fewer ways to tie up
energy in the internal degrees

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:27.427
of freedom of the molecule.
When we increase the disorder,

00:09:27.427 --> 00:09:33.256
that is what happens.
And so, your body has figured

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:39.319
out how to get back all of that
delta H, and then some.

00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:45.382
We are getting that energy out
that is locked up in the

00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:51.108
reactants, in the internal
degrees of freedom of the

00:09:51.108 --> 00:09:55.263
reactants.
That is a physical feeling,

00:09:55.263 --> 00:10:02.000
there, for what delta G is.
Entropy for a reaction.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.550
The entropy is calculated from
the absolute entropies of the

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.868
products and the reactants.
And so, what you need are the

00:10:10.868 --> 00:10:15.496
absolute entropies for each one
of the products multiplied by

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:18.349
the appropriate stoichiometric
number.

00:10:18.349 --> 00:10:22.051
You sum them all up.
And you do the same then for

00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:25.290
the reactants,
the absolute entropy of each

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.994
one of the reactants multiplied
by that stoichiometric number.

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:32.900
Sum them up.
Subtract it.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.128
That is the entropy change for
the reaction.

00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:40.557
Now, one thing I do want to
point out is that in the case of

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.935
entropies, here,
these are absolute entropies.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.938
That is rather unusual in
thermodynamics.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:51.142
In thermodynamics usually we
look at changes in energies,

00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:54.745
but here we are talking about
absolute entropies.

00:10:54.745 --> 00:11:00.000
That is a consequence of the
third law of thermodynamics.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.094
You will see how that arises
again in 5.60,

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:09.944
but right now we are going to
use it to calculate the entropy

00:11:09.944 --> 00:11:14.038
for a reaction.
And some reactions here are

00:11:14.038 --> 00:11:17.743
completely entropy-driven.
For example,

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:21.448
if you melt ice,
this is an endothermic

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:24.763
reaction, 6.95 kilojoules per
mole.

00:11:24.763 --> 00:11:28.760
In going from solid water to
liquid water,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:35.000
you have to put energy into the
system to do that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.474
But you know that this reaction
occurs spontaneously.

00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:43.089
If I had a cube of ice here,
it would melt.

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:45.756
This reaction is
entropy-driven.

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:47.563
Why?
Let's look at it.

00:11:47.563 --> 00:11:51.091
Let's calculate delta S for
that reaction.

00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:56.341
You need the absolutely entropy
for water in the liquid phase,

00:11:56.341 --> 00:12:00.643
that is the product,
minus the absolute entropy for

00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:07.186
water in the solid phase.
The difference between the two

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:11.754
is positive.
We have increased the disorder.

00:12:11.754 --> 00:12:17.703
There are less ways to tie up
energy in liquid water than

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:21.102
there are in solid water,
in ice.

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:27.582
And that fact is going to make
this reaction then spontaneous,

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:33.000
6.95 positive for delta H minus
T delta S.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.977
This term, T delta S,
now is larger in absolute

00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:42.413
magnitude.
Therefore, delta G is negative.

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:48.904
This reaction is spontaneous.
It is certainly entropy-driven.

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:55.288
The other concept I want to
talk about is the free energy of

00:12:55.288 --> 00:13:02.104
formation, which is analogous to
what we talked about last time,

00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:09.032
the enthalpy of formation.
The free energy of formation is

00:13:09.032 --> 00:13:14.315
the free energy for a reaction
that forms one mole of a

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:19.989
compound from the elements in
their most stable form in the

00:13:19.989 --> 00:13:24.293
standard state.
And our standard state is one

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:27.521
bar.
The free energy of formation,

00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:33.000
here, is tabulated like the
heats of formation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.899
You can find tables of free
energy and enthalpy of formation

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:43.799
for all molecules.
However, unlike the enthalpy of

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:49.899
formation, the free energy of
formation can also be calculated

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:53.600
easily by you,
which is the following,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.000
if you know the enthalpy of
formation for some reaction.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.406
Or, for the reaction that
defines the enthalpy of

00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:07.527
formation.
And if you know what the

00:14:07.527 --> 00:14:12.209
entropy change is for that
reaction that defines the

00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:17.075
enthalpy of formation,
then you can calculate the free

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:21.849
energy here of formation.
You have two choices in the

00:14:21.849 --> 00:14:25.154
case of the free energy of
formation.

00:14:25.154 --> 00:14:30.758
You can look it up.
Or, if you know what delta H

00:14:30.758 --> 00:14:35.979
sub f and delta S
are for the reaction,

00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:41.791
that defines the free energy of
formation or the enthalpy of

00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:45.337
formation.
You can calculate the free

00:14:45.337 --> 00:14:47.799
energy of formation,
here.

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:53.316
Here is a reaction that forms
one mole of CO two.

00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:58.832
And the delta G for this
reaction is minus 394 kilojoules

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:03.581
per mole.
The delta G for this reaction

00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:09.011
is defined as the free energy of
formation for CO two.

00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:14.442
It is so because we are forming
one mole of this molecule from

00:15:14.442 --> 00:15:19.160
the elements in their most
stable form in the standard

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.097
state.
The most stable form of the

00:15:22.097 --> 00:15:26.905
element carbon is graphite.
The most stable form of the

00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:31.000
element oxygen is molecular
oxygen.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.700
But what is important about the
free energy of formation,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.910
here, is that it is a measure
of a compound stability relative

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.167
to decomposition to its
elements.

00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:50.544
For example,
the free energy of formation of

00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:55.838
carbon dioxide is negative.
What that means is CO two

00:15:55.838 --> 00:16:01.946
is thermodynamically
stable relative to decomposition

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:07.427
into its elements.
Because delta G for this

00:16:07.427 --> 00:16:13.699
reaction is written as negative.
The reaction is spontaneous in

00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:18.049
this direction.
It is not spontaneous in the

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:22.803
reverse direction.
That is, the decomposition of

00:16:22.803 --> 00:16:28.771
CO two to its elements
is not a spontaneous process.

00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:34.436
Therefore, we say that CO two
is thermodynamically stable

00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:40.000
relative to decomposition into
its elements.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.651
If you have a free energy of
formation for a molecule that is

00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:47.751
negative, it is
thermodynamically stable,

00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:52.325
but if you have a free energy
of formation that is positive,

00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:56.124
then that compound is not
thermodynamically stable

00:16:56.124 --> 00:17:00.000
relative to decomposition to its
elements.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.461
For example,
let's look at benzene.

00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:09.570
Here is a reaction that forms
one mole of liquid benzene from

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:14.967
the elements in their most
stable form in the standard

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:18.836
state, graphite and molecular
hydrogen.

00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:24.945
The free energy of formation
for this benzene is positive 124

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:31.359
kilojoules per mole.
That means that this forward

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:36.160
reaction, as written,
is not spontaneous.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:43.240
However, the reverse reaction
is spontaneous because delta G

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.079
is minus 124 kilojoules per
mole.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:52.839
And so we say benzene,
here, is thermodynamically

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:58.000
unstable relative to its
elements.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.971
But, even though you might have
a reaction, here,

00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:08.046
that is spontaneous,
that is the reverse reaction.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:12.707
You have a delta G formation
that is positive,

00:18:12.707 --> 00:18:17.160
meaning the reverse reaction is
spontaneous.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.546
Even though that reverse
reaction may be spontaneous,

00:18:22.546 --> 00:18:27.000
it also could be very,
very slow.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.862
When was the last time you saw
a pint of benzene decompose into

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:37.022
graphite and hydrogen?
You haven't seen that.

00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:40.805
I haven't seen that and I am a
lot older.

00:18:40.805 --> 00:18:45.627
What this means is that even
though you might have a

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:50.828
thermodynamic tendency to
compose, it does not mean that

00:18:50.828 --> 00:18:56.501
it is going to happen because
there is a question of the rate

00:18:56.501 --> 00:19:02.900
of the chemical reaction.
We have two different terms to

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.216
describe the thermodynamic
tendency and then the kinetic

00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:12.373
tendency, and these terms are
the following.

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:18.269
We call the molecules stable or
unstable when we are referring

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:23.973
to the thermodynamic tendency.
That is when we are referring

00:19:23.973 --> 00:19:29.000
to delta G or the free energy of
formation.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.737
If it is negative,
the molecule is stable.

00:19:32.737 --> 00:19:36.565
If it is positive,
the molecule is unstable

00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:41.123
relative to decomposition.
However, we also have to

00:19:41.123 --> 00:19:45.316
consider the rates.
And we have another term to

00:19:45.316 --> 00:19:49.053
describe the rates.
And that is labile and

00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:52.608
non-labile.
If a molecule is non-labile,

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:57.986
what that means is that the
rate, at which the thermodynamic

00:19:57.986 --> 00:20:03.000
tendency is realized,
is very, very slow.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.705
Benzene, for example,
is thermodynamically unstable

00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:11.752
relative to decomposition into
its elements,

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:15.611
carbon and hydrogen,
but it is non-labile.

00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:21.352
The rate at which that reaction
happens is just too slow to be

00:20:21.352 --> 00:20:24.364
of any practical interest to
you.

00:20:24.364 --> 00:20:30.105
However, if this decomposition
reaction occurred very readily,

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:35.000
then we would call that
molecule labile.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.750
That is, the rate of the
decomposition is something that

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:48.622
is going to affect your ability
to handle that particular

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:55.618
compound or that molecule.
Like the enthalpy of formation,

00:20:55.618 --> 00:21:02.000
the free energy of formation
can also be zero.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.335
Last time, we talked about how
the enthalpy of formation for

00:21:07.335 --> 00:21:10.319
hydrogen, oxygen,
chlorine, xenon,

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:14.207
all of that,
had zero enthalpy of formation.

00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:18.909
Well, all of these molecules
have zero free energy of

00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:24.515
formation because they are all
in the most stable form already,

00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:29.308
in the standard state.
The free energy of formation of

00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:34.281
bromine liquid and
mercury liquid is

00:21:34.281 --> 00:21:38.359
zero.
Because they are in the most

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.140
stable form at the standard
state.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.280
The free energy of formation of
carbon in the form of graphite,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.567
sodium solid,

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:53.191
iron solid, iodine solid.

00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:57.741
Those free energies of
formation are all equal to zero,

00:21:57.741 --> 00:22:02.292
but the free energy of
formation here of bromine in the

00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:09.068
gas phase is not equal to zero.
Because bromine gas is not the

00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:12.954
most stable form in our standard
state.

00:22:12.954 --> 00:22:17.761
Liquid bromine is,
so it is going to take energy

00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:23.181
to produce bromine gas.
So Delta G of formation is not

00:22:23.181 --> 00:22:27.784
going to be zero.
Likewise, the free energy of

00:22:27.784 --> 00:22:33.000
formation of diamond is not
equal to zero.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.730
Because carbon,
in the form of diamond,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.363
is not the most stable form of
carbon.

00:22:40.363 --> 00:22:44.585
Graphite is.
This is going to take energy to

00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:47.825
form that configuration of
carbon.

00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:53.618
So free energies of formation
are very important in terms of

00:22:53.618 --> 00:23:00.000
understanding the thermodynamic
stability of molecules.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.469
Just a review,
here.

00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:05.103
If you want to calculate delta
G for a reaction,

00:23:05.103 --> 00:23:08.737
what can you do?
You can take the free energy of

00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:13.144
formation for each one of the
products, multiply it by the

00:23:13.144 --> 00:23:17.010
appropriate stoichiometric
number, since those free

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.417
energies of formation are given
per mole, add them all up,

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:24.819
and then do the same thing for
the reactants.

00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:30.000
Free energies of formation for
each of the reactants.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.962
Stoichiometric number.
Add them all up.

00:23:32.962 --> 00:23:36.470
Subtract the two.
That is the delta G for your

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.134
chemical reaction.
Like delta H for the chemical

00:23:40.134 --> 00:23:44.577
reaction, which you calculated
from the differences in the

00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:48.163
heats of formation,
the products and reactants,

00:23:48.163 --> 00:23:51.438
note that this is products
minus reactants.

00:23:51.438 --> 00:23:55.258
This is different from when you
calculate delta H,

00:23:55.258 --> 00:23:59.000
for example,
from bond enthalpies.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.835
That was reactants minus
products.

00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:06.389
Something to remember.
But again, in the case of delta

00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:11.114
G, we can calculate it from
knowing the free energies of

00:24:11.114 --> 00:24:14.809
formation of the reactants and
the products.

00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:19.019
But we can also calculate it
from this expression.

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:22.799
If, for example,
you know the enthalpy change

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:28.040
for a reaction and you know the
entropy change for a reaction,

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.680
you can calculate the free
energy change from these two

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.436
quantities.
You have two choices to

00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:43.580
calculate the free energy change
of some chemical reaction,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:49.618
depending on what information
is known or is given to you.

00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:55.550
Now, I want to talk kind of
briefly about controlling the

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:00.000
spontaneity of a chemical
reaction.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.051
And, to do so,
I am going to talk about this

00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:07.537
molecule, which is sodium
bicarbonate.

00:25:07.537 --> 00:25:12.155
Sodium bicarbonate is better
known as baking soda.

00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:17.714
It is what you put into some
batter of soft baked goods that

00:25:17.714 --> 00:25:22.237
you want to make.
What happens is that the sodium

00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:27.513
bicarbonate decomposes and two
of the products are gases,

00:25:27.513 --> 00:25:32.888
CO two and water.
And so, in your batter,

00:25:32.888 --> 00:25:37.649
what you get are these bubbles
of CO two and water.

00:25:37.649 --> 00:25:42.328
And what happens is that the
dough starts to harden around

00:25:42.328 --> 00:25:45.119
these bubbles.
And then, of course,

00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:49.798
eventually, the CO2 and water
leave, are completely driven

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:54.888
off, but what that leaves behind
in the batter is a very porous

00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:59.977
structure, so porous that after
you remove it from the oven you

00:25:59.977 --> 00:26:04.000
can actually put your teeth into
it.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.969
Have you ever left out the
baking soda in some soft baked

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:12.163
goods?
You cannot get your teeth into

00:26:12.163 --> 00:26:15.180
it, right?
So, this is an important

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.020
reaction.
But this is a reaction,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.812
here, that is very endothermic.
It does increase in the

00:26:22.812 --> 00:26:27.426
entropy, but at room
temperature, this reaction has a

00:26:27.426 --> 00:26:33.110
positive delta G.
This reaction does not proceed.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.725
It is non-spontaneous in the
forward direction,

00:26:37.725 --> 00:26:41.939
as written.
And that is good because you do

00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:47.859
not want this reaction to start
when your batter is still on

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:53.076
your kitchen counter.
You want it to start when it is

00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:57.090
in the oven.
What happens as we raise the

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:02.792
temperature, here?
For the purposes of what we are

00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:07.207
going to do, we have the same
delta H and delta S.

00:27:07.207 --> 00:27:11.801
But now, when we calculate
delta G, the temperature,

00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:16.936
here, is going to be our baking
temperature of 350 degrees

00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:20.630
Fahrenheit.
And now, what you see is delta

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.504
G is negative,
minus 14 kilojoules per mole.

00:27:24.504 --> 00:27:27.747
All of a sudden,
this reaction became

00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:33.023
spontaneous.
And we made it spontaneous

00:27:33.023 --> 00:27:39.534
simply by increasing the
absolute magnitude of T delta S.

00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:44.767
We increased it by increasing
the temperature,

00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:49.186
in this case.
We made it spontaneous by

00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:54.186
raising the temperature.
For some reactions,

00:27:54.186 --> 00:27:59.186
we can do that.
We can find a temperature at

00:27:59.186 --> 00:28:05.000
which the reaction will be
spontaneous.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.403
Let's look at the particular
conditions.

00:28:09.403 --> 00:28:14.709
Delta G is a linear function of
the temperature,

00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:19.677
so let me draw that for this
particular case,

00:28:19.677 --> 00:28:24.193
for the sodium bicarbonate
decomposition.

00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:30.290
The slope of this line for this
reaction is, of course,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:35.617
minus delta S.
The intercept is delta H.

00:28:35.617 --> 00:28:39.490
And now, let me just draw a
zero here.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.563
What I want you to notice is
that there is some temperature

00:28:45.563 --> 00:28:49.646
that I am going to call 
T star.

00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:55.194
There is some temperature at
which the sign of delta G

00:28:55.194 --> 00:28:58.754
changes.
You see that below T star,

00:28:58.754 --> 00:29:04.099
delta G is positive.
Below those temperatures,

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:08.297
such as room temperature for
the sodium bicarbonate

00:29:08.297 --> 00:29:11.152
decomposition,
delta G is positive.

00:29:11.152 --> 00:29:14.007
We have a non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:29:14.007 --> 00:29:18.206
Above some temperature delta G
has become negative.

00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:23.244
We have a spontaneous reaction.
We can calculate the value of

00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.854
this T star, where the
spontaneity switches,

00:29:26.854 --> 00:29:31.389
by setting delta G nought
equal to zero

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:36.211
and then solving for T star.
Let's do that.

00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:41.232
I rearrange this to give me T
star is equal to delta H over

00:29:41.232 --> 00:29:43.483
delta S.
For this reaction,

00:29:43.483 --> 00:29:46.946
I know the values of delta H
and delta S.

00:29:46.946 --> 00:29:51.794
And for this reaction that
value of T star is 406 Kelvin.

00:29:51.794 --> 00:29:56.988
So, your oven has to be higher
in temperature than 406 Kelvin

00:29:56.988 --> 00:30:01.922
if you want to make some baked
goods that you can put your

00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:06.043
teeth into.
For some reaction,

00:30:06.043 --> 00:30:11.493
in this particular case here
that is endothermic,

00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:17.170
delta H greater than zero,
in which case we have an

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:22.620
increase in entropy,
that reaction is spontaneous

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:30.000
whenever the temperature is
above some temperature T star.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.240
But we also have reactions
which are exothermic,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:40.703
delta H less than zero,
and reactions in which the

00:30:40.703 --> 00:30:45.609
entropy decreases.
Delta S is less than zero.

00:30:45.609 --> 00:30:51.296
And I have plotted that line
here, delta G versus T.

00:30:51.296 --> 00:30:57.205
For the opposite condition,
we have the opposite slope

00:30:57.205 --> 00:31:02.000
because delta S has changed
sign.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.670
In this case,
the reaction will be

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.635
spontaneous whenever the
temperature is below some

00:31:08.635 --> 00:31:12.682
temperature T star.
And you can see that by looking

00:31:12.682 --> 00:31:15.919
at the relative signs in this
expression.

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:20.774
If delta H is less than zero up
here, then we have a negative

00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:24.901
quantity right here.
And, since delta S is less than

00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:30.000
zero, we have minus times a
minus, which is a plus.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.033
This term here is positive,
this term is negative,

00:31:35.033 --> 00:31:40.785
and so this positive term
better not be in absolute value

00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:44.277
very much larger than delta H
here.

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:49.824
If it is, then we are going to
have a positive delta G,

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:55.474
but if this term is small
compared to the absolute value

00:31:55.474 --> 00:32:01.432
of delta H, then we will have a
spontaneous reaction at low

00:32:01.432 --> 00:32:06.513
temperatures.
So, you want to keep this term

00:32:06.513 --> 00:32:09.445
small.
That is why it is spontaneous

00:32:09.445 --> 00:32:14.221
when T is less than T star.
But we can also have reactions

00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:18.662
that are exothermic and
reactions in which the entropy

00:32:18.662 --> 00:32:20.589
increases.
In this case,

00:32:20.589 --> 00:32:23.186
you have the best of all
worlds.

00:32:23.186 --> 00:32:26.872
In this case,
this reaction is spontaneous at

00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:30.056
all temperatures.
You cannot adjust the

00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:35.000
spontaneity of this reaction by
temperature.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.763
This is always going to be
negative.

00:32:37.763 --> 00:32:41.000
Delta H is negative here,
minus T delta S.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.394
This is going to be minus a
positive number.

00:32:44.394 --> 00:32:48.657
A negative minus a positive
number is always a negative

00:32:48.657 --> 00:32:52.210
number, always spontaneous.
And then, finally,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:57.026
we can have a condition where
we have an endothermic reaction,

00:32:57.026 --> 00:33:00.973
delta H is greater than zero,
and where the entropy

00:33:00.973 --> 00:33:05.000
decreases, delta S is less than
zero.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.607
In this case,
the reaction is never

00:33:07.607 --> 00:33:11.134
spontaneous, no matter what
temperature you do.

00:33:11.134 --> 00:33:14.354
You cannot adjust that
non-spontaneity with

00:33:14.354 --> 00:33:17.268
temperature.
Delta H, you can see that,

00:33:17.268 --> 00:33:21.408
is going to be positive.
And since delta S is negative,

00:33:21.408 --> 00:33:25.012
we have a minus times a minus,
that is positive,

00:33:25.012 --> 00:33:29.000
delta G is positive at all
temperatures.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.095
So we have failed to adjust the
spontaneity with temperature for

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:38.220
some reactions that are
endothermic and in which the

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.000
entropy decreases.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:56.730
What we have been talking about
are values of delta G that are

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:02.888
standard state.
We have been talking about

00:34:02.888 --> 00:34:06.444
delta G nought,
one bar pressure.

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:10.777
That is what we have been
talking about.

00:34:10.777 --> 00:34:17.222
What that means is that the
delta G nought for any reaction

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:23.111
means that we have one
atmosphere each of the products

00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:28.111
and the reactants.
That is what delta G nought

00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:32.482
means.
That our famous reaction here,

00:34:32.482 --> 00:34:35.544
argon-boron,
argon plus boron going to

00:34:35.544 --> 00:34:39.434
carbon plus deuterium.
Let's take this reaction.

00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:44.151
When I give you a delta G
nought for this famous reaction,

00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:48.951
what that means is that that is
the delta G nought when the

00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:52.675
partial pressure of the reactant
A is one bar,

00:34:52.675 --> 00:34:57.393
and the partial pressure of
reactant B, is one bar and the

00:34:57.393 --> 00:35:02.027
partial pressure of product C is
one bar, and the partial

00:35:02.027 --> 00:35:06.000
pressure of product D is one
bar.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.725
That does not seem real useful,
because say you were going to

00:35:11.725 --> 00:35:17.450
start a reaction and you just
start it even with one bar of A

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.839
and one bar of B,
this is not the delta G under

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:27.469
those particular conditions.
We have to be able to calculate

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:33.360
delta G under any conditions.
Not just our standard state

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.857
conditions.
And that is what we are going

00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:41.491
to do with this expression.
We are going to be able to

00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:45.775
calculate a delta G at any time
during a reaction.

00:35:45.775 --> 00:35:50.409
We can stop a reaction,
and we can measure the partial

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:54.868
pressures of the reactants and
the products present,

00:35:54.868 --> 00:35:59.677
and we can get from that,
then, a delta G for a reaction

00:35:59.677 --> 00:36:05.356
at that particular point.
That is what we are going to

00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:08.554
do, here.
What have I got written here?

00:36:08.554 --> 00:36:12.425
I have delta G is equal to this
delta G nought,

00:36:12.425 --> 00:36:16.801
the standard state delta G,
plus RT ln of the partial

00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:22.103
pressure of product C over some
reference pressure raised to the

00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:26.396
appropriate stoichiometric
number, times the partial

00:36:26.396 --> 00:36:31.108
pressure of the other reactant,
divided by some reference

00:36:31.108 --> 00:36:35.148
pressure raised to the
appropriate stoichiometric

00:36:35.148 --> 00:36:39.417
number.
And that is all over the

00:36:39.417 --> 00:36:44.958
product of the partial pressure
of A over that reference

00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:49.895
pressure, raised to the
appropriate stoichiometric

00:36:49.895 --> 00:36:53.623
number, times the same for
reactant B.

00:36:53.623 --> 00:36:58.055
What this ratio here of partial
pressures is,

00:36:58.055 --> 00:37:02.690
or what it is called,
is the reaction quotient,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.561
Q.
It is the ratio of the partial

00:37:06.561 --> 00:37:11.087
pressures present during any
time during the reaction.

00:37:11.087 --> 00:37:15.784
Not necessarily at equilibrium
-- at any time during the

00:37:15.784 --> 00:37:18.516
reaction.
That is what Q is here.

00:37:18.516 --> 00:37:21.932
And so in this way,
with this expression,

00:37:21.932 --> 00:37:26.629
we are going to be able to
calculate what delta G is for

00:37:26.629 --> 00:37:31.923
the reaction at any time outside
of this special standard state

00:37:31.923 --> 00:37:36.107
of one bar pressure for each one
of the reactants,

00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:42.000
one bar partial pressure for
each one of the products.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.338
Where this expression comes
from is, again,

00:37:46.338 --> 00:37:50.159
discussed in exquisite detail
in 5.60.

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:56.253
You will see where it comes
from later, but right now we are

00:37:56.253 --> 00:38:02.244
going to use it to calculate
delta G at any time during the

00:38:02.244 --> 00:38:06.272
reaction.
But now let me point out that

00:38:06.272 --> 00:38:09.721
our reference pressure right
here is one bar.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:13.796
What I am going to do is
substitute a one in here for

00:38:13.796 --> 00:38:18.106
each one of the reference
pressures, so that my reaction

00:38:18.106 --> 00:38:20.849
quotient is going to look like
this.

00:38:20.849 --> 00:38:25.630
And I did not put in the bars
because what you are going to do

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:31.423
is put in the pressures in bars.
And then, the reaction quotient

00:38:31.423 --> 00:38:35.018
will be just fine.
You have to use bar pressure

00:38:35.018 --> 00:38:37.989
here, since that is our standard
state.

00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:42.210
That is our reference pressure.
Now, keep this in mind.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.962
This is important.
We are going to use this again

00:38:45.962 --> 00:38:49.557
in just a moment.
Let's start talking about the

00:38:49.557 --> 00:38:53.309
equilibrium constant.
Here is our famous A plus B

00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:58.000
going to C plus D reaction.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.229
We already said if delta G,
for this reaction as written is

00:39:03.229 --> 00:39:07.827
negative, then that forward
reaction is spontaneous.

00:39:07.827 --> 00:39:13.147
If delta G for that reaction is
positive for the reaction as

00:39:13.147 --> 00:39:18.196
written, what that means is
then, the reverse reaction is

00:39:18.196 --> 00:39:21.622
spontaneous.
And now, very importantly,

00:39:21.622 --> 00:39:25.409
if delta G is zero,
then we are at chemical

00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:29.286
equilibrium.
Notice this is delta G equal to

00:39:29.286 --> 00:39:33.627
zero.
This is not delta G nought

00:39:33.627 --> 00:39:37.264
equal to zero.
A big difference here.

00:39:37.264 --> 00:39:43.125
This is delta G equal to zero.
Then, we are at equilibrium.

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:48.278
What I am going to do is I am
going to bring back my

00:39:48.278 --> 00:39:53.634
expression that allowed me to
calculate delta G at any

00:39:53.634 --> 00:40:00.000
arbitrary pressures of the
reactants and the products.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.375
And I just said that
equilibrium, here,

00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:07.017
is defined by delta G being
equal to zero,

00:40:07.017 --> 00:40:11.104
so I am going to plug in a zero
right in there.

00:40:11.104 --> 00:40:15.368
If that is the case,
then I am going to rearrange

00:40:15.368 --> 00:40:19.010
this equation.
I am going to bring delta G

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.629
over to the other side,
and that is what I do here on

00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:27.626
the next slide.
I have delta G nought is equal

00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:31.180
to minus RT ln of this reaction
quotient.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:37.275
Now, we have a special

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:41.620
condition here.
And that is when delta G is

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.965
equal to zero,
when we are at thermodynamic

00:40:45.965 --> 00:40:51.448
equilibrium this reaction
quotient has a special name.

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:56.103
That special name is the
equilibrium constant,

00:40:56.103 --> 00:40:59.517
K.
This reaction quotient is equal

00:40:59.517 --> 00:41:05.000
to the thermodynamic equilibrium
constant.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.131
And it is so only when delta G
is equal to zero.

00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:13.624
Not delta G nought equal to
zero.

00:41:13.624 --> 00:41:18.646
We get the equation,
delta G nought is equal to

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:23.449
minus RT ln of K.

00:41:23.449 --> 00:41:30.000
That is where this particular
expression comes from.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.734
So, the reaction quotient is
equal to K when we are at

00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:39.736
thermodynamic equilibrium.
Now what we are going to do is

00:41:39.736 --> 00:41:45.364
set up some equations here that
are going to allow us to quickly

00:41:45.364 --> 00:41:48.937
tell when our reaction is at
equilibrium.

00:41:48.937 --> 00:41:52.957
We are going to compare Q to K.
Let's do that.

00:41:52.957 --> 00:41:57.870
Here is that general expression
I had that allowed me to

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:02.337
calculate delta G at any
arbitrary pressures of the

00:42:02.337 --> 00:42:08.400
reactants and the products.
Here is the expression delta G

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.480
nought at equilibrium,
delta G nought equal minus RT

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.280
ln of K.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.599
What I am going to do is
substitute this delta G nought

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:22.800
into here right in there.
Let me do that.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.599
I am just going to plug it
right in.

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:29.039
So, I have minus RT ln of K
plus RT ln of Q.

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:34.659
Now I have the difference

00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:39.765
between two logs.
The difference between two logs

00:42:39.765 --> 00:42:45.829
is the log of the quotient of
those arguments of the logs.

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:50.404
So, delta G then is RT times ln
of Q over K.

00:42:50.404 --> 00:42:55.510
Remember what Q is?

00:42:55.510 --> 00:43:02.000
It is this ratio of
instantaneous partial pressures.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.275
If we have a reaction running
and we somehow measure the

00:43:08.275 --> 00:43:15.120
partial pressures at some time,
and we calculate the reaction

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.624
quotient from that and then we
find that Q is less than K,

00:43:21.624 --> 00:43:28.013
the equilibrium constant,
what that means is that we have

00:43:28.013 --> 00:43:34.630
fewer products present than
equilibrium says we should have

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.702
--
-- because Q is less than K.

00:43:38.702 --> 00:43:43.625
If that is the case,
then what is going to happen is

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:49.513
that the reaction is going to
proceed in the forward direction

00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:55.401
in order to make more products,
so that Q can get to the point

00:43:55.401 --> 00:44:01.000
of being equal to K.
You can also see that up here.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.055
When Q is less than K,
we had the log of a number that

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:11.588
is going to be less than one.
The log of a number less than

00:44:11.588 --> 00:44:15.976
one is a negative number.
When Q is equal to K,

00:44:15.976 --> 00:44:19.792
delta G is going to be
negative, meaning,

00:44:19.792 --> 00:44:24.753
the reaction as written is
spontaneous in the forward

00:44:24.753 --> 00:44:28.378
direction.
That is what our equilibrium

00:44:28.378 --> 00:44:32.649
says.
It wants to make more products.

00:44:32.649 --> 00:44:36.581
On the other hand,
if we have Q greater than K,

00:44:36.581 --> 00:44:40.940
that says we have too many
products compared to what

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.957
equilibrium says we should have.
And, of course,

00:44:44.957 --> 00:44:49.914
then the reaction is going to
run in the reverse direction.

00:44:49.914 --> 00:44:54.700
It is going to try to use up
those products and make more

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.948
reactant.
You can also see that by this

00:44:57.948 --> 00:45:02.240
expression.
When Q is greater than K,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:07.887
we are going to have a log of a
number that is greater than one,

00:45:07.887 --> 00:45:13.086
that is going to be positive.
If delta G is positive in the

00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:17.120
forward direction for the
reaction as written,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.767
then it is the reverse reaction
that is going to be spontaneous.

00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:26.263
Another way to look at it is
shown here.

00:45:26.263 --> 00:45:32.000
Suppose we are in a situation
where Q is less than K.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.606
I am plotting here Q as a
function of the time in the

00:45:37.606 --> 00:45:44.183
reaction, and I am starting out
here at T equals zero and Q is

00:45:44.183 --> 00:45:47.633
less than K.
If Q is less than K,

00:45:47.633 --> 00:45:53.778
it means that we have fewer
products than what equilibrium

00:45:53.778 --> 00:45:58.954
tells us we should have.
The reaction is going to

00:45:58.954 --> 00:46:04.021
proceed in the forward
direction, so that Q will

00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:09.196
increase to the value of K,
so that we can attain

00:46:09.196 --> 00:46:13.723
equilibrium.
On the other hand,

00:46:13.723 --> 00:46:18.319
if we have a situation where we
start a reaction,

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:21.861
but Q is greater than K,
in that case,

00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:26.936
we started the reaction by
putting all the products in

00:46:26.936 --> 00:46:32.355
instead of the reactants.
When Q is greater than K,

00:46:32.355 --> 00:46:38.007
it says we have more products
than equilibrium says we should

00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:41.398
have.
What is going to happen is that

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:45.166
the reverse reaction is going to
proceed.

00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:49.217
It is going to try to use up
those products,

00:46:49.217 --> 00:46:54.115
so that we attain this ratio
given by the equilibrium

00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:58.934
constant.
That is how we are going to use

00:46:58.934 --> 00:47:04.141
Q, compare it to K to determine
whether or not we are at

00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:08.969
chemical equilibrium.
Professor Cummins will be here

00:47:08.969 --> 00:47:12.755
on Wednesday.
I will see you later in the

00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:13.755
week.
