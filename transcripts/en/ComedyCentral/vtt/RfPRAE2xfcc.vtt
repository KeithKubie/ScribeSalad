00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.036
And they're hungry.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.771
What else is new?

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.107
Sure, they're not
little kids anymore,

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.109
but they still want
a snack that's fun.

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.612
That's why they're not getting
regular old chicken fingers.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.046
They're getting--

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.215
(all)
Finger blasted!

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.385
(announcer)
Introducing Finger Blasters!

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.355
Blast your fingers into
our unique sauce containers,

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.589
filled with honey,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.192
tangy barbecue,
or salt and vinegar.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.160
Finger blasting is the best.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.563
Finger blasting
is the perfect thing

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.632
to hold them over until
they're ready to move onto

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.567
something more serious,
like dinner.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.701
(announcer)
Try one finger at a time.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.069
Yum!

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.304
(announcer)
Two fingers.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.572
Mmm, okay!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.207
(announcer)
And then,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.476
if everybody's cool with it,
work up to three!

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.178
No, two is good.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.279
For now.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.047
I'll take
what I can get.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.783
(announcer)
Finger blasting
is fun with friends.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.585
But if my friends
aren't around,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.520
I'll just finger blast myself!

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.721
"Noice"!

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.523
(announcer)
Don't be a food prude!

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.960
Surprise the crew by dipping
into two sauces at once.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.361
Whoa.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.529
That's a shocker.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.597
Let's be real.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:04.932
They're teens.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.567
They're gonna be snacking.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.602
I feel safe knowing
it's under my roof

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.405
rather than behind some
movie theater or in the woods.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.673
So get a general sense

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.641
of what your kids are putting
in their bodies

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.176
and help them--

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:19.179
(all)
Get finger blasted!

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.480
(announcer)
Finger Blasters,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.549
from the makers of Circle Jerky.
