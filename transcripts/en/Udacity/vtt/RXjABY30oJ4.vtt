00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's introduce one more feature into our list comprehensions.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Remember ta_data and ta_facts.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When we ran this, we got a list of strings

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which each contained a fact about a TA.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Like: Job lives in the USA,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and is the TA for CS387.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, what if we only want facts about TAs that don't live in the USA?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, in this case that would be Gundega and Sarah.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, since these TAs are working remotely,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
let's call it remote<u>ta</u>facts,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and all we have to do is add a simple "if" statement.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And now when we run this, we only get these two strings

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
about Sarah and Gundega.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The addition we made was pretty intuitive.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This "if" statement just says: "If the country is not the USA,"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
then we're going to add an entry

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
according to the rules we described earlier.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I hope you learned a lot about list comprehensions.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but now it's time to practice.
