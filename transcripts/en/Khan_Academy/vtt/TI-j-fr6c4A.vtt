00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.672
- [Voiceover] So we've got the function

00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:02.721
f of x is equal to two x to the third plus

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.554
five x squared minus seven.

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:05.875
All of that to the eighth power.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.277
And we want to find the derivative of our

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:10.609
function f with respect to x.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.527
Now the key here is to
realize that this function

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:16.285
can be viewed as a
composition of two functions.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:17.587
How do we do that?

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:19.077
Well let me diagram it out.

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:21.662
So let's say we want to start with,

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:23.830
and I'll do it down here
so we have some space.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.641
So we're gonna start with an x and

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:27.469
what's the first thing that we would do?

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.491
If you were just trying to
evaluate it given some x?

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.480
Well, the first thing
you would take two times

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.590
that x to the third power
plus five times that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.899
x squared and then minus seven.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.149
So, what if we imagined a function here

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:41.859
that just did that first part.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.639
That just evaluated two x to the third

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.749
plus five x squared
minus seven for your x.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.770
So let's call that the function u.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.571
So whatever you input
into that function u,

00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:54.701
you're gonna get two times that input

00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:57.800
to the third power, plus
five times that input

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.550
to the second power, minus seven.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.230
And so when you do that,
when you input with an x,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.759
what do you output?

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.180
What do you output here?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
Well, you're going to output u of x,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.189
which is equal to two
x to the third power,

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.921
plus five x squared minus seven.

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.600
And I'll do it all in one color just so

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.120
I don't have to keep changing colors.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.129
So two x to the third power, plus

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:26.099
five x squared, minus seven.

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.599
That is u of x.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.099
Now what's the next thing you're gonna do?

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.299
You're not done evaluating f of x yet.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969
You would then take that value and then

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.329
input into another function.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.239
You would then take the
eight power of that value.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.910
So then, we will take that and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.319
input it into another function.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.841
Let's call that function v.

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:45.599
And that function,
whatever input you give it,

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.140
and I'm using these squares just to say

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.954
whatever input goes into that function.

00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:50.969
You're going to take
it to the eighth power.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.700
And so in this case, what do you get?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.289
What do you end up with?

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.122
Well, you end up with v of u of x.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.701
V of u of x.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.450
Or you could view this as
v of two x to the third,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
plus five x squared, minus seven.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.240
Or, you could view this
as two x to the third,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.720
plus five x squared, minus seven.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.069
All of that to the eighth power.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.630
All of that to the eighth power
and that's what f of x is.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.590
So as we just saw, f of x can be viewed

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.090
as the composition of v and u.

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:33.398
This is f of x.

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:37.037
So, if we write f of x.

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:39.277
If we write f of x

00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:41.527
being equal to v of u of x,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.969
then we see very clearly the
chain rule is very useful here.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.771
The chain rule tells us that f prime of x

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.938
is going to be the derivative
of v, with respect to u.

00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:02.712
So it's going to be v prime of, not x,

00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:04.158
but v prime of u of x.

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:07.537
The derivative of v, with respect to u,

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:11.617
times the derivative of
u, with respect to x.

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:13.637
So u prime of x.

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:16.304
So we know a few things already.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.347
So let's, let me just write
things down very clearly.

00:03:20.347 --> 00:03:23.708
So we know that u of x is equal
to two x to the third power,

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:26.908
plus five x squared, minus seven.

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:28.947
What is u prime of x?

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:30.797
Here we're just going
to use some derivative

00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:32.407
properties and the power rule.

00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:34.138
Three times two is six x.

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:37.108
Three minus one is two, six x squared.

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:38.858
Two times five is 10.

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:42.018
Take one off that exponent, it's gonna be

00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:44.087
10 x to the first power, or just 10 x.

00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:46.158
And the derivative of a
constant is just zero,

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:47.737
so we can just ignore that.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:49.597
So that's u prime of x.

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:53.868
Now, we know that v, if
we inputted an x into v,

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:58.438
so v of x would be equal
to x to the eighth power.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:01.778
V prime of x, well we just
use the power rule again.

00:04:01.778 --> 00:04:04.627
That's eight x to the seventh power.

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:06.710
And so v prime of u of x,

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:10.917
so if you were to input
u of x into v prime,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.627
well it's going to be equal to

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:17.210
eight times u of x to the seventh power.

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:22.984
Whatever you input into v prime,

00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:24.774
you're gonna take it to the seventh power

00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:26.614
and multiply it by eight.

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:29.864
So u of x and that's the same thing.

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:33.331
That is the same thing.

00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:37.451
This is equal to eight times
this entire expression.

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.868
U of x is two x to the third power,

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:45.343
plus five x squared, minus seven.

00:04:45.343 --> 00:04:46.992
So there you have it.

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.075
F prime of x.

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:50.951
It is equal to this,

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:54.152
which we just figured
out v prime of u of x is

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:55.822
all of this business.

00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:59.989
So it's equal to eight,
times two x to the third,

00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:04.114
plus five x squared, minus seven.

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:06.174
All of that to the seventh power,

00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:08.174
times u prime of x.

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.484
U prime of x, we figured out is that.

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:12.651
So times six x squared, plus ten x.

00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:17.502
Now, as you get more
practice with the chain rule,

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:19.711
you'll recognize this faster

00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:21.583
and actually you won't have
to right all of this down,

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:22.951
you'll be able to do a
lot of it in your head.

00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:24.871
You'll say, okay, I'm
gonna take the derivative

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:27.110
of the outside function, the
blue function you could say,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.200
with respect to what I have in the inside.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.391
So, if I was taking the
derivative of x to the eighth,

00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:33.811
it would be eight x to the seventh.

00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:35.431
That's with respect to x.

00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.111
But if I'm taking the derivative of this,

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.971
with respect to the inside, well, where I

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.821
had the x's before, I would
just have this u of x.

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:44.631
So it's gonna be eight times
this to the seventh power.

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:47.780
And I multiply that times
the derivative of the inside.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.780
Which is six x squared plus 10 x.
