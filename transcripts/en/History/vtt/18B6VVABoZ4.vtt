00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.670
COREY: What can I help you with?

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.620
Well, I found this, and I'm
hoping it's worth some money.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.210
That's pretty cool.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.330
This is from the Civil War.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.880
It is interesting.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.290
I mean, at one point, there
was people in the Senate

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.670
and Congress and
stuff that wanted

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.380
50% of all males
living in the South

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.210
to write a written
apology for the war.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.540
Really?

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.080
Could you imagine what
the world would have

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.210
been like if they did that.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.500
[laughing]

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.500
I have a Southern Orphan
Association Certificate.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.540
I found it in my
parents' attic in a box

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.670
of all old papers and photos.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.540
I think it was, like, from
my great-grandparents.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.830
I'm hoping the certificate
is worth, like, maybe $500.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.040
What are you
looking to do with it?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.920
- Well, sell it.
- Sell it?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.420
OK.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.250
Any idea what you're
wanting to get out of it?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.710
I'm hoping, like, around $500.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.920
Um-- it very well could be
worth $500, I have no idea.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.540
I don't even know
if it's real, so.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.120
SHIRLEY: Right.
I understand.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.120
When it comes to Southern
money, Southern stuff

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.040
like this, it's forged a lot.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.620
Oh, really?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.750
I've got a buddy who is
really, really good with paper

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.460
money stuff like this.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
Do you mind if I have him come
down and take a look at it?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.960
No, that would be great.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.380
All right, I'll be right back.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.620
Feel free to take a
look around the store,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620
and I'll grab you
when he gets here.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.120
OK.
Thanks.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.290
They said they were going
to call in an expert.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.120
I'm thinking it
might be counterfeit,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.750
so I'm kind of nervous.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.120
It's pretty cool, but a lot of
Confederate stuff can be fake.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120
So I called up Peter to
come down and check it out.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.040
So Southern Orphan
Association Certificate.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.580
Well, this is pretty cool.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
This is General
Stonewall Jackson,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.620
and he's featured on here.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.000
And this is post-Civil War.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.290
This was during the
Reconstruction period.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.790
I didn't notice that
was Stonewall Jackson.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.620
- That is.
- That dude was gnarly.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.170
Yeah, he was an intense man.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.830
He was, essentially, General
Lee's right-hand man.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.790
He passed away from pneumonia.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.460
And many believe that
if he didn't pass,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.500
that the war would have
drastically changed.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.170
Yeah.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920
General Lee, for all intents
and purposes, was a good guy.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.830
Now, to have the
main guy like that,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.460
that guy has got to have the
guy that does the dirty work.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.670
And the guy that did the dirty
work was Stonewall Jackson.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.830
This guy would go into
a town in West Virginia

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.000
and he would burn
the whole thing down.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.960
Kind of ironic that he would
be on this, since he's the one

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.620
who burned everything down.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.120
Well, he burned stuff down
in the North, not the South.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.040
Yeah, in the South
he was the man.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.710
This is a pretty significant
time in our history, where

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.710
the country,
specifically the South,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.460
came together, rebounded,
and created opportunity

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.960
for the children and
the widows of lives

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.170
lost during the Civil War.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.040
I'm assuming it
was like welfare

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.460
or food stamps for Southern
orphans and widows.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.460
Well, kind of, sort of.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.040
During the Civil War, about
a quarter million soldiers

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.960
lost their lives in the South.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.380
So this particular
association was actually

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.830
designed to fund orphans
who didn't have food

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.540
or needed to survive somehow.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.460
This isn't a
payable certificate.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.540
This, in my opinion, is believed
to be a donation receipt.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.880
So it is not currency.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.040
PETER: It is not currency.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040
OK.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.710
I assumed it was currency.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.670
I assumed it was issued by
the United States government.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.540
But essentially, it's a receipt
saying that you donated $1.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.080
Correct.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080
There's not a lot of information
on this, surprisingly.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.580
But that's the consensus of
the experts in the field.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.080
OK, so obviously
this isn't fake.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.420
It is genuine.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.670
There's really no reason
to replicate this.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.000
COREY: So what do you
think it might be worth?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.420
This is exceptional
in quality.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.830
It's the nicest I've seen.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.920
They're not rare,
but they're cool.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.670
They have a lot of history.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.540
I would put a retail
number of $175.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.880
OK.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.960
I appreciate it, my man.
- Anytime, buddy.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.790
I'll see you soon.
Good luck.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.250
Thank you.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.790
While the certificate
isn't rare, it is cool.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.540
It would be a
definitely good buy,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.620
'cause it would cater to pretty
much anyone that is a Civil War

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.880
relic collector, or just
the general public which

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.080
find United States
history fascinating.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.120
It's not worth what I
had hoped it would be.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.380
Yeah, and it's not as cool
as I hoped it would be either.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.120
I'd give you about
75 bucks for it.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.920
Really?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.120
COREY: Yeah.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.380
How about $125?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.960
You'd make $50.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.920
I'll give you 100 bucks.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.120
OK.
Done.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.080
It's a deal?
SHIRLEY: Deal.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.250
All right.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.460
Meet me right over there.
- OK.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.290
Thank you.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.330
Knowing what the retail price
was, I think the $100 was fair.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.500
This certificate was
to help children,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.960
and I'm going to
use the $100 I made

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.960
to help my own grandchildren.
