that<00:05:33.620><c> they</c><00:05:33.680><c> use</c><00:05:33.830><c> a</c><00:05:33.860><c> lot</c><00:05:34.220><c> throughout</c><00:05:34.550><c> the</c><00:05:34.669><c> film</c>

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 align:start position:0%
that they use a lot throughout the film
 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
that they use a lot throughout the film
but<00:05:35.210><c> it</c><00:05:35.270><c> just</c><00:05:35.810><c> goes</c><00:05:35.990><c> on</c><00:05:36.139><c> a</c><00:05:36.289><c> really</c><00:05:36.680><c> long</c><00:05:36.889><c> time</c>

but it just goes on a really long time
 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.770 align:start position:0%
but it just goes on a really long time
there's<00:05:37.639><c> a</c><00:05:37.729><c> couple</c><00:05:37.940><c> scenes</c><00:05:38.270><c> that</c><00:05:38.479><c> it's</c><00:05:38.630><c> just</c>

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 align:start position:0%
there's a couple scenes that it's just
 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.710 align:start position:0%
there's a couple scenes that it's just
like<00:05:38.900><c> okay</c><00:05:39.289><c> yes</c><00:05:40.160><c> we</c><00:05:40.580><c> get</c><00:05:41.479><c> it</c>

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
like okay yes we get it
 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
like okay yes we get it
so<00:05:42.110><c> then</c><00:05:42.319><c> the</c><00:05:42.530><c> t-rex</c><00:05:42.919><c> is</c><00:05:43.130><c> chasing</c><00:05:43.400><c> them</c><00:05:43.699><c> all</c>

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 align:start position:0%
so then the t-rex is chasing them all
 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.610 align:start position:0%
so then the t-rex is chasing them all
because<00:05:44.120><c> basically</c><00:05:44.810><c> the</c><00:05:44.930><c> entire</c><00:05:45.169><c> film</c><00:05:45.470><c> was</c>

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 align:start position:0%
because basically the entire film was
 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
because basically the entire film was
just<00:05:45.800><c> t-rexes</c><00:05:46.400><c> and</c><00:05:46.580><c> Raptors</c><00:05:47.000><c> chasing</c><00:05:47.479><c> humans</c>

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
just t-rexes and Raptors chasing humans
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.650 align:start position:0%
just t-rexes and Raptors chasing humans
and<00:05:48.289><c> it's</c><00:05:48.470><c> turned</c><00:05:48.910><c> away</c><00:05:49.910><c> from</c><00:05:50.180><c> like</c><00:05:50.569><c> this</c>

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 align:start position:0%
and it's turned away from like this
 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.860 align:start position:0%
and it's turned away from like this
really<00:05:50.960><c> cool</c><00:05:51.259><c> like</c><00:05:51.620><c> sciency</c><00:05:52.550><c> feeling</c><00:05:53.060><c> movie</c>
