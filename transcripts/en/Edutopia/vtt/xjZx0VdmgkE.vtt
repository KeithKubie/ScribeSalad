00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:04.826
&gt;&gt;Roberta: Every student walks through
the door wanting to feel valued.

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.296
Every child deserves to
have at least one adult

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:09.986
in this building who knows them by name.

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.756
We want a hundred percent of our
students to feel connected to a teacher

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.296
in our building and that's our goal.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.126
It was just a matter of
how do we measure this?

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:23.826
Early in the year, we conduct a
teacher-student-connection poster

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:28.556
activity so that we can determine
which students we've connected with

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:29.976
and which students we need to
work toward connecting with.

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:32.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Delaney is
allergic to red food dye.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:32.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And she also has
a pond that she swims in.

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:37.046
[ Laughter ]

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.266
&gt;&gt;Roberta: We take their whole roster
of students, we put it up on a wall,

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.946
and we ask teachers to go
through by name and face, "Yep,

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:43.966
I know this one, this one, this one."

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:45.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Know them all?

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:47.076
&gt;&gt;Chris: All by name and face.

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:51.016
I think that was a team goal
by the end of the second week.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:51.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What?!

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:52.156
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:52.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: End of week two?

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:57.276
&gt;&gt;Chris: The activity was based around
how well do you know your students,

00:00:57.526 --> 00:00:59.886
just through the simple, you
know, adding a check mark next

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:02.366
to the kid's name that you
know them by name and face,

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:05.166
and then the other categories,
academic status,

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:08.296
and then the more in-depth
personal story about them.

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.026
&gt;&gt;Chris: She's one that
slips under the radar though.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.976
She is pretty quiet.

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:13.426
&gt;&gt;Chris: You look at a lot
of kids and you go, "Hey,

00:01:13.756 --> 00:01:15.706
this student has one check mark.

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.626
I know them by name and face,
but other than that I don't know

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.026
where they're at academically.

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:22.316
I don't know anything
about their personal life."

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:26.316
It's probably harder for them to
feel valued in a learning environment

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.686
without that connection to the teacher.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:32.676
So, to me, that's what this was
all about, a reflective process.

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:36.976
How well are we getting
to know our kids?

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And, so, you don't
get to know those students.

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:39.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The stones in the river.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:40.516
That's what I like to call them.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:40.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Right.

00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:42.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: They're just letting
the water wash over them.

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.096
We've got to go pick up
that stone, turn it over.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.286
&gt;&gt;Roberta: We want them to reflect

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.266
and then it's time to
develop an action plan.

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:52.506
What are we going to do to make sure
that these students are taken care of?

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:54.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have personal
conversations with our students

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:55.926
in the hallways during passing time.

00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:59.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We also do things
like "Thumbs Up Thursdays"

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:01.556
or "Feel Good Fridays" and
we just take a few seconds

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.826
to have kids share things
that they're proud of.

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:06.786
&gt;&gt;Chris: To get to know the kids a
little bit better on a personal level,

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:09.256
just asking them a simple
question as they come in the door.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.336
Example, last week I started off

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:14.466
by just asking kids what their
favorite food or fruit was.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.206
And then those questions can get
deeper to try and get, you know,

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:18.746
a little more personal with them.

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:20.496
&gt;&gt;Chris: Winter.

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:20.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Winter.

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:21.796
&gt;&gt;Chris: Winter?

00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:22.426
&gt;&gt;Student: Summer.

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:24.196
&gt;&gt;Chris: What is it?

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:24.666
Summer?

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:24.733
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:24.866
&gt;&gt;Chris: Nice.

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:24.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Fall.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.666
&gt;&gt;Chris: The students here should be
seen as people and not just pupils.

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:32.136
The more valued they are for their
individuality the more successful

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:33.316
they're going to be in the classroom,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.206
the more risks they're
going to be willing to take.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:36.366
And that's awesome.

00:02:36.706 --> 00:02:41.386
&gt;&gt;Roberta: We have seen a huge increase
in our students' connection to school,

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:43.256
with their connection to the teachers,

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.676
and I think that's probably the most
joy teachers have in their profession.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:49.856
Then the real work can begin.
