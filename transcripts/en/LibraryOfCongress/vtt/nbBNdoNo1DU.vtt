00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.810
Have you guys heard
of Israel before?

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.120
Have you been there?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.340
She has traveled to us here, and
Israel is in the Middle East.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.870
She's come a long way.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.560
And she will actually
tell you where that is,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.180
and Alona Frankel has also
designed and illustrated a lot

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.070
of books for other authors.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.450

then you can take it home.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.340
It's so nice to see you.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.780
You look for me from
here like flowers

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.230
and blooming and so beautiful.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.590
So my name is Alona Frankel, and I
came from far, far away to tell you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.480
about one of the books I
have written and illustrated.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.030
If it seems to you
strange the way I speak,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.110 position:56%
is because English is not the
language of my country, and I may --

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.840
I can do some mistakes,
and I will be very happy

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.110
if you would tell you about it.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.110 position:56%
So I want to tell you that books,
they do not grow on trees, you know,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.970
like apples or other fruits.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:56.600
People the books, and the first
person that is responsible

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.470
for a book to be is the one
that wrote it, and I write books

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.010
for children, and the second one
is the one that illustrate it.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.570
The illustrator.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.450
I also illustrate books
for children.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.230
One of my book is a book
about the moon and the stars.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.200
And it's about a little girl.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.860
Her name is Prudence, and her
best friend is a little dwarf

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.160
like this one.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.020
You will see him all over the
book and this dwarf is my dwarf.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.570
I like him very, very much,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.260
and his name is Krasnoludek
[assumed spelling].

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.560
Can you say it?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.870
It's difficult to say.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.920
Try it. Kras-snow Lu-dick, and I
carried him always in my purse,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.910
and when I feel uncomfortable or
something, so I just put my hand

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.020
in my person, and I feel
him, and I feel better.

favorite toy that you like to touch

what toy is his favorite?

Oh, they fall over.

I put him here just
-- he's nice, huh?

I like it very much.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.110
So now I want to try to read this
book for you, and you can look

up here, and you will
see the illustrations.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.840
So first of all, I want to explain
why the name is moon and stars.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.150
Because sometimes when I was a
little girl, and I wanted something

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.020
from my parents, so they
say, "No, we can't get you

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.500 position:56%
because we do not have enough money
now, and the next thing you may wish

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.530
to have is the moon and the stars."

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.510

So The Moon and The Stars

you have a book that your parents

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.380
or kindergarten teacher or
whoever reads for you, a book,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.910
so it's very important to
mention who wrote the book

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:34.540 position:56%
and who illustrate the book, because
to make a book it takes many people.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.020
Like first I told you the one that
is writing the book and the one

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.570
that illustrating the
book, and later,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.670
the one who is printing the book,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.350
and the person that's
selling the book in the store.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:56.650
But when I write, I am the
first one to create the book

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.600
for children, and I
like it very much.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.660

inside me, being a very,

I can still feel this
little girl that I was once.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:20.670
So when I see children,
somehow, I can understand them

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.860
and maybe this is the reason
that children like my books.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.370
So I start to read it, and excuse
me again that I make English,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.350

was not too runny, and poured a mug

most delicious breakfast ever,

something was missing.

"What more could you want,
the moon and the stars?"

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.160

as you know, it's impossible

to get the moon and stars.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.890
They are very high in the sky.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.190
It's impossible.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.650
I said, it's impossible
to buy moon and stars.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:55.300
Okay, in a bad mood and grumpy,
Prudence went to kindergarten.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:02.520
At kindergarten, Miss Zelda let
Prudence feed of the bunnies.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.850
She was the kindergarten teacher.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.620
You see the little dwarf again?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.170
Where he's hiding?

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.250
In her pocket?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.940 position:56%
This is the one, when I brought you.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.430 position:56%
Miss Zelda made her queen for a day.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.910
Miss Zelda asked Prudence
to show her how

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:30.090
to do a 100-piece jigsaw puzzle.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.810 position:56%
It was the greatest day in
kindergarten ever, but Prudence felt

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.240
like something was missing.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.750
"What more could you want?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.250
The moon and the stars?"

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.250
asked Miss Zelda.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.850
Is it possible to get
moon and stars?

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.410
Is it possible?

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.230
You can get moon and stars?

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.830
It is impossible, believe me.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.930
In a bad mood, grumpy, and
sad, Prudence went home.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:11.080
At home, Grandma Scarlet
had made lunch.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.850
Alphabet noodle soup.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.720
You know alphabet noodle soup?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.180
Salad without onions or pepper
and nonggreasy breaded cutlets,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:28.360
mashed potatoes lumps, and
three flavors of Jello,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.500
and you see the little dwarf
also, leaning on the -- to see it?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.350
Do you see him, Krasnoludek,
leaning there?

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.950
You see? I will put him here.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.600
He will be comfortable.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.390
You can see both of
us at the same time.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.650
And then it was the most
scrumptious lunch ever.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.960
Prudence ate it all up
and said, "Thank you."

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.220
But she felt like something
was missing.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.270
"What more could you want,
the moon and the stars?"

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.070
asked Grandma Scarlet.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.380
In a bad mood, grumpy, sad, and
upset, Prudence went to play

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.860
with her friend, Charles.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.270
Charles showed her his room.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.390
Charles showed her his
most secret drawer.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.470 position:56%
Do you see little Krasnoludek there?

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.020
Do you notice him?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.560
You can see him?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:43.200 position:56%
Yes? Ari, can you show it, the
little Krasnoludek is sitting there.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.630
Okay, and later on Charles
played jet rocket with her.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.150
You see the little
Krasnoludek there?

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.760
You see him riding in the car?

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.240
Playing with Charles was the most
exciting ever, but Prudence felt

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.830
like something was missing.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.500
"What more could you want?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.020
The moon and the stars?"

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.210
asked Charles.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.420
Do you see the little
dwarf, Karsnoludek,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.450 position:56%
sitting on the back of the cat, huh?

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:27.500
Grandpa Emerson Walden let
her ride back in Bronco.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:36.750
Grandpa Emerson Walden told
her stories of the old days.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.870
This was usually what
grandparents tell grandchildren.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.590
Being with Grandpa Emerson
Walden was the most fun ever,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.900
but Prudence felt like
something was missing.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.110
"What more could you want?

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.100
The moon and the stars?"

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.450
asked Grandpa Emerson Walden.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:04.480
In a bad mood, grumpy, sad,
upset, gloomy, and blue,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.310
Prudence went to her room.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.790
In her room, Prudence imagine
seeing [inaudible] Prudence

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.760
like was the Peter Pan.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.200
Do you see the little dwarf?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.170
You can only see his head.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.580
In her room, Prudence
was Captain Hook.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.310
You know who is Captain Hook?

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:35.510
You know about Peter Pan and
Captain Hook, and this story?

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:41.580
And the room, Prudence
built a tower up to the sky.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:50.360
The games in her room were the most
wonderful ever, but Prudence felt

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.540
like something was missing.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:02.920
Then knock-knock, knock-knock,
knock-knock, somebody knocked

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:10.310
on her door, and in
walked Prudence mother.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:17.640
Prudence mother saw Prudence in bad
mood, grumpy, sad, upset, gloomy,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.860
blue, and down the dumps.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.620
The worst thing in the world is for
a little girl to be down the dumps,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:36.540
blue, gloomy, upset, sad,
grumpy, and in bad mood.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.590
"You had better come
here right this minute!"

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:46.470
said Prudence mother,
gathering Prudence in her arms

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.780
and hugging her very tightly.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.110
Now I must hug somebody.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.470
I must hug -- you want
to come to me?

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.560
You, hey, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.330
You want to come here?

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.940
You want to come here?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.880
Want to? Who want to
come to me to be hugged?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.980
Okay, come on, come
on, quickly, quickly.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.370
Run up. Run up.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.700
Quickly, quickly.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.000
Come over, come over.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.390
Please, please, please.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.810
Please, please, please.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.870
Hi, what's your name?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.170
&gt;&gt; Olivia.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.480
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Oh, Olivia.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.150
I know a book about Olivia.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.450
Can I hug you?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.040 position:56%
Okay. You had better come here right
this minute, said Prudence mother,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:43.040
gather Prudence in her arms
and hugging very tightly.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.230
It was the not the moon.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.560
It was not the stars.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.780
It was the fullest moon
and the starriest sky ever,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.780
because the best thing that
can happen to somebody is

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:07.750
that you love somebody
and is hug, isn't it?

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.940
When someone's hugging you, and
I am a grandmother that like

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.700
to hug her grandchildren,
and when I see a child,

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.380
I always have this feeling
that I want to hug you.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.480
So this is the story,
and here, also,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.590
you can see this little
-- isn't he wonderful?

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.050
Isn't he? The little Krasnoludek.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.890
Can you say Krasnoludek?

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.190
&gt;&gt; Krasnoludek.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.490
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Fantastic!

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.690
Wow! Beautiful.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.140
So in no time, you can learn
Polish, which is not necessary.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.370
Oh, it's so nice.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.150
You can go to your place.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:50.000
Okay, this is this
book about children

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.190
that sometimes they feel bad
and they do not really want,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:21:00.730
they do not really know what
they want, but for sure,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.030
they always want to be hugged.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.770
Isn't it? And it's a cat here,

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.110
and you see the little
dwarf here and the cat.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:14.130
Who has a cat at home?

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.500
Yeah? You have a cat?

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.820
&gt;&gt; I don't.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.120
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: No?

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.420
&gt;&gt; A dog.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.720
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: A dog.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.020
Ah, yeah.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.320
&gt;&gt; His name Jordon.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.620
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: I see.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.980
I see. So this is this
book I wrote about a girl

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.720
that felt bad, and this is me.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.350
This is my picture.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.340
It's like five or 10 years ago.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.490
I looked much younger,
but never mind.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.260
You still can recognize me.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.270
Okay, so now [inaudible].

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.200
So now [inaudible].

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.130
Okay, so now I tell you
this story, and I told you

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.530
that the books do not grow
on trees, and I told you

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:14.570
that every book you see in the
world, many people created,

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:21.530 position:56%
and I told you that the first one
that is responsible for a book to be

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.910
in the world is the
person that write the book,

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.170
and the second one is the person

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.300
that make the illustration
in the book.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.980
And then the ones that make the
paper to print and the printer,

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.700
and the one that makes the cover.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.660
And then the librarian
who invites you

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.820
to this amazing, beautiful library.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.060
It's your first time here?

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.900
You have never been here?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.920
&gt;&gt; No, I've been here
with my nanny before.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.470
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Wonderful, so
many, many people try very much

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:08.370
to create books for
children, and now I am sure

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.430
that most of you like books.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.730
You like best?

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.030
Yes?

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.440
&gt;&gt; I have books in my room.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.110
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: You
have books at your room?

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.070
Do you remember one that you can
mention that you have in your room?

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:26.150
&gt;&gt; I have -- I have
the Olivia fairy book.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.700
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: That you like?

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.450
&gt;&gt; From the bookstore.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.750
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: I see.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.920
I see, and do you come
to the library often?

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:42.060
You're such a nice girl.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.560
Olivia, Olivia, it's
a book about Olivia?

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.240
You know the book?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.910
&gt;&gt; I have one in my room.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.710
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Oh, really?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:55.960
Olivia. That's fine, okay,
Olivia, now you can run and sit

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.550
in your place, and maybe
-- thank you for coming.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.510
Thank you very much.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:11.100
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.400
You can shake hands.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.700
Thank you very much.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.000
And I want you to remember my name.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.300
It's Alona.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.600
Can you say Alona?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.900
&gt;&gt; Alona.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:26.050
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: And now,
maybe some of you want to ask me

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.950
about my work, about writing
for children and illustrating

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.920
for children and about my cat.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.440
I have a cat and I have
a fish, a goldfish,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.320
and I have this Krasnoludek.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.750
Is there anybody that
wants to ask me something?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.150
You want to?

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.450
Come here.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:55.280
He even leaves fewer crumbs.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.460
Now Joshua knows a
lot of polite words

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.190
and uses them most of the time.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.760
In the morning he says -- what
do you say in the morning?

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:12.630
Good morning, and in the
evening, before going to bed,

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:17.360
he says good night, yeah?

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.470
Good night.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.150
When his friend, Charles,
comes to visit,

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.620
does Joshua say, "Enjoy your meal"?

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.090
No, no, no, no, no.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.840
He's not saying that.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:36.860
He says, "Hello, and welcome."

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:43.230
And when his friend,
Charles, is ready to leave,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.400
does Joshua say, "You look nice"?

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.320
No, you say to his
friend, you look nice

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.950
when he's dressed in new clothes.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.430
Joshua say, "Goodbye.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:59.800
Goodbye, see you soon again."

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:05.500
When Joshua accidentally stepped on
Zelda, the kindergarten teacher's,

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:10.330
foot, did he say "Congratulations"?

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.260
No, he doesn't say this.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.140
He says, "I am sorry."

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.530
You know this word, I am sorry?

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:27.420
Yeah? When Joshua's grandmother,
my mother, gives him a present,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.590
does he say, "Good luck"?

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.710
No, he says thank you.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:38.170
Whenever he gets present,
Joshua say thank you.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:43.140
When Joshua wants me, his
mother, to read him this book,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.220
does he say, "Bless you"?

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.270
No, no, no, no.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:56.580
He says please when he wants me,
his mother, to read him this book.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.480
Joshua say please.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.980
When I, his mother,
finish reading this book

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.420
to him, Joshua says thank you.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.890
Joshua's table manners
are really splendid now.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:14.970
He can sit close to the table,
use a spoon and fork and a knife,

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.860
and wipe his mouth with a napkin.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:24.420
He does not a mess with lots of
crumbs all over the table anymore,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:29.560
and at the end of the meal, he
says, "Thank you, how wonderful."

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.370
And I, his mother, am
very happy and proud.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.140
Now let me ask you a question.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.550
If you wanted to read this book
to you again, what would you say?

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:46.720
"Yes please," or perhaps,
"No, thank you."

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:54.170
And I look at you now and I
feel that you are already tired.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:41:00.760
Isn't it? And I think that
you will say to me thank you,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.770
Grandma Alona Frankel, that you
write and illustrate those books.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:14.760 position:56%
You want to sleep, and I hope when I
meet you again, you will be already

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:21.210 position:56%
in school, the first grade, and I
look at you, and you are all so nice

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:27.150
and beautiful, and I wish you
have a wonderful, healthy,

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.420
and happy life in the future.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.510
Thank you for coming,
and you are sweet.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.210
[ Applause ]

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.870
