00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.370
We're now going to study the
unit circle a little bit more,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.370
and see how it extends, I guess
we could say, the traditional

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.770
SOH-CAH-TOA definitions
of functions.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.590
And how we can actually use it
to solve for angles that the

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.280
SOH-CAH-TOA definition of the
trig functions actually

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.560
doesn't help us with.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830
So let's just, as a
review, remember what

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.760
SOH-CAH-TOA told us.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.670
I'll write it up here
in this corner.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.910
I don't want to get confusing,
because I don't want to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.700
write over too much.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.260
SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.690
I'm sorry.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.120
I got it all jumbled up here.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.730
That told us that if we have a
right angle that the sine of an

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.920
angle in the right angle is
equal to the opposite side

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.070
over the hypotenuse.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.210
The cosine of an angle is
equal to the adjacent

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.600
side over hypotenuse.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.810
And the tangent side is
equal to the opposite

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.750
over the adjacent side.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.940
And this worked fine for us.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.820
But if you think about it,
what happens when that angle

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.980
approaches 90 degrees?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.790
Because you can't have two 90
degree angles in a right angle.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.890
Or what happens when that angle
is greater than 90 degrees?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.900
Or what if it went negative?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.780
And that's why, if you remember
from the previous video,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.560
we needed the unit
circle definition.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.100
So let's review the unit
circle definition.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.180
Let me erase this.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.670
Dum di-dum di-dum.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.060
I actually got this unit
circle-- I think I got

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.850
it from Wikipedia.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.900
But I want to give due
credit to whoever I did

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.610
it get for, this drawing
of the unit circle.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.730
But the unit circle
kind of extends that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.770
SOH-CAH-TOA definition.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.560
It tells us if we have a unit
circle-- and this is a picture

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.290
of a unit circle here-- a unit
circle is just a circle

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.100
centered at the origin,
centered at the point 0, 0,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.910
and it has a radius of 1.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.850
So it intersects the x-axis
at 1, 0 and negative 1, 0.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.440
It intersects the y-axis at
0, 1 and 0, negative 1.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.000
If we have a unit circle we
define-- let's start with the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.170
cosine of theta-- we define the
cosine of theta as let's take

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.960
an angle that's between two
radiuses in this unit circle.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.600
And one radius is going to
be the positive x-axis

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.330
between 0 and 1.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.550
So one radius is going
to be this line here.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.620
And then we have the angle is
the angle between you can kind

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.380
of view that as the base
radius and some other radius.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.760
So let's say this
case right here.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.020
And this would be our angle.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.550
The unit circle definition
tells us that the cosine of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.110
this angle is equal to the
x-coordinate where this radius

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.850
intersects the unit circle, and
that the sine of this function

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.055
is equal to the y-coordinate
where this point intersects

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.370
the unit circle.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.570
So for example, in this case--
if you can read behind

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.770
my line-- this says 30
degrees equals pi/6.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.090
So this angle right here is
30 degrees, or pi/6 radians.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.720
And what this definition tells
us is that the sine of 30

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.240
degrees is 1/2, and that the
cosine of 30 degrees is

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.990
square root of 3/2.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.990
And what I want to show you is
that this unit circle

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.050
definition actually coincides
with our SOH-CAH-TOA

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.490
definition, but then
it extends it.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.320
So let's see how we can get
from that SOH-CAH-TOA

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.840
definition to this unit circle
definition, and why they're

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.300
actually consistent
with each other.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.410
So let me erase some of
what I have written here.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.340
Let me get the eraser tool.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.995
I'm going to erase what I had.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:08.450
So let me go back to the pen
tool, make it small again.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.310
OK.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.400
I think I'm all set.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.150
So let's go back to that theta.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.410
Let's say that this
is the theta.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.100
And as we said, this angle
is 30 degrees or pi/6.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.710
Let's drop a line from
that point to the x-axis.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.590
And as we see this line is
perpendicular, so this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.740
is a 90 degree angle.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.510
And if this is a 30 degree
angle here-- this is 30.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.750
Right?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.450
Theta equals 30.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.730
This is 30, this is 90.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.380
What is this angle?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.955
Well, this is a 60 degree
angle, because they

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:47.100
add up to 180.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.440
So this is a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.410
Interesting.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.320
And what do you remember
about 30-60-90 triangles?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.570
Well, the side opposite the
30 degree side is 1/2 the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.530
length of the hypotenuse.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.390
I hope you remember that.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.790
I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.160
So this is the side opposite
the 30 degree side.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.280
Right?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.390
And what's the hypotenuse?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.490
This is the hypotenuse.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.200
And what's the length
of this hypotenuse?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.360
Well it's 1, because this is a
unit circle and this is the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.990
radius of the unit circle.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.870
So the length of this
hypotenuse is 1, and so the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.300
length of this side, which
is opposite the 30 degree

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.490
angle, is going to be 1/2.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.740
Right?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.560
And I'm just using the
30-60-90 triangles that we've

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.450
done previous videos on.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.170
And what's the side opposite
the 60 degree side?

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.070
Well once again it's
square root of 3/2

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.230
times the hypotenuse.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.860
And so it's square root of 3/2.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.180
Right?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.260
So we can figure out that this
side is square root of 3/2,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.750
and that this side is 1/2.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.760
So a couple of things
we can figure out.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.650
Just by looking at this we can
immediately say, well what's

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.240
the coordinate of this point?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.440
Well it's x-coordinate
is right here.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.800
Right?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.510
It's x-coordinate would
be square root of 3/2.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.810
That's this right here.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.080
This distance.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.970
And it's y-coordinate would be
the length of this side of

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.260
the right triangle, or 1/2.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.410
And there we have
it right here.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.850
It was already written for us.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.850
The x-coordinate is the
square root of 3/2 and

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.170
the y-coordinate is 1/2.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.160
And now what I want to show you
is why this x-coordinate can be

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.820
taken as the cosine of theta,
and why this y-coordinate can

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.340
be taken as the sine of theta.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.170
Well what does
SOH-CAH-TOA tell us?

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.410
Well let's start
with the cosine.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.940
So SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.400
So CAH.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.795
Cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse, right?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.790
Well, in this triangle I just
drew, what is the adjacent

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.490
side to this angle?

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.613
Right?

00:06:50.613 --> 00:06:52.120
Because we're trying to figure
out the cosine of this

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.170
angle, this 30 degrees.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.220
Well the adjacent side to this
angle is, of course, this side.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.170
Right?

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.260
So adjacent is
square root of 3/2.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.060
We figured that out just now.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.320
And what's the hypotenuse?

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.050
Well the hypotenuse is this
side, which has length 1

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.830
because it was the unit circle
and that's the radius of it.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.540
So the cosine of this angle
using the SOH-CAH-TOA

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.630
definition is square root
of 3-- the adjacent side--

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.230
over the hypotenuse 1.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.935
So square root of 3/2 over
1, which is the square root

00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:25.070
of 3/2, which was the same
thing as the x-coordinate.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.060
Similarly, we can look at SOH.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.660
Sine equals opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.010
Well what's the opposite side?

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.410
It's 1/2.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.470
And the hypotenuse is 1 here.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.450
So the sine is just 1/2 over 1.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.940
And so we have it here.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.220
So that's why the unit circle
definition isn't kind of a

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.180
replacing definition for the
SOH-CAH-TOA definition, it's

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.960
really just an extension that
allows us-- I mean, for 30

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.940
degrees SOH-CAH-TOA worked, for
45 degrees SOH-CAH-TOA worked,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.750
for 60 degrees it would work.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.490
But once you get to 90 it
becomes a little bit more

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.980
difficult if you use
traditional SOH-CAH-TOA and you

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.310
try to draw a right triangle
that has two 90 degree angles

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.410
in it-- because you couldn't.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.480
And especially once you get to
angles that are larger than 90

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.190
or angles that actually
could even go negative.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.650
It's not drawn here in the unit
circle, but 330 degrees is the

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.140
same thing as negative 30
degrees, because you could go

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.060
either way in the circle.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.340
And you could keep going
around the circle.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.480
You could figure out the sine
or the cosine of, you know, 1

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.590
million degrees if you just
keep going around the circle.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.460
So hopefully this gives you
a sense of the unit circle

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.250
definition of the sine
and cosine functions.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.240
And, of course, the tangent
function is always just the

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.310
sine over the cosine,
or the y over the x.

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.250
And you could use the
unit circle definition

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.440
for that as well.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.170
And I'll leave it for you as an
exercise to try to derive all

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.490
of these other values using
this unit circle, and using

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.930
what you already know about
30-60-90 triangles and what you

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.650
already know about 45-45-90
triangles, or what you

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.670
already know about the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.320
And you should be able to
figure out all of these values

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.570
going around the unit circle.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.270
Hopefully that was helpful.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.772
See you soon.
