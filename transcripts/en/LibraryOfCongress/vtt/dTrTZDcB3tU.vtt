&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C...

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.560
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Morning, I'm Karen
Jaffe of the Young Reader Center

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.380
and this is a special story
time on Friday, April,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:47.370
8th to celebrate 150th anniversary
of "Alice in Wonderland".

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.580
How many know who "Alice
in Wonderland" is?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.370
Well, you're going to
find out very soon.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.930
I just have a few things to
share with you before we begin.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.130
After the program, which is
going to be about 30 minutes,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.080
we're going to have
a special parade,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.070
so you will be following our
storyteller Caroline Quandt

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.520
and a special guest
storyteller who will be our

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.000
"Alice" this morning,
Joani Etskovitz.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.310
And I just want to remind everybody

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.890 position:56%
when we start the parade you will
all, all the grown-ups will have had

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.610
to fill out a photo release form,
so if you have not done that,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.350
you will have to do that
before you join the parade

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.830
because we have video
and we have photography,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.740
and we need that document
for the library.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.080
So now I'm going to
introduce Caroline Quandt,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.850
the YRC storyteller.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.590
&gt;&gt; Caroline Quandt: Hey everybody.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.620
Time for stories, time for
stories, oh it's story time again.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.390
Let us gather altogether as
we sit beside our friends.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.620
Time for stories, time for
stories, oh it's story time again.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.290
Let us gather altogether as
we sit beside our friends.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.160
Good morning everybody and
welcome to the Young Reader Center

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.740
and happy birthday
"Alice", yeah, alright.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.890
So let's do Open Shut Them
to wake up our brains, okay?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.160
Open, shut them, open, shut them,
give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.000
Open, shut them, open, shut them,
put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.130
Creep them, crawl them,
creep them, crawl them,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.160
right up to your chin, chin, chin.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.120
Open wide your little mouth
but do not let them in.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.560
One more time.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.860
Open, shut them, open, shut them,
give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.820
Open, shut them, open, shut them,
put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.840
Creep them, crawl them,
creep them, crawl them,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.690
right up to your chin, chin, chin.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.680
Open wide your little mouth
but do not let them in.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.650
Good job, okay.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.870
Can you clap with two
hands, two hands, two hands.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.740
Can you clap with two
hands, clap, clap, clap.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.850
Can you kick with two
feet, two feet, two feet?

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.820
Can you kick with two feet,
kick, kick, kick, kick, kick?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.440
Can you sway side to side,
side to side, side to side?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.680
Can you sway side to side,
sway, sway, sway, sway, sway?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.860
Can you kiss with two
lips, two lips, two lips?

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.720
Can you kiss with two
lips, [inaudible]?

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.680
We are all so happy, happy, happy.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.710
We are all so happy
to be with you today.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.370
We are all so happy, happy, happy.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.130
We are all so happy
to be with you today.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.870
[inaudible], alright.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.100
So let's give a big hand for Joani
Etskovitz who's come all the way

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.190
from her college at Princeton to
give us this wonderful story time

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.230
with "Alice in Wonderland".

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.620
Come on up Joanie.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.660
Oh, isn't she lovely,
here's "Alice".

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.300
Alright. Okay, "Mr. Mad
Hatter" has taken off.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.110
&gt;&gt; Joani Etskovitz:
Well, welcome everybody.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.440
Thank you for coming
to my story time today.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.570
How many of you have heard of
my adventures in Wonderland?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.870
Some of you.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.930
Well today I'm going to
get to tell you about them.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.200
My good friend Lewis Carroll
wrote me a story called

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.780
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
and it begins with the rabbit hole.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.890
I was beginning to get very tired
of sitting by my sister on the bank

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.640
and of having nothing to do.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.760
Once or twice, I had peeped into
the book that my sister was reading

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.110
but it had no pictures and
no conversations in it.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.910
"And what is the use
of a book", I thought,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.680 position:56%
"without pictures or conversations?"

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.850
So I was considering in my
own mind as well I could

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.160
for the hot day made me feel
very sleepy and very stupid,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.270
whether the pleasure of making
a daisy chain would be worth the

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.800
trouble of getting up
and picking the daisies

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.170
when suddenly a white rabbit
with pink eyes ran close by me.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.910
There is nothing so very remarkable
in that nor did I think it,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.210
"[inaudible], we have
a little rabbit here."

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.120
Nor did I think it so very much out
of the way to hear the rabbit say

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.550
to itself, "Oh, dear, oh, dear.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.830
I shall be too late."

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.500
Well, when I thought about it
afterwards, it occurred to me

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.100
that I ought to have
wondered at this

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.530
but at the time it had
all seemed quite natural.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:54.390
But when the rabbit actually took
a watch out of its waistcoat pocket

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.040
and looked at it and hurried
on, I started to my feet

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.890
for it had flashed across my mind

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.190 position:56%
that I had never before seen a
rabbit with either waistcoat pockets

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.930
or a watch to take out of it.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.570
And burning with curiosity, I
ran across the field after it

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.160
and was just in time to see it pop

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.670
down a large rabbit
hole under the hedge.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:27.620 position:56%
In another moment, down I went
after it, never once considering how

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.860 position:56%
in the world I was to get out again.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.210
The rabbit hole went
straight on like a tunnel

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.420
for some way then dipped suddenly
down so that I had not a moment

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.540
to think before stopping myself.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.900
And before I could stop
myself, I found myself falling

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.320
down what seems to
be a very deep well.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.940
So as I was falling,
naturally I thought

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.870
to myself, "Well, why am I falling?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.170
Why am I in a hole?

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.470
Where am I going?"

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.810
I was very confused, you see.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.810
It's very puzzling to
fall for such a long way.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.890
So I thought that it might
help to recite some lessons

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.270
to remember what I had taught,

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.520
perhaps remember something
that would help me.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.380
And I thought of my lesson
about the little crocodile.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.930
Have you learned that one?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.700
Do you know the lesson
about the crocodile?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.230
Oh, well it's very
important, everybody knows it,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.220
so I will present for you?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:40.870
Yes. And I do believe there's
a song to go along with it.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.170
Let me see what's the tune?

00:08:44.510 --> 00:09:14.510
[ Singing ]

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.200
So naturally, as the crocodile's
a creature of the water,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.350
what I would find at
the bottom of my hole,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.120
at the bottom of the
rabbit hole was a great sea.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.480
And after swimming through it for
quite some time, I found myself

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.780
on an island with many
strange animals.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:46.240
And as it is quite uncomfortable to
be wet in so many layers of fabric,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.940
we had to find a way
to get ourselves dry.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.940
And this is what we did.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.110
Lewis Carroll wrote about
it in his Chapter 3,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.570
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale".

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.330
We were indeed were a queer-looking
party that assembled on the bank,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.950
the birds with draggled feathers,

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.210
the animals with their fur
clinging close to them,

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.920
and all dripping wet cross
and quite uncomfortable.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.260
The first question was, of
course, how to get dry again.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.630
We had a consultation about this

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.250
and after a few minutes it
seemed quite natural to me

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.730
to find myself talking
familiar with them

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.760
as though I had known
them for all my life.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:51.670
So my animal friends and I talked
about what we should do to get dry.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.170
And my friend Mr. Dodo
gave a long speech

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.510
and everybody cut him off
but the Dodo spoke up.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.190
"What I was going to stay" said
the dodo in an offended term "was

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.480
that the best thing to get us
dry would be a caucus race."

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.910
Now, who here knows
what a caucus race is?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.210
&gt;&gt; Alligator.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.600
&gt;&gt; Joani Etskovitz: An alligator.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.380
Well, there was an
alligator involved

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.700
and we're going to
learn more about it.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.360
"What is a caucus race?"

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.470
I asked, not that I
really wanted to know.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:34.080
But the dodo had paused as if it
thought that somebody had ought

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.280
to speak and no one else seemed
inclined to say anything.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.780
"Why?" said the dodo, "the best
way to explain is to do it."

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.480 position:56%
And pay close attention as you might

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.680
like to try the thing yourself
some winter day or some spring day

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.310
in the Library of Congress.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:59.370
I will tell you how the dodo
managed his caucus race.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.670
First, the dodo marked out a
race course in a sort of circle.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.970
"The exact shape doesn't
really matter."

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.890
it said. And then all the parties
were placed along the course here

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.190
and there.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.120
There was no "one, two, three,
[inaudible]" but they began running

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.090
as they liked and left off when
they liked but it was not easy

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.910
to know when the race was over.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.240
However, when they had been
running for half an hour or so

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.380
and were quite dry again,
the dodo suddenly called out,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.740
"The race is over."

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.420
And all the crowd [inaudible]
and asked, "but who's won?"

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:45.110
This was a question that
the dodo could not answer

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.520
without a great deal of thought.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.460
And it stood for a long time with
one finger pressed on its forehead;

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.780
you know the position in which
you usually see Shakespeare

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.210
in pictures of him?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.900
Now the rest waited in silence.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:10.640
At last, the dodo said, "Everybody
has won and all must have prizes."

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.100 position:56%
Little did I know that when the
dodo said that all must have prizes,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.930 position:56%
I was expected to supply the prizes?

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.500
I had but a thimble in my pocket
but it functioned, it worked.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.650
Everybody was very pleased
to receive my thimble.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:32.700
And what I did next was I
went and continued my journey,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.890
I met more animal friends.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.610
I met a cat, the Cheshire
cat, perhaps you've heard

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.030
of him, my friend Cheshire?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.330
Does anybody know Cheshire puss?

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.630
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.930
&gt;&gt; Joanie Etskovitz:
You know Cheshire puss?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.230
Well, excellent.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.860
Well, what I said to him-- Darling,

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.110
would you like to come
sit by me in the front?

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.580
Would you like to sit with me?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.400
Come and sit with me.

You can help me tell the story.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.540
I have another Alice to
help me tell my story.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.840
Would you like to come?

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.750
Oh, well you're welcome
to sit where you'd like.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.550
One thing about Wonderland, we're
all mad here so there's no order.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.920
So to the Cheshire cat, "Cheshire
puss", I began rather timidly

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.740
as I did not at all
know whether it would

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.540
like that name [inaudible]

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.610
It's a smiling cat.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.040
[inaudible], it's pleased so
far, I thought, and I went on.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.150
"Would you tell me, please, which
way I ought to go from here?"

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.920
for I was lost.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.980
"That depends, a good deal" said
the cat, "on where you want to go."

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.470
"I don't much care where", I said.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:58.920
"Then it doesn't matter which
way you go" said the cat.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.770
"So long as I get somewhere."

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.290
I added as an explanation.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.690
"Oh well, you're sure to
do that" said the cat,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.770
"if you only walk long enough."

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:16.190 position:56%
I felt that this could not be
denied, so I tried another question.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.040
"Well, what sort of
people live about here?"

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:28.220
"Well, in direction", said the
cat waving its right paw around,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.660
"lives a hatter.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.910
Perhaps, you've seen the hatter?

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.830
And in that direction" waving the
other paw, "lives a large hare.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.250
Visit either you like,
they're both mad."

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.540
"But I don't want to
go among mad people."

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.840
I remarked.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.700
"Oh well, you can't help that."

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.510
said the cat "We're all mad here."

[ Background Sounds ]

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.170
I didn't think that
proved it at all.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:04.250
However, I went on, "And how
do you know that you're mad?

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.430
"To begin with," said the
cat, "a dog is not mad.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.340
You grant that?"

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.640
"I suppose so."

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.440
I said. "Well then", the cat
went on, "you see a dog growls

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:25.190
when it's angry [inaudible] and
wags its tail when it's pleased.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.210
Now, I growl when I'm [inaudible]
and I wag my tail when I'm angry

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.450
and therefore, I am mad."

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.250
"I call it purring, not growling."

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.310
I said. "Call it what
you like" said the cat,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.760
"Do you play croquet
with the queen today?"

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.170
"I should like it very much."

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.210
I said, "but I haven't
been invited yet.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:54.230
"You'll see me there" said
the cat and he vanished.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:00.380
So I followed the cat's direction
and I went to see the Mad Hatter

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.960
as much as I did not want
to go amongst mad people.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.420
And while I was there, we had a
lovely tea party, a mad tea party.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.110
And the Hatter sang us a song.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:18.800
It was called, "Twinkle
