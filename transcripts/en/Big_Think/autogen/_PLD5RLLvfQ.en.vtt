mind God connection is something that
 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.129
mind God connection is something that
people have intuitively known for a long

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139
people have intuitively known for a long
 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.490
people have intuitively known for a long
time but science has only I would say in

the last few years
 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.359
the last few years
gotten a grasp and acceptance of this

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369
gotten a grasp and acceptance of this
 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.480
gotten a grasp and acceptance of this
concept it essentially means that your

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490
concept it essentially means that your
 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.780
concept it essentially means that your
brain has intimate connections with the

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790
brain has intimate connections with the
 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.870
brain has intimate connections with the
gut and another entity in our gut the

gut and another entity in our gut the
 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.779
gut and another entity in our gut the
second brain which is about a hundred

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789
second brain which is about a hundred
 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.810
second brain which is about a hundred
million nerve cells that are sandwiched

million nerve cells that are sandwiched
 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.170
million nerve cells that are sandwiched
in between the layers of the gut and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180
in between the layers of the gut and
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.400
in between the layers of the gut and
they can do a lot of things on their own

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
they can do a lot of things on their own
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.910
they can do a lot of things on their own
in terms of regulating our digestive

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920
in terms of regulating our digestive
 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.810
in terms of regulating our digestive
processes but there's a very intimate

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820
processes but there's a very intimate
 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.540
processes but there's a very intimate
conversation between that little brain a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550
conversation between that little brain a
 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.819
conversation between that little brain a
second brain in the gut and our main

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829
second brain in the gut and our main
 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.790
second brain in the gut and our main
brain they use the same

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800
brain they use the same
 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500
brain they use the same
neurotransmitters they are connected by

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510
neurotransmitters they are connected by
 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.830
neurotransmitters they are connected by
nerve pathways and so we have really an

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840
nerve pathways and so we have really an
 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.889
nerve pathways and so we have really an
integrated system from our brain to

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899
integrated system from our brain to
 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.529

when we talk about the connection
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.980
when we talk about the connection
between depression and the gut there's

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990
between depression and the gut there's
 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.750
between depression and the gut there's
there's some very intriguing

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
there's some very intriguing
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.000
there's some very intriguing
observations both clinically but also

now more recently scientifically that
 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.210
now more recently scientifically that
make it highly plausible that is an

there's a connection because many

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
there's a connection because many
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.550
