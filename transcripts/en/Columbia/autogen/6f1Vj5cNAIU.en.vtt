off why are we doing this at all what's

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019
off why are we doing this at all what's
 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.059
off why are we doing this at all what's
what's what's the need for this

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069
what's what's the need for this

well I think this is something that all

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
well I think this is something that all
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520
well I think this is something that all
of you intuitively understand that's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
of you intuitively understand that's
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940
of you intuitively understand that's
simply that the the problems inherent to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
simply that the the problems inherent to
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.940
simply that the the problems inherent to
large-scale web archiving are just two

effectively there's any number of

effectively there's any number of
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420
effectively there's any number of
potential problems that we have to deal

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
potential problems that we have to deal
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.810
potential problems that we have to deal
with just highlighting to the two that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
with just highlighting to the two that
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120
with just highlighting to the two that
that tend to come up most often first of

that tend to come up most often first of
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.300
that tend to come up most often first of
all is the question of web scale

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
all is the question of web scale

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.140
curators could go into the interface and
they could come up with you know how

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.150
they could come up with you know how
 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.180
they could come up with you know how
often this thing should be crawled which

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.190
often this thing should be crawled which
 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.840
often this thing should be crawled which
of our standard scoping scopes should

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:31.850
of our standard scoping scopes should
 

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.510
of our standard scoping scopes should
this follow etc and it would just kind

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.520
this follow etc and it would just kind
 

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.040
this follow etc and it would just kind
of work the whole system would work and

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.050
of work the whole system would work and
 

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.870
of work the whole system would work and
there was a way there is a way to

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880
there was a way there is a way to
 

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.890
there was a way there is a way to
automatically push it to our

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:38.900
automatically push it to our
 

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.600
automatically push it to our
preservation repository which we were

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:40.610
preservation repository which we were
 

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.930
preservation repository which we were
happy about so we you know we were ready

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:43.940
happy about so we you know we were ready
 

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.130
happy about so we you know we were ready
to celebrate and then all of a sudden

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.140
to celebrate and then all of a sudden
 

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.930
to celebrate and then all of a sudden
the kind of the rug pulled out from

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:46.940
the kind of the rug pulled out from
 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.820
the kind of the rug pulled out from
under us

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:47.830
under us
 

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.130
under us
because all of a sudden okay the library

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.140
because all of a sudden okay the library
 

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.040
because all of a sudden okay the library
is reorganizing in 2009 so it was a

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.050
is reorganizing in 2009 so it was a
 

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.900
is reorganizing in 2009 so it was a
really bad timing for us because we were

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:54.910
really bad timing for us because we were
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.210
really bad timing for us because we were
just about to say okay what should be

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.220
just about to say okay what should be
 

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.520
just about to say okay what should be
the operating cost model should this you

00:08:59.520 --> 00:08:59.530
the operating cost model should this you
 

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.230
the operating cost model should this you
know for this thing which should be the

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240
know for this thing which should be the
 

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.210
know for this thing which should be the
dedicated staff for this thing how

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.220
dedicated staff for this thing how
 

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.430
dedicated staff for this thing how
should we expand this to more curatorial

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440
should we expand this to more curatorial
 

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.100
should we expand this to more curatorial
units so long story short during that

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.110
units so long story short during that
 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.230
units so long story short during that
reorganization which actually I count as

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240
reorganization which actually I count as
 

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.880
reorganization which actually I count as
four different reorganizations within

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:14.890
four different reorganizations within
 

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.210
four different reorganizations within
that time period because it really was

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220
that time period because it really was
 

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.990
that time period because it really was
our system stagnated and like CDL saw we

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000
our system stagnated and like CDL saw we
 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.150
our system stagnated and like CDL saw we
had we now have years of technical debt

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160
had we now have years of technical debt
 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.950
had we now have years of technical debt
we had nobody dedicated to this you know

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:28.960
we had nobody dedicated to this you know
 

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.320
we had nobody dedicated to this you know
not from the service provider

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.330
not from the service provider
 

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.970

has been upgraded during this time and

has been upgraded during this time and
 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.440
has been upgraded during this time and
so hair tricks is now several versions

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:40.450
so hair tricks is now several versions
 

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.760
so hair tricks is now several versions
ahead we're also still using networks

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:44.770
ahead we're also still using networks
 

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.340
ahead we're also still using networks
instead of solar and we're still using

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.350
instead of solar and we're still using
 

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.550
instead of solar and we're still using
arc instead of work and it's still only

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560
arc instead of work and it's still only
 

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.110
arc instead of work and it's still only
being used by the original three

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120
being used by the original three
 

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.770

curatorial units so we looked at this

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:55.780
curatorial units so we looked at this
 

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.800
curatorial units so we looked at this
and we thought okay if we were to bring

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:58.810
and we thought okay if we were to bring
 

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.540
and we thought okay if we were to bring
bring this up up to speed you know

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:00.550
bring this up up to speed you know
 

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.740
bring this up up to speed you know
modernize it scale it up really put it

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:04.750
modernize it scale it up really put it
 

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.530
modernize it scale it up really put it
into you know production if we think it

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:07.540
into you know production if we think it
 

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.080
into you know production if we think it
would take 2.5 FTE for one year to

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.090
would take 2.5 FTE for one year to
 

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.640
would take 2.5 FTE for one year to
upgrade it and that includes some

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.650
upgrade it and that includes some
 

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.700
upgrade it and that includes some
development staff but also some support

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:14.710
development staff but also some support
 

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.870
development staff but also some support
staff some liaison to the curators and

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880
staff some liaison to the curators and
 

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.720
staff some liaison to the curators and
then 3ft on an ongoing basis and around

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:21.730
then 3ft on an ongoing basis and around
 

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.490
then 3ft on an ongoing basis and around
two FTE is closer to what the library

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.500
two FTE is closer to what the library
 

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.510
two FTE is closer to what the library
wants to to put onto this at the moment

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:27.520
wants to to put onto this at the moment
 

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.880
wants to to put onto this at the moment
but I'm looking at this and you know

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:29.890
but I'm looking at this and you know
 

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.310
but I'm looking at this and you know
whether you say to FD III FTE it's kind

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320
whether you say to FD III FTE it's kind
 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.990
whether you say to FD III FTE it's kind
of really the same it's not that much of

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000
of really the same it's not that much of
 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.390
of really the same it's not that much of
a difference but the real the real issue

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:36.400
a difference but the real the real issue
 

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.340
a difference but the real the real issue
is what are you going to spend your

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
is what are you going to spend your
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.290
is what are you going to spend your
development resources on so you have a

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:40.300
development resources on so you have a
 

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.760
development resources on so you have a
certain amount of development resources

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:41.770
certain amount of development resources
 

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.290
certain amount of development resources
are you going to spend it working on on

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300
are you going to spend it working on on
 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.350
are you going to spend it working on on
maintaining crawlers you know working on

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360
maintaining crawlers you know working on
 

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.240

always expanding your full text index
that kind of just kind of stuff that

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:53.830
that kind of just kind of stuff that
 

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.280
that kind of just kind of stuff that
should already be there or are you going

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.290
should already be there or are you going
 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.780
should already be there or are you going
to spend it on kind of the more

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:57.790
to spend it on kind of the more
 

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.300

interesting things like the supporting

interfaces which wouldn't be silos of

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:10.529
interfaces which wouldn't be silos of

just web harvests you know browsing

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:12.630
just web harvests you know browsing
 

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.579
just web harvests you know browsing
through that but it would integrate

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:13.589
through that but it would integrate
 

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:15.769
through that but it would integrate
different types of content and from

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779
different types of content and from
 

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:17.060
different types of content and from
different institutions you know that

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.070
different institutions you know that
 

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.250
different institutions you know that
kind of more interesting work so that's

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260
kind of more interesting work so that's
 

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.160
kind of more interesting work so that's
really the issue for us it is how can we

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.170
really the issue for us it is how can we
 

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.750
really the issue for us it is how can we
transition to something that is in

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760
transition to something that is in
 

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.070
transition to something that is in
collaboration with a lot of other people

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:28.080
collaboration with a lot of other people
 

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.110
collaboration with a lot of other people
and and makes it so that we can spend

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120
and and makes it so that we can spend
 

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.240
and and makes it so that we can spend
our developer resources on those things

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.250
our developer resources on those things
 

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:41.060
our developer resources on those things
that we can't find elsewhere so I think

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.070
that we can't find elsewhere so I think
 

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.680
that we can't find elsewhere so I think
there's also been a number of allusions

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:42.690
there's also been a number of allusions
 

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.139
there's also been a number of allusions
to the potential benefits of

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:45.149
to the potential benefits of
 

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:47.660
to the potential benefits of
collaboration throughout the day and

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:47.670
collaboration throughout the day and
 

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.610
collaboration throughout the day and
these three particular points we saw

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620
these three particular points we saw
 

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.030
these three particular points we saw
actually up on the screen this morning

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040
actually up on the screen this morning
 

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.630
actually up on the screen this morning
these are three areas in which the I IPC

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640
these are three areas in which the I IPC
 

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.449
these are three areas in which the I IPC
has identified partly as a justification

00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459
has identified partly as a justification
 

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:02.329
has identified partly as a justification
for its own existence but I think it's

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339
for its own existence but I think it's
 

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:04.730
for its own existence but I think it's
pretty clear that basically everything

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740
pretty clear that basically everything

pretty clear that basically everything
that they're saying here in an

this is important we think for making

00:16:59.950 --> 00:16:59.960
this is important we think for making
 

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.770
this is important we think for making
the possibility of adhering to to this

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.100
customized solutions whenever necessary
and particularly whenever you think that

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.110
and particularly whenever you think that
 

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.390
and particularly whenever you think that
you can uniquely add value so with that

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400
you can uniquely add value so with that
 

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.340
you can uniquely add value so with that
in mind we would get sort of an

some of it so this looked to us like the

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:49.710
some of it so this looked to us like the
 

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.070
some of it so this looked to us like the

and so we decided to put a grant in the

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:58.289
and so we decided to put a grant in the
 

00:19:58.289 --> 00:19:59.930
and so we decided to put a grant in the
national leadership grant for libraries

00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940
national leadership grant for libraries
 

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.570

and the way they do it now for those

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580
and the way they do it now for those
 

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.279
and the way they do it now for those
particular grants is first you put in a

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:04.289
particular grants is first you put in a
 

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:06.529
particular grants is first you put in a
preliminary proposal and then you can be

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539
preliminary proposal and then you can be
 

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.680
preliminary proposal and then you can be
invited to put in a full proposal so we

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:09.690
invited to put in a full proposal so we
 

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.200
invited to put in a full proposal so we
decided to go for the the one earlier

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.210
decided to go for the the one earlier
 

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.750
decided to go for the the one earlier
this year and invited a number of

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760
this year and invited a number of
 

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.399
this year and invited a number of
institutions to Boston in January to

00:20:19.399 --> 00:20:19.409
institutions to Boston in January to
 

00:20:19.409 --> 00:20:21.500
institutions to Boston in January to
help us put together a grant and for

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:21.510
help us put together a grant and for
 

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.870
help us put together a grant and for
some reason a lot of them said okay and

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880
some reason a lot of them said okay and
 

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.039
some reason a lot of them said okay and
came to Boston and but that was before

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:28.049
came to Boston and but that was before
 

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.779
came to Boston and but that was before
all the snow in February's it was okay

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:29.789
all the snow in February's it was okay
 

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:32.389
all the snow in February's it was okay
and helped us put together this

00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:32.399
and helped us put together this
 

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.639
and helped us put together this
preliminary proposal which we submitted

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:34.649
preliminary proposal which we submitted
 

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:36.200
preliminary proposal which we submitted
and there were three strands of

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.210
and there were three strands of
 

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.450
and there were three strands of
activities in this proposal the first

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460
activities in this proposal the first
 

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.519
activities in this proposal the first
was an environment environmental scan

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:40.529
was an environment environmental scan
 

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:43.100
was an environment environmental scan
what are our common challenges what are

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.110
what are our common challenges what are
 

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.629
what are our common challenges what are
yous cases what are the functional

00:20:44.629 --> 00:20:44.639
yous cases what are the functional
 

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:47.090
yous cases what are the functional
requirements and then there were two

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100
requirements and then there were two
 

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.490
requirements and then there were two
types of collaboration developing these

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500
types of collaboration developing these
 

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.350
types of collaboration developing these
collaborations one was from an

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360
collaborations one was from an
 

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.340
collaborations one was from an
organizational standpoint and the other

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.350
organizational standpoint and the other
 

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.409
organizational standpoint and the other
from a technical standpoint so from the

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:55.419
from a technical standpoint so from the
 

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:58.770
from a technical standpoint so from the
technical standpoint you know okay does

00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:58.780
technical standpoint you know okay does
 

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.260
technical standpoint you know okay does
that model make sense with the api's

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.270
that model make sense with the api's
 

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.840
that model make sense with the api's
Kent can we prototype some of them can

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:03.850
Kent can we prototype some of them can
 

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.270
Kent can we prototype some of them can
we test some of them and can we show

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280
we test some of them and can we show
 

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.130
we test some of them and can we show
that they really are plug and play and

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:08.140
that they really are plug and play and
 

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.450

so there were those three strands of

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200
so there were those three strands of
 

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.440
so there were those three strands of
activity we were not invited to submit

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:40.450

probably IMLS grant round in the
 

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:55.380
probably IMLS grant round in the
meantime we have a couple different sets

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.390
meantime we have a couple different sets
 

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.810
meantime we have a couple different sets
of activities going on to prepare better

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:57.820
of activities going on to prepare better
 

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.909
of activities going on to prepare better

and it was written by some of us in the
 

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.850
and it was written by some of us in the
preservation working group within the

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:23.860
preservation working group within the
 

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.899
preservation working group within the
IPC and in the in this article it talks

00:22:27.899 --> 00:22:27.909
IPC and in the in this article it talks
 

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:31.100
IPC and in the in this article it talks
about what is the current state of

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.110
about what is the current state of
 

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.539
about what is the current state of
digital preservation for web archiving

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:33.549
digital preservation for web archiving
 

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:36.960
digital preservation for web archiving
for I IPC members and it's something

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:36.970
for I IPC members and it's something
 

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.970
for I IPC members and it's something
that does not get a lot of attention

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:38.980
that does not get a lot of attention
 

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.100
that does not get a lot of attention
normally I mean even today if you think

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.110
normally I mean even today if you think
 

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.260
normally I mean even today if you think
about the different topics we heard it's

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:43.270
about the different topics we heard it's
 

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.299
about the different topics we heard it's
a lot of it is still about collecting

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:45.309
a lot of it is still about collecting
 

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:47.190
a lot of it is still about collecting
you know you know it's good that a lot

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200
you know you know it's good that a lot
 

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.590
you know you know it's good that a lot
of it now is about use of web archives

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600
of it now is about use of web archives
 

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.360
of it now is about use of web archives
but we're still not quite having a lot

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.370
but we're still not quite having a lot
 

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.010
but we're still not quite having a lot
of conversations about the preservation

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:53.020
of conversations about the preservation
 

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.190
of conversations about the preservation
of web archives and so we did run a

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200
of web archives and so we did run a
 

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.760
of web archives and so we did run a
survey for the I MPC members and you can

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:58.770
survey for the I MPC members and you can
 

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.169
survey for the I MPC members and you can
learn some of the results if you read

00:23:01.169 --> 00:23:01.179
learn some of the results if you read
 

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.870
learn some of the results if you read
that article it's

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880
that article it's
 

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.710
that article it's
but it's not looking very great I'll

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720
but it's not looking very great I'll
 

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.930
but it's not looking very great I'll
tell you that I'll give you one example

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940
tell you that I'll give you one example
 

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.660
tell you that I'll give you one example
which just really stands in my mind was

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:11.670
which just really stands in my mind was
 

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.810
which just really stands in my mind was
kind of disturbing a little bit and so

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820
kind of disturbing a little bit and so
 

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.550
kind of disturbing a little bit and so
we asked about different preservation

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:16.560
we asked about different preservation
 

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.040
we asked about different preservation
practices and you know do you do this

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.050
practices and you know do you do this
 

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.170
practices and you know do you do this
for your web archives do you do this we

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.180
for your web archives do you do this we
 

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.120
for your web archives do you do this we
asked about replication which is a

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.130
asked about replication which is a
 

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.580
asked about replication which is a
really basic thing everybody knows you

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:25.590
really basic thing everybody knows you
 

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.830
really basic thing everybody knows you
need to have more than one copyright of

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840
need to have more than one copyright of
 

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.870
need to have more than one copyright of
something if you want to hope to keep

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880
something if you want to hope to keep
 

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.050
something if you want to hope to keep
this thing and roughly fifty percent a

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.060
this thing and roughly fifty percent a
 

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.610
this thing and roughly fifty percent a
little under fifty percent we're not

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620
little under fifty percent we're not
 

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.620
little under fifty percent we're not
even doing replication for their web

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:36.630
even doing replication for their web
 

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.110
even doing replication for their web
archives and you know it's

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120
archives and you know it's
 

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.570
archives and you know it's
understandable because a lot of these

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580
understandable because a lot of these
 

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.940
understandable because a lot of these
institutions are collecting a lot of

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:43.950
institutions are collecting a lot of
 

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.740
institutions are collecting a lot of
material you know at the domain level

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:45.750
material you know at the domain level
 

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.110
material you know at the domain level
but still you know if you're going to

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120
but still you know if you're going to
 

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.500
but still you know if you're going to
continue to put a lot of effort and

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:51.510
continue to put a lot of effort and
 

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.000
continue to put a lot of effort and
funding into this you want to make sure

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.010
funding into this you want to make sure
 

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.530
funding into this you want to make sure
that you can hold on to this so there's

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:54.540
that you can hold on to this so there's
 

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.420
that you can hold on to this so there's
clearly a lot of work that needs to go

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:56.430
clearly a lot of work that needs to go
 

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.790
clearly a lot of work that needs to go
on in the preservation arena and the

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:58.800
on in the preservation arena and the
 

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.980
on in the preservation arena and the
article goes on to talk about over the

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:00.990
article goes on to talk about over the
 

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.820
article goes on to talk about over the
years what we've done in the

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:01.830
years what we've done in the
 

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.440
years what we've done in the
preservation working group to it to

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.450
preservation working group to it to
 

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.300
preservation working group to it to
address our challenges and it's always

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:05.310
address our challenges and it's always
 

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.430
address our challenges and it's always
been around sharing tools and practices

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440
been around sharing tools and practices
 

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.530
been around sharing tools and practices
and that kind of thing so there is a lot

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:09.540
and that kind of thing so there is a lot
 

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.230
and that kind of thing so there is a lot
of precedent to having this kind of you

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240
of precedent to having this kind of you
 

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.930
of precedent to having this kind of you
know this is kind of technical solutions

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940
know this is kind of technical solutions
 

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.240
know this is kind of technical solutions
being one part of the solution for

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.250
being one part of the solution for
 

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.930
being one part of the solution for
helping us with our challenges and

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:19.940
helping us with our challenges and
 

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.690
helping us with our challenges and
recently at the I IPC General Assembly

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700
recently at the I IPC General Assembly
 

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.010
recently at the I IPC General Assembly
at Stanford there were several

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020
at Stanford there were several
 

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.160
at Stanford there were several
presentations that talked about the need

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.170
presentations that talked about the need
 

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.200
presentations that talked about the need
for api's is this very same thing that

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.210
for api's is this very same thing that
 

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.090
for api's is this very same thing that
we had been working on because everybody

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100
we had been working on because everybody
 

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.340
we had been working on because everybody
is concerned about maintaining these

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:34.350
is concerned about maintaining these
 

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.680
is concerned about maintaining these
infrastructures over time and being able

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:36.690
infrastructures over time and being able
 

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.560
infrastructures over time and being able
to meet new researcher expectations and

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:39.570
to meet new researcher expectations and
 

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.970
to meet new researcher expectations and
so you know wanting to have these

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980
so you know wanting to have these
 

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.860
so you know wanting to have these
maintainable infrastructure's where you

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:42.870
maintainable infrastructure's where you
 

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.020
maintainable infrastructure's where you
can say okay this Q a tool is now better

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.030
can say okay this Q a tool is now better
 

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.580
can say okay this Q a tool is now better
i'm going to try to switch over to that

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:46.590

you can't do that kind of thing unless

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:52.410
you can't do that kind of thing unless
 

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.260
you can't do that kind of thing unless
you do have this common API

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:54.270
you do have this common API
 

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.810
you do have this common API

within the IPC we put out a survey to
 

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.750
within the IPC we put out a survey to
see if there would be interested in

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760
see if there would be interested in
 

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.760

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.190
collaboration and I think that you know
there's a lot of us in favor of that a

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200
there's a lot of us in favor of that a
 

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.170
there's a lot of us in favor of that a
lot of interest in api's and willingness

funding opportunities to facilitate this
effort and so if you have ideas for how

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.170
effort and so if you have ideas for how
 

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.680
effort and so if you have ideas for how
to advance this we be very interested in

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:50.690
to advance this we be very interested in

thanks in your architectural diagram
there I couldn't help but noticing

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760
there I couldn't help but noticing
 

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.960

display API and I kinda was wondering

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:18.970
display API and I kinda was wondering
 

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.930
display API and I kinda was wondering
what kind of requirements do you have

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:21.940
what kind of requirements do you have
 

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.910
what kind of requirements do you have
there that go beyond what the memento

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:23.920
there that go beyond what the memento
 

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.100
there that go beyond what the memento

systems yeah we don't really have any

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:36.250
systems yeah we don't really have any
 

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.580
systems yeah we don't really have any
tangible requirements at this point we

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:38.590
tangible requirements at this point we
 

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.820
tangible requirements at this point we
have a diagram so part of the

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:41.830
have a diagram so part of the
 

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.919
have a diagram so part of the
environmental scan one part of it will

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:43.929
environmental scan one part of it will
 

00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:45.630
environmental scan one part of it will
be seeing what are the existing guys

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640
be seeing what are the existing guys
 

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.100
be seeing what are the existing guys
what are the existing things we can use

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.110
what are the existing things we can use
 

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.870
what are the existing things we can use
this obviously we don't want to create

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880
this obviously we don't want to create
 

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.680
this obviously we don't want to create
something where there's already

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:49.690
something where there's already
 

00:27:49.690 --> 00:28:08.270
something where there's already
something we can use yes front here

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.090
 
um yeah so my background from coming

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100
um yeah so my background from coming
 

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.910
um yeah so my background from coming
from a very small arts nonprofit and

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:15.920
from a very small arts nonprofit and
 

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.730

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240
collaborative web archiving affords and
 

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.380
collaborative web archiving affords and
seeing this diagram is of course kind of

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:23.390
seeing this diagram is of course kind of
 

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.220
seeing this diagram is of course kind of
intimidating and what what we managed to

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.230
intimidating and what what we managed to
 

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.940
intimidating and what what we managed to
do is also because we I think we made

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:31.950
do is also because we I think we made
 

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.010
do is also because we I think we made
some quite good progress with with web

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020
some quite good progress with with web
 

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.780
some quite good progress with with web
archiving for ourselves and have been

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:35.790
archiving for ourselves and have been
 

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.350
archiving for ourselves and have been
doing since 1996 but we haven't for

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360
doing since 1996 but we haven't for
 

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.890

example approached things at web scale

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900
example approached things at web scale
 

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.010
example approached things at web scale
and I I wonder this is such a thing that

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020
and I I wonder this is such a thing that
 

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.870
and I I wonder this is such a thing that
seems totally undisputed here that

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880
seems totally undisputed here that
 

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.240
seems totally undisputed here that
everything has to be at an astronomic

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:50.250
everything has to be at an astronomic
 

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.400
everything has to be at an astronomic
scale and I wonder if you want to get

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:52.410
scale and I wonder if you want to get
 

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.180
scale and I wonder if you want to get
more input into into this field you you

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:56.190
more input into into this field you you
 

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.580
more input into into this field you you
should think about small institutions

00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:58.590
should think about small institutions
 

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.830
should think about small institutions
that don't even have the I don't know

that that will never be able to put even
 

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.200
that that will never be able to put even
half of this work into work what you

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.210
half of this work into work what you
 

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.080
half of this work into work what you
have on this diagram but it is more like

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:12.090
have on this diagram but it is more like
 

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:16.120
have on this diagram but it is more like
the experimentation and the and also

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.130
the experimentation and the and also
 

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.470
the experimentation and the and also
interesting input just i think is very

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480
interesting input just i think is very
 

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.860
interesting input just i think is very
much located in small institutions but

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:20.870
much located in small institutions but
 

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.260
much located in small institutions but
yeah if you need to be I don't know a

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:24.270
yeah if you need to be I don't know a
 

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.110
yeah if you need to be I don't know a
paying member of several organizations

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120
paying member of several organizations
 

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.090
paying member of several organizations
also even to participate I'm so happy to

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100
also even to participate I'm so happy to
 

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.190
also even to participate I'm so happy to
be invited here by the way yeah that's

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200
be invited here by the way yeah that's
 

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.510
be invited here by the way yeah that's
that's great and you know how to do that

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520
that's great and you know how to do that
 

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.350
that's great and you know how to do that
but yeah I think this is this is a big

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360
but yeah I think this is this is a big
 

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.090
but yeah I think this is this is a big
thing because small institutions they

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100
thing because small institutions they
 

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.010
thing because small institutions they
can give the depth instead of the breath

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020
can give the depth instead of the breath
 

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.620
can give the depth instead of the breath
and for example using the memento

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:45.630
and for example using the memento
 

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.510
and for example using the memento
protocol it can still be a universal

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520
protocol it can still be a universal
 

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.220
protocol it can still be a universal

think about collaborations often it is
 

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.170
think about collaborations often it is
sort of you know that's assumed to be

00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.180
sort of you know that's assumed to be

point she was making was but we need to
 

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.470
point she was making was but we need to
figure out is what do people have to

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480
figure out is what do people have to
 

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.660
figure out is what do people have to
offer and then bring those people in

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:07.670
offer and then bring those people in
 

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.890
offer and then bring those people in
whether they're from a large

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:08.900
whether they're from a large

organization that has no money from a
small organization that has a lot of

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320
small organization that has a lot of
 

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.990
small organization that has a lot of
funding and a lot of technical expertise

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000
funding and a lot of technical expertise
 

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.700

depth to it and so speaking to the point

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.330
depth to it and so speaking to the point
 

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.820
depth to it and so speaking to the point
that was raised earlier you know if

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:21.830
that was raised earlier you know if
 

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.230
that was raised earlier you know if
you're a small organization how can you

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240
you're a small organization how can you
 

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.180
you're a small organization how can you
how can you participate I think exactly

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.190
how can you participate I think exactly
 

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.150
how can you participate I think exactly
looking at what our collaborated not

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160
looking at what our collaborated not
 

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.920
looking at what our collaborated not
models that we're building and making

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:29.930
models that we're building and making
 

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.780
models that we're building and making
sure that people can in fact participate

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:31.790
sure that people can in fact participate
 

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.700
sure that people can in fact participate
so we have that diversity of the voices

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:33.710
so we have that diversity of the voices
 

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:43.150
so we have that diversity of the voices
at the table yes so smaller institutions

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160
at the table yes so smaller institutions
 

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.640
at the table yes so smaller institutions
have a real challenge in this debate I

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:45.650
have a real challenge in this debate I
 

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.100
have a real challenge in this debate I
think that's pretty clear it isn't it

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.110
think that's pretty clear it isn't it
 

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.650
think that's pretty clear it isn't it
the case that the API models that you're

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:50.660
the case that the API models that you're
 

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.590
the case that the API models that you're
putting up there would allow smaller

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:53.600
putting up there would allow smaller
 

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.720
putting up there would allow smaller
software packages that allowed sort of

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:55.730
software packages that allowed sort of
 

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.020
software packages that allowed sort of
downloading and preserving websites to

00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.030
downloading and preserving websites to
 

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.000
downloading and preserving websites to
be plugged in to other systems that

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.010
be plugged in to other systems that
 

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.980
be plugged in to other systems that
could then preserve them and provide

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:02.990
could then preserve them and provide
 

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.950
could then preserve them and provide
access to them so it could enable a more

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960
access to them so it could enable a more
 

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.520
access to them so it could enable a more
diverse approach to web archiving at the

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.530
diverse approach to web archiving at the
 

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.220
diverse approach to web archiving at the
lower level as well yes that's that's

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:12.230
lower level as well yes that's that's
 

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.870
lower level as well yes that's that's
the supposition that we're moving ahead

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880
the supposition that we're moving ahead
 

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.420
the supposition that we're moving ahead
on yes

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:16.430
 
 

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:23.740
 
but yeah I I agree but I think Stephen

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:23.750
but yeah I I agree but I think Stephen
 

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.300
but yeah I I agree but I think Stephen
brought up something that worrying me

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:25.310
brought up something that worrying me
 

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.140
brought up something that worrying me
and the Abby Smith rumsey stressed in

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:29.150
and the Abby Smith rumsey stressed in
 

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.070
and the Abby Smith rumsey stressed in
her talk at the IPC GA which is so

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:33.080
her talk at the IPC GA which is so
 

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.830
her talk at the IPC GA which is so
you're saying you want to concentrate on

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:35.840
you're saying you want to concentrate on
 

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.790
you're saying you want to concentrate on
high value-added activities for your

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800
high value-added activities for your
 

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.820
high value-added activities for your
community those high added value

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:41.830
community those high added value
 

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.400
community those high added value
activities are almost all concerned with

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:45.410
activities are almost all concerned with
 

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.090
activities are almost all concerned with
access and not with actually collecting

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:49.100
access and not with actually collecting
 

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.880
access and not with actually collecting
the stuff what looks like to me is that

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:51.890
the stuff what looks like to me is that
 

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.250
the stuff what looks like to me is that
what everybody wants is for the Internet

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.260

what everybody wants is for the Internet
Archive to collect everything and though

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:57.260
Archive to collect everything and though
 

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.840
Archive to collect everything and though
people would grab pieces of it and build

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:00.850
people would grab pieces of it and build
 

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.460
people would grab pieces of it and build
customized delivery systems on top of it

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:03.470
customized delivery systems on top of it
 

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.740
customized delivery systems on top of it
and the difficulty with that is what I

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:05.750
and the difficulty with that is what I
 

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.660
and the difficulty with that is what I
be was pointing out is that this is

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:07.670
be was pointing out is that this is
 

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.700
be was pointing out is that this is
building a monoculture situation and

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:09.710
building a monoculture situation and
 

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.520
building a monoculture situation and
this is defining what is archived able

this is defining what is archived able
 

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.920
this is defining what is archived able
as what the internet archive can get

as what the internet archive can get
 

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.870
as what the internet archive can get
their hands on and that's a very

their hands on and that's a very
 

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.240
their hands on and that's a very
dangerous path to be going down and that

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:22.250
dangerous path to be going down and that
 

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.550

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.690
to develop an architecture with many
different customized collection tools

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:00.700
different customized collection tools
 

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.040
different customized collection tools
coexisting behind in in one piece of

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.050
coexisting behind in in one piece of
 

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.720
coexisting behind in in one piece of
architecture and that involves defining

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:07.730
architecture and that involves defining
 

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.930
architecture and that involves defining
things like the collection proxy that

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:10.940
things like the collection proxy that
 

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.670
things like the collection proxy that
actually collects stuff and the

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680
actually collects stuff and the
 

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.090
actually collects stuff and the
management tools the target the

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:15.100
management tools the target the
 

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:19.120
management tools the target the
collectors and allow them to decide for

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.130
collectors and allow them to decide for
 

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.430
collectors and allow them to decide for
example that oh I found something on

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440
example that oh I found something on
 

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.110
example that oh I found something on
this site that leads this other

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:23.120
this site that leads this other
 

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.130
this site that leads this other
collector to go collect it and

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:26.140
collector to go collect it and
 

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.799
collector to go collect it and
it's that kind of plug and play

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:28.809
it's that kind of plug and play
 

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:30.420
it's that kind of plug and play
infrastructure for collection is very

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:30.430
infrastructure for collection is very
 

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.410
infrastructure for collection is very
important in avoiding the idea that the

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:34.420
important in avoiding the idea that the
 

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.750
important in avoiding the idea that the
only stuff we can preserve is stuff that

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760
only stuff we can preserve is stuff that
 

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.099
only stuff we can preserve is stuff that
era tricks can get its hands on well

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:41.109
era tricks can get its hands on well
 

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:43.470
era tricks can get its hands on well
we're we're we're certainly interested

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480
we're we're we're certainly interested
 

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.549
we're we're we're certainly interested
in added value discovery but we're also

00:38:47.549 --> 00:38:47.559
in added value discovery but we're also
 

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:49.319
in added value discovery but we're also
very much interested in added value

00:38:49.319 --> 00:38:49.329
very much interested in added value
 

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:53.120
very much interested in added value
capture we're very happy to to let

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.130
capture we're very happy to to let
 

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:58.019
capture we're very happy to to let
archive it be responsible for you know

00:38:58.019 --> 00:38:58.029
archive it be responsible for you know
 

00:38:58.029 --> 00:38:59.700
archive it be responsible for you know
the routine capture the heretics base

00:38:59.700 --> 00:38:59.710
the routine capture the heretics base
 

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.200
the routine capture the heretics base
capture but we know that that is missing

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.210
capture but we know that that is missing
 

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.089
capture but we know that that is missing
a lot of stuff that our curators are

00:39:06.089 --> 00:39:06.099
a lot of stuff that our curators are
 

00:39:06.099 --> 00:39:08.880
a lot of stuff that our curators are
interested in so having the ability to

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:08.890
interested in so having the ability to
 

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.890
interested in so having the ability to
have alternative capture mechanisms that

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:10.900
have alternative capture mechanisms that
 

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.730
have alternative capture mechanisms that
could then be injected into our common

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:14.740
could then be injected into our common
 

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.230
could then be injected into our common
archiving collections is something

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240
archiving collections is something
 

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.870
archiving collections is something
that's seems to be a very important

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880
that's seems to be a very important
 

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.490
that's seems to be a very important
aspect for us so this i think the slides

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:23.500
aspect for us so this i think the slides
 

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.750
aspect for us so this i think the slides
will be available so you'll be able to

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760
will be available so you'll be able to
 

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.549
will be available so you'll be able to
see the picture better because it's

00:39:26.549 --> 00:39:26.559
see the picture better because it's
 

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:29.700
see the picture better because it's
really hard to see i know so near the

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:29.710
really hard to see i know so near the
 

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.589
really hard to see i know so near the
top it has a module that's for

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599
top it has a module that's for
 

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:35.130
top it has a module that's for
alternative capture because you know in

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:35.140
alternative capture because you know in
 

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.680
alternative capture because you know in
our case we have content that can't we

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:37.690
our case we have content that can't we
 

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.960
our case we have content that can't we
have web archive content or websites

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:39.970
have web archive content or websites
 

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.819
have web archive content or websites
that have been given to us that we can't

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:41.829
that have been given to us that we can't
 

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:43.410
that have been given to us that we can't
integrate with the west rest because

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:43.420
integrate with the west rest because
 

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.079
integrate with the west rest because
they're in a completely different format

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:45.089
they're in a completely different format
 

00:39:45.089 --> 00:39:49.230
they're in a completely different format
and you probably have cases it with that

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240
and you probably have cases it with that
 

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.970
and you probably have cases it with that
same way people don't give you arcs or

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:50.980
same way people don't give you arcs or
 

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.650
same way people don't give you arcs or
works right I mean that's not what they

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:52.660
works right I mean that's not what they
 

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.839
works right I mean that's not what they
have they have other you know content

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:54.849
have they have other you know content
 

00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:57.509
have they have other you know content
and other formats so we definitely need

00:39:57.509 --> 00:39:57.519
and other formats so we definitely need
 

00:39:57.519 --> 00:40:00.150
and other formats so we definitely need
a variety of different ways to collect

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160
a variety of different ways to collect
 

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.999
a variety of different ways to collect
this content but the thing about this

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:03.009
this content but the thing about this
 

00:40:03.009 --> 00:40:06.930
this content but the thing about this
this model is it uses on the left and

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:06.940
this model is it uses on the left and
 

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.430
this model is it uses on the left and
the right it's actually using the same

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440
the right it's actually using the same
 

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.099
the right it's actually using the same
exact api's so it's saying that we what

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:11.109
exact api's so it's saying that we what
 

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:13.680
exact api's so it's saying that we what
we should work towards is having our

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:13.690
we should work towards is having our
 

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.559
we should work towards is having our
tools speak the same interfaces so that

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:16.569
tools speak the same interfaces so that
 

00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:18.630
tools speak the same interfaces so that
we can plug and play so that we can have

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640
we can plug and play so that we can have
 

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.730
we can plug and play so that we can have
the opportunity to do alternative

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:20.740
the opportunity to do alternative
 

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.299
the opportunity to do alternative
captures etc and so a lot of times when

00:40:24.299 --> 00:40:24.309
captures etc and so a lot of times when
 

00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:25.980
captures etc and so a lot of times when
we talk about this we do focus on the

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:25.990
we talk about this we do focus on the
 

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.079
we talk about this we do focus on the
access side because that is the side

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:28.089
access side because that is the side
 

00:40:28.089 --> 00:40:30.599
access side because that is the side
that you know does lead to new research

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:30.609
that you know does lead to new research
 

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:32.940
that you know does lead to new research
and has the biggest bang for your buck

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:32.950
and has the biggest bang for your buck
 

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.549
and has the biggest bang for your buck
but there's definitely interest

00:40:36.549 --> 00:40:36.559
but there's definitely interest
 

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:39.219
but there's definitely interest
I know within my institution in the

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:39.229
I know within my institution in the
 

00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:41.559
I know within my institution in the
preservation side as well in the

00:40:41.559 --> 00:40:41.569
preservation side as well in the
 

00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:46.269
preservation side as well in the
alternative capture as well a slightly

00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:46.279
alternative capture as well a slightly
 

00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:48.640
alternative capture as well a slightly
different topic of great concern and

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:48.650
different topic of great concern and
 

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.469
different topic of great concern and
that is you know one of the chief

00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:50.479
that is you know one of the chief
 

00:40:50.479 --> 00:40:54.459
that is you know one of the chief
barriers to use of web archives is the

00:40:54.459 --> 00:40:54.469
barriers to use of web archives is the
 

00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:56.289
barriers to use of web archives is the
creation of disparate different web

00:40:56.289 --> 00:40:56.299
creation of disparate different web
 

00:40:56.299 --> 00:40:58.539
creation of disparate different web
archives in different places and to tell

00:40:58.539 --> 00:40:58.549
archives in different places and to tell
 

00:40:58.549 --> 00:41:00.699
archives in different places and to tell
our researchers oh go to these seven

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:00.709
our researchers oh go to these seven
 

00:41:00.709 --> 00:41:02.769
our researchers oh go to these seven
places and maybe you'll find some useful

00:41:02.769 --> 00:41:02.779
places and maybe you'll find some useful
 

00:41:02.779 --> 00:41:04.779
places and maybe you'll find some useful
content and try to merge them and try to

00:41:04.779 --> 00:41:04.789
content and try to merge them and try to
 

00:41:04.789 --> 00:41:07.660
content and try to merge them and try to
do something with them think it's a big

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:07.670
do something with them think it's a big
 

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.549
do something with them think it's a big
challenge but we have to address this

00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:09.559
challenge but we have to address this
 

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:12.130
challenge but we have to address this
question of discovery and and the user

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:12.140
question of discovery and and the user
 

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.420
question of discovery and and the user
experience that we're trying to create

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:13.430
experience that we're trying to create
 

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.910
experience that we're trying to create
for historians and other users of this

content and Internet Archive has a great

00:41:19.269 --> 00:41:19.279
content and Internet Archive has a great
 

00:41:19.279 --> 00:41:21.099
content and Internet Archive has a great
value in that respect for being a

00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:21.109
value in that respect for being a
 

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:23.079
value in that respect for being a
consolidating place that people can do

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:23.089
consolidating place that people can do
 

00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:25.209
consolidating place that people can do
single searches but I'm interested in

00:41:25.209 --> 00:41:25.219
single searches but I'm interested in
 

00:41:25.219 --> 00:41:26.769
single searches but I'm interested in
whether the modeling that you've talked

00:41:26.769 --> 00:41:26.779
whether the modeling that you've talked
 

00:41:26.779 --> 00:41:28.839
whether the modeling that you've talked
about would help to address the broader

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:28.849
about would help to address the broader
 

00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:34.120
about would help to address the broader
discovery question as well it certainly

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:34.130
discovery question as well it certainly
 

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.969
discovery question as well it certainly
could I mean there's a there's a box for

00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:36.979
could I mean there's a there's a box for
 

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:43.479
could I mean there's a there's a box for
that and I know that well I don't speak

00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:43.489
that and I know that well I don't speak
 

00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:45.249
that and I know that well I don't speak
for Jefferson but the internet hive is

it certainly is interested in this they

00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:47.479
it certainly is interested in this they

it certainly is interested in this they
participated very fully in this effort

00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:49.809
participated very fully in this effort
 

00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:53.140
participated very fully in this effort
as a matter of fact you know there's

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.150
as a matter of fact you know there's
 

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.539
as a matter of fact you know there's
actually a subset of the institutions

00:41:55.539 --> 00:41:55.549
actually a subset of the institutions
 

00:41:55.549 --> 00:41:58.599
actually a subset of the institutions
that were involved on that failed I am

less proposal that have just put in a
 

00:42:00.529 --> 00:42:03.929
less proposal that have just put in a

and we can do that again but it's a lot
of work but it's a struggle to try to
