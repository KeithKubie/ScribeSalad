00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.080
So I think the first garment that I'd like
to talk about today is just a pair of Levi's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.600
511, which is our slim fit.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.410
One of our central, most popular fits.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.750
But this one's been put through what we call
the Wellthread process, which is an attempt

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.700
to develop a systems-based sustainability
strategy that reconsiders every point of the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.340
garment's lifecycle, understand its impacts,
and seeks to recalibrate and reduce the impact.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.239
All of that can be summed up rather easily
by saying it's a design methodology that allows

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.140
the designer just to do the right thing whenever
they have a choice.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.910
So it says simply, "These Levi's jeans were
designed for durability, a lifespan measured

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.080
not in years, but in decades.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.590
We designed them to be strong.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.180
The denim was made from extra-long staple
supima cotton grown in the U.S., one of the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.340
most durable cotton fabrics that we've ever
made.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.750
It was indigo dyed using a new system that
saves up to 70% of the water in the dying

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.480
process, that's compared with other conventional
processes.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.020
They were made with easily extractable metal
sundries for recyclability.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.180
These jeans were sewn in a facility where
we invest in workers through well-being programs

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.649
designed to benefit individuals as well as
their families and communities.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.560
These jeans represent responsible production.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.219
They are our purest expression of sustainability.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.049
This is a pair of Levi's jeans."

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.060
In the sustainability space, we often try
to reduce our marketing messages to, like,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.970
one word, you know, buzzy little tags or whatever.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.460
The fact of the matter is that there's a degree
of complexity to the science and a degree

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.079
of complexity to the systems design that goes
into this.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.069
A strategy that tries to communicate in a
friendly way that complexity, I think, is

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.069
essential.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.709
That we start respecting the complexity and
respecting the consumer in a way that we tell

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.820
the fuller story, so that we're not trying
to sell them on a one word tag.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.459
You take it out of the bag and it's a pair
of Levi's, and it's, in almost every way,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.479
consistent with what you'd expect.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.079
The only visual distinction is that what would
be a leather pouch on the back is cotton.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.759
And that cues you to the fact that every element
of this jean is actually cotton.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.829
A normal garment that...any garment that you're
wearing that you think is cotton, the thread

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:03.869
is not cotton.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.979
The labels likely aren't cotton, and the interfacing
used to stabilize the garment is not cotton.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.280
The zipper tapes aren't cotton.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.789
The pocket bags aren't cotton.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.380
They're all using synthetic materials to add
strength at certain spots.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.890
And that is just something that became normal
industry practice.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.750
You really need material purity for recycling
to be effective.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.790
Any polyester that would be present in the
garment, when you try to recycle it, is going

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.020
to show up as trash in the second generation
waste stream.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.060
That means if it was, you know, if it was
a polyester red tag, when you recycle it,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.510
there would be little flecks of red in that
recycled material.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.490
Well, because this entire garment is made
of cotton, when you break it down and garnate

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.800
it in the recycling process and extract color,
you can extract color fully.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.090
And so, this becomes a pure input into a recycling
system.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.150
Even more fundamental than the material components
being all cotton, this jean is made out of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.590
a fabric that came from a farm in California's
Central Valley, where the farmer had invested

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.070
in a special hybrid of cotton that is much
longer than any other cotton that's ever been

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.070
grown.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.890
It's the longest stable, supima cotton ever
grown.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.013
Now, that length allowed us to do a really
tight twist that we did just for, you know,

00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:14.660
for the sake of using supima, a superior cotton
quality that's softer.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.040
Turned out, that high twist value created
almost twice the strength of a normal pair

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040
of jeans.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.680
That a strategy that got us transparency into
the field and got us this quality of softness

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.000
without using softeners and eliminating chemistry,
also yielded tremendous strength value to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.890
the point when we did the abrasion testing,
we couldn't get a test to go far enough to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.890
actually break this.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.330
That this is, you know, I can't promise anything
but, nearly indestructible denim here.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.540
It can't be ripped apart.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.090
So, by pursuing a sustainability strategy
around labor transparency, we also unlocked

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.000
this tremendous value around extended durability.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.510
We then sent that special cotton...where we'd
visited the farm, we confirmed that the farmer

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.570
was using drip irrigation.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.740
We selected the exact cotton we wanted, we
had it sent to a very special mill.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.000
A mill that had a partnership with a chemistry
company that was experimenting in a new formulation

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.140
for low water dying.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.810
And we were able to come up with a way of
dying this indigo just as rich and dark as

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.910
any jean you'd ever seen from us, but using
about 75% less water at the mill level.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.449
Finding a farmer with really advanced irrigation
practices.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.660
Then we worked with a factory that knew how
to do some of our waterless finishing processes.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.700
We picked a factory that was also investing
concurrently in building a public water infrastructure

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.350
so that the people who are making this garment,
who had, you know, been suffering from poor

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.280
sanitation in their village, high rates of
dysentery at the factory.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.340
By helping the factory invest in the creation
of public water infrastructure, we were able

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.220
to lower rates of dysentery and improve the
general health of the whole community, not

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.800
just the people working in the factory, but
the community around the factory, so improving

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.840
the worker's whole lives.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.330
And for me, as a designer, that's the kind
of good work I'd like to be doing.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.050
And so, if I can create an arrangement of
materials and a specific design that forces

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.950
itself to be allocated to that one factory
that I know to be doing better work, then

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.400
I'm, in a way, promoting that work through
the design process.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.020
But at the end of the day, what you have is
simply a soft, long-wearing, useful pair of

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.630
jeans that fits as good as any other [pair]
that you would get from Levi's, but has this

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.370
whole complete story of both social value
creation and responsible community stewardship

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.490
behind it.
