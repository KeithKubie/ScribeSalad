00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:01.769
- [Voiceover] There's
a lot of different ways

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.301
that you could represent
a linear equation.

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.970
So for example, if you
had the linear equation

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.221
y is equal to 2x plus three,

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:11.788
that's one way to represent it,

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.749
but I could represent this in
an infinite number of ways.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.280
I could, let's see, I could

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.589
subtract 2x from both sides,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.420
I could write this as negative 2x plus y

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.987
is equal to three.

00:00:25.987 --> 00:00:29.615
I could manipulate it in
ways where I get it to,

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:31.403
and I'm gonna do it right now,

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:33.759
but this is another way of
writing that same thing.

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.683
y minus five is equal to
two times x minus one.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.518
You could actually simplify this

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:41.514
and you could get either
this equation here

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:43.337
or that equation up on top.

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.077
These are all equivalent,
you can get from one

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:48.893
to the other with logical
algebraic operations.

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.691
So there's an infinite number of ways

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.175
to represent a given linear equation,

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:56.033
but I what I wanna focus on in this video

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.633
is this representation in particular,

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:01.129
because this one is a
very useful representation

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.509
of a linear equation and
we'll see in future videos,

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.471
this one and this one can also be useful,

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:07.746
depending on what you are looking for,

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.255
but we're gonna focus on this one,

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.917
and this one right over
here is often called

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:13.377
slope-intercept form.

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:17.173
Slope-intercept form.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.508
And hopefully in a few minutes,

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:21.909
it will be obvious why it
called slop-intercept form.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.115
And before I explain that
to you, let's just try

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:25.869
to graph this thing.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.890
I'm gonna try to graph it,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.666
I'm just gonna plot some points here,

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.009
so x comma y, and I'm
gonna pick some x values

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.633
where it's easy to calculate the y values.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.198
So maybe the easiest is
if x is equal to zero.

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:40.159
If x is equal to zero, then
two times zero is zero,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.200
that term goes away, and
you're only left with this term

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.336
right over here, y is equal to three.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:48.854
Y is equal to three.

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:50.618
And so if we were to plot this.

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:54.658
Actually let me start plotting it, so

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:58.502
that is my y axis,

00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:03.098
and let me do the x axis, so

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:06.256
that can be my x, oh that's not

00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.100
as straight as I would like it.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.491
So that looks pretty good, alright.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.810
That is my x axis and let me mark off

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.304
some hash marks here,
so this is x equals one,

00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:22.938
x equals two, x equals three,

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:27.938
this is y equals one,

00:02:28.758 --> 00:02:32.242
y equals two, y equals three,

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:34.285
and obviously I could keep going

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:38.267
and keep going, this would be
y is equal to negative one,

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:41.401
this would be x is equal to negative one,

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.828
negative two, negative three,

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.707
so on and so forth.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.900
So this point right over
here, zero comma three,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.464
this is x is zero, y is three.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:55.518
Well, the point that represents
when x is equal to zero

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:57.885
and y equals three, this is,

00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:00.022
we're right on the y axis.

00:03:00.022 --> 00:03:01.868
If they have a line going
through it and this line

00:03:01.868 --> 00:03:05.083
contains this point, this is
going to be the y- intercept.

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:07.556
So one way to think about it,
the reason why this is called

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.156
slope-intercept form is it's very easy

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.246
to calculate the y-intercept.

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:13.849
The y-intercept here is going to happen

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.287
when it's written in this form,

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:17.284
it's going to happen
when x is equal to zero

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:18.573
and y is equal to three,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.836
it's gonna be this point right over here.

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:23.054
So it's very easy to
figure out the intercept,

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:25.724
the y-intercept from this form.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:27.083
Now you might be saying, well it says

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.882
slope-intercept form, it must also be easy

00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:31.019
to figure out the slope from this form.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.666
And if you made that conclusion,

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:33.781
you would be correct!

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:35.917
And we're about to see
that in a few seconds.

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.124
So let's plot some more points here

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:39.585
and I'm just gonna keep
increasing x by one.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:42.499
So if you increase x by
one, so we could write

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.901
that our delta x, our change
in x, delta Greek letter,

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.955
this triangle is a Greek letter, delta,

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:49.256
represents change in.

00:03:49.256 --> 00:03:51.403
Change in x here is one.

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:53.539
We just increased x by
one, what's gonna be

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.966
our corresponding change in y?

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.161
What's going to be our change in y?

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:00.261
So let's see, when x is equal to one,

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:03.442
we have two times one, plus three

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:06.054
is going to be five.

00:04:06.054 --> 00:04:08.840
So our change in y is going to be two.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.979
Let's do that again.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.219
Let's increase our x by one.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.795
Change in x is equal to one.

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:16.956
So then if we're gonna increase by one,

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.092
we're gonna go from x equals one

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.497
to x equals two.

00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:21.761
Well what's our corresponding change in y?

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.933
Well when x is equal to two,

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:27.577
two times two is four,
plus three is seven.

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:31.931
Well our change in y, our
change in y is equal to two.

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:32.930
Went from five-

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.705
when x went from one to two,

00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:37.247
y went from five to seven.

00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:39.244
So for every one that we increase x,

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.729
y is increasing by two.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.535
So for this linear
equation, our change in y

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:49.971
over change in x is always going to be,

00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:53.070
our change in y is two when
our change in x is one,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.487
or it's equal to two,

00:04:54.487 --> 00:04:57.251
or we could say that our
slope is equal to two.

00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.096
Well let's just graph this to make sure

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:01.232
that we understand this.

00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:03.855
So when x equals one, y is equal to five.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.653
And actually we're gonna
have to graph five up here.

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:09.033
So when x is equal to one, y is equal to,

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:11.146
and actually this is a little bit higher,

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:13.410
this, let me clean this up a little bit.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.291
So this one would be,

00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.567
erase that a little bit.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.774
Just like that.

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:21.595
So that's y is equal to four,

00:05:21.595 --> 00:05:24.229
and this is y is equal to five.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.933
So when x is one, y is equal to five,

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.871
so it's that point right over there.

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:32.576
So our line is going to look-

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:34.666
you only need two points to define a line,

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.732
our line is going to like,

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:40.586
let me do this in this
color right over here.

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:44.034
Our line is going to look like,

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:46.636
is going to look,

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:49.409
is going to look something like,

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.288
is going to look, let me see if I can,

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:53.751
I didn't draw it completely at scale,

00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:56.212
but it's going to look
something like this.

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:58.650
This is the line, this is the line,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.808
y is equal to 2x plus three.

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:03.967
But we already figured out
that its slope is equal to two,

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:07.067
when our change in x is one,

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:11.444
when our change in x is
one, our change in y is two.

00:06:11.444 --> 00:06:13.626
If our change in x was negative one,

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:15.844
if our change in x was negative one,

00:06:15.844 --> 00:06:19.593
our change in y is negative two.

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:22.309
And you can see that,
if from zero we went,

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.467
we went down one, if we
went to negative one,

00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:26.976
then what's our y going to be?

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:29.948
Two times negative one is

00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:32.596
negative two plus three is one.

00:06:32.596 --> 00:06:36.554
So we see that, the point
negative one comma one

00:06:36.554 --> 00:06:38.957
is on the line as well.

00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:41.708
So the slope here, our
change in y over change in x,

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.134
if we're going from between any two points

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:47.606
on this line, is always going to be two.

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.671
But where do you see two
in this original equation?

00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:53.086
Well you see the two right over here.

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:55.186
And when you write something
in slop-intercept form,

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:56.870
where you explicitly solve for y,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.549
y is equal to some constant
times x to the first power

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:04.566
plus some other constant,
the second one is going

00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:07.573
to be your intercept, your y-intercept,

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:09.286
or it's going to be a way to
figure out the y-intercept,

00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:11.601
the intercept itself is this
point, the point at which

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.261
the line intercepts the y axis,

00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:17.545
and then this two is going
to represent your slope.

00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:19.205
And that makes sense because
every time you increase

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:22.061
x by one, you're gonna
multiply that by two,

00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:25.544
so you're gonna increase y by two.

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:28.378
So this is just a, kinda
of a get your feet wet

00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:29.945
with the idea of slope-intercept form,

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:33.403
but you'll see, at least for
me, this is the easiest form

00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:35.377
for me to think about what the graph

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:36.782
of something looks like,

00:07:36.782 --> 00:07:38.395
because if you were given another,

00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:40.740
if you were given another linear equation,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.456
let's say y is equal to negative x,

00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:46.778
negative x plus two.

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:48.623
Well immediately you say, okay look,

00:07:48.623 --> 00:07:51.107
my yintercept is going to be the point

00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:55.089
zero comma two, so I'm
gonna intersect the y axis

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.724
right at that point, and
then I have a slope of,

00:07:57.724 --> 00:08:00.302
the coefficient here is
really just negative one,

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:02.333
so I have a slope of negative one.

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.203
So as we increase x by one, we're gonna

00:08:04.203 --> 00:08:06.641
decrease y by one.

00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:10.076
Increase x by one, you're
gonna decrease y by one.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:13.874
If you increase x by two,
you're gonna decrease y by two.

00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:16.438
And so our line is gonna
look something like this.

00:08:16.438 --> 00:08:19.433
Let me see if I can draw
it relatively neatly.

00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:21.616
It's going to look something,

00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:25.017
I think I can do a little
bit better than that.

00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:27.677
It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn.

00:08:27.677 --> 00:08:30.891
It's not ideal, but I think you get,

00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:32.819
you get the point.

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:34.409
It's gonna look something like that.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.208
So from slope-intercept form,

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:38.740
very easy to figure out
what the y-intercept is,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.038
and very easy to figure out the slope.

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:45.044
The slope here, slope
here is negative one.

00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:46.925
That's this negative one right over here,

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:50.662
and the y-intercept, y-intercept

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:54.040
is the point zero comma two,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.408
very easy to figure out 'cus essentially

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.771
that gave you the information right there.
