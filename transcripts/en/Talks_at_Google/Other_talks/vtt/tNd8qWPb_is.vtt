00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thanks for comin' today.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.950
Appreciate it.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:14.219
This is, again, another, I think, very powerful
session in terms of our inaugural At Google

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.570
Talks speaking series.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.870
It's a perfect movie day.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.390
So it seems highly appropriate to have a man
who revolutionized the theater experience

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.080
join us this morning.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.180
From my seat at least, the Alamo Drafthouse
took a concept that we all accepted as good

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.770
enough and reinvented it so that it made everything
else at that point seem obsolete.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.469
Sound familiar?

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.089
Maybe like Apple or Google?

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.199
Gmail or Maps or Offers or Apps?

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.780
So if a good movie starts with a good script,
then let me offer the following scene.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.909
The desert spit a dry wind.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:49.909
The sun set.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:50.909
A star fell.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.429
Somewhere in the hills, a curtain rose, and
on the screen it read "Once upon a time, a

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.879
movie palace died.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.190
And decayed into a square, stale and routine
annoyance devoid of the joy your parents felt.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.710
Mesmerized under a flickering light.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.979
With sweaty palms and the sticky sweetness
of fountain soda through a squeaking straw.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.250
Then a stranger appeared.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.100
He looked at the audience and said 'No. no
more compromises.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.710
No interference.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.200
Just purity of essence.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200
And maybe some beer.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
Nachos.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.710
T-shirts in the lobby.'"

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.070
I welcome that man to the house today.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.010
The man who dreamt, drafted, and directed,
a rebirth in the theater experience.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.049
Tim League.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.159
The Alamo Drafthouse.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.460
&gt;&gt;Tim: Hey!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.420
[cheers and applause]

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.210
&gt;&gt;Tim: I'm sorry if I slouch.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.770
I have kind of bad posture.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.109
My dad has bad posture.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.109
It's genetic.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.109
So just pretend like I'm standing straight.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.840
'Cause eventually I'm gonna slump forward
a little bit.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.900
So anyway, I think, one of, I'm feeding back
a little bit.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.020
Should I?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.130
[microphone noises]

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.081
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Volume a little bit?

00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.081
&gt;&gt;Tim: There.

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:00.081
Is that OK?

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.081
Hey, that's me.

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:02.081
That's me and my wife.

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:07.170
So, I guess I'm gonna start just by talking
a bit about the origin of Alamo Drafthouse

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.910
Cinema.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.040
And actually, so it starts a few years before
this picture.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.940
This picture was taken during Week one of
construction in 1996 when we were building

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.730
our first theater on Colorado Street here
in town.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.379
We were 26 years old and we had just moved
to town.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.319
But I wanna back up a little bit and talk
about what brought me to the path of opening

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.569
up a movie theater with my wife.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.569
And not wearing a shirt.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.420
I should probably have a more respectable
slide to start things off.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.420
[laughter]

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.319
But, I think it starts off when I was actually
in high school.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.120
I think a lot of people that are probably
in this room had the same situation.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.410
Where you're good in math, or you're good
in science, and then you take a certain career

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.799
path.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.760
And it puts you into an engineering, comp
sci, technical background.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.590
Without any really forethought.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.960
And what it did for me was that, it set me
on a career path that I hadn't thought about

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960
it.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.340
It set me the first step of moving into a
career that I could have possibly retired

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.230
from without any forethought whatsoever.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.370
So go ahead and cue the next slide.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.730
I ended up taking a job with Shell Oil.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.150
Out of college.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.470
I got a mechanical engineering degree at Rice
University.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.360
Again, just, high school math.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
Yeah.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
Hey.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.379
Go Owls.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.680
[laughter]

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.319
And so I worked as a facilities engineer which
meant I was three days out in the field doing

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.620
maximization, optimization of oil field equipment
from pump to pipeline.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.070
That was my role for an oil field in Los Angeles.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.070
Southern Los Angeles.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.070
In Yorba Linda actually.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.510
Home of Richard Milhous Nixon.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.530
For those who are fans of the man.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.910
[one audience member claps]

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.120
And the first day that I got onto the job
at Shell, I went through my employee training.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.530
They gave me the handbook.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.959
And they said "OK, you're about ready to work.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:08.959
But one more thing.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.409
You gotta go down to the basement and pick
up your art."

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.409
And I said "Oh, OK.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.560
I don't even know what that statement means."

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.220
So I went to the basement and they had this
vast warehouse of about 5,000 oil paintings

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.690
of either landscapes or oil derricks.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.730
I think that way, or flowers.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.810
Flowers, oil derricks, or landscapes.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.210
And so you're supposed to pick out the three
that you liked best for the three walls that

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.660
didn't have a window.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.200
And that was how you decorated your office.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.160
And that's how everybody decorated their office.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.250
And that was such a alien and disturbing concept
to me that I knew right there that I somehow,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.669
when I was back in high school and scored
well in math that I had made some sort of

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.420
catastrophic error in judgment.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.919
To land me at this spot.

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.260
So I opted for an exit strategy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.970
I worked at Shell for a couple years.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.120
Never stopped living like a student.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.740
So I just amassed every dime that I made and
I knew that I was gonna do something else.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.610
I wasn't exactly sure what I was gonna do.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.930
So go to the next slide.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.000
So on my way to work, was this 1947 single
screen art deco theater.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.300
And one day I saw a "for lease" sign, and
I was on my way to work.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.140
So, "For Lease" sign and then over the weekend
had a casual conversation with a couple friends

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.630
over some beers at a bar.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.310
And then on Monday I went ahead and signed
the lease to open up the Tejon Theater.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.960
With really, it's a completely, it's a decisions
that I made, I was 23 years old at the time.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.430
And it was a decision of a 23 year old.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.770
I was stupid.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.770
And I completely inexperienced and way, way,
way out of my depth to try to do something

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.770
like this.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.520
But, you know, I think about it now and I
don't think it's actually that much of a mistake,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520
in a way.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.930
Because I did go through the analysis of OK,
worst case scenario, what's going to happen.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.300
Worst case scenario is, I can go back to my
job.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.479
I can find another job with another oil company
or another engineering form.

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.430
I'll lose the 50,000 dollars or so that I
had amassed at that point.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.530
So no harm, no foul.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.890
I was completely unencumbered.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.930
Didn't have any family.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.330
Just had a girlfriend who thought the idea
was absolutely stupid.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.330
[laughter]

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.820
So, go ahead and go to the next slide.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.990
Arrogance and ignorance.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.990
Yes.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.410
So that's sort of how I define those days
in Bakersfield.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.810
So not only was that, it was actually a beautiful
theater on the inside, but it had been abandoned

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.990
for a number of years.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.740
It was in Bakersfield.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.490
Is anybody from Bakersfield?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.490
Or driven?

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.570
Filled up gas in Bakersfield?

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.160
That's right, we had talked about that.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yes.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.759
&gt;&gt;Tim: So let's talk about, top 20 markets
that you would open up your first movie theater

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:55.759
in.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.479
Would Bakersfield come to mind?

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.840
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Bakersfield sucks.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840
&gt;&gt;Tim: Yeah.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.840
[laughter]

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's where I was born
and raised.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080
[laughter]

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.780
&gt;&gt;Tim: we did actually reminisce about some
of our favorite things about Bakersfield.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.889
I think both of us could show everybody in
this room a tremendous weekend in Bakersfield.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.900
But then, we would have shot it.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.660
There's no, that's what you got.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.820
Bakersfield's a good weekend time.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.820
But.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.020
But it was on the wrong side of the tracks
in Bakersfield also.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.349
There were literally railroad tracks that
divided the affluent and the poor side of

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:26.349
Bakersfield.

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:28.629
And being 23 years old at the time.

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:29.990
And having a lot more hair.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.639
That's me on the whatever that is, the right.

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:39.210
I said it doesn't matter if we put on a great
show, then the people are going to come and

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.950
they're going to overcome their prejudices
and not worry about where they're going.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.030
That was a complete, that was a fallacy.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.759
It just didn't work out that way.

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.580
So we opened up as a, it was a 1,000 seat
theater.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.510
So we took out half of the seats and opened
up as a art house theater.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.080
And most days we were hoping that nobody would
show up so that we could have a night off.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.800
But ultimately, like one or two people.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.050
One conscious decision would come and buy
the five dollar, seven dollar movie ticket,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.319
would come and sort of screw up our plans
to get out of the theater.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:18.449
So we ran this place for two years.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.400
And it was a tremendous struggle.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.940
And, it was actually kind of depressing, too.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.229
Because we never left the building.

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:28.300
We didn't have enough money to live anywhere
else.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.440
So we just built pretty much the most depressing
and squalid bedroom

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440
[laughter]

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.010
Behind the screen of the movie theater.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.970
So there's no windows.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.370
And then sort of [laughs].

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.370
Yeah.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.520
It was terrible.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.020
And then insult to injury, the only thing
that ever worked for us is we did live music

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.360
as well.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.680
'Cause it was a very big facility.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.560
But the only room that was suitable for a
"Green Room" for the band was our bedroom.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560
[laughter]

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.510
So, you now, we'd have mostly punk and metal
shows come through town.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.250
And you know, they wanna just live up to the
lifestyle somehow.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.650
So the thing that they do is sort of just
semi trash our bedroom.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.650
[laughter]

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.670
So we'd, you know, spend the night, 'cause
we didn't really have any staff.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.390
We'd spend the night cleaning the theater.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.390
And we'd come back.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.510
We'd come back to this "Green Room" that smelled
like, I don't know what.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.210
Hookers, and drugs and certainly alcohol.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.520
So that was our life for a couple of years.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.510
The way we ran it was, it was just the two
of us.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.510
It was, well, it was eventually my wife.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.910
My girlfriend was working in San Francisco.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.360
She was a molecular biology researcher.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.960
And also followed the science path.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.570
And so I started this theater.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.780
And after a month it was plain and simple
that I was so over my head that I needed help.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:49.830
So I begged her to quit her job and come down
and salvage what we could out of this enterprise.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:56.870
And you know, my parents were sort of pissed
off about my decision to do what I had done.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.090
And her parents were I think, exponentially
pissed off about her decision.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.090
[laughter]

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:08.600
So we had both thrown away an expensive Rice
University education and decided to do a completely

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.060
trivial and possibly hopeless exercise.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.150
But she did it.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.150
She quit her job.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.150
She moved down.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.340
And she actually did save the theater.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.060
She got things in order.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.610
And so the two of us would be behind the concessions
counter.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.710
She would be selling tickets and I would be
serving popcorn and whatever.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.410
And then when it came movie time, I would
run upstairs, start the movie, and then run

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.410
back downstairs and help sell popcorn.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.410
But.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.680
Thankfully there was no customers so that
system worked out.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
[laughter]

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.000
Really, really well for a while.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.040
So you know, one of the lessons there was
this importance of the location.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.540
It's such a cliché when talking about business.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.540
But.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.610
It really, really is true.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.610
So.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.290
We knew, we knew at a certain point that we
wanted to, this was untenable.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.520
We couldn't stay at the Tejon.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.950
That we had to go someplace else.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.360
And we knew when we went someplace else we
wanted to find just the right location.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
So.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.800
Go ahead to the next one.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.920
Yeah, I mentioned that we did, the movies
really they did not work for us.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.770
It really literally was two to ten people
for every screening.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.510
We would only pay the bare minimum to the
film distributors.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.960
But we did have success with concerts.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.380
This is a shot from the second to last Ramones
tour.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.080
So we were able to just 'cause there was no
other big venue that wanted to book that kind

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.530
of show, we were able to book lots of things
like this.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.740
So, Tool.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.950
The Ramones.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.170
Pennywise played.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.620
Los Lobos even played.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.490
So that's the money that we amassed to get
out of Bakersfield.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.940
Go to the next slide.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.801
So this, yeah, I don't know, some people probably
still remember this.

00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:58.150
This is like the seminal classic of the modern
era was Montell Jordan's "This is How We Do

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.150
It."

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.150
[laughter]

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.150
Does everybody remember that song?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.150
It's good.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.150
It's good.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.000
If this were a better presentation we could
all listen to the music video now.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
But it's not.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.029
We just have to imagine it in our head.

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:14.430
So this was, in fact, the last straw that
took us out of Bakersfield.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.020
So we agreed to do a concert with Montell
Jordan.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.750
And it was right when that album hit.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.290
Right when he was at the peak of his 15 minutes.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.950
And I mean it's, it was such a lame concert.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.660
Because he only really had about seven songs
so the concert was, about 40 minutes long,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.930
45 minutes long.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.002
And he played "This is How We Do It" twice.

00:12:34.002 --> 00:12:37.170
[laughter] It was in the middle of the set,
and then it was the encore.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.640
It was like, oh man.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:46.920
So, but, the unfortunate thing that happened
that night is there was some sort of lover's

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.800
quarrel after the show.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.210
And somebody was driving away, and the one
of the members of that love triangle pulled

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.550
out a gun and shot the guy that was driving
away.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.250
So he shot him and killed him.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.270
And his car wrecked into our ticket booth.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:08.930
So the next morning front page of the paper
was this car, our ticket booth, our marquees.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.840
It was like, again, disproving the no such
thing as bad press.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.300
It was like the worst conceivable press when
we were struggling to convince people that

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.520
it was safe to come over.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.750
To cross the tracks and enjoy a nice movie.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.310
Then we just knew we were already struggling.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.510
This, we were not gonna be able to overcome
this.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.350
So we packed everything we had.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:42.100
We took the projectors, the screen, the speakers,
200 chairs, the everything.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.100
Everything we could.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.380
And we put it in a truck and we came to Austin.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.380
So that's.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.890
And that's, I guess I've got two slides where
I'm not wearing a shirt.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.920
At least that one's small.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920
[laughter]

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.560
So, we came to Austin in 1996.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.260
To start over again.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.800
Lot of things we had done at Bakersfield were
the origins for what we were gonna try to

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.910
do at the Austin location.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.690
And but, we were aiming a little bigger.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.070
But the problem is, we didn't have any money.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.490
We had about 50 to 60 thousand dollars that
we had pulled out of two years of hard scrabble

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.680
work in Bakersfield.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.330
And that's not nearly enough.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.970
So this is our first pace which is at 409
Colorado.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.430
As you can see.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.510
That's week one.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.590
Where my wife is actually pulling out nails
from the wood that we salvage out of the building

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.040
so that we could reuse it into the building.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.670
That kind of level of bootstrapping.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.690
So we assembled money.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.670
We did this through a couple of ways.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.060
One, my wife's parents now, now wife, I made
good.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.390
[claps] I, she was no longer my girlfriend.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.390
Now my wife.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.250
Her parents were still very skeptical about
the idea since we had failed miserably and

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.530
then start it again.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.930
But they actually agreed to mortgage their
house for us.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:05.480
So they gave us 125,000 dollars from a mortgage
from their house.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.510
My parents did the same.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.510
Sort of.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.440
They got us about 50,000 dollars.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.350
Did the stereotypical credit card loans.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.790
So we got about 70 grand from a variety of
credit cards taken out on the same day.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.790
[laughter]

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.301
And, I don't know if you can still do that.

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.930
That was a great trick back in the '90s.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:25.930
[laughter]

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.930
So.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.920
Back when you had to mail in your credit application.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.970
And then the last one I think is the funniest
bit.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.730
We got another 50,000 dollars from Bank of
America.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.470
But we were so not a good credit risk.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.220
We could not get a loan under any sort of
normal circumstances.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.410
But that year and that year alone in the history
of Bank of America, they had this thing called

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.480
"Invest in America" loan.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.610
Which was a 50,000 dollar small business start
up.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.700
One page form.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.500
You just signed it and you basically got approval
that day from the bank.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.860
And so we got 50,000 dollars from Bank of
America.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.330
But apparently we were of the five percent
that paid back that loan.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.330
At any time.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.233
So it was a tremendously abused loan that
will never be seen again for Bank of America.

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:12.350
But anyway, that's what we got.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.170
We had about 275,000 dollars.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.270
And in that space, Karrie and I built it ourselves.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.370
We had one guy that helped us with some of
the more complicated things and things that

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.370
we weren't allowed.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.530
Like setting the air conditioning units.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.360
And getting the plumbing inspections.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.280
We did a lot of the rough plumbing and the
rough electrical.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.720
But we did everything else ourselves.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.450
So it was new electrical.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.240
New utility service in the alley.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.240
Built the kitchen.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.240
Built the restrooms.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240
Built the risers.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240
Built the projector room.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.910
All for about 200,000 dollars.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.480
Which, I don't know how that, I don't know,
it's inconceivable to me, this day.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.260
We did a minor renovation of the lobby at
Village recently.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.190
That cost 300,000 dollars.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.630
So I don't.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.080
it was nothing.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080
So I don't know.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.840
We really, really, really scraped.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.240
And did all of the work ourselves.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.470
The problem there, though, is it left us,
end of the day, we had about 25,000 dollars

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.470
for working capital to start the business.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.860
Which, if the business had failed, in the
first month, then it would have, we wouldn't

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.650
have known what to do.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.670
We would have been crying back to our parents
again.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.150
To invest bad money after, good money after
bad.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.220
So we'll go ahead and go to the next slide.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.940
So, that's the, I guess there's a little bit
of a segue here.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.890
[laughter] but that's the origin of the Alamo.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.600
And how we got to the first location.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.400
And I do think that one of the, when I'm talking
to people that are entrepreneurs, people who

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.270
are thinking about doing their own business.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:49.580
What I mentioned earlier about really doing
a hard assessment of what is the worst case

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.580
scenario and can you be comfortable with the
worst case scenario is a very valuable exercise.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.430
And I think even when we were doing the theater
in Austin, not just the Bakersfield theater.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.500
We did that exercise again.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.860
And we knew that we were taking this money
from our parents.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.390
But we had assured them that if this time
it didn't work, that we would go back into

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:14.820
engineering, research, and work out a payment
plan and get them their money back.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.450
So even then it really wasn't the end of the
world.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.900
But we felt like it was worth it to risk it.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:26.480
Because by that hard scrabble work for two
years and ultimately failing in Bakersfield,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
we learned a lot of things.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.830
We learned how to be very, very frugal.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.390
We knew exactly where every dime was in our
organization.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.510
And we learned how to just do things ourselves.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.330
And find a cheaper alternate route.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.220
Ultimately, obviously, we've grown in size.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.240
We now have ten locations.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.440
We've got two under construction.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.980
We do have plans to open in some other cities.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.190
We should be making an announcement about
New York and San Francisco soon.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.420
Relatively soon.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.650
We have spots identified.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.970
And hopefully within, by the first couple
weeks in January we can make that public.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:12.050
The idea is just to sort of grow the concept
and experience of what we've been trying to

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.050
do here in Austin.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.050
To other cities that don't have it.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.610
I guess I'll go into what I think some of
the.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.780
"Core values" is one of those terms.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:20.780
Like mission statement.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.100
Where some people sort of frown on it.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.650
And I, uh, well we went through an exercise
to go through it.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:34.380
And I've become comfortable with what previously
might have been sort of a questionable idea.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.120
Those words sometimes, you know they still
actually sort of prickle a little bit at the

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120
base of my spine.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.780
But I do think it's really, really important
to know you know, who you are or why you're

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.990
doing what you're doing.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.270
And what's important to you.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.340
So we went through a process and came up with
I think some core values.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.230
So I'm gonna cycle through some of those real
quick.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.980
[pause as he shows the slides]

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.350
Here we go.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.190
Ah, there we go.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.190
Fun Experts.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.840
This is Zack Carlson who works for us.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.420
And I'm not sure what it is.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.639
I hope that that's not a baby.

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:12.200
I don't know what that is [laughter] I don't
know.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.470
Let's just pretend it's a piece of meat.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.240
Anyway, but that's Zack Carlson.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.530
So he's one of the guys that has joined the
programming department at the Alamo.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:28.560
And, the way he came to the company is, he
volunteered to because he was such a movie

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.540
fan to join us on our nationwide outdoor movie
screening tour.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.090
He has worked at a video store.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.160
Scarecrow Video up in Seattle.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.310
Which is the biggest video store in the world.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.740
It employs a lot of obsessive compulsives
like Zack.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.940
[laughter]

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:51.980
And recently he actually published a book
called "Destroy All Movies" which is a compendium

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:57.950
of every single appearance of a punk rock
character in cinema from 1978 to 1990.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.450
It's 5,000 reviews of movies.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.320
With in depth interviews with the Titans of
punk rock on film.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.050
So he's a guy that, there is no other job
for him.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.600
He has to be programming at the Alamo Drafthouse.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.970
Because there's no other life skills that
he's got other than

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.970
[laughter]

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:23.820
the, just the sheer unadulterated joy and
love of kinda weird cinema.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.910
So, we have a programming, creative office
of about 15 people.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.700
A lot of them, they're not necessarily like
Zack.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.910
But I think we try to hire obsessive movie
fans.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.340
Oh, before I talk about my mom.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.820
That's my mom.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.920
The Fun Experts.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.210
I wanna explain what that meant.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.270
We do a, a eight day film festival in the
fall.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.770
Of horror, science fiction movies called Fantastic
Fest.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.220
We had a Spanish filmmaker.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.300
Not even a native speaker come up to me and
he's been at the festival every year since

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.940
his first feature debuted in 2007.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.300
He's come back to the festival just as a fan
every year since.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.560
He said "Tim, I've figured it out.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.550
You guys are experts in the under-appreciated
art of having fun."

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:15.190
So I was like, you know what, I'm gonna turn
that into a slide in a PowerPoint presentation.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.420
Alright, on to my mom.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.150
So this is my mom.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.930
And it's the slide is actually perfectly positioned.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.470
She's just staring at me, right.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.470
Maybe not judging me.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.720
Maybe a little judging me.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.130
I'm not sure.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.900
But I use my mom as a barometer.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.090
Like a lot of people misunderstand the identity
of the Alamo.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.980
And thing that it's just a, sometimes it'
s just a cult movie place.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.710
Or that's what we're all about.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.660
But I, for me, it's, the idea of inclusivity.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.390
I want my mom to be comfortable every time
she comes to the theater.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:53.040
So it means, death metal shouldn't be playing
on the radio at the box office.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.490
And even if our staff has more tattoos and
piercings than she's normally used to, they

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.840
should also have a smile and be really nice
and friendly to her.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840
That's just in general.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:10.250
She's me, she's my sort of rudder in making
sure the business is still on track in that

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.250
regard.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:19.040
We also, we're, I guess, always trying to
do something a little bit better.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.720
This is a guy we just recently brought on.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720
Bill Norris.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.330
He's sort of the Austin celebrity bartender.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.890
But he's now the Director of Beverage for
Alamo Drafthouse.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:33.540
He was reaching a point in his career where
he's, like myself, early 40s. but he was closing

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.730
down bars at two o'clock in the morning.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.240
But I think I caught him at a good time.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.850
Where he was just weary at where he was.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.900
He's built a great reputation for being exceptional.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.890
He hates the word mixologist.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.890
Bartender.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.740
And was ready to take a new step.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.781
So he came on with us and his job now is just
to make sure that every beverage that we serve

00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:59.750
is awesome and he also runs the cocktail program
at Highball.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:05.650
And we're opening up a tequila bar as part
of our new Slaughter Lane down on South Mopac.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.200
And a couple other things for us.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.390
But I think the idea is that where we recognize,
well maybe we're not doing this quite well

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.390
enough.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.400
Or there's other people that impress us.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:23.710
So we want to always try to surpass them by
bringing in people and lending focus to areas

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.630
where there's room for improvement.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.440
'Cause there's always room for improvement.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.480
As you guys know at Google, everything changes
in the technology side of things just way

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480
too fast.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.840
And we have to, we feel like we have to stay
on top of the curve.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.390
I'm sure that you guys had that pressing desire
to stay on top of the curve as well.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.210
Or maybe you're just setting the curve I don't
know.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.210
Whatever.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.210
But anyway.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.210
So.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.460
Oh, go ahead and go to the next one.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.650
I was struggling for a picture when I was
putting this together.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:55.680
I actually, I'm gonna go ahead and brave it
and say that I don't like Stevie Ray Vaughn.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.210
I sometimes, I should stop saying it because
most of the time it creates awkwardness because

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.140
he's such an iconic figure in this town.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.140
But anyway.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.400
He is an iconic figure in this town.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.700
But that has nothing to do with what our aspect
of community is.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.710
We like to think, do you have a question about
Stevie Ray Vaughn?

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.520
[audience member speaks off mic]

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.210
&gt;&gt;Tim: I do.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.240
I do like that building.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.610
Our law firm is there.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:30.550
But I like it because every time I go up there
it reminds me of that "My Neighbor Totoro",

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.630
that Miyazaki movie.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.720
I don't know.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720
So.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.290
I think it's the most beautiful mov-, uh,
building, in downtown.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.640
So, sure, I'm a fan.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640
Alright.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.400
I'll crop out Stevie Ray and I'll just put

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400
[laughter]

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.020
The tower.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:51.600
So, we like to think of ourselves as a neighborhood
movie theater.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.860
And I think it happened inadvertently when
we weren't thinking about it . when it was

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.000
just, when we literally were a mom and pop
theater back in Bakersfield and the 409 Colorado

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
space.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.520
It was my wife and I. we were there every
day.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.740
We did the same thing we were doing in Bakersfield.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.702
But we had a small staff.

00:26:11.702 --> 00:26:13.620
But we knew all of our regular customers.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.590
We introduced the shows personally.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.830
We answered our customer feedback personally.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.090
And I think that just sorta set the tone.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:26.400
And now as we're expanding we're trying to
make sure that that never gets lost.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.809
Both the idea of giving back to the community,
of being available to the community for nonprofit

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:32.809
events and fundraisers.

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:39.980
But then also having the sense that we are
a part of and responsible to the neighborhood

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.940
that's immediately around us.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.910
And then, the last one.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.190
Is, that we wanna be credible.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.100
And I bring this up, not that like this gang
of dudes is not credible.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.190
But.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:59.520
There was a period in time where I had stepped
away from the Alamo Drafthouse to a certain

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520
extent.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.690
We had started a franchise company.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.190
But really had no concept of what that meant
and what the obligations to the people that

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:13.140
we were working with in a franchise relationship,
what that was.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.730
So we were again, in over our head.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.720
So we decided to ostensibly sell the business.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.510
So back about six years ago we sold Alamo
Drafthouse.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.840
But retained ownership of the theaters in
the town.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840
The Village.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840
South Lamar.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840
And the Downtown Theater.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.740
And just focused our energies on those theaters.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.700
And that's when we really got a sense of what
the brand was and some of our specialty programming

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.320
really grew in those years.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.830
And that's when we started the festival.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.860
At the same time, that other company was developing
other locations.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.690
And our vision was starting to spread.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.380
Like there was an Alamo Drafthouse that we
shepherded that was this.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.170
There was an Alamo Drafthouse that we didn't
have any involvement with, this.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.500
We were both, just fighting.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.080
And it became worse and worse and worse and
worse.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.960
And then ultimately we both realized that
the best thing to do would be to shake hands,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.520
settle our differences, and smash everything
back together.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.240
So there was one vision, one brand, one identity.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.309
And that's, that happened about a year and
three months ago.

00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:17.110
And it's been actually great.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.360
But I bring up this slide.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.240
And I probably can't do this in any internal
Alamo talks along this.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.080
I'll have to change the slide out.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.730
But one of the things that drove me crazy
during that period was this issue of credibility.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.170
Whereas we had invested in guys like Zack
Carlson and really hardcore obsessive movie

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.690
guys, the other locations had not.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.770
And so it was evident in some of the programming.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:43.290
And this is the one that was almost like that
last straw for me.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.670
There was an event that we'd been doing for
years and years and years.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.110
Called Spaghetti Western, Spaghetti Feast.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.490
Where classic spaghetti westerns, with all
you can eat spaghetti.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.320
Very simple, very silly concept.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320
But it always worked.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.120
At least for the non-obscure spaghetti westerns.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:05.990
So, it was one of the outside of Austin locations
put together a show called Spaghetti Western,

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.110
Spaghetti Feast, with Young Guns.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.280
I said, not on my watch is that ever gonna
happen ever again.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.950
Because that, my friends, is not a spaghetti
western.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.300
So anyway, that's, basically what I'm trying
to say with a long and rambly story is that

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.590
it's very important that if we're gonna put
our name on something that somebody can't

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.740
you know, sneer at us.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.350
And think that we don't get it.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:32.930
So, the decisions, in terms of what we do
and how we do it, we have to be able to stand

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.870
behind those decisions.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.620
So that's, that's it for the.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.940
Yeah, that's it for our quote unquote core
values.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.990
And I think the last thing I wanna do is just
run through a couple of the folks on the Alamo

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.990
team.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.440
I think that first slide is probably that
Zack Carlson slide again.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.740
So if it is we'll cycle past him 'cause you've
already met Zack.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.740
No!

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.540
I think I might have already taken him out.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.120
Sorry to say no like that.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [laughs]

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.410
&gt;&gt;Tim: so we do have a big creative staff.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.410
This is Henry Mazza.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.929
Who runs the creative department.

00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:05.470
He runs all the action packed stuff and the
sing-alongs.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.470
Quote-alongs.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.430
And also kinda oversees a lot of the programming
at the Highball as well.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.860
So Henry started kind of as a food runner.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.550
Kind of lowest on the totem pole.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.040
Moved to waiter.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.420
And then at a certain point we wanted to cross
train him.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.080
Because we thought he was really clever and
fun.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080
Had some really good ideas.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.550
So I was like "Hey, would you like to cross
train to be, you know, in the kitchen?"

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:30.750
He was like "Well, you know, actually, technically
I'd like to cross train to be an owner."

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:36.520
And so I thought, that's pretty good for a
24 year old kid who's been on with us for

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.870
a year as a waiter.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.120
But ultimately I liked a lot of his ideas.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.420
He started programming on his own.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.040
And, hired him to be the first member of the
creative staff.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.750
And now he oversees the group of 20.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.170
And also is helping the other markets develop
their own creative staff under our model.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.170
Next one.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.170
Oh, that's Zack.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.170
You know Zack.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.560
We'll just move on to the next one.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.360
This is Lars Nilsen.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.610
And he came to the Alamo, similar way.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.610
So we do a show every Wednesday called Weird
Wednesday.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.820
Which is, used to be free.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.760
Now it's a dollar or two dollars.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.960
Screenings of 35 millimeter '70s and '80s
exploitation movies.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.460
Kinda sleazy movies.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.980
But it's a genre of film that I hold very
dear.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.179
And so does Lars.

00:31:25.179 --> 00:31:27.210
So I became friends with him just as a patron.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.510
I used to host that show and curate the show
and pick out the movies.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.960
And so eventually, this is a long time ago,
this is 11 years ago.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.890
He would start bringing VHS tapes to the theater
for the pre-show that he had made on his own.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:47.090
So "Hey Tim, this is a collection of clips
that I think really suits the movie.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.610
And this is what you should probably play
for this."

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.610
I was like "Oh, OK.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.610
This is great."

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.760
So we'd do that for a few months and then
I passed the reins.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.040
He started programming the series.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.860
And then he started introducing all the shows.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:05.500
And then a friend of mine had to tell me,
that, point out, that Lars actually, in fact,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.400
was working for me but I wasn't paying him
anything.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400
[laughter]

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.190
So I rectified that.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.809
He's the guy that was the first employee to
handle the Alamo pre-show which is the video

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:18.460
montage of clips that happens before the movie.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.570
We have a full time staff employed that does
that work for us.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:25.150
So no advertisements, as one of our, it's
not really a core value.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.170
But it's what we do at the theater.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.299
And not only that, not only do we ignore the
revenue stream of the advertisements.

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:43.200
We go deeper in the hole by having a full
time staff in order to create that content.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200
So.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200
[laughter]

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200
Go ahead.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200
Ah, this is Andrew McEthron.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200
Who was a college student that I met back
in 1999.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.160
He was the technical, well at the time he
was a college student he was a technical coordinator

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160
for South by Southwest.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.179
He was also head of all projection for Cinemark
in the area.

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:05.750
And I just, I used to handle a lot of the
technical side of the projection room back

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.190
when we were a lot smaller.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:13.120
And we bonded because we were able to talk
about gears and nuts and bolts and that sort

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.120
of thing.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120
So.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.960
But he was working for Cinemark and they were
paying him such an abysmal wage that I said

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.880
"Wow, that's really not a lot of money.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.200
I can give you 50 percent more if you come
work for me."

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.880
Which really wasn't a lot of money at the
time either.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.400
But he's, he came on board.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.380
Worked for us part time while he was in college
and has continued for the last eight years

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.690
after college.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.690
Oversees.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.309
He was computer science.

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:38.850
So he did database development for South by
Southwest.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.090
So he handles all of our IT execution as well
as the projection side.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.920
He's got a team under him now.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.020
Next one.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:54.840
And this is another interesting obsessive
compulsive orphan that's on our team.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.250
Justin moved down, he, I knew him because
we're a, we collect old film.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.650
Justin was a 23 year old film collector in
Kansas City.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.339
He moved down to Alamo, we got him a job as
a bartender.

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:11.040
He was kind of a crappy bartender.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.800
And then we moved him over to projection.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.240
He wasn't that great at projection.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.240
[laughter]

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.369
So we moved him over to the outdoor movie
rolling road show.

00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:27.070
Where he proved to be not able to shine so
well.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.070
[laughter]

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:34.050
Then we moved him over to venue rental to
see if he could do something there and, quickly

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.980
realized that that wasn't his calling either.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.980
[laughter]

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:43.510
So, on his fifth shot, we moved him into taking
over Mondo.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.890
Which is our sort of boutique poster company.

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:51.450
And that's where we finally found a spot,
where this is the guy.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:56.810
He dug in and he created something really
special that wasn't part of the company before.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.120
So I don't know how many people know about
Mondo.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.110
But it's they're highly sought after limited
edition art posters for movies.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.740
You can see a few behind him in the background
there.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.240
Or nerdy properties for the most part.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.970
It's been a huge year for Mondo.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.390
There's been articles about them in the New
York Times and Wall Street Journal.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:22.850
They've also been the only company outside
of the studio system that has their posters

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:28.170
now archived at the American, what, the, uh,
MPA.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.130
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.730
So we're, every single Mondo poster is archived.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.210
Go on to the next one.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.690
And this is Mike.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:43.080
Mike came to us, he was the head of operations
for all of Trudy's.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.100
He came to us from Trudy's.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.900
What's important, I talked a lot about the
passion.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.340
But this goes back to the early lessons of
the first days.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.770
Having a very clear eye on what the numbers
are.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.940
So Mike does a lot of statistical analysis.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.860
We look at our revenue numbers and our expense
numbers on a daily basis.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.880
And we also look at our customer satisfaction
numbers.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.130
Our sort of, net promoter score.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.880
And that's, it's those indices of how well
we're doing that everybody in the company

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.010
is bonused by.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.400
The managers know that they have to make sure,
make sure that our guests are happy and that

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.130
they come back and they wanna come back or
decided to come back.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.840
So that's the man that does that.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840
You know that guy already.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840
Yeah.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.840
He makes really good drinks.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.869
And then John Bullington is our head of cuisine.

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:34.380
He came to us from Mars Restaurant years and
years ago.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.760
Mars, and at the time Mars was voted best
restaurant in Austin.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.500
And we had to really convince him that moving
to a place that served pizzas and burgers

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.320
and cranked out a lot of them in a really
fast amount of time was something he wanted

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320
to do.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.990
But we also give him a lot of freedom to express
his sort of chef-y side of things, too.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:37:00.220
And so I have a few slides of I think a few
things that he's done over the years.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.640
We'll cycle through those real quick.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
Oh no, I took those out.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640
Alright, never mind.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.450
So, anyway, but John does these feast events.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:11.570
Lord of the Rings feast event where there's
a different meal every two hours for a 12

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.570
hour experience.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.570
[laughter]

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.580
It's a gargantuan amount of food.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:20.440
The very, very first thing that he ever did
for us is, uh, he's a big fan of the movie

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.440
"Ishtar".

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:27.510
So he did a five course feast built around
the movie Ishtar of Moroccan food.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:34.070
So every month and a half or so, we'll do
a high end food and film themed even that

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.070
John curates.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.840
He does a lot of community outreach, too.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.830
He brings students in to learn about the kitchen.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.859
He does mock interviews for them.

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.940
To help with the Texas Culinary Academy.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:49.300
And just is given the freedom to do some crazy
wacky things.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.490
We'll go ahead and, the next.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:56.680
The other thing that we like to do at the
Alamo is try to go over the top when we possibly

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.680
can.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.200
This was for the premier of Iron Man.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.619
Where it was really cute.

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:06.560
This guy is a guy that flies over stadiums
in a jet pack.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.670
For whatever reason.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.050
And that's his job.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:13.590
But he was so excited about being perceived
as Iron Man that he handmade this little felt

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.590
[laughter]

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.590
Iron Man costume.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.900
[laughs] I thought it was one of the cutest
things ever.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.900
[laughter]

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.470
Anyway, so that's one of the things we've
done.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.119
Go ahead to the next one.

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:30.450
This was an event we did for the remake of
Amityville Horror.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.550
Ryan Reynolds was coming into town.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.980
And so in order to get a chance to meet Ryan
Reynolds and hang out at the screening you

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.050
had to walk through the House of Flies.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:44.280
So we found that you, for I don't know why,
but on the internet you can buy fly larvae

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.500
that can hatch into flies.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.750
So I bought a box of 20,000 flies.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.750
[laughter]

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.800
And the problem was I failed to really understand
the instructions.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.600
I let it sit for a little bit too long before
I opened it.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:05.210
And the box was like literally shaking and,
so I had, I went into this House of Flies

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.490
with an X-acto knife and I knew this was gonna
be a horrible thing.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.260
And so I had the eye goggles on.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.401
I had like a hoodie pulled tight.

00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:17.580
And I sliced the box open and this wave of
flies just flew into my face.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.480
And I had an X-acto knife and just like sort
of.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480
I don't know what I did.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.990
I just started flailing and completely lacerated
my hand open.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.610
So I just ran out of the House of Flies.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.610
[laughter]

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.540
Bleeding and and screaming.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.640
And but anyway.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640
It worked.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.940
Eventually it worked.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.220
So if you're gonna buy flies, I guess the
lesson here is, if you're gonna buy flies

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.740
on the internet, read the instructions as
to when they're actually going to hatch.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.740
OK.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.830
Go on to the next slide.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:49.470
Um, this was an even for the unfortunate box
office disappointment of Nacho Libre.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.480
Everybody was really expecting it to be awesome
after Napoleon Dynamite.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:59.510
It was OK, but the studio agreed to finance
this show that we put together.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.680
Where we brought in Lucha Libre wrestlers
from Mexico City.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680
Some of them midgets.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.760
Some of them full size.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.770
[laughter]

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:15.850
And so they dragged me into the ring and they
didn't speak English.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.280
And so there I was just sort of following
along.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.000
So "OK, so you wanna hold my arms back like
this.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.510
OK, you're gonna hit me in the chest with
a two by four.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:24.070
I've always wanted to know what that is.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.070
How you do that trick.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.070
'Cause it looks so convincing."

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:30.440
And so apparently the way that you do that
trick is, the guy holds your arms back and

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.810
the guy on the ground hits you really hard
on the chest with a two by four.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:34.810
[laughs]

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.810
[laughter]

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:43.240
And I had this crazy like, three and a quarter
inch bruise across my chest for about two

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.410
weeks.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.570
[laughter]

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:46.570
I don't know.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.570
It was fun.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.570
[laughter]

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.710
Oh, go ahead and go to the next one.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.340
I don't know why, but it's Ryan Reynolds I
guess likes to come into town.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.930
So this is again a stump for Ryan Reynolds'
"Buried."

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.150
Which came out last year.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.569
Last year?

00:41:00.569 --> 00:41:02.180
I think it was last year.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180
Yeah.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180
Supremely underrated movie.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180
I really loved this film.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.060
And it all takes place inside of a coffin.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:12.220
Ryan Reynolds is buried either in Iraq or
Afghanistan and has a phone and is trying

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.119
to find a way to get out of this box.

00:41:14.119 --> 00:41:21.900
So we staged a contest for people to volunteer
to watch the ultimate “Buried” experience.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.060
Where we met them at the theater, blindfolded
them, took them in a van out into the country,

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:31.530
where we had dug four shallow graves and built
four coffins that had LCD monitors built into

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.530
the top of them.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.530
So it was this.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.530
It was.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.530
And then we buried them.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.530
[laughter]

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.400
And then, so it was the, the screening.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.410
Like supposed to be the ultimate "Buried"
screening.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.330
Like, put yourself inside the movie.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.330
[laugher]

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.710
And, so, we did that.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.710
It was an idea.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.100
I saw the movie at Sundance.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.380
It was an idea that my friend and I had.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.950
And we said, oh, there's no way this is gonna
pass legal.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.060
But we went ahead and sent it over to the
studio.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.940
And I don't know if legal was just, I caught
'em on a day where they were not paying attention.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.520
But anyway, they said "Yeah.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520
Sure.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.520
No problem.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.520
Do it."

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.520
[laughter]

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520
Provided that we assume the liability.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.520
Which we did.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.520
It really wasn't that dangerous.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520
We tested it all out.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520
There was airflow systems.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520
And there was paramedics on hand.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.130
And we had cameras monitoring them.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.130
So anyway.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.750
It was a fun event.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:19.900
It was good.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.020
[audience commenting off mic]

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.410
Well, they were buried for the whole movie.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.130
They had to watch the movie inside the coffin.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.910
So for each of 'em were buried for 90 minutes
while they watched "Buried."

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.040
[audience laughing and chattering]

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040
Yeah.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040
Yeah.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.570
We made it actually extra special for them,
there was a little tube.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:42.390
So when sand would come into Ryan Reynolds'
coffin we'd dump sand into their coffin.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.390
[laughter]

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.390
Not a lot.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:45.390
Just some.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.150
To give them a taste.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.150
But.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.150
[laughter]

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.100
So, go ahead and move on.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.810
The, and that, the other things we do is we
take the Alamo on the road.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.150
We do famous movies in famous places.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.980
We've been doing this for the last seven years.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.870
We've done "Jaws" at Martha's Vineyard.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.040
This is "Close Encounters" at Devils Tower.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.869
You know "Escape from Alcatraz" on Alcatraz.

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:11.300
So every year we try to go crazier and crazier.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.430
We pitched this idea.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.630
I haven't told anybody this yet.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:20.651
But one I really wanna do is a similar to
the, we did Buried, and it's like oh, what

00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:23.609
could be even more traumatic than buried.

00:43:23.609 --> 00:43:28.290
So what we're gonna try to do is get our insurance
carrier to cover us for the screening of watching

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.580
"Jaws" in shark-infested waters in a shark
tank.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.730
If we can figure out how to do that.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.730
[laughter]

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.310
So that may be part of the next road show
tour this summer.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.310
It's been pitched.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.310
I don't know.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.310
We'll see.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.310
Totally safe.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.810
You know, we take every safety precaution
here at the Alamo.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.810
[laughter]

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.710
Go ahead and go to the next one.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.030
And there's John doing one of his skills at
Fantastic Fest.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:56.900
I mentioned it before but this is a festival
that focuses on horror, science fiction and

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.900
fantasy.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.230
Things that we really, that our programming
team really loves.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.240
So John always likes to do something special
for the closing night party.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:15.090
This is a 700 pound cow that he sort of butterflied
and roasted on a open fire for 22 hours.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.200
As really sort of a visceral way to eat a
steak.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.180
So that was, so he's carving it off for the
attendees.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:27.350
And I think, we've just got a couple more
slides.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:33.710
But just, we've started to branch out and
consider the Alamo as more of a entertainment

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:34.710
brand.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.710
If you will.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.990
And so we're, we've started a film distribution
company.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.270
It's gonna be in full swing in 2012.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.630
We're gonna try to release six new movies
and six classic old movies a year.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.540
This is our first one that we did.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.740
It's sort of a beta test.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.000
It's called "Four Lions."

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.510
Ended up, TIME Magazine called it one of the
best, ten best films of the year in 2010.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.990
We were able to get it, I think because we're
drawn to movies that we're really passionate

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.880
about but also maybe have something a little
bit wrong with them.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880
[laughter]

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.970
And so what's wrong about this one is that
it's jihadi suicide bomber comedy.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.970
[laughter]

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.980
And at the time, tensions were high around
this particular issue.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:24.160
So I think, even though it was directed by
really a legend of comedy in the UK, Chris

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.660
Morris, a lot of distributors that we thought
would have bought it were afraid that perhaps

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.369
a jihad would be called against them for doing
such a blasphemous thing.

00:45:33.369 --> 00:45:35.480
It's actually in fact not blasphemous.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.500
It's very, very respectful to the religion.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:46.250
What he was trying to point out is how certain
types of oblivious youth get drawn to movements

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.090
like this in the UK.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:53.830
And sort of drawing out the stupidity of the
people that would sign up to be a suicide

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.830
bomber.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:55.830
So.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:56.830
That's what it's about.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:57.830
It's a good film.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.830
I like it.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:04.180
But, so, we're gonna pick movies that we love
and maybe movies that have some issues like

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:09.060
this one to push out there and try to support
and nurture in 2012.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.820
And that brings us to the last thing.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:18.770
Greg wanted me to talk a little bit about
our viral sensation this year which was a

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.920
lot of fun.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:29.710
So what happened was at the Village Theater,
one of our customers was kicked out for texting.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:35.260
And despite her disjointed claims and her
subsequent voicemails, she was texting in

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.730
her seat and refused to acknowledge the warning
to stop doing it.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.390
And so our policy is to kick that person out
without a refund.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:44.690
It's been a policy we've had since the very,
very early days.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.840
It wasn't since day one, it was actually,
the policy came out when during a screening

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.340
of "Blue Velvet" at midnight at the original
location where it came, like a free Pabst

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.480
Blue Ribbon at the door.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.810
And people just started drinking probably
too much Pabst Blue Ribbon.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.030
It just go out, it got out of control.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.910
It made me sick to my stomach and I was like,
this is not what I signed up for.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.220
We don't have controls in place to take care
of these people.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.070
And so it was after that screening that we
instituted the policy back in '97.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.280
And we've taken it very seriously ever since.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.630
We've kicked out a lot of people.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:19.820
Probably about 100 people a year, we kick
out of the theater without a refund.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:25.450
And hopefully the lesson is that they're not
welcome at the Alamo until they can change

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:26.450
their behavior.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.600
And then they can, then they're a guest again.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.230
But so this one voicemail came through.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.820
Our manager sent it to us 'cause our voicemail
comes through Mp3.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.430
He said "Hey, check this out, this would make
a really funny 'Don't Talk' PSA."

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.730
And we agreed and just cut something together.

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.890
We cut it to just put up on screen.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:50.700
And we at the same time, when we put it up
on screen, we posted it on YouTube.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.380
We've been doing that for the last year or
so when we do a new "Don't Talk" PSA.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.150
We put it on YouTube as well.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.990
So Roger Ebert I think was the first guy that
saw it.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:05.320
And we had engaged in dialog with him about
digital projection 'cause he had gotten up

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.460
on a soapbox and we got, became part of that
dialog with him.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.980
And I think he subsequently started following
our feeds.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:18.080
And so he reposted it and when he did that,
it started posting at a whole bunch of other

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.280
sites and we had never been any, through anything
like this.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.270
So it was clear that something had gone wrong.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.220
'Cause our website was 100 percent shut down.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.340
Like 'cause when, people were linking back
to our blog post.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:36.830
So Andrew, our IT guy figured out very, very
quickly how to dynam-, to host that page in

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.490
the Cloud.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:43.510
And also, yes, and get our website back.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.000
'Cause once you know website controls everything
for us.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.480
We, close to 70 percent of our ticket sales
are online.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.349
So when the website goes down it's very devastating
for us.

00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:58.490
So we got it working again and then by the
end of the day the numbers had spiked up to

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.560
two and a half million views on this clip.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.580
And they ultimately went up to five and a
half million.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:08.210
But the following day it got picked up by
some serious news outlets.

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.940
Howard Stern picked it up that day.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.150
But the best one was Anderson Cooper.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:15.390
Later that night.

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.690
So his people called us.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.010
We got some interviews set.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.700
And he did, kind of a interesting overview
of the piece.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.950
And so I think we have the Anderson Cooper
clip.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:29.950
Switch that over.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.410
'Cause he not only shows the clip, but breaks
it down in a very Anderson Cooper way.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:34.410
[laughter]

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:35.740
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:51.400
&gt;&gt;Tim: He lumps on some unworthy praise but
we're gonna totally take it anyway.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.839
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Where's my, how do we get
out of the full screen of this shortcut?

00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:54.839
We gotta find it.

00:49:54.839 --> 00:49:55.920
&gt;&gt;Male: What did you do?

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Uh, nothing.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.850
Go ahead.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.500
&gt;&gt;Tim: [chuckles]

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.430
&gt;&gt;Male: Well, uh, you just do.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.510
That's the uh, full screen.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:09.510
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.510
Thank you, sir.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.510
OK.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:12.510
And I have that clip right here.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.510
[pause]

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.510
[video clip begins]

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:15.510
&gt;&gt;Female Announcer: Well, in case you're wondering
where he is, he's on the road, so, let's see.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.510
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Uh, thanks very much.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.510
Alright, so time now for the ridiculous.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:18.510
Tonight we're adding my latest source of annoyance.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.510
People who talk and text at the movies.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.510
And I wanna talk about one young woman in
particular.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.210
A woman who was repeatedly warned to stop
texting during a movie in Austin, Texas.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.670
Wouldn't stop and was promptly thrown out
of the theater.

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:31.220
Then she left an angry voicemail for the theater,
which is posted on its blog for your enjoyment.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:36.400
&gt;&gt;Female Customer: Didn't know that I wasn't
supposed to text in your little crappy [bleep]

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400
theater.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.540
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Alright, did I mention
that theater is called the Alamo Drafthouse

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.920
and that they serve beer?

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.339
Well, I'm not sure if I mentioned that but
indeed, I think our texter may have partaken

00:50:46.339 --> 00:50:47.339
a bit.

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.950
A little pre-party during the previews perhaps.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.420
Listen to her next offense.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:57.760
&gt;&gt;Female Customer: So excuse me for using
my phone in USA Magnited State of America.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.470
Where you are free to text in a theater.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.450
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I love living in the Magnited
States of America.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.450
[laughter]

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.510
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Where you are free to text
in a theater.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.960
Now that's a lady who knows her Constitution.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.830
What's all that freedom jazz about if some
drunk girl can't constantly update her Facebook

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.900
status while people are trying to concentrate
on Kung Fu Panda II.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.770
Next the lady employs something I like to
call "The Silent but Deadly" defense.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.520
&gt;&gt;Female Customer: And it was on silent.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.089
It wasn't on loud.

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:26.660
It wasn't bothering anybody.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.280
You guys obviously were being [bleep] to me.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.960
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I'm sorry drunk girl.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.359
But texting in a dark movie theater is like
lighting a road flare.

00:51:34.359 --> 00:51:35.359
People are gonna see it.

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:36.359
[laughter]

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.670
You might not through your beer goggles, but
everybody else will.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.770
Drunk girl didn't give up though.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:43.170
She's been hitting the law books apparently
and comes up with two more arguments for her

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:44.170
defense.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:48.520
A combo of the "I didn't know" defense seasoned
with just a touch of the "I do it everywhere

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.520
else" defense.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.670
&gt;&gt;Female Customer: I was not aware that I
couldn't text in your theater.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:54.670
Alright?

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:57.380
I've texted in all the other theaters in Austin.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.600
And no-one ever gave a [bleep] about what
me, I was doing with my [bleep] phone.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.600
Alright?

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.960
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Now maybe she has texted
her way through every other movie theater

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.960
in Austin.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.960
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.250
But as it turns out, this particular theater
has a well-known zero tolerance policy against

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:12.500
talking and cell phones.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.760
It's kinda this theater's crusade.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.710
And they have all kinds of creative announcements
about it.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:17.710
Watch.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.290
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I keep a, uh, electric cattle prod
with me.

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.710
So if I hear someone talking I give 'em just
a little.

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.810
Not an aggressive shock.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:26.810
But just a light shock.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.109
&gt;&gt;Male #2: My name is Pedro Sanchez from Napoleon
Dynamite.

00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:31.100
If you vote for me, I'll make sure that everyone
is really quiet in the theater.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.520
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Don't talk during the movies.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.700
Turn off your cell phones and beepers, please.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.270
&gt;&gt;Male #1: If you can find out who they are,
and then go cut their tongue out.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.270
[loud noise]

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.820
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: So, I think it's pretty
clear where the Alamo Drafthouse stands on

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.820
this issue.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.820
&gt;&gt;Tim: [laughs]

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.820
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: And you know what?

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.360
Maybe a theater with that kind of policy just
isn't for everyone.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:57.300
&gt;&gt;Female Customer: You know, I will never
be comin' back to your Alamo Drafthouse or

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.300
whatever.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:01.200
I'd rather go to a regular theater where people
are actually polite.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.200
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Oh yeah.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.730
The "regularlier" theater are full of polite
people.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:05.990
Politely shouting at the screen.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.130
Politely bringing screaming toddlers to rated
R movies at 11 o'clock at night.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.130
Politely talking and texting through the whole
movie.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:14.570
The CEO of the Alamo Drafthouse says he wants
his theater to be different.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.440
Here's Tim League, great American hero.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.440
[laughter]

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.119
&gt;&gt;Tim on the Anderson clip: we wanted to take
a hard stand and say that those people are

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:22.710
not welcome at the Alamo Drafthouse.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:25.770
So we'll get rid of those people and just
make it a better place for the rest of the

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:26.770
movie going public.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.780
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I think that guy should
win the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780
[laughter]

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.780
So listen up, Magnited States.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.780
News Flash.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.780
The movie theater is not your living room
so don't act like it is.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.339
We're paying to see the movie, not your cell
phone light.

00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:40.109
And we wanna listen to the actors, not your
lame comments and inane chatter.

00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:42.740
Next time you're about to text in a film,
remember the Alamo.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.740
Drafthouse.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.990
Or you might end up at The Ridiculous.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.990
More news ahead in the next hour.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.990
We'll be right back.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.990
[music]

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.990
[laughter and applause]

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:56.630
&gt;&gt;Tim: So that was some pretty good press,
I gotta say.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:02.010
Anyway that was a crazy wild adventure and
that's the last thing that I've got on my

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.670
little presentation today.

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:10.340
But you know, if anybody has any questions
about anything please feel free to fire 'em

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.450
away.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:18.130
[audience member asks question off mic]

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:26.480
&gt;&gt;Tim: Well, the girl, uh, we had a lot of
things cued up for those type of Maury Povich

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.480
type of shows.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.480
Where they wanted a showdown.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.880
It might have ended up in chairs thrown and
things like that.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.840
Which I would have totally been down for.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.300
But actually it never happened.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:39.961
The only thing she did was she went onto KVET
in the morning and said that she wanted to

00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:43.640
stay anonymous but she was still pretty mad
and pretty feisty on KVET.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.780
And they had a little fun with her and that's
the only appearance she had.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:52.300
I think she was savvy enough to know that
if she were to come out and be identified

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.170
then it would not have been a good thing for
her.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.849
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I agree.

00:54:57.849 --> 00:54:58.849
Yeah.

00:54:58.849 --> 00:55:04.390
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So, there's been a kind of a lot
of copy cat people who are doing the dinner

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:05.760
and movie type thing.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:11.300
Studio Movie Grill being one that's kind of
aggressively opening shops across the nation.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:15.930
Do you see that as a good thing because it's
introducing people to the concept?

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:19.160
And does that make it easier for you to expand?

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:24.680
Or do you think that it's kind of tarnishing
the whole brand of what you're doing?

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.530
&gt;&gt;Tim: I'm somewhere in the middle.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:31.140
It doesn't really matter to me what, we keep
tabs on everybody.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.710
I think it's the never satisfied concept that
we want to know what everybody's doing.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.760
And occasionally we'll say "Oh wow, that's
actually really great.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760
I wish we would have thought of that."

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.250
And then we'll steal that idea.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:49.540
So, I mean, so you know, like when Flicks
comes into town, we'll you know, our whole

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.869
team, we've got logs of information of our
visits to Flicks.

00:55:52.869 --> 00:55:53.869
What we like.

00:55:53.869 --> 00:55:54.869
What we didn't like.

00:55:54.869 --> 00:55:56.270
We've been to Studio Movie Grill a lot of
times.

00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:01.310
So I think our role is to try to execute better.

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:07.660
And we're certainly the only type of this
concept that does any type of interesting

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660
programming.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.020
Most of those other concepts are just like
a regular movie theater but they have different

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.020
food offerings.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.130
Different concessions offerings.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.920
So more power to 'em.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.980
So we're just, we're gonna expand where we
wanna expand and it doesn't matter what they

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.980
do.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.530
&gt;&gt;Male #1: And then one other thing.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:29.980
In the '90s when I first heard about the Drafthouse,
it was kind of through the ramblings of Harry

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.980
Knowles.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.390
Is it just a coincidence that the Drafthouse
and Ain't It Cool News started at the same

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.390
time?

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:40.180
Or were you guys kind of in cahoots before
either of those things started?

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.730
&gt;&gt;Tim: Uh, it was coincidence.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.310
So, I mean we really did start almost at the
exact same time.

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:50.400
And Harry, along with Rick Linklater who's
in town.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.340
Were both guys that initially when we opened
up were very, very skeptical.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:57:01.710
Because for a true cinephile, the idea of
having this added disturbance of food service

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.550
in a movie theater is really an offensive
idea.

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.859
And so we had to prove to both of those guys.

00:57:08.859 --> 00:57:15.891
And Harry, I remember very distinctly the
first movie Harry ever came to was a, we did

00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:18.620
a screening of a blaxploitation called "Super
Fly".

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.970
Came with a free 40 ounce malt liquor.

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.079
It was this crazy

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.750
[laughter]

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.140
over the top promotion.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:31.820
And he wrote this long expansive essay about
how much he loved that experience.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.490
And I didn't know who he was.

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:38.790
And somebody had to point out the website
to me and the next time he came in we shook

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:39.790
hands, became friends.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.970
And we've just been, you know we like a lot
of the same movies.

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.829
So we actually became businessmen together.

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:46.829
You know.

00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:50.869
His site grew at the same time we were growing.

00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:54.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Can someone just walk up?

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.660
Or?

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:59.800
Go ahead in the back, Josh.

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:06.380
[audience member asks question of mic]

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.580
&gt;&gt;Tim: Mm-hm.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:14.070
[audience member continues off mic]

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:22.260
&gt;&gt;Tim: it, the working with big licensed brands
has been a, certainly an evolution.

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:27.710
Ah, it's easier now that we're established
and people know what Mondo is.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:32.890
People actually start coming to us to say,
"Lets, we'd like to do this."

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.330
And honestly right, Star Wars was the first
big, big license that we bought.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.360
And it was a big check.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.620
And so writing that check was very speculative.

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.240
But it ended up being really great for us.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.460
So it's a little bit frustrating sometimes.

00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:52.349
Because there's a lot of the, Star Wars in
particular is very picky about what goes out.

00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:56.960
So there's actually a lot of Star Wars designs
that are awesome.

00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.790
But maybe a little bit outside the wheelhouse
of how they want Star Wars represented.

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:04.540
And so those will never be posters.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.710
They're just conceptual drawings at this point.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:10.710
So you have to work through that process.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.579
But in general it hasn't been too bad.

00:59:12.579 --> 00:59:18.700
The ground rules are laid out that it's Alamo,
it's Mondo basically that's driving the creative

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:19.700
process.

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.079
And they don't take input from the studio.

00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:25.210
If the studio doesn't like it then they will
scrap it and do something else.

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:30.010
But they're not gonna tweak it to the whims
of the studio.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:31.030
They are what they are.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.730
They're, they have final cut, I guess, if
you will.

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:39.710
And then the artists, you know, it's Ali Moss
and Tyler Stalter are two of our biggest artists

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:40.710
that we work with.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.850
But Tyler Stalter was unknown.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:45.080
Like he became famous through the Mondo poster
series.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:50.940
So because he got a lot more work coming out
of us, he's done stuff for you know Adidas

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.880
and Nike and bigger paying jobs than what
we can afford at this point.

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.690
But he's always happy to come back.

00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:00.740
A, because he's a movie fan, and it's really
satisfying work for him to do.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.350
But also because we've been with him since
the very beginning.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:05.630
Two more questions and then.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:06.660
Tim you pick.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.830
Go ahead.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:09.000
&gt;&gt;Tim: Uh.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.350
Do, I don't know.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.100
Here we go.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.100
Over.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.100
Right here.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100
Sorry.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100
The green shirt.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.730
[audience member speaking off mic]

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.950
&gt;&gt;Tim: Oh no.

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.710
I keep on telling myself I have to prepare
myself for this question.

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:25.710
[audience member speaking off mic]

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:26.710
&gt;&gt;Tim: Top three movies?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.260
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Top three theater movies.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.339
&gt;&gt;Tim: What are my top three favorite movies?

01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:33.290
I'm very, it changes.

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.210
It changes a lot.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.339
I just saw the Muppets last week.

01:00:37.339 --> 01:00:39.680
So the Muppets is my favorite movie of all
time.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680
[laughter]

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680
Um.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680
I really liked it.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
I don't know.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680
I came in.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.330
I hated all those fake trailer ads that they
did.

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.310
So I came in with really low expectations
but you know.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.480
I cried in the middle when he's in with all
the portraits.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.870
And I just thought it was like the perfect
mix of nostalgia.

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:59.210
And you know, just, I had a smile on my face.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.869
Um. [soft whistle] I mean I like some sort
of weirdo, obscure movie.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:04.869
You know.

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.920
'Cause I still program Fantastic Fest.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.119
I'm the head of programming.

01:01:08.119 --> 01:01:13.320
So what I watch is a lot of foreign genre
films.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.950
There's a, there's a movie you can get on
Amazon actually that's called "Adam's Apples."

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.390
Which nobody's seen.

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:23.770
But it's from a Danish director.

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:28.230
It's where Mads Mikkelson got his start, with
this director.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:38.410
Just this perfect mix of inappropriate comedy
and violence and more inappropriateness and

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:39.410
awkwardness.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:40.589
I think it's' a great film.

01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:47.109
You know, we're, I'll give a unabashed plug
for Drafthouse Films.

01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:50.220
You know 'cause we bought, we're buying movies
that we love.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.910
We bought a movie out of the festival this
year called "Bullhead."

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.859
Which is from a first time Belgian director.

01:01:56.859 --> 01:02:02.690
But it actually, after we bought it, it was
Belgium's choice for Academy Award Best Foreign

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.690
Language Film.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.119
It just, it ended up on a variety of short
lists.

01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:12.920
So we're, it might be conceivable that this
film ends up being one of the five films for

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.700
Best Foreign Language Film for this year.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.330
I don't know.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:17.420
Fingers crossed.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.810
But it's this crazy story.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:26.339
Sort of early Scorsese-ish film about a guy
who's addicted to testosterone and runs this

01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:28.580
meat processing facility.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.240
And there's this illegal steroids subplot
that goes through it.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.010
And also this very heartfelt, heart crushing
romantic storyline.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:41.000
So I like a lot of movies like that that are
complicated.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.350
Really well acted.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.180
Story that you haven't seen before.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.180
Fresh and original.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.720
But then I like really stupid movies like
"Teen Lust" is a really, really fun movie

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.000
from the '80s that you should probably not
check out.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
[laughter]

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Shouldn't have said that.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
OK.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Next question.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Last question.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.310
&gt;&gt;Tim: In the back.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:07.930
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I guess mine's following the same
lines as favorite movies except I'm more or

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:09.859
less asking what your favorite worst movies?

01:03:09.859 --> 01:03:11.589
I'm a big Mystery Science Theater fan.

01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:12.950
I grew up on that stuff.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:15.589
So I kinda see a lot of similarities in that.

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:17.530
I guess I'll give you an example of mine first.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:19.160
I loved "Manos: The Hands of Fate"

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.190
&gt;&gt;Tim: Yeah.

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:23.490
&gt;&gt;Male #3: And Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:24.730
&gt;&gt;Tim: Those are both very fine films.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:25.730
Yeah.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.810
"Manos" is apparently getting a restoration
next year.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:32.190
Yeah, there's one guy that's obsessively doing
it on his own outside of the studio system.

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:35.190
So we might be able to see the ultimate "Manos:
The Hands of Fate" next year.

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.190
We'll see.

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:40.480
&gt;&gt;Male #3: As a suggestion, c3333333333333333333333333333333333ould
you just buy all the Mystery Science Theater?

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.570
&gt;&gt;Tim: Uh, I'll put it in the idea hopper.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.570
[laughs]

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:48.130
I mean, it's, I am drawn.

01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:54.170
Like, I, it's it's tough, because I'm not
such a big fan of the idea of so bad it's

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:55.170
good.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:04:02.050
I like to think of those movies as people
that are earnestly trying to make the best

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:04.109
movie possible.

01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:06.710
It's just they might have been dropped on
their head as a child.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:07.710
[laughter]

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.930
Or like they just, there's something not quite
right in their makeup.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.839
I really don't' like the movies that are holier
than though.

01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:16.530
That they're gonna a willfully make something
campy or bad.

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:19.220
I just, that feels, that rings false to me.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.260
But I do love exactly what you're talking
about.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.710
So some favorites of mine that, strangely
I can answer that question better than my

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.650
favorite movies.

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:31.680
I like this movie called "Dangerous Men" by
John Rad.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.510
Who came out, it came out about five years
ago.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.860
But he had been working on it for a decade.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.030
He was a Persian.

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:42.380
Came to the United States.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.200
And apparently made 300 movies in Iran.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.700
Came here and made this action movie in Los
Angeles.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.359
In four-walled theaters in Los Angeles and
it's just this absurd mess.

01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:54.550
But very lovable.

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:56.250
I liked "Troll 2".

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.869
Which had a documentary about Best Worst Movie.

01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:01.300
We were big champions of that film.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:07.620
There's, I like a lot of '80s straight to
VHS stuff that some of my team knows a lot

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.490
better and they've been introducing me to
some of the classics.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:17.260
But a movie called "Deadly Prey" which is
kinda like a "First Blood" type of movie.

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:21.380
But seemingly shot in somebody's back yard
with this really muscle bound guy in cut off

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.380
shorts.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.380
[laughter]

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380
It's pretty good.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.380
So.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.380
This.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.380
We could have a longer conversation about
that if you like.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.319
But I guess that's the last question.

01:05:29.319 --> 01:05:30.319
So.

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:37.470
Anyway, I wanna thank you guys for taking
part of your day to hang out.

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:38.470
[applause]

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:43.099
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So we have a nice tradition
of being able to offer our speakers for four

01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:44.950
hours of time, a eight dollar t-shirt.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:45.950
&gt;&gt;Tim: Right on.

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:49.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But it's very special because
it actually identifies you as a speaker here.

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:50.090
&gt;&gt;Tim: Nice.

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:51.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and there's only like three
people who have this so far.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.090
So.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.090
There you go.

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:54.090
&gt;&gt;Tim: Fantastic.

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:55.090
Thank you.

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:56.090
I will wear it with pride.

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:57.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thanks again.

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.090
Appreciate that.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.090
&gt;&gt;Tim: Thank you.

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.090
[applause]

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:00.093
&gt;&gt;Tim: Thanks guys.
