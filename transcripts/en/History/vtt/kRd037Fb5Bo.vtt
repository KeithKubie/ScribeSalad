00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.702
[music playing]

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:06.206
NARRATOR: The brown bears
of Alaska's Afognak Island

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:10.510
have been a danger since Morgan
set foot here two days ago.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.212
Now they've forced
him on a detour

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.447
through unfamiliar
terrain and put

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.550
his only ride home in jeopardy.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.819
I'm not exactly sure
where I'm at, but--

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.087
MORGAN (VOICEOVER):
I'm running late,

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.857
and uh, I'm not sure how
long the boat's going to wait

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.092
for me, So I gotta be there.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.027
MORGAN: I shouldn't
be too far off.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.177
Ugh.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.713
[bleep] This isn't cove
I got dropped off in.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.485
Definitely not.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.355
Must be one inlet over.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:03.897
I think I recognize that
square, blocky island out there

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.800
from when we came in, so
I think I just gotta get

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.903
out and around this headland.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.838
The seas are calm
enough right now.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.174
I could probably raft it.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.943
NARRATOR: Morgan's four pound
inflatable raft is not designed

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.379
for ocean currents, but
it's his only chance

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.514
to catch his
scheduled extraction

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.149
before it leaves without him.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:29.389
Looks to me like the tide's
just starting to come in again.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.890
Looks pretty low right now.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.028
So that's good, that means
it'll be washing me on the shore

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.430
and not trying to pull me out
into the open water, which

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.966
is where I don't want to be.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.936
I'm gonna have to do something
about my paddle, too.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.971
The hand paddles are
great in the river,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.074
because I can use them like oars
and make really quick moves.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.710
But paddling on flat
water trying to get

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.245
somewhere with them is brutal.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.413
It's just an unnatural motion.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.914
MORGAN (VOICEOVER):
So, what I need

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:59.052
to do is kind of attach them to
the end of a good strong stick,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.820
and then I'll have a
kayak paddle that's

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.655
much, much more efficient.
OK.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.494
Oh yeah.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.795
Nice.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.664
I think there's a little bit
of wind on the water now,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.666
and some ripples.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:17.637
Hopefully it's not
going to pick up.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:21.407
I'm behind schedule pretty
significantly at this point.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.610
So I need to get moving.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.182
[music playing]

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:33.052
NARRATOR: On the Gulf
of Alaska, Morgan's risk

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.989
has paid off with a healthy
reward of salmon that will help

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.958
sustain him this coming winter.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.761
But now he's dangerously close
to missing his ride home.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.931
MORGAN (VOICEOVER): Really,
I'd rather not be doing this,

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.734
but it's the only way
I'm going to get there.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.903
NARRATOR: Thrown off course
by the island's bears,

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.438
he's racing to reach
an inlet to the north,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.975
where he's due to catch a
boat back to the mainland.

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:59.212
And he's navigating
only by memory.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.848
I do know, at the
entrance to the inlet,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.384
there was a big stone arch.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.619
So I'm just waiting
'til I see that arch,

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.689
and I'll know for sure that
that's the inlet I need

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.591
to be going into.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.960
But since the shoreline
is so complicated

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.963
with all these inlets
and fjords and islands,

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:21.467
it's not like it's a
straight, continuous beach.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.203
And I don't know if the
boat's been waiting for me,

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.273
or already come and
gone, but hopefully

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.041
it's around the corner.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:34.814
Yup, that's the arch.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.316
Pretty distinctive land form.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.952
And, uh, I know this is
the entrance to the inlet

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:41.854
that I'm going to
get picked up in.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.623
Should be right up
here, not too far.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.361
Hey, there's some
shiny aluminum.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.163
Yeah, there's a boat.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.632
Yeah, that's the one
that dropped me off.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.000
Aw, I'm glad.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.669
I'm ready to get
out of this raft.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.905
MORGAN (VOICEOVER): Thankfully,
they're waiting for me,

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.074
so I should be home
free at this point.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.312
Made it.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.380
Thanks for waiting for me.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.881
Sorry I was late.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.750
Nice to be standing
on the deck of a big,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.287
solid ocean-going boat,
versus a tiny little four

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.789
and 1/2-pound Rover pack raft.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.791
MORGAN (VOICEOVER: ) This
trip's been a success.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.126
I'm pretty happy
to be heading home,

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.462
and I know Margaret's going
to be thrilled with this fish.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.664
But winter is on its way.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.699
There's a lot of work to be
done around the homestead,

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.601
and I still have
to hit the ground

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.037
running once I get back there.
