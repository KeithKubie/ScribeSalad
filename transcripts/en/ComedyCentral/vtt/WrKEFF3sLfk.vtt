NOW, WE'VE BEEN COVERING THE
FREDDIE GRAY CASE THIS WHOLE

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:08.241 line:91%
WEEK, SO LAST NIGHT AFTER THE
SHOW I DECIDED THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.710 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE SHOULD TALK TO SOME ACTUAL
PROTESTERS.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.079 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO I HOPPED ON A TRAIN TO
BALTIMORE-- THIS IS TRUE-- AND,

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:16.416 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF COURSE, AS SOON AS I DID,
THIS HAPPENED.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.085 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN NEW YORK CITY,
DEMONSTRATORS CLASHED WITH

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.286 align:start position:0% line:85%
POLICE.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.523 line:91%
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE
ARRESTED DURING THE PROTESTS IN

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.090 align:start position:0% line:85%
MANHATTAN.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.024 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: COME ON, GUYS!

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:29.162 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST LEFT TOWN TO GO TO SOME
PROTESTING.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU WEREN'T

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.700 line:91%
EVEN THINKING ABOUT "THE NIGHTLY
SHOW WITH LARRY WILMORE" AT ALL

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:40.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN YOU MADE YOUR "LET'S START
A PROTEST IN LARRY'S 'HOOD"

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:40.673 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLAN.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.744 size:88% position:44% line:85%
KNOW MY SCHEDULE, ALL RIGHT.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:45.912 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN. BUT OF ALL THE THINGS GOING
ON IN BALTIMORE

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.981 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE THING THAT FASCINATED ME THE
MOST WAS THIS GANG TRUCE.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HEARD
ABOUT IT, BUT EVERYBODY WAS

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.985 align:start position:0% line:85%
TALKING ABOUT IT.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:59.792 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIVAL GANGS IT'S BLOODS,
CRIPS, AND BLACK GUERILLA

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.061 align:start position:0% line:91%
GANGS-- CALLING A TRUCE FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.663 line:91%
THE REAL PROBLEM THEY SAY IS
DECADES OF POVERTY AND POLICE

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.398 align:start position:0% line:85%
BRUTALITY

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.368 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU KNOW THE COPS
ARE RUNNING WILD WHEN GANG

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.506 align:start position:0% line:91%
LEADERS START SOUNDING LIKE NOAM
CHOMSKY BY COMPARISON.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.974 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S PRETTY BAD, MAN.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.978 line:91%
SO ANYWAY, LAST NIGHT, I HEADED
DOWN TO BALTIMORE, AND I SAT

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.182 line:91%
DOWN IN A DINER WITH SOME RIVAL
GANG MEMBERS WHO CALLED A TRUCE,

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.917 size:75% position:38% line:85%
AND WE ATE A LITTLE PIE.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.955 align:start position:0% line:85%
TAKE A LOOK.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.492 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I'M HERE WITH SOME OF THE
BROTHERS WHO ARE HERE IN

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
BALTIMORE HERE DOING ALL THE
UPRISING, THE UNREST.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU GUYS EATEN YOU HAVE
LOOKED AT THE MENU?

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.032 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:42.168 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: CAN WE HAVE A
WAITRESS IN HERE.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:43.503 line:85%
WHO BROUGHT YOU GUYS TOGETHER?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.105 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE KNOWN THIS BROTHER A
LONG TIME.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:49.041 line:91%
KNOWN THIS BROTHER A LONG TIME
&gt;&gt; HOW LONG YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM.

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:49.976 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; LIKE FOUR YEARS.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; FOUR YEARS.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IN GANG TIME,
THAT'S LIKE 18 YEARS, RIGHT.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:58.718 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SO ARE YOU GUYS IN THE SAME
ORGANIZATION OR DIFFERENT

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start position:0% line:85%
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.119 line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, THE SAME ORGANIZATION.

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:00.887 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SAME ORGANIZATION.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE THE SAME.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:02.522 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE THE SAME.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:03.656 line:85%
YOU'RE NOT IN THE ORGANIZATION.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.991 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M COOL WITH EVERYBODY.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.493 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HE'S COOL WITH
EVERYBODY.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.794 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE'S COOL WITH EVERYBODY.

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:12.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO YOU GUYS HAVE
CALLED A TRUCE-- WAIT, IS IT A

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.033 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUCE OR A TREATY?

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.502 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE RATIFIED BY
CONGRESS OR ANYTHING.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.804 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; NO,.

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.507 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BECAUSE JOHN BOEHNER
IS AN [BLEEP] I'LL TELL YOU NOW

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.809 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T HAVE A TRUCE OR
TREATY.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:28.381 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAD MEN RESPECTING MEN AS MEN
AND WE DID IT JUST LIKE THAT.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:32.051 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WAS WALKING AND WE WAS ALL
IN A PACK DOWN FULTON AVENUE

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.686 line:91%
AND ONE THE BLOOD HOMIES STEPPED
ON MY SHOE. AND I LOOKED AT HIM

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.688 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SAID YOU KNOW 3 DAYS AGO I'D
HAVE HIT YOU IN THE MOUTH FOR

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.223 line:85%
THAT? AND HE SMILED.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:40.159 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THREE DAYS FROM NOW
THINGS MIGHT BE BACK TO NORMAL

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.362 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOU CAN HIT HIM IN HIS MOUTH
AGAIN.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.297 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, HE'S GOOD.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.997 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S GOOD.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.098 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE TRUCE IS GOOD.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.466 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IT'S FOREVER NOW, RIGHT?

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.268 line:85%
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.236 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AS FAR AS US.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.104 size:75% position:38% line:91%
WE CAN'T SPEAK FOR WHOLE
COUNTRY, BUT AS FAR AS

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:54.340 align:start position:0% line:91%
BALTIMORE, WHAT WE'RE DOING,
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:55.541 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE START WITH US.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:57.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHERE DO YOU GUYS
THINK THE ANGER IN THE COMMUNITY

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:58.611 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMES FROM?

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE TO YOU THINK THAT COMES
FROM?

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.217 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ANALOGY I'VE BEEN
USING IS, NOW YOU SEE THIS

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.151 align:start position:0% line:91%
CORNER ON THE MENU? THIS IS A
CORNER.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:05.985 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS A PERSON.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS YOU.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:10.723 line:91%
IT'S ONLY SO FAR BACK INTO THIS
CORNER YOU CAN PUSH ME BEFORE I

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.358 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE TO PUSH BACK.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY PUSHED BACK.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.662 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF
AMERICA CAN'T RELATE TO RIGHT

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:17.296 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.397 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.598 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT. IF YOU LIVE IN
A MILLION-DOLLAR HOUSE

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.567 line:91%
HOW CAN YOU RELATE TO LIVING IN
THE HOOD AND GETTING PUSHED?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.603 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
YOU'RE GOOD. YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING 

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.172 line:91%
THROUGH. SAME, AS WHEN YOU'RE
LIKE MAN, I HAVE TO PAY MY

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.506 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROPERTY TAX. I CAN'T RELATE TO
THAT.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
I NEVER PAID PROPERTY TAX
BEFORE.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.645 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT
THE ANGER OF THE PROPERTY TAX.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.982 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO LET'S SAY THIS IS MY
MILLION-DOLLAR HOUSE, OKAY.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.484 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
AND THE PROPERTY TAX IS PUSHING

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:39.452 align:start position:0% line:85%
ME INTO THIS CORNER.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.120 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THAT'S WHEN I GET ANGRY.

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:42.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S WHEN I BURST.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.624 align:start position:0% line:91%
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T RELATE TO
THAT.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:48.227 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU CALL A LAWYER AND YOU
PUSH BACK.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.094 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXACTLY.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.229 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND THEN IT'S A
VICIOUS CYCLE.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER STOPPED
SOMEBODY FROM DOING SOMETHING,

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:57.136 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE PHYSICALLY STOPPED SOMEBODY
FROM THROWING SOMETHING?

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:57.536 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WHOOPED SOMEBODY'S ASS
&gt;&gt; DID YOU?

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.904 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:04.810 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE THAT CAME UP ON
THE AVENUE, WEREN'T FROM THERE.

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:07.446 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO THERE WERE PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T EVEN FROM AROUND

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS LITTLE KIDS

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.150 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ALSO PEOPLE --
&gt;&gt; HOW OLD WERE THEY?

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE, MIDDLE
SCHOOL.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY STARTED--
&gt;&gt; I SAW JON STEWART OUT THERE.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.924 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU SAW JON STEWART
OUT THERE.

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:22.762 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF THE
SCHOOL, ME AND A COUPLE OF

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:23.796 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOMIES.
&gt;&gt; Larry: OK, SCOOBY AND

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.899 align:start position:0% line:91%
A COUPLE OF HOMIES
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE STORE.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.768 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; JON STEWART IS RIGHT BEHIND
US.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.236 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; JON STEWART IS NOT HERE.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:30.970 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUST ME.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUST ME ON THAT.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.140 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.641 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE POLICE PULL UP IN A TANK.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:38.778 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  A TANK, LIKE ONE OF
THOSE BIG HUMVEES.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY COME OUT WITH THEIR
ASSAULT RIFLES.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.154 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I WAS LIKE, "MAN, THIS IS
'CALL OF DUTY'."

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.422 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THEY JUMPED OUT.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:54.060 line:91%
THEY DID, THEY POINT THEIR GUNS
AND ALL THAT AND I GOT HIT WITH

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.262 align:start position:0% line:91%
A CONCUSSION GRENADE. I GOT
HOLES ALL IN MY FAVORITE HOODIE

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT, THAT HAPPENED
THIS PAST WEEK?

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.834 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU GOT HIT WITH A CONCUSSION
GRENADE?

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:03.736 line:91%
&gt;&gt; TWO DAYS AGO. THEY THREW IT
RIGHT TOWARDS US AND WE WERE

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.137 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROTECTING THE STORES
&gt;&gt; IT HIT ME RIGHT IN THE RIBS.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.906 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE WERE MAKING SURE THERE WAS
NO LOOTING

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
 &gt;&gt; WE RAN THROUGH THE
ALLEY, TO

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:12.244 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PROJECTS, MADE SURE EVERYONE
ELSE WAS OKAY AND WENT RIGHT

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:15.948 line:91%
BACK TO OUR POST AND LINKED ARMS
AND MADE SURE NOBODY GOT IN THAT

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:16.348 align:start position:0% line:85%
STORE.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:17.549 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.552 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY SET ONE POLICE CAR ON
FIRE AND WE STOPPED THEM FROM

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.754 line:85%
SETTING THE OTHER CAR ON FIRE.

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:24.390 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOULD YOU GUYS EVER
MEET WITH THE POLICE?

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:25.057 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.925 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU TALKED TO THEM?

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.695 align:start position:0% line:91%

THE SANDWICHES BECAUSE THEY HAD

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0% line:91%
