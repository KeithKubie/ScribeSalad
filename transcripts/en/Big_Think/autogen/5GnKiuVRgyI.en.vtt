psychology of research because what
 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.620
psychology of research because what
psychologists know today is what we can

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
psychologists know today is what we can
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.500
psychologists know today is what we can
do when we can actively do to to

do when we can actively do to to
 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.140
do when we can actively do to to
experience more growth following

who's a British psychologist and what he
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.010
who's a British psychologist and what he
shows is that there are actually certain

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020
shows is that there are actually certain
 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.710
shows is that there are actually certain
characteristics that can be learned and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
characteristics that can be learned and
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.770
