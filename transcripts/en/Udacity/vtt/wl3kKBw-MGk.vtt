00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.780
So, we're familiar with the problem.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.500
Zero connectivity is a bad experience,
low connectivity is,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.630
well maddening and previously there
was nothing you could do about it.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.630
All you could do is make a request and
then it's entirely out of your hands.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.180
It might work, it might not,
it might be fast, but it might not.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.100
You have zero control until
the request succeeds.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.770
If it even succeeds.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.630
Well, that story changes with
a relatively new browser feature

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
called service worker, and that's-
&gt;&gt; Wait, Jake.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.509
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; Was that it?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.510
&gt;&gt; Was what, what?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.710
&gt;&gt; This is the feature
that solves everything,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.840
the feature that gives developers
new powers over the network.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.950
You could at least introduce
it a bit better than that.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.770
&gt;&gt; How do you mean?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.700
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.050
&gt;&gt; For too long, users have been
left staring at a white screen.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.120
For too long, they've been let down by
the cruel seas of network connectivity.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.525
And for
too long we've been powerless to help.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:05.558
[MUSIC]

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:06.880
We've been left waiting.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.530
But no longer.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.038
[MUSIC]

00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:20.120
A new browser feature has arrived.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.200
A total game changer.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.784
[MUSIC]

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:32.251
A feature that let's you control
the network rather than letting

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.110
the network control you.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.710
Who is this new feature?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.250
What promises does it bring?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.675
Introducing The Service Worker.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:02:00.082
[MUSIC]

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:02.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah okay, that was pretty good.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.472
I'm British you see.
I'm physically incapable of positivity

00:02:05.472 --> 00:02:07.380
and excitement.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.830
&gt;&gt; Well, I still like you,
Britishness and all.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.470
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.723
&gt;&gt; And listen, if that wasn't compelling
enough for you to stick with us for

00:02:14.723 --> 00:02:16.517
the next lesson, I don't know what is.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:19.000
So strap in and
click through to the next lesson.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840
Let's drag the web into
the world of offline first.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what he said, let's do this.
