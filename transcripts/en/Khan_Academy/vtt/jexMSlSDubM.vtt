00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.540
Everything we've done up to now
has dealt with Cartesian

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.310
coordinates, even though you
might have not realized

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.930
that they were Cartesian
coordinates, because I never

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.290
called it that before just now.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.420
So what is a Cartesian
coordinate?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.620
Let me draw the axis
that you're hopefully

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.490
familiar with by now.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.420
If you're not, review
those videos.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.550
Let me just draw the
y-axis and the x-axis.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.720
And so, Cartesian coordinates--
and actually, they can apply to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.830
more than just 2 dimensions.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.190
But 2 dimensions is what
we tend to deal with.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.880
Then if I want to specify any
point in 2 dimensional space, I

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.170
just tell you how far in the x
direction I have to go, and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.400
how far in the y direction.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.160
And I can specify that point.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.150
Like, let's see, if I said,
well, let me give the Cartesian

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.590
coordinates for that
point right there.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.550
And I might say, well, to get
to that point right there, I

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.570
have to go to the
right 3 steps.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.610
So this is 3, right here.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.650
And then I have to
go up 4 steps.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.510
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.640
And you end up there.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.110
And by convention, we call this
the x-coordinate, and we call

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.630
this the y-coordinate, and
we call this 3 comma 4.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.530
And this is just a convention
where we say the first

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.730
coordinate is how far in the x
direction we go, and the second

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.250
coordinate is how far in the up
and down, or the y

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.940
direction, we go.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.270
So this is 3 comma 4.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.020
And we could have gone 3 to the
right and 4 up, or we could

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.880
have gone 4 up and
3 to the right.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.740
And we'd have gotten to
the exact same point.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.440
This is just one way to
really specify a point

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440
in 2 dimensions.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.370
Another option, and you might
have done this in everyday

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.490
life, is to say, hey, let me
just point you in a direction,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.680
and then you go a certain
distance in that direction.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.470
So I could have said,
you know what?

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.530
Let me just point you
in this direction.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.940
Let me just point you in
that direction, and you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.970
need to go this far.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.120
You need to go this far
in that direction.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.000
That would also get you
to the same point.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.920
So how do I specify
the direction?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.840
Well, how about I
call this 0 degrees?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420
How about I call
this the x-axis?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.790
How about I call
that 0 degrees?

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.070
And we'll deal with degrees.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.400
But hopefully, you know
how to convert between

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.260
degrees and radians.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.810
So you could just as easily
convert to radians.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.270
But you could specify the
direction if you call this 0,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.720
saying, ok, this is theta
degrees, and I want you-- I'm

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.490
going to point you in a degree
in-- you know, you could

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.570
always imagine someone
who's blindfolded.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.200
You point them in this
direction and you

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.700
say, walk r units.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.280
And then they'll end up
at that same point.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.740
And so you could also specify
this point-- instead of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.160
specifying, this is the
Cartesian coordinates, this is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.570
x comma y-- you could also
specify it-- maybe, if we can

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.710
figure out a way to do it.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.250
And I'll do it in magenta.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.580
You can also specify
it as r comma theta.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.990
Which essentially says,
you know, walk r units

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.650
in the theta direction.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.660
Well, let's figure
out what that is.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360
Because I think it's kind of
abstract now, and might be a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.240
little difficult to understand.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.050
So we're going to break out
a little trigonometry and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.490
actually just a little
Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.090
Can we figure out r and theta?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.010
Well, r, hopefully, is
the easier one here.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.950
Because if you think about it,
this is a right triangle.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.030
This is a right triangle.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.380
That has distance 3.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.410
This is distance 4.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.840
This is a right triangle.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.090
So what is r here?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.630
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.260
3 squared plus 4 squared is
equal to the hypotenuse

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.580
squared, or r squared.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.890
So we could say, 3 squared
plus 4 squared is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.420
equal to r squared.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.860
That's 9 plus 16 is
equal to r squared.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.880
25 is equal to r squared.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.990
We don't want to deal with
negative distances, so 5 is

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.900
equal to r, r is equal to 5.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.380
Fair enough.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.480
So we already figured out
that r is equal to 5.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.900
How do we figure out theta?

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.040
So what do we know here?

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.950
We know-- well, we're trying
to figure out theta.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.480
And we know it's
opposite side, right?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.370
This is just going
back to SOHCAHTOA.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.140
Let me write down SOHCAHTOA.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.660
If this is completely
unfamiliar to you, you might

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.170
want to watch the basic
trigonometry video.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.610
So we know the opposite
side of theta, right?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.570
That's 4.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.950
And we also know
the adjacent side.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.060
That's 3.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.090
So which of the trig
functions uses the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.470
opposite and the adjacent?

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.090
Well, the TOA.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.620
Opposite and adjacent.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.750
So tangent.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.100
So tangent of theta is equal to
the opposite-- which is really

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.680
the y-coordinate, which is
equal to 4-- over the adjacent.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.180
Which is the x-coordinate,
which is 3.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.720
So tangent of theta
is equal to 4/3.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.810
And to solve this, you
essentially just take

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.600
the inverse tangent of
both sides of this.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.530
So this is the same thing.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.050
And depending on your
calculator, or the convention

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.060
you use, you might write this.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.560
When you take the inverse
tangent of both sides,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.020
you get-- well, I'll
just write it out.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.960
You could write it as the
arctan of the tangent of theta

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.020
is equal to the arctan of 4/3.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.150
And this, of course-- the
arctan of the tangent.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.740
This is the same thing
as the inverse tan of

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.620
the tangent of theta.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.590
This is just equal to theta.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.220
That just simplifies to theta.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.300
Is equal to arctan of 4/3.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.180
And then another way to write
arctan is often-- they'll often

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.310
write it-- I'll write it.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.365
So the same exact statement
could be written as tan inverse

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:22.780
to the negative 1 power.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.460
They sometimes say it.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.020
Although it's a little
misleading sometimes, when

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.750
they write it like this.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.300
Because you don't know.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.800
Oh, am I taking the whole
tangent of theta to the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.900
negative power or something?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.480
But sometimes I'll write arctan
as 10 to the negative 1 power.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.280
But either way.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.610
So we can figure out theta by
taking the arctangent of 4/3.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.160
And most people do not have the
arctangent of 4/3 memorized.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.390
And I don't know an easy way
to figure it out, without

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.050
getting my TI-85 out.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.600
So let's get it out.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.410
All right.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.190
So how do we know the arctan--
so we want to do this inverse--

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.270
let me get the calculator up a
little higher, so you can see.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.550
We want to get this
inverse tan right here.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.440
So you press second inverse
tangent of 4 divided by 3.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.500
And I already set my
calculator to degree mode.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.055
It gives you 53.13 degrees.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.360
So theta is equal
to 53.13 degrees.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.010
So there you have it.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.610
We already knew that we could
specify this point in the 2

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.020
dimensional plane by the point
x is equal to 3,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.550
y is equal to 4.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.320
We can also specify it by r
is equal to 5, and theta

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.790
is equal to 53 degrees.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.590
So I'll write that.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.430
And polar coordinates, it can
be specified as r is equal to

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.640
5, and theta is 53.13 degrees.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:50.930
So all that says is, OK, orient
yourself 53.13 degrees

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.930
counterclockwise from the
x-axis, and then walk 5 units.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.000
And you'll get to the
exact same point.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.040
And that's all polar
coordinates are telling you.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.980
Let's do another one.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.640
Actually, before that, let's
see if we can come up with

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.020
something general here.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.870
Because once you have the
general, then you can always

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.850
solve for the particular.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.510
So let me just write
an arbitrary point.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.980
Last time I gave a
specific point.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.250
The point-- was it 3 comma 4?

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.760
I think it was.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.090
So let's say I have
the point x comma y.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.120
It's right there.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.500
So its x-coordinate is there,
its y-coordinate is there.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.580
So how do we convert this to
r, to polar coordinates?

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.720
r, theta.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.140
Well, let's do the same thing
we did in the last video.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.770
If this length is r, and
this angle is theta.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.640
So just going into what we
did in the last video.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.750
We use Pythagorean Theorem.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.340
We say that x squared plus--
because this distance

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.580
here is also y, right?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.150
This distance here is x.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.446
Pythagorean Theorem, you get
x squared plus y squared

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:56.130
is equal to r squared.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.090
That's just the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.460
And then you have the
tangent of theta.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.100
The tangent of this angle.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.250
SOHCAHTOA.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.220
TOA.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.670
Opposite over adjacent.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.560
Tangent of theta is equal to
the opposite-- which is y--

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.320
over the adjacent-- which is x.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.340
And this is really
all you need.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.530
And if you wanted to go one
step further, and this is

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.640
actually something you
should write at the

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.490
side of your paper.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.800
How can we express y as
a function if we wanted

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.420
to go the other way?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.490
If we were given r and
theta, how could we get y?

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.790
Well, let's think about it.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.800
y-- if we want to know-- let's
see, if we are given r and y

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.160
and we want to figure out
theta-- what deals with the r

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.300
and the y, with respect to
theta? r is the hypotenuse

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.610
and y is the opposite.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.840
Let me write SOHCAHTOA down.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.710
So what deals with the
opposite and the hypotenuse?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.950
Sine.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:03.410
So the sine of theta is equal
to the opposite-- which is the

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.630
y side, which is equal to y--
over the hypotenuse,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.750
which is r.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.990
Equal to r.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.570
And so if you multiply both
sides by r, you get r

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.410
sine theta is equal to y.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.680
And then let's do
it the other way.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.840
What if we wanted to have an
equation for theta, r, and x?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.860
x is adjacent to the angle.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.335
r is still the hypotenuse.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:30.680
So what deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.820
Well, that's CAH.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.070
Cosine.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.530
So we have the cosine of theta
is equal to the adjacent,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.540
is equal to x, over the
hypotenuse, which is r.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.710
Multiply both sides by r
and you get x is equal

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.980
to r cosine theta.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.560
And really, when you're
equipped with this formula--

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.060
which really just comes from
our trig identities-- this

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.770
formula, which you know, is
similar, just comes

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.220
from SOHCAHTOA.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.090
This, which comes from
SOHCAHTOA-- and really

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.180
is, you know-- if you're
given these first.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.350
If you're given these two, you
can easily derive that one.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.920
And this one, which is just
the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.010
you're actually ready.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.010
You're fully equipped to
convert between polar and

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.030
rectangular coordinates.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.480
And we'll do that in the
next video, because I just

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.530
realized I'm out of time.
