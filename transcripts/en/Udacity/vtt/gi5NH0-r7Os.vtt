00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.920
Now that we know a little bit about
rates let's put them into use.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.750
For example, let's say we
have a waiter at a restaurant

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.040
who in three hours
time makes $40 in tips.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.560
So what I want to know is if we have
this waiter who makes $40 in three

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.040
hours, what is his tip rate?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.145
Enter your answer as a fraction with the
numerator here and denominator here and

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:20.560
don't forget your units.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.080
The words dollars and
hours should appear in your answers.
