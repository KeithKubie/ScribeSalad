[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.140
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.180
Next up for our auto advancing
slides is Wolff Dobson.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.650
He's told me to warn you all
that he'll probably be talking

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.149
like the Micro Machines guy.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.780
So this'll be great.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.648
Ready?

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.992
WOLFF DOBSON: Hello.

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:21.600
Oops, sorry.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
OK.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm Wolff Dobson.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.450
I'm a developer of
programs engineer.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.866
And I'm going to
talk to you about

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.410
bite-sized virtual reality.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.811
I'm going to talk really
fast, so let's all just enjoy

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.560
this moment of zen
until it auto-advances.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.532
All right.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:40.990
Cardboard was
Google's surprise way

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.674
to have virtual
reality experiences

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.090
just with the phone
in your pocket

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.420
and a few dollars' worth
of folded cardboard.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.740
We've been pushing the
entry cost for developers

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.739
to get into mobile VRs way down.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.405
I'm going to talk a
lot about Cardboard.

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.370
But first, I'm going to talk
about the uncanny valley.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.250
The uncanny valley is
the idea that things

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.897
that look kind of human are OK.

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:02.480
As you get closer
and closer to human,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.120
it starts getting
a little weird.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.620
Right.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.680
Oh god, I hate those guys.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.110
And it can be really creepy.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.460
This is the uncanny valley.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.990
And on the left, you've got
industrial robots and really

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.487
nice cartoons you like.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:19.070
And on the right, you have real
humans, which everybody likes.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.700
And then right in
the middle there

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.660
is the uncanny valley where--
oh god, that guy again!

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.910
I hate that guy.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.170
I'm going to posit the
same thing exists about VR.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.060
This is a pleasantness
curve that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.160
shows all the possible
experiences of VR

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.440
on various kinds of hardware.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.780
The left, low-fidelity stuff, on
the right, super high-fidelity

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.550
matrixy stuff.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.756
And in the middle,
there's this awkward thing

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.630
where you're going to
get weird looking stuff

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.030
like screen door visuals,
and motion sickness,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.720
and tracking latency.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.210
They're all emblematic of
that big dip in the VR valley.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.150
When you're gunning for
sensory replacement,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.430
you're telling people that
they're in another place.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.860
And you're teleporting them
to this alternate reality.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.780
The problem is every time
you deviate from reality--

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840
any kind of frame lag
or sensor freezes--

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.050
it'll make you unhappy.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.466
It makes you
recognize that you're

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.100
wearing some kind of
weird-looking mask

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.070
with the screen smashed
up against your face.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.611
And that can be a
little off-putting.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160
So Cardboard and similar
low-cost VR experiences

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.130
live comfortably on the
near side of the VR valley.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.060
These experiences
aren't cut-down versions

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.966
of high-grade VR.

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.340
They're just their
own experience

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.400
that has a different kind
of set of affordances.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.360
So as this lovely woman in a
matching phone and sweater set

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.210
will tell you--

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.840
--she's holding this
device up to her face.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.170
And her eyes can't turn
any faster than her spine.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.700
And she's also holding
her hands up to her face,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340
which gives her this
feeling like she's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.710
peering into something.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.240
And a peering mentality is
a very different experience

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.040
than feeling like
you're teleporting.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.290
It's like you're looking
into something, not replacing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410
your entire sensory
field, like an SLR camera

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.960
or, say, this 1861
megalethoscope that I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.510
found in a Stanford museum.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.040
So the point of all this is
holding Cardboard to your face

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.250
is not an infinite thing.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.300
You're going to put it down
because we don't have a strap.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.420
You're going to like--
[SIGH] my arms are tired.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.374
So what we're calling
this is bit-sized VR.

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:13.790
So let's take a
look at an example

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.970
that you have right now.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.670
Those of you who have
Google Maps on your phone

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.796
can try this yourself.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.170
This is just
regular Google Maps.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.040
If you click on
Street View, you'll

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.179
see that you can
see Street View.

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.470
And if you tap on this little
button in the lower left,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.845
you're in Look
Around mode, which

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.420
is you're using the
gyroscope to show

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.510
where you are in the space.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.000
If I double tap on that
button, it actually

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.420
puts it in VR mode,
which is really cool.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.849
And you should all try it.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.140
And outside of the fact that
that's really mind-blowing

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.681
that this is in your
pocket right now

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.348
and you can access
it any time you want,

00:03:46.348 --> 00:03:47.806
the thing that's
cool about is when

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:50.040
you're done looking, you
can just hit the Back button

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.020
and pop right back into 2D
land, where you can go back

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.270
to doing this manipulation
like Maps does

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.210
and go and find something else
to look at besides Notre Dame.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.140
So what about your mobile game?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.170
You might not be ready to run
your entire game in VR right

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.670
now.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.920
You many not have the controls
optimized around gaze.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.740
You might not have the commit
to performance on side-by-side

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.561
rendering.

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.810
But there's still a bunch
of really interesting things

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.230
you can do.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.550
So imagine you're making
a first-person shooter.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.940
For an onlooker, you might
want to make an experience

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.160
like being a security camera.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.546
You are in a stationary place.

00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:28.920
So your controls
are pretty easy,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.700
and you're just looking around
watching everybody shoot

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.520
at each other.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.255
I think that's
going to be awesome.

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.630
Another thing is
if you're making

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.300
"Kerbal Space Program" or some
other kind of game like that.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.910
I want to actually, after I'm
finished building my spaceship,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.621
actually stand on the
spaceship and look at things.

00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:43.870
That would be totally awesome.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.790
Likewise,
"RollerCoaster Tycoon"--

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.580
totally want to
experience what it's like

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.640
to ride on a roller coaster
that I've built myself.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.780
The trick is that you can mix
2D and 3D experiences side

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.240
by side-- 2D when you need
hands-on manipulation,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.790
when touch is the right
experience, 3D when you just

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.610
want to show something awesome
and look around and experience

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.197
it-- the big eyeball
kicks that you're

00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:05.530
going to get that you've
worked on your graphics so hard

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.640
in these games.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640
So let's get this going.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.940
This afternoon, we're
actually doing a code lab

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.523
where you can try
doing this yourself.

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:15.430
If you're using Unity, adding
VR to your game is really easy.

00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:20.100
I did the code lab myself
and was blown away--

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.829
like, man, this does
not take long at all.

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.745
No matter what, come
visit us here on the web.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:28.220
You can get SDKs for
Unity, Android, and Java.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.410
Think about what kind
of bit-sized experiences

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.070
that you can put in your game
and see what that's like.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.810
Ah!

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.330
Dammit-- that guy again.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.570
Anyway, thank you.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.860
