00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:09.516
&gt;&gt; Sally: Happy Birthday Dude.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:10.356
&gt;&gt; Dude: Geez Sally.

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.716
I can't believe you remembered!

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.616
Can I open this now?

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.046
&gt;&gt; Sally: Of course, I hope you like it.

00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:18.376
&gt;&gt; Dude: Sounds like it has parts!

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.586
&gt;&gt; Sally: I know how much
you like to build things.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:21.636
&gt;&gt; Dude: I think I know what it is.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:24.326
Will I have to keep this here in the lab?

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:26.456
&gt;&gt; Sally: Only if you want to.

00:00:26.456 --> 00:00:27.146
&gt;&gt; Dude: Awesome.

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:30.336
It's an electronics building kit.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.526
&gt;&gt; Sally: It has all the parts to build
a bug that scoots around on the floor.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.076
The box says the red laser eyes
will flash when it hears a voice.

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:39.206
Dude, do you like it?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:46.326
&gt;&gt; Dude: I do...I guess...but...well I thought
this might be the parts to build something real.

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:50.466
You know, something living...like a real
bug with red eyes and legs that move.

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:53.146
&gt;&gt; Sally: You thought the box had
parts for genetic programming?

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:56.536
&gt;&gt; Dude: Yeah...that's what
I really want to try.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:02.446
If I do OK snapping these wires and lights
together, can I get a genetics kit next?

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:04.066
&gt;&gt; Sally: I would love to give you that!

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.526
But there is no snap-together version.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.096
Here let me show you the closest thing.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:13.496
You know that all living things are
programmed by their DNA, their genomes.

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:17.806
And that DNA is made of four
kinds of nucleotides, G,A,T,C.

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:22.206
But even when we know the order of
every nucleotide in the master program,

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:25.206
we still don't completely
understand how the program works.

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:30.076
So it's not easy to snap together a new
genetic program that works predictably.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:35.306
To really program with DNA we'll need our
own programming language, one that allows us

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.306
to create our own grammar and vocabulary.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:41.596
We can call the words parts where each
part describes some biological function.

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:45.966
Here's a functional sequence I happen to know.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.235
&gt;&gt; Dude: Is that a real sequence?

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:48.856
&gt;&gt; Sally: What do you mean real?

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.235
It's really nucleotides.

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.765
&gt;&gt; Dude: I mean does it do anything?

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.015
Is it really a part?

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:54.966
&gt;&gt; Sally: It is.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:58.856
This one is a promoter, a piece
of DNA where the RNA polymerase

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:01.206
from the bacteriophage T7 can bind.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.906
&gt;&gt; Dude: But how did you know that?

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.166
How am I supposed to know that?

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.806
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude, that's the point!

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:07.386
&gt;&gt; Dude: What?

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:09.326
That you know more than me?!

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:09.985
&gt;&gt; Sally: No.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:14.186
Look. The point is that we can describe
the function of a sequence and catalog it

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.526
so you don't have to memorize sequences.

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:17.316
No one does.

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:25.736
Here, let's draw a black box around the
sequence itself and call it a promoter part.

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:26.946
&gt;&gt; Dude: Here, let me try?

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:27.106
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude!

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:28.466
&gt;&gt; Dude: No Sally, really.

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.926
Parts are only cool if they
can be snapped together.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:35.886
Even this electronics kit makes it easy to
hook the wires up to the battery and the LED.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.826
The instruction book gives me rules
for putting the parts together

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:40.926
so I don't short circuit or fry the thing.

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:46.555
Don't be mad but I really don't see how
biological parts will help me write a new

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:51.116
genetic program if there isn't an easy
way to put them together so they'll work.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:52.116
&gt;&gt; Sally: I'm not mad.

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.446
These are two really important
ideas, and you're exactly right.

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.836
No one knows the all rules for
reliably assembling genetic programs

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.836
but there are some ideas about
how to put the parts together.

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:02.696
Want to look?

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.606
&gt;&gt; Dude: Sure.

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.096
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well the parts
will need to be standardized

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:08.136
in some way so they can snap together.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:12.066
Let's look at BioBricks for one example.
