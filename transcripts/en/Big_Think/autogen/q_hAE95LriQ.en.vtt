00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:12.300
So let’s say brain science in 15, 20 years
really understands why a certain population

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.810
of people, say psychopaths, behave the way
they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, we know it, we got it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.500
let’s say we have figured out a treatment
for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;So you got the psychopath.&nbsp;&nbsp;He

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.199
has done the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold him responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
we’re at the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we treat him

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.680
or put in the slammer? Right, because we now
know if we can treat him they’re back to

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.540
the normal population, they’re back doing
normal things again. Does that satisfy in

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.210
us the sense of justice that should be done
to this person?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that satisfy our built

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.890
in sense of retribution, which I think humans
have in spades?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can people live with the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.780
fact that somebody who carried out a crime
against their family or their body or their

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.969
property is just simply fix the guy so he
doesn’t do that stuff anymore - or do they

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.962
want this other component and does that other
component?

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:18.969
That is the discussion we should be having.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
shouldn’t be confusing the fact that someone

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:27.640
with a slight or even a serious brain disorder,
are they responsible or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.289
have the legal category in our country, which
we don’t: guilty but insane, not not guilty

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:44.569
because insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should get the responsibility
issue clear and then as a society we have

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.530
to decide well what are we going to do about
that person and just think how interesting

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.020
it gets.
I think our time would be better spent trying

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.890
to sort that out because I think down the
pike there will be treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.139
be more effective treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason
why it isn’t a burning issue now is because

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:09.080
none of our so-called treatments or rehabs
or what have you are that great.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recidivism

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.670
rate just sits there around 63% no matter
what you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is just isolation

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
of just put people in institutions of one
kind or another.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.840
I think by clearing up this responsibility
question we focus on the real question of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.390
what does our society decide to do about this
person and that’s a tough one.
