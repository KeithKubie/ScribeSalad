00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
&gt;&gt;Ok today's number is 383...
&gt;&gt;At last!

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.800
I know there's number of people have been demanding...

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.020
No one has been demanding 383. This is one...

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.640
'Cause numberphile has, you know, grown over the years.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.540
And you've done all sorts of exciting numbers: e, pi...

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.980
All the all the big guys have been involved.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.820
But now I feel like we're losing touch with our roots.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.260
Not literal roots but like metaphorical.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.720
The simple numbers which made this channel what it was

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.580
And I think 383 is not an amazing number.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.360
It's not special number, or a great number.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.220
But we can't forget about the numbers that are day in day out

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.400
making maths work. So,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.680
the work horses of the number system.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260
383 is a prime.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.520
That's already amazing!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
It's already amazing.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.000
It's also a palindrome.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.160
Which is quite nice.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.260
It is the sum of the first 3 palindromic 3-digit primes.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.680
And so if you get the first 3,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.360
I think it's 101 is a 3-digit palindrome +

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.360
131 3-digit palindromic prime

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.500
+ 151 is the next one,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.040
that's the first 3 of them that equals 383.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.640
That's kind of cool. There's something going on there.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.620
You're not doing a very good job, making me think it isn't a special number.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.240
Well this is the great thing about numbers.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.040
Any semi-arbitrary number, if you dig into it, it's gonna have some cool properties.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.800
It's also the smallest number which is the sum of a prime and the reversal of the prime:

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.380
241 is a prime number

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.720
and if you add it to its digits in reverse order 142

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.220
it equals 383 which is itself prime.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
So the smallest number which is prime

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.780
and it's a prime number plus

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.640
the reverse of the digits of that prime number in base 10.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.920
That's kind of cool. That's a thing.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.240
It's a bit base ten-ny.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.740
In fact anything involving palindroms is a little bit base ten-ny.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.280
though, what will you gonna do?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.300
It's also a thing called a Woodall prime.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.640
And a Woodall prime... let's that so...good to get a different color...

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.500
A Woodall prime is a prime number.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.100
So Mersenne primes....

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.340
We all know and love Mersenne primes 2^n - 1.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.360
A Woodall prime is n2^n - 1.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.100
This is a Woodall prime

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:35.360
It's the 3rd Woodall prime. It is 6 x 2^6 - 1 = 383.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.000
&gt;&gt;And so if...
&gt;&gt;Did you forgot the ending 3 ?

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.960
I forgot the ending 3. I've been doing a lot today videos, you know

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.380
And the fact is that number is a palindrom but I've written over half of it, so I've got no excuses.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.880
So anyway right...

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.820
Woodall primes again, an unsung type of prime.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.440
Completely go on and on; we've done so many videos about Mersenne primes.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.260
Don't get me wrong, big fan.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.920
Woodall primes, have you ever heard them mentioned?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.100
I never hear them mentioned. I think they're great.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.200
And we do videos whenever we find a new Mersenne prime

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680
cos' they're the big ones. Everyone celebrates Mersenne primes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.680
We did a video when I printed it out. It was possibly over-the-top.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.080
Woodall primes, did you remember the last time we had a Woodal prime?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.540
See? No one does right? and yet we are still trying to find them.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.280
So quick bit of history.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.280
They were first named or used by Woodall,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.820
In fact, it was two guys, it was Cunningham and Woodhall in 1917.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.460
Which you will notice it exactly 100 years ago and so this is the centenary

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.220
We're in the centenary year of Woodall primes.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.800
And I imagine I mean a lot of people may be organizing Woodall prime parties.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.980
But I haven't been invited and I haven't heard about them.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.660
&gt;&gt;Matt, if it was one guy going, you'd be...
&gt;&gt;It's well-- I'd better be-- I'll be a little bit offended if I wasn't...

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.600
And so,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.800
I think in the centenary year of Woodall primes,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.680
we should celebrate the less significant

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.000
the less exciting the less well known

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.400
types of numbers.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.840
And so, 383 as a Woodall prime, I think we should be celebrating it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.820
in 1917. And what we can do

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.660
other than having parties, if you want to celebrate it,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.560
is to help us find another one.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960
The last time we found a world record

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.600
Woodall prime was in 2007

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.860
So the last one we found was in the 90th anniversary of Woodall primes.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.340
Wouldn't it be great to find another one

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.560
in the 100-year anniversary?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.160
On case you're wondering, the last one we found,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.520
the world record, is

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.960
3,752,948

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.980
- get that right - times 2^3,752,948 - 1.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.620
That a prime number and it has over a million,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.100
it's got 1,129,757 digits.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.720
That is a lot, that is the current biggest known Woodall prime.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.860
So I think we should try and find a better one.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.720
That was found, not by the great internet Mersenne prime search

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.380
because in their name as you can tell they're

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.720
all that Mersenne numbers.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.220
They have no respect, they don't give any attention

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.360
to the smaller types of primes.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.880
There is another organization called PrimeGrid.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.220
And PrimeGrid deal with all the other primes

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.400
that the Mersenne guys forgot about.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.740
So people are running a very simple thing

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.760
you can download the thing, you run it on your computer,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.780
your computer would check bigger and bigger Woodall numbers,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280
to see if any of them are prime

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.860
if enough computers maybe will do PrimeGrid, I mean i do.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.840
As I speak there is a computer in my office,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that I built solely to run PrimeGrid

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.380
to try and find... I haven't found any yet...

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.860
to try and find these. And they do lots of other types of prime numbers.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.580
You can let your computer in it's downtime help us celebrate

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.620
in the 100-year anniversary some unsung prime numbers.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.900
Thank you for watching this video,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.080
and thank you to squarespace for supporting up.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.940
I use squarespace almost every day

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.419
and I'd like to tell you why

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.219
basically it makes my life easier both

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.940
for business and creatively. There's no fuss,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.300
it's quick, and it makes my websites

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.300
look better than anything I could do on my own.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.960
They have award-winning templates

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.780
to get you started and they're fantastic from the word go.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.020
But if you're one of those people that likes to tweak things

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.320
you do have some freedom to do some customization as well.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.380
So whatever your next move on the web is you really

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.039
couldn't do better than have everything

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.050
in one place from the domain to the

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.699
website building and you'll find all

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.280
of that at squarespace.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.620
It's really the definition of all-in-one a one-stop shop

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.080
but with 24 7 customer support if you

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.159
need a helping hand.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.899
I already have three projects running on

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.729
squarespace with more in the works and

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.169
you can check them out at

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.260
squarespace.com/numberphile.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.719
That'll make sure they know you came from here

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:52.800
which helps us out

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.720
there's ten percent of your first order

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.460
using the URL squarespace.com/numberphile.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.780
And you can use the code

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.949
numberphile on check out that's what ten

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.869
percent off and i thank to squarespace

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:05.460
for supporting this video.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.640
Most another to get all the glory partly because

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.220
they're linked to perfect numbers in

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.380
fact that's why we care about them in the first place.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.740
And now it's because they're easy.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.340
And they hold I think they've either got all or 9/10

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.780
of the top 10 biggest primes are all Mersenne primes, cos' they're easy to find, right.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.840
And the people ch... peoples go for glory

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.960
all they care about are the biggest ones.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.700
They go and pick off the Mersenne primes,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.600
where these other ones, they're not as easy to find, right.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.300
And they know that this is about...

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.480
Well this is well below, right.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.620
This is an order of magnitude fewer digits

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.280
than the current world-record Mersenne prime.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.100
And I think it's a shame

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.240
that we knew size isn't everything.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.500
We should be looking for these other interesting numbers.
