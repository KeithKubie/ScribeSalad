00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.139
 
so we're gonna do chemistry today just

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149
so we're gonna do chemistry today just
 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.670
so we're gonna do chemistry today just
kidding I can't do any chemistry but

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
kidding I can't do any chemistry but
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.889
kidding I can't do any chemistry but
this one is for the chemist because

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
this one is for the chemist because
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.880
this one is for the chemist because
we're gonna talk about something called

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
we're gonna talk about something called
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.919
we're gonna talk about something called
the centrifuge problem okay so the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
the centrifuge problem okay so the
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.780
the centrifuge problem okay so the
centrifuge is this thing that chemists

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
centrifuge is this thing that chemists
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.850
centrifuge is this thing that chemists
used to take test tubes and they spin

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
used to take test tubes and they spin
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.110
used to take test tubes and they spin
them to separate the contents of the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
them to separate the contents of the
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.609
them to separate the contents of the
test tube because it's something that's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
test tube because it's something that's
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500
test tube because it's something that's
spinning at a very high speed it needs

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510
spinning at a very high speed it needs
 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.029
spinning at a very high speed it needs
to be balanced in order to work

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
to be balanced in order to work
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950
to be balanced in order to work
effectively and so here's what the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
effectively and so here's what the
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990
effectively and so here's what the
centrifuge problem is if you have a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
centrifuge problem is if you have a
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.529
centrifuge problem is if you have a
centrifuge we say n holes let's say six

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
centrifuge we say n holes let's say six
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.589
centrifuge we say n holes let's say six
and you have K test tubes is it possible

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
and you have K test tubes is it possible
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510
and you have K test tubes is it possible
to balance the centrifuge

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
to balance the centrifuge
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430
to balance the centrifuge
that's the question let's assume they're

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
that's the question let's assume they're
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290
that's the question let's assume they're
evenly spaced and on the edge let's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
evenly spaced and on the edge let's
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.580
evenly spaced and on the edge let's
assume the test tubes all have the same

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
assume the test tubes all have the same
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380
assume the test tubes all have the same
way it's that kind of thing just to sort

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
way it's that kind of thing just to sort
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930
way it's that kind of thing just to sort
of idealize the problem it's hard enough

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
of idealize the problem it's hard enough
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.569
of idealize the problem it's hard enough
as it so that's the problem so if you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
as it so that's the problem so if you
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340
as it so that's the problem so if you
look at this example so I've drawn this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
look at this example so I've drawn this
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.799
look at this example so I've drawn this
example with N equals 6 if K was equal

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
example with N equals 6 if K was equal
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.200
example with N equals 6 if K was equal
to 1 we have no chance if you only have

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
to 1 we have no chance if you only have
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790
to 1 we have no chance if you only have
one test tube and you try and balance

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
one test tube and you try and balance
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.139
one test tube and you try and balance
this thing you're never gonna make it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
this thing you're never gonna make it
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.590
this thing you're never gonna make it
work

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
work
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420
work
right because one side will be weighted

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
right because one side will be weighted
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920
right because one side will be weighted
because it's got the only test tube in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
because it's got the only test tube in
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689
because it's got the only test tube in
there so we can't balance it with one

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
there so we can't balance it with one
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750
there so we can't balance it with one
right but we can balance it with two we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
right but we can balance it with two we
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250
right but we can balance it with two we
just put them opposite each other

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
just put them opposite each other
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590
just put them opposite each other
okay so k equals 2 we can do and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
okay so k equals 2 we can do and
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
okay so k equals 2 we can do and
similarly for 3 you could imagine

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
similarly for 3 you could imagine
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850
similarly for 3 you could imagine
putting one here one here and one there

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
putting one here one here and one there
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160
putting one here one here and one there
and then the centrifuge will be balanced

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
and then the centrifuge will be balanced
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870
and then the centrifuge will be balanced
because they're evenly spaced along the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
because they're evenly spaced along the
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450
because they're evenly spaced along the
border and so k equals 3 we can do it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
border and so k equals 3 we can do it
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.960
border and so k equals 3 we can do it
and for K equals 4 you might not see

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
and for K equals 4 you might not see
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.030
and for K equals 4 you might not see
right away that K equals 4 can be done

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
right away that K equals 4 can be done
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.850
right away that K equals 4 can be done
but here's the thing k equals 4 trying

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
but here's the thing k equals 4 trying
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890
but here's the thing k equals 4 trying
to balance that is the same problem as

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
to balance that is the same problem as
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140
to balance that is the same problem as
trying to balance k equals 2 right

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
trying to balance k equals 2 right
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.899
trying to balance k equals 2 right
because if we have six spots total then

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
because if we have six spots total then
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240
because if we have six spots total then
missing two spots has the same weight

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
missing two spots has the same weight
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880
missing two spots has the same weight
balances filling two spots alright so if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
balances filling two spots alright so if
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.999
balances filling two spots alright so if
K is equal to 4 we can do it and maybe

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
K is equal to 4 we can do it and maybe
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.249
K is equal to 4 we can do it and maybe
you either see that directly or you can

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
you either see that directly or you can
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.359
you either see that directly or you can
think of it as being sort of the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
think of it as being sort of the
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.789
think of it as being sort of the
opposite of doing two test tubes right

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
opposite of doing two test tubes right
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980
opposite of doing two test tubes right
so rather than filling two I'm leaving

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
so rather than filling two I'm leaving
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.050
so rather than filling two I'm leaving
too empty so if one of them balances it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
too empty so if one of them balances it
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480
too empty so if one of them balances it
then so will the other okay so yes we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
then so will the other okay so yes we
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060
then so will the other okay so yes we
can do k equals 4 and for k equals 5

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
can do k equals 4 and for k equals 5
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179
can do k equals 4 and for k equals 5
though we again have no chance for the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
though we again have no chance for the
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.429
though we again have no chance for the
same reason as k equals 1 which is that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
same reason as k equals 1 which is that
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010
same reason as k equals 1 which is that
if we leave one empty then there's no

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
if we leave one empty then there's no
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.569
if we leave one empty then there's no
chance of balancing this thing and of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
chance of balancing this thing and of
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310
chance of balancing this thing and of
course with 6 then we just fill every

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
course with 6 then we just fill every
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.290
course with 6 then we just fill every
spot so right away if

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
spot so right away if
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300
spot so right away if
six we see that one in five are the bad

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
six we see that one in five are the bad
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.370
six we see that one in five are the bad
configurations everything else is okay

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
configurations everything else is okay
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.080
configurations everything else is okay
and if you're me and you like prime

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
and if you're me and you like prime
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.060
and if you're me and you like prime
numbers the first thing you think to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
numbers the first thing you think to
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.460
numbers the first thing you think to
yourself as well I see exactly when it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
yourself as well I see exactly when it
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.420
yourself as well I see exactly when it
can be done it's when K and n have some

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
can be done it's when K and n have some
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.020
can be done it's when K and n have some
common factor right because one in six

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
common factor right because one in six
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.430
common factor right because one in six
they don't have a common prime factor

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
they don't have a common prime factor
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440
they don't have a common prime factor
five and six don't have a common prime

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
five and six don't have a common prime
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.090
five and six don't have a common prime
factor but every other number on this

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
factor but every other number on this
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220
factor but every other number on this
list does have a common factor with six

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
list does have a common factor with six
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.680
list does have a common factor with six
that was my guess when I first saw this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
that was my guess when I first saw this
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.230
that was my guess when I first saw this
problem and before I tell you how well

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
problem and before I tell you how well
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.570
problem and before I tell you how well
my guess does let me point out two

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
my guess does let me point out two
 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.000
my guess does let me point out two
things so one is that we've already

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
things so one is that we've already
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.920
things so one is that we've already
discussed which is doing this for K

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
discussed which is doing this for K
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.840
discussed which is doing this for K
tubes is the same as doing it for n

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
tubes is the same as doing it for n
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.720
tubes is the same as doing it for n
minus K tubes all right so if I can do

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
minus K tubes all right so if I can do
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790
minus K tubes all right so if I can do
it for safe and a six if I can do it for

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
it for safe and a six if I can do it for
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.620
it for safe and a six if I can do it for
one I can do it for five if I can't do

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
one I can do it for five if I can't do
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.180
one I can do it for five if I can't do
it for one I can't do it for five and so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190
it for one I can't do it for five and so
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.910
it for one I can't do it for five and so
on so that's one thing to notice maybe a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
on so that's one thing to notice maybe a
 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680
on so that's one thing to notice maybe a
more interesting thing to notice is that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
more interesting thing to notice is that
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.430
more interesting thing to notice is that
we can add up configurations right so if

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
we can add up configurations right so if
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.340
we can add up configurations right so if
I can balance some number of tubes okay

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
I can balance some number of tubes okay
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.250
I can balance some number of tubes okay
put them in the centrifuge it's balanced

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
put them in the centrifuge it's balanced
 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.900
put them in the centrifuge it's balanced
now if I have additional tubes and I can

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910
now if I have additional tubes and I can
 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.270
now if I have additional tubes and I can
balance those then just add them in and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
balance those then just add them in and
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.790
balance those then just add them in and
I again stay balanced right because it's

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
I again stay balanced right because it's
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.979
I again stay balanced right because it's
like adding zero to zero if you were

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
like adding zero to zero if you were
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.090
like adding zero to zero if you were
balanced and then you add another

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100
balanced and then you add another
 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.280
balanced and then you add another
balanced configuration on top of it you

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
balanced configuration on top of it you
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050
balanced configuration on top of it you
stay balanced if we want to think about

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
stay balanced if we want to think about
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.360
stay balanced if we want to think about
the K equals for example another way to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
the K equals for example another way to
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.120
the K equals for example another way to
think about it is two plus two I put one

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130
think about it is two plus two I put one
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.340
think about it is two plus two I put one
configuration here that's balanced and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
configuration here that's balanced and
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.360
configuration here that's balanced and
then I can choose any other

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
then I can choose any other
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.830
then I can choose any other
configuration that's balanced for the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
configuration that's balanced for the
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.720
configuration that's balanced for the
other two and this will always work this

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
other two and this will always work this
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.850
other two and this will always work this
adding configurations so long as there

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860
adding configurations so long as there
 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.590
adding configurations so long as there
is room for it in this example the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
is room for it in this example the
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.300
is room for it in this example the
numbers are small and it's kind of okay

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310
numbers are small and it's kind of okay
 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.710
numbers are small and it's kind of okay
there's a lot of room in the centrifuge

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720
there's a lot of room in the centrifuge
 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.620
there's a lot of room in the centrifuge
but it's not always gonna be true okay

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
but it's not always gonna be true okay
 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.780
but it's not always gonna be true okay
okay all right so here's why I'm wrong

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790
okay all right so here's why I'm wrong
 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.750
okay all right so here's why I'm wrong
let's do an example with 12 spots let's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
let's do an example with 12 spots let's
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.330
let's do an example with 12 spots let's
pretend these are all evenly spaced like

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340
pretend these are all evenly spaced like
 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.880
pretend these are all evenly spaced like
before and so now we have N equals 12

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890
before and so now we have N equals 12
 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.240
before and so now we have N equals 12
and I claim that we can actually balance

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
and I claim that we can actually balance
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.000
and I claim that we can actually balance
this with seven tubes

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010
 
 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.949
 
no common factors with 12 in fact it's a

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959
no common factors with 12 in fact it's a
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.540
no common factors with 12 in fact it's a
prime number and it's not any of the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550
prime number and it's not any of the
 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.640
prime number and it's not any of the
Prime's that divide 12 and it looks kind

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
Prime's that divide 12 and it looks kind
 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.110
Prime's that divide 12 and it looks kind
of weird right like I can't really

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
of weird right like I can't really
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.590
of weird right like I can't really
visualize putting seven dots in here to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
visualize putting seven dots in here to
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.330
visualize putting seven dots in here to
balance this thing but think about what

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
balance this thing but think about what
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.460
balance this thing but think about what
I said a minute

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470
I said a minute
 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.129
I said a minute
about adding configurations if I can do

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139
about adding configurations if I can do
 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.679
about adding configurations if I can do
three in a balanced way and I can do

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:26.689
three in a balanced way and I can do
 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.350
three in a balanced way and I can do
four in a balanced way as long as I can

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
four in a balanced way as long as I can
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.610
four in a balanced way as long as I can
put them in here so they don't overlap

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620
put them in here so they don't overlap
 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.249
put them in here so they don't overlap
then I can do it and that's exactly how

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259
then I can do it and that's exactly how
 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.170
then I can do it and that's exactly how
we'll do this because three divides 12 I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180
we'll do this because three divides 12 I
 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.300
we'll do this because three divides 12 I
can just put them every four spots so

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310
can just put them every four spots so
 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.189
can just put them every four spots so
there's three that are balanced and same

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199
there's three that are balanced and same
 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.420
there's three that are balanced and same
thing with four I can just put them

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
thing with four I can just put them
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.129
thing with four I can just put them
every three spots and get something

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139
every three spots and get something
 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.129
every three spots and get something
balanced so we'll put say one here one

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139
balanced so we'll put say one here one
 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.309
balanced so we'll put say one here one
two three one two oh that's not gonna

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319
two three one two oh that's not gonna
 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.679
two three one two oh that's not gonna
work it's already filled right so let's

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689
work it's already filled right so let's
 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:51.219
work it's already filled right so let's
start again

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229
start again
 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.670
start again
so can I do it by skipping every three

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680
so can I do it by skipping every three
 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.369
so can I do it by skipping every three
well if I start here I run into a filled

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379
well if I start here I run into a filled
 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.100
well if I start here I run into a filled
spot we already tried starting here and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110
spot we already tried starting here and
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.159
spot we already tried starting here and
I ran into a filled spot if I start here

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169
I ran into a filled spot if I start here
 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.809
I ran into a filled spot if I start here
I'm gonna run into a filled spot over

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819
I'm gonna run into a filled spot over
 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.089
I'm gonna run into a filled spot over
here so that configuration isn't gonna

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099
here so that configuration isn't gonna
 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.040
here so that configuration isn't gonna
work but it turns out there's actually a

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
work but it turns out there's actually a
 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.990
work but it turns out there's actually a
different four configuration that will

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000
different four configuration that will
 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.519
different four configuration that will
work and the reason we know that is

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:12.529
work and the reason we know that is
 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.670
work and the reason we know that is
because 4 is 2 plus 2 right so let's not

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680
because 4 is 2 plus 2 right so let's not
 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.420
because 4 is 2 plus 2 right so let's not
do 4

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430
do 4
 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.700
do 4
let's do 2 pairs of opposite tubes

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710
let's do 2 pairs of opposite tubes
 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.189
let's do 2 pairs of opposite tubes
here's one opposite pair and here's

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199
here's one opposite pair and here's
 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.290
here's one opposite pair and here's
another opposite pair and so even though

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300
another opposite pair and so even though
 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.909
another opposite pair and so even though
this looks kind of strange I guess we've

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919
this looks kind of strange I guess we've
 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.850
this looks kind of strange I guess we've
got 3 here and then 2 spaces and then

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
got 3 here and then 2 spaces and then
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.610
got 3 here and then 2 spaces and then
1/2 and then a space even though this

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
1/2 and then a space even though this
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.980
1/2 and then a space even though this
configuration looks kind of strange we

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
configuration looks kind of strange we
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.050
configuration looks kind of strange we
know for sure it's balanced because it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060
know for sure it's balanced because it
 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.309
know for sure it's balanced because it
was the sum of three balanced

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319
was the sum of three balanced
 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.140
was the sum of three balanced
configurations yeah it's not obvious

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150
configurations yeah it's not obvious
 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.640
configurations yeah it's not obvious
even after you do it looking at it

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650
even after you do it looking at it
 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.339
even after you do it looking at it
you're like I don't know how do I tell

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349
you're like I don't know how do I tell
 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.170
you're like I don't know how do I tell
but because we built it up from balanced

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180
but because we built it up from balanced
 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.939
but because we built it up from balanced
configurations we know that it's

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949
configurations we know that it's
 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.860
configurations we know that it's
balanced so when you say balanced just I

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
balanced so when you say balanced just I
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.399
balanced so when you say balanced just I
could I could pin yes that's right

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409
could I could pin yes that's right
 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.990
could I could pin yes that's right
that's right I mean if you want to talk

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000
that's right I mean if you want to talk
 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.459
that's right I mean if you want to talk
about centers of mass and that kind of

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469
about centers of mass and that kind of
 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.019
about centers of mass and that kind of
thing you should probably talk to a

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029
thing you should probably talk to a
 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.950
thing you should probably talk to a
physicist for me I'll tell you the

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960
physicist for me I'll tell you the
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.689
physicist for me I'll tell you the
mathematical interpretation of this

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699
mathematical interpretation of this
 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.279
mathematical interpretation of this
we've talked about complex numbers

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289
we've talked about complex numbers
 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.140
we've talked about complex numbers
before and we've talked about the

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150
before and we've talked about the
 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.540
before and we've talked about the
complex plane before so remember a

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550
complex plane before so remember a
 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.790
complex plane before so remember a
complex number is a real number plus

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800
complex number is a real number plus
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.159
complex number is a real number plus
another real number times this eye and

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169
another real number times this eye and
 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.050
another real number times this eye and
the way we visualize it on the plane is

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060
the way we visualize it on the plane is
 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.420
the way we visualize it on the plane is
just using the coordinates for the first

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
just using the coordinates for the first
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.829
just using the coordinates for the first
and second real number which I've

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839
and second real number which I've
 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.320
and second real number which I've
written is a and B so here's my like a

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330
written is a and B so here's my like a
 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.200
written is a and B so here's my like a
and B so if I draw a circle on this

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210
and B so if I draw a circle on this
 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.329
and B so if I draw a circle on this
plane that centered at 0 and goes

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:28.339
plane that centered at 0 and goes
 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.279
plane that centered at 0 and goes
through the point 1 then I can draw this

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289
through the point 1 then I can draw this
 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.980
through the point 1 then I can draw this
centrifuge as a bunch of points on this

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990
centrifuge as a bunch of points on this
 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.719
centrifuge as a bunch of points on this
circle let me do the 6th one it's

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729
circle let me do the 6th one it's
 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.059
circle let me do the 6th one it's
easier and it turns out that you can

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069
easier and it turns out that you can
 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.189
easier and it turns out that you can
always write these complex numbers in

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199
always write these complex numbers in
 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.839
always write these complex numbers in
terms of the first one so let's say this

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849
terms of the first one so let's say this
 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.619
terms of the first one so let's say this
is Z then this is Z squared this is Z

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629
is Z then this is Z squared this is Z
 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.379
is Z then this is Z squared this is Z
cubed which is minus 1 actually this is

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389
cubed which is minus 1 actually this is
 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.360
cubed which is minus 1 actually this is
Z to the fourth and this is Z to the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370
Z to the fourth and this is Z to the
 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.010
Z to the fourth and this is Z to the
fifth and so the mathematical

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020
fifth and so the mathematical
 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.829
fifth and so the mathematical
translation of this problem is can I add

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:53.839
translation of this problem is can I add
 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.640
translation of this problem is can I add
together powers of that one number Z and

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650
together powers of that one number Z and
 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.730
together powers of that one number Z and
get 0 our very first configuration this

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740
get 0 our very first configuration this
 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.489
get 0 our very first configuration this
was when we had four tubes in six spots

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:03.499
was when we had four tubes in six spots
 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:07.239
was when we had four tubes in six spots
right this is the same as saying so I

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:07.249
right this is the same as saying so I
 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:08.559
right this is the same as saying so I
have to rotate this picture a little bit

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569
have to rotate this picture a little bit
 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.809
have to rotate this picture a little bit
let's say this is my Z this is the same

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819
let's say this is my Z this is the same
 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.739
let's say this is my Z this is the same
as saying Z plus Z squared plus and then

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:14.749
as saying Z plus Z squared plus and then
 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.480
as saying Z plus Z squared plus and then
I skipped a spot and then Z to the

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490
I skipped a spot and then Z to the
 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.709
I skipped a spot and then Z to the
fourth plus Z to the fifth is equal to

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:20.719
fourth plus Z to the fifth is equal to
 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:24.399
fourth plus Z to the fifth is equal to
zero for that particular complex number

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.409
zero for that particular complex number
 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.379
zero for that particular complex number
ok and so the way that you actually

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389
ok and so the way that you actually
 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.029
ok and so the way that you actually
prove this is by showing that certain

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039
prove this is by showing that certain
 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.029
prove this is by showing that certain
combinations like this of powers of some

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039
combinations like this of powers of some
 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.999
combinations like this of powers of some
complex numbers can add up to zero but

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009
complex numbers can add up to zero but
 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:35.350
complex numbers can add up to zero but
let's actually go back to the original

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360
let's actually go back to the original
 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.129
let's actually go back to the original
thing so we thought maybe at first that

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:39.139
thing so we thought maybe at first that
 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:41.350
thing so we thought maybe at first that
the answer was having a factor in common

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360
the answer was having a factor in common
 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.749
the answer was having a factor in common
a prime factor in common now we know

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759
a prime factor in common now we know
 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.209
a prime factor in common now we know
that that's not true but it turns out

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:46.219
that that's not true but it turns out
 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.760
that that's not true but it turns out
that your next guess is true which is if

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770
that your next guess is true which is if
 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.409
that your next guess is true which is if
you think about this process what did we

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:50.419
you think about this process what did we
 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.709
you think about this process what did we
do we took the number of tubes we had we

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:53.719
do we took the number of tubes we had we
 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:55.869
do we took the number of tubes we had we
broke it down into prime factors and

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879
broke it down into prime factors and
 

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:58.089
broke it down into prime factors and
those we knew we could balance right

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:58.099
those we knew we could balance right
 

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.519
those we knew we could balance right
just by spacing them evenly as long as

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:00.529
just by spacing them evenly as long as
 

00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:02.920
just by spacing them evenly as long as
there was no overlap and it turns out

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:02.930
there was no overlap and it turns out
 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.779
there was no overlap and it turns out
that's exactly when this will work is

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:04.789
that's exactly when this will work is
 

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:07.269
that's exactly when this will work is
that you can balance the centrifuge if

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:07.279
that you can balance the centrifuge if
 

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.059
that you can balance the centrifuge if
and only if both the number of

00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:10.069
and only if both the number of
 

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:11.709
and only if both the number of
test-tubes you have which I've called K

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719
test-tubes you have which I've called K
 

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:14.889
test-tubes you have which I've called K
and the number of empty spots which is n

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:14.899
and the number of empty spots which is n
 

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:18.010
and the number of empty spots which is n
minus K can be written as sums of prime

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.020
minus K can be written as sums of prime
 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.110
minus K can be written as sums of prime
factors of n so let's look at this N

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120
factors of n so let's look at this N
 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.070
factors of n so let's look at this N
equals 6

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080
equals 6
 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.829
equals 6
so 1 is not possible to write as a sum

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:23.839
so 1 is not possible to write as a sum
 

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:25.659
so 1 is not possible to write as a sum
of prime factors of n because the prime

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:25.669
of prime factors of n because the prime
 

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.909
of prime factors of n because the prime
factors are 2 and 3 remember we need

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919
factors are 2 and 3 remember we need
 

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.209
factors are 2 and 3 remember we need
both K and n minus K to be written that

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:31.219
both K and n minus K to be written that
 

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:35.319
both K and n minus K to be written that
way so 2 can be + 4 is 2 plus 2 3 can be

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:35.329
way so 2 can be + 4 is 2 plus 2 3 can be
 

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:38.409
way so 2 can be + 4 is 2 plus 2 3 can be
n minus K is 3 which is also the prime

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:38.419
n minus K is 3 which is also the prime
 

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.449
n minus K is 3 which is also the prime
factor of n K equals 4 we've already

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:40.459
factor of n K equals 4 we've already
 

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:42.880
factor of n K equals 4 we've already
checked an N minus 4 is 2 we've already

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:42.890
checked an N minus 4 is 2 we've already
 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.790
checked an N minus 4 is 2 we've already
checked that 1 2 5 can't be done even

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800
checked that 1 2 5 can't be done even
 

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.480
checked that 1 2 5 can't be done even
though 5 is 2 plus 3

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.490
though 5 is 2 plus 3
 

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.910
though 5 is 2 plus 3
- five is one which can't be written as

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920
- five is one which can't be written as
 

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.980
- five is one which can't be written as
a sum of prime factors of n and so this

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:51.990
a sum of prime factors of n and so this
 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.410
a sum of prime factors of n and so this
condition of whether or not the number

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.420
condition of whether or not the number
 

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.139
condition of whether or not the number
of test-tubes and the number of missing

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:57.149
of test-tubes and the number of missing
 

00:08:57.149 --> 00:08:58.880
of test-tubes and the number of missing
spots can be written as a sum of prime

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:58.890
spots can be written as a sum of prime
 

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.820
spots can be written as a sum of prime
factors of the number of holes is

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:00.830
factors of the number of holes is
 

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.540

that kind of study if you can change
 

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.810
that kind of study if you can change
something just a little bit and get back
