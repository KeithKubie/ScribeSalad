&gt;&gt; Okay. So I work for the Research Discovery
and Innovation, formerly office of Research

00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:15.766
and Discovery, formerly the office for
the senior Vice President of Research.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.606
[Laughter] Started out as an opera singer.

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:22.076
I did that for 15 years.

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:24.086
Well I'm still doing it.

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:28.976
And it's only been in the last three years
where I've started to do musical theater.

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:39.216
So this is Elf'd, a production, and
it is based on the Will Farrell movie.

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:47.056
And but the Gaslight tradition is we take
something in the popular culture or you know,

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:51.546
just classic stories and then
we turn them into melodrama.

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:56.976
And I play the Chester, the toy store manager.

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:06.176
I talk to the bosses that be and they're
very supportive of what I do here.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:08.546
I come here to rehearsal.

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:11.046
And then go back and stay later.

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:14.576
I call this place the theatrical
love of my life.

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.606
It's -- yeah it's -- I love this place.
