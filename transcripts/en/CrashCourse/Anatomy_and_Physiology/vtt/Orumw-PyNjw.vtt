00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.239
When you hear about your “organs,” you
probably think of your heart, or your liver,

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.860
or your lungs. Maybe you picture Captain Nemo
playing the organ aboard the Nautilus. Why

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.419
do they have an organ on a submarine? That
is - that doesn’t make any sense.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.780
But your first associations with that term
probably overlook your biggest organ.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.099
I’m talking about your skin.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.019
The glorious fleshy shroud that keeps the
world out, and you in.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.759
Your skin protects your body against infection
and extreme temperatures, maintains your balance

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.869
of fluids, and even synthesizes vitamin D
for your own personal use.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.090
Its many nerve endings allow you to sense
the outside world, and its sweat glands and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.600
blood vessels help you maintain a proper temperature
and communicate a whole range of stuff -- from

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.770
your health to your emotions -- through things
like blushing, and flushing, and sweating.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.289
It also accounts for about 3 to 5 kilograms
of your body weight, and if you could spread

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.020
it out, it would measure up to two square
meters, enough to cover your bed -- the most

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.949
disgusting, paper-towel-thin, waterproof,
insulating, stretchy, self-repairing, lifetime-lasting

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:57.859
quilt on the planet!

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.519
It comes in lots of different colors, you
can cover it up, or show it off, or tattoo

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.850
the periodic table on it if you want. And
of course, without it, you would basically

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.470
shrivel up and die in no time.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.220
Together with your hair, nails, and sweat and oil
glands, your skin forms your integumentary system.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.250
And if you’ve ever been burned, or had surgery,
or stepped on a nail, you know how fast complications

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.640
arise when it gets damaged.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.720
But it also heals up quite quickly.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.860
LAYERS.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.500
Like an everlasting gobstopper, the key to
your integumentary system is layers.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.420
And although you can’t tell by looking at
it, your skin actually has three of them,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.520
each with particular types of cells that have
their own skin jobs, to borrow a phrase from

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.110
Blade Runner or BSG… whichever you like!

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.009
The epidermis is the only layer you can actually
see, assuming that your skin is intact, which is

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.719
why it’s what you think of, when you think of “skin.”
It’s made of stratified squamous epithelial tissue.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.130
But the dermis just below it is where most
of the work that skin does gets done, like

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.060
sweating, and circulating blood, and feeling
everything everywhere all the time. And at

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.860
the bottom there’s the subcutis, or hypodermis,
composed mostly of adipose or fatty tissue.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.300
Each of these layers owes its properties -- and
its ability to do its “skin job” -- to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.580
its unique combination of cells.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.160
The bulk of your epidermis, for example, is
made up of cells called keratinocytes, which

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.660
are the building blocks of that tough, fibrous
protein keratin that gives structure, durability,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.580
and waterproofing to your hair, nails, and
outer skin.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.690
These cells are constantly dying and being
replaced -- you lose millions of them every

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.350
day, enough to completely replace your epidermis
every 4 to 6 weeks.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.360
That’s why if you want to tell the world
you love your mom or commemorate your favorite

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.520
famous physiologist with a tattoo you gotta
make sure the ink gets below the epidermis.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.640
If there’s a cell in the human body that’s
been responsible for causing the most pride

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.870
and the most prejudice in human history, it’s
another epidermal cell: the melanocyte, the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.110
spider-shaped cell that synthesizes melanin,
the pigment that gives skin its color.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.360
I’ll spend more time later talking about
why skin color differs around the world, but

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.330
one thing to keep in mind is that both the
very palest and the very darkest human skins

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.130
on the planet have about the same number of
melanocytes.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.880
Your particular color isn’t about the number
of these cells that you have, but instead

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.700
about the breadth of their spidery cellular
extensions, which in turn affect the amount

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.190
of melanin that they contain.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.370
But on a cellular level, we’re all the same.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.500
Now, your skin, obviously, is also your first
line of defense when it comes to protecting

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.550
you from the outside world. So it may not
come as a surprise that you have lots of immune

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.260
system cells in your epidermis as well.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.320
These are your dendritic, or Langerhans cells,
which are kinda star-shaped, and like white

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.590
blood cells and platelets, they actually originate
in your bone marrow. Once they migrate to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.900
the epidermis, their long, skinny tendrils
run around the keratinocytes and spend much

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.130
of their time ingesting the unwanted invaders
that are trying to sneak around your skin.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.530
Finally, rounding out the quartet of epidermal
cells, your tactile, or Merkel cells occur

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.290
deep down at the boundary between the epidermis
and the dermis, where they combine with nerve

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.940
endings to create a sensory receptor for touch.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.130
What’s a little weird, though, is that all
these cells are all organized differently

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.400
in the skin that covers your body. In fact, in some
places, you have more layers of epidermis than others.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.900
Your thick skin -- and yes, that’s what
it’s really called -- is the tougher stuff

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.590
on the palms of your hands and the soles your
feet, and it consists of five epidermal layers.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.350
Your thin skin covers everything else, with
just four.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.110
To get to know what’s going on with your
thick skin, let’s just imagine you’re

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.980
walking around barefoot in the yard, when
suddenly you feel a shooting pain.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.520
You’ve just stepped on a big ol’ nail,
and it’s penetrated all of the layers of

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.180
your epidermis.
First it pierced your stratum corneum, which

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.250
means -- pardon my Latin -- “horny layer.”
This is the outermost layer and also the roughest,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.940
made up of about 20 or 30 sheets of dead keratinocyte
cells. This is the layer that you’re always sloughing

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.240
off and feeding to dust mites, but while it’s in place
it offers basic protection from environmental threats.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.410
From there, the nail drives through your stratum
lucidum, or “clear layer.” This holds

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.720
two or three rows of clear, flat, dead keratinocytes
that are only found in the thick skin of your

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.620
palms and foot soles. So, in places where you only
have thin skin, this layer is what’s missing.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.180
Things start to get more serious in the “granular
layer” or stratum granulosum, because this

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.200
contains living keratinocytes that are forming
keratin like crazy. This layer looks kind

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.110
of grainy because those cells are getting
compressed and flattened as they move up through

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.620
the epidermal layers, maturing as they go.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.320
The deeper you go through the layers of the
epidermis, the younger the cells get. Regeneration

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.050
happens in the lower layers, and new cells
move up toward the surface, maturing along

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.080
the way, where they eventually die and slough
off from the surface of your skin.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.660
This whole process is due in part to the fact
that the epidermis is epithelial, so it’s

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.100
avascular. That means that all the oxygen
and nutrients that its cells need have to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.320
come from the dermis below it. So, as epidermal
cells mature and get bumped up by younger

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.500
cells forming below them, they move further
and further from the blood supply, and end

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.880
up essentially suffocating.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.120
When that nail cuts through the fourth layer
-- the stratum spinosum, or “spiny layer”

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.240
-- it’s getting closer to the point where
cell regeneration, or mitosis, is active.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.030
These cells look prickly when they’re dehydrated
for microscope slide preparation -- hence

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.150
the name -- and that’s because they contain
filaments that help them hold to each other.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.889
And finally, that dang nail touches down on
your deepest, thinnest epidermal level -- the

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.650
“basal layer” or stratum basale. It’s
just a single layer of columnar cells, but

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.530
it’s like a cell factory where most of that
new-cell production happens. This stratum

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.860
is also what connects the epidermis to the
layer of skin below it, the dermis.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.880
Feelin’ a little overwhelmed by all the
layers? Just remember: “Come Let’s Get

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.740
Sun Burned” -- it’s a pneumonic.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.120
I mean, though, who came up with that, because
if you own some skin you know you don’t

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.520
want to get sunburned!

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.590
The ultraviolet radiation in the sun can damage
the epidermis, causing elastic fibers to clump

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.240
up, leading to that tell-tale leather-face
condition. Plus, getting sunburned temporarily

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.460
depresses your immune system -- because, remember,
you have immune cells in your epidermis too

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.810
-- AND the radiation can actually alter your
skin cells’ DNA, leading to skin cancer.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.389
We’re gonna go into your skin’s love-hate
relationship with sunlight more next week,

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.040
but in the meantime, seriously, wear your
sunscreen.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.520
Now, skin damage of any kind can get serious
when it affects the dermis, because it’s

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.320
not only got loads of those collagen and elastin
fibers, which help make your skin strong and

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.880
elastic, it’s also full of capillaries and
blood vessels.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.100
And it houses the nerve fibers that register
sensations like temperature, pressure, and

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.210
pain, as well as parts of your hair follicles
and oil and sweat glands with the ducts that

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.550
lead up to the surface of the skin.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.060
So, the dermis is where most of the skin’s
work is done, and it does it in just three

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.150
layers.
The upper, papillary layer is composed of

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.920
a thin sheet of areolar connective tissue that’s riddled
with little peg-like projections called dermal papillae.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.520
These papillae are pretty neat because in
the thick skin of your hands and feet, these

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.610
tiny protrusions form unique friction ridges
that press up through the epidermis to help

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.580
our fingers and feet grip surfaces.
Your fingerprints!

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.660
Just below that papillary layer is the deeper,
thicker reticular layer that makes up 80 percent

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:56.240
of your dermis, made up of dense irregular
connective tissue. All of the dynamic parts

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.110
contained within the dermis -- like the nerve
fibers and capillaries -- are distributed

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.639
between both its layers.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.449
So any time you get cut enough to bleed or
feel pain, you know that you’ve broken through

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.350
the epidermis and lacerated the dermis. Which,
by the way, is the layer that tattoo needles

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.060
have to reach in order to work: It’s the
only way to make tattoos permanent, but also

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.970
it means getting tattoos hurts. And bleeds.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.199
Finally, something of a footnote to your skin
is its third and most basal layer -- the subcutis,

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:27.669
or hypodermis. It consists of mostly adipose
connective tissue -- basically a seam of fat

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:33.289
-- and it provides insulation, energy storage,
shock absorption, and helps anchor the skin.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.700
In short, your hypodermis is where most of
your body fat hangs out.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.740
But there are more skin things to discuss,
so in our next lesson we will tackle big

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.460
questions, like -- does lotion really do anything?
How does deodorant work? And what will make

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.960
my hair soft and shiny and irresistible?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.820
For now, though, you learned all about skin,
the main organ of your integumentary system.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.920
We looked at the structure, mechanism, and
function of your three layers of skin -- the

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.160
epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis -- and their
various sub-layers. We talked about the roles

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.510
of melanin and keratin cells, what happens
when you step on a nail, how to ensure you

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.330
get a good tattoo, and why it pays to wear
sunscreen.
