Thinking about all of your recent graphing experiences, what is the minimum

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:08.713
points that we need to draw a straight line? In addition to this, what is the

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:12.956
minimum number of points we need if we want to draw a straight line but then

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:17.413
also have one extra point to check that the line we drew is the line we actually

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.244
wanted to draw?
