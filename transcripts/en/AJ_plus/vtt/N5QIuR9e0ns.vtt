00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.140
Mohammad is stateless.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.660
He’s been here, in this

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.190
sprawling camp, for over a year.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.830
He’s one of the 120,000 10 to 18-year-olds
living in the Rohingya refugee camp at the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.800
Bangladesh-Myanmar border.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.960
His family fled the bloody military-led massacre in Myanmar,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.000
which killed up to 10,000 people by December
2017.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.210
And for those who made it to the camps there’s
a real fear of Rohingya youths becoming a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.900
lost generation.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.990
No one is allowed officially to work.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.140
Some people buy and sell food aid supplies, but the risks are high.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.260
Bangladeshi authorities say it is a criminal offense.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.440
Yet people do whatever they can to get by.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.920
The bi-monthly food rations each family receives consists of rice, lentils and vegetable oil.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.119
With few opportunities to learn, and fearful of returning home to Myanmar, Mohammad has

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840
taken up whatever casual work

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520
he could find.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040
The work is challenging.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.340
Alongside his chores and the daily grind at the blacksmith workshop, Mohammad is a teen

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.720
who survived terror.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.240
And his memories, these scars of war, are
a burden he continues to carry.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920
Mohammad used to collect firewood in Myanmar.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.920
And now, in the refugee camp in Bangladesh
he supports his parents, his five sisters

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.870
and two brothers who are reliant on aid.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.770
He is the eldest son.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.960
His father looks for casual day work too.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.680
Mohammad works 10 hours a day.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.200
The long, arduous walk every morning and evening, and then standing all day to work, have taken a toll on his body.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.760
While his future is uncertain, Mohammad still dreams of a life where he can go to school.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.300
But for now, Mohammad is just dreaming of the day when he'll be able to go home.
