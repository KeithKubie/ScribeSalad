00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.812
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Welcome
to tonight's lecture.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.025
It's gonna be a fun lecture.

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.504
Pia and
l were talking about this just before,

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:33.764
we each agreed that there are certain
things that were both passionate about and

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:36.325
we're trying to teach
the classes about that.

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.063
So l am very passionate about foams and

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:45.152
emulsion cuz that what we'll hear about
today, that's what I do some research on.

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:46.850
So that's one of the themes of this week.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.340
So who's been to these lectures before?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.690
Most people, who hasn't been?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.204
Okay, watch carefully.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:01.830
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So we always have a quiz.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:12.205
And remember the traditions in this
class when we see an equation.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:16.540
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.730
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: This apron has all of

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.140
the equations from one of
the years of the class on it.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.610
So you get to wear this, so you put up
your hand and you answer the question.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.170
I'll try and pick somebody.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.990
But I get to read the question before.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.174
It's based on last week's lecture.

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:38.800
So the heat diffusion
coefficient determines how fast

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.100
heat moves into a material.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.839
Why is it more or
less the same for all foods?

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.640
Back there,
the one who's looking behind, you.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.304
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:52.892
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Pardon?

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:54.550
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.455
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: What does that mean?

00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:03.550
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.370
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So what's food

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.070
mainly made of?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.046
Very good.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:15.569
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Okay,

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.100
a little freebie science lesson.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.110
If you take a part of water and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.431
heat it from the bottom,
does it heat up by diffusion?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.320
No, how do you know that?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.898
What's the one thing
that you absolutely know?

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:38.453
If I took a piece of meat
the size of pot of water,

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.752
how long will it take to cook it?
&gt;&gt; Several hours.

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:42.160
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Several hours.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.343
How long does it take
to boil a pot of water?

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:46.167
&gt;&gt; Few minutes.

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:46.791
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Few minutes,

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.769
so what's happening?

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.390
It's convection.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.240
The difference in the weight and the
density of the water causes it to stir.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.820
So it's not diffusion.

00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.199
Okay, chef Gordy from
last week made a liquid

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:09.188
distill that turned into a solid
when poured onto a plate.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:14.252
How did that happen way back?

00:03:14.252 --> 00:03:17.565
Yes?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:18.461
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Super cool,

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.986
super cold water is very super cool,

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:21.611
right?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.470
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Very good, so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.650
super cold water.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.077
You don't allow the ice
crystals to nucleate,

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:39.570
So it doesn't form ice even though
you cool it below the freezing point.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.616
Then when you pour it,
it freezes instantaneously.

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:50.761
Last quiz.

00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:58.173
Jeff Gordy made cigar flavor ice cream,
how did he get the smoke into

00:03:58.173 --> 00:03:59.036
the ice cream?

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:08.230
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: He

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.700
whipped the cream of smoke.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.250
Okay, that's gonna be something
we will talk about today.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.909
What does that mean?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.017
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Air goes into the cream to

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:22.460
make the ice cream filled with air.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:29.785
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:32.075
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: In fact, in fact,

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:36.094
that's what the topic of today.

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:37.260
This is what I get.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.640
That's the topic of today.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.500
It's creams, ice cream.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500
It's really a foam.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.460
And so
we're gonna talk about foam this week.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.790
Here's my favorite kind of foam.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.548
I tried to buy some,
that's why I was late.

00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:54.936
I tried to buy some outside and they said
they make it but it didn't foam up enough.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:57.546
So fortunately, Pia got some and so

00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:02.070
we always like to have some
demonstration during this class.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.477
So we have a demonstration,
can we do this now?

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.390
Look at that.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.173
This is a foam.

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.050
Let me take it from here.

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:30.990
You can pass it around, don't drink
it all of it, if you take a zip.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.710
Okay, what is the foam?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.780
It's bubble of gas inside the fluid,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.527
the gas doesn't go into the fluid you
have to made bubbles of it and so

00:05:47.527 --> 00:05:50.510
foam is a really cool thing.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.300
Can I have my slide?

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.830
So this is one of my favorite
foams on top of a coffee.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.890
Notice this one though.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.920
Notice this one.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.288
It's getting really solid like, right?

00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:10.010
So this is sort of what
I find really amazing.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.660
What have you done?

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.680
You took gas.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.700
Gas goes everywhere.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.420
And you took fluid.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.330
Fluid flows everywhere.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.010
And you mixed them together.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.310
Gas and a liquid and you get a solid,
how is that possible?

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.339
So if you look inside, you see that
the form is made up of bubbles,

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.650
bubbles of air, why does it get solid?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.935
If you pack it enough, if you start to
pack it, the bubbles start reforms and

00:06:45.935 --> 00:06:50.510
it's the deformation of
the bubbles that make it solid.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.120
So here's different degrees of solidity,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.320
this is just a little bit of wet milk
essentially, it's clearly a fluid.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.270
This is the foam on top of a latte,
this is a whip cream,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:11.330
same thing, it's just air and
cream and this is a shaving cream.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.430
It's even more solid.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.910
So what's happening?

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.250
Well, you can go back and
you can see it here.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.786
The more you pack the bubbles together,

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:25.052
the more you pack them,
the more solid they get.

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:32.030
But,
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.940
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: The degree of packing

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:40.050
depends on what we call the volume
fraction of the bubbles and you know that.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.660
You know that,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.890
in fact, if you remember what Pia showed
us, the bubbles were well separated.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:51.860
If they're well separated, they move
freely in the fluid and it's just a fluid.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.290
You have to pack them enough
until they start to deform.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.950
So you have to pack them so much until
they actually begin to deform and

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.670
that doesn't happen if there's
spherical and they're the same size.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.980
It doesn't happen until
the volume fraction reaches 64%.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.020
That's a magic number,
it's a well defined number and

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.980
we can measure it but
there's no way of actually predicting it.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.560
Even to this day,
it's a well known number, but

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.280
nobody can actually predict it.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.740
This is true only for
spherical objects of uniform size.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.140
And, so, the more you pack them,
the stiffer they get.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.550
But the stiffness doesn't start
until you're above this value.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.100
And so the elasticity or

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.520
the stiffness of the foam will go
from something that has no stiffness,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.690
no elastic properties to
something that barely is elastic.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.540
And then as you increase the volume
fraction above this critical value,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.540
it becomes more and more elastic.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:08.541
And we can capture that,
by a simple equation which is shown here.

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:12.260
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.510
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: And the important features

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:19.880
are it only has a value, a positive value,
when the volume fraction is above

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.020
this critical value here and
it depends on the surface tension.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.780
That's the stiffness of the surface.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.480
It's like how stiff a balloon is and
inversely with the size of the bubbles.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.620
If I make the bubbles smaller,
it gets stiffer.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.710
There's another kind of mixture and
we'll hear a lot about that today as well.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.950
That behaves very much like a foam.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.820
A foam I take air, and
I mix it with water.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.240
If I take a second fluid and mix it
with a fluid, two admissible fluids,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.650
like oil and water,
normally they don't mix.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:02.114
If I wanna mix them, I get a mixture
of drops of one into the other and

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:03.980
that's an emulsion.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.200
A mayonnaise or an aioli is an emulsion.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.470
Whipped cream, or coffee foam, is a foam.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.320
This has air drops inside
of a continuous fluid.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.750
This has water drops or
fluid drops inside a continuous fluid.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.805
And if you look at a microscope
image of this, this is a mayonnaise,

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:34.950
this is actually just Hellman's
mayonnaise, and if you look at it,

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.782
you can see the drops of
the oil inside of the water.

00:10:38.782 --> 00:10:39.413
Same with aioli.

00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:43.366
Aioli is made with garlic,
a little bit of lemon juice,

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:46.570
some salt to draw the water
out at the garlic.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.690
And then you emulsify,
you make drops of olive oil inside of it.

00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:54.980
So how do make the drops?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.090
And how do they stable?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.407
Why do they stable?
Well you can make them just by,

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:03.510
essentially, either mixing two fluids
together, or mixing air with a fluid.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.660
You can do it by whisking or blending.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.638
And emersion blender will see some
examples with Corey tonight of how he does

00:11:10.638 --> 00:11:11.999
it in a restaurant.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:17.090
What happens when you mix fluids or
air together when they wanna cross

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:23.340
each other they're sheer, there's torn
apart and they break into smaller drops.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.510
And you mix more and more, you make
them into smaller and smaller drops.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.896
What happens if I make the drops smaller?

00:11:29.896 --> 00:11:30.870
Do you remember?

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.330
Stiffness goes up.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.450
It gets more elastic.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.800
And why do they stay stable?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.596
Normally, so a good example, one of the
most common examples, is a vinaigrette.

00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:50.000
You mix olive oil and vinegar,
you shake them up they will miscible,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.370
you shake them up you get drops.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.610
If you do that, just with the oil and
vinegar, and you put it down, they will

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.370
rapidly face upright, they are all rapidly
go back to the oil and the vinegar.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.170
But if you add a little flavor in,
people like to add mustard for example,

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.470
little mustard powder.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.006
Add a little mustard powder,
a little mustard, you mix them up,

00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:12.790
it adds some taste, but
it also keeps them stable.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600
And keeps them from separating.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.610
And the reason for that is that the
mustard acts as what we call a surfactant.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.410
A surfactant is surface active.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.270
Surfactant, surface active molecule.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.860
It's a molecule that's half and half.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.072
It's half water-like,
and it's half oil-like,

00:12:34.072 --> 00:12:37.260
half hydrophilic, half hydrophobic.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.119
It can't decide what it wants to be,
so it always stays at the interphase.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:44.039
And if it stays at the interphase,

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:49.389
the role of the surfactant is
actually to stabilize the drops.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.990
Because if you have a coating of
surfactant, and I think we show it here.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.110
That keeps the drops
from emerging together.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.660
As they come closer,

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.610
the surfactant prevents the drops
from touching one another.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.221
So the role of the surfactant,
in an emulsion, or a foam,

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:08.934
is to stabilize the drops.

00:13:08.934 --> 00:13:12.571
so a real alioli is just garlic,

00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:18.634
a little lemon juice,
some salt, crush the garlic,

00:13:18.634 --> 00:13:24.426
you draw the water out of the garlic,
tiny, tiny,

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:30.680
tiny amount of water and
a huge amount of olive oil.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.290
And you emulsify the olive
oil inside that water.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.960
No surfactant except from
the surfactant from the garlic,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.150
which is not a great surfactant.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.990
But now what people do
is they use egg yolk

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.580
because that is a wonderful surfactant.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.230
And so we had a little contest.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:55.210
We asked, how much emulsion, how much
mayonnaise can you make with egg yolk?

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:02.000
Anybody have a idea
theoretically how much it is?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.630
It's a huge amount, huge amount.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.460
Here, somebody this was
in one of our course,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.530
somebody made nearly a litre
of mayo from one yolk.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:17.210
Actually there's enough surfactant
to make probably ten times

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.940
that amount of emulsion,
because egg yolk is a fabulous surfactant.

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:30.765
Okay, so tonight we have Corey Lee
from Benu Restaurant in San Francisco,

00:14:30.765 --> 00:14:35.530
I had the real pleasure to do
something with him before.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.290
And so
I know a lot of the things he makes.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.690
And he's gonna tell us about his menu,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.390
which is just filled with foams and
emulsions.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.115
So Cory.

00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:47.420
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thanks Dave, and

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.060
thanks Pia for inviting me out.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.920
I'm really excited to be here.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.880
As Dave mentioned, I'm from San Francisco.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:02.810
I'm a chef and
restaurateur in San Francisco.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.220
I operate three restaurants
in San Francisco.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.960
One is called Mr. Benjamin.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.180
It's a very casual French bistro.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.866
The other one is called Institu, which
is a restaurant that I opened last year,

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:16.883
and that's kind of an interesting project
where we collaborate with over 100 chefs

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.350
around the world.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.510
And they pick a dish from their repertoire
and they show us how to make that dish,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.690
and we execute that at the museum.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.210
So it's kind of like a food exhibition,
so to speak.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:34.026
And then the third restaurant is Benno,
where I spend most of my time.

00:15:34.026 --> 00:15:37.840
And Beno is a resturaunt
that I opened in 2010.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.860
At the time I had been working as a chef
for 15 years, I started cooking in 1995.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.327
And all my experience up to that
point was in Western kitchens or

00:15:49.327 --> 00:15:54.730
French restaurants, or
at least French based restaurants.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.630
And my last position right before I start
up and it was at the restaurant called

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:03.070
the French Laundry in Napa Valley For
the great American chef Thomas Keller.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.180
And that's a restaurant that
I think is very iconic.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.593
And known worldwide for
being one of the first kind of fine dining

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:13.843
restaurants in America to have
an American perspective, and

00:16:13.843 --> 00:16:16.799
not just try to replicate French cuisine.

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:21.499
And because I was the chef there I had a
lot of responsibility that had to do with

00:16:21.499 --> 00:16:26.657
menu development and creating new dishes
and making sure that the cuisine evolved.

00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:32.323
And that was really rewarding, but
there was also kind of this growing

00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:38.100
curiosity to explore some different
kinds of flavors and techniques.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.754
And those are the flavors and
techniques really of my native culture.

00:16:41.754 --> 00:16:43.870
And of Asian cuisine in general.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.923
So that's something that I became more and
more interested in.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.527
But at the same time I knew it wasn't
the right restaurant for that.

00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:53.032
People go to Napa Valley, they're at
a restaurant called French Laundry,

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:54.456
they wanna have that cuisine,

00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:58.050
the last thing they want is some
kind of Asian influence in that.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.049
But still, as that curiosity grew,
I realized more and

00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:05.210
more that I needed to
do something on my own.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:11.450
And that was really the impetus for
going out and opening Benu.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.130
Has anyone here ever been to Benu?

00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:16.143
There are people here.

00:17:16.143 --> 00:17:16.753
Okay, great.

00:17:18.822 --> 00:17:24.157
But I figured most of you hadn't been,

00:17:24.157 --> 00:17:29.329
so this is a little video that can kinda

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:35.322
give you a look into our restaurant, okay.

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:45.322
[MUSIC]

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:38.590
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thank you.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.832
So Dave mentioned that we're going to
talk a lot about foams and emulsions.

00:20:42.832 --> 00:20:47.767
And okay, so something that we think a lot

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:52.846
about at Benu is is texture and
mouth feel.

00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:56.973
A lot of people think about how something
tastes to decide whether they like

00:20:56.973 --> 00:21:00.330
something or not, but
I look at it with three things in mind.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.210
One is the taste of course.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.070
Another is the aroma,
which is incredibly important.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.350
And the last is texture.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.780
So if you think of a food that you really,
really like or you really don't like.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.170
And if you were to just
close your nose and

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.500
just put that food on your palate, I think
you'd find you'd have a pretty different

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.860
experience with that food
you either like or dislike.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:25.960
And that's important texture is in
how we perceive a certain food.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.486
So that's something we think a lot
about and to that we go about

00:21:31.486 --> 00:21:37.330
that in a lot of ways, but it's a texture
that we want to be deliberate about.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.810
So sometimes it's a choice
of the ingredients.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.624
So if we're making it a chicken broth or
a dish with chicken soup, for

00:21:44.624 --> 00:21:47.695
example, we might put
some chicken feet and

00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:52.260
chicken wings so that you get this
really gelatinous mouth feel,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.240
maybe with vegetables, a potato,
we might fry it versus steaming it,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.059
versus poaching it, and
impart a different texture.

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:04.910
Sometimes we actually intentionally
overcook things to get a certain texture.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.736
But the texture is
really really important.

00:22:06.736 --> 00:22:10.653
Another way we do that is actually
by engineering like a system,

00:22:10.653 --> 00:22:12.838
which is what Dave is referring to.

00:22:12.838 --> 00:22:15.120
And two of those are foams and emulsions.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.650
So when I was looking at our menu, and

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.770
this is our menu from I don't
know three or four weeks ago,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:26.120
getting ready to talk about this,
I asked myself okay, this is our menu.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.292
They asked if I can talk about foams and
emulsions,

00:22:28.292 --> 00:22:30.620
which is not really something I do often.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.760
But let me see how many emulsions we have.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.290
So I went down the list and that's how
many emulsions that we have on the menu.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.620
So I was kind of surprised.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.425
I said, okay,
maybe I can actually do this talk.

00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:42.935
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:44.225
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And then I asked myself,

00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:46.560
okay, well, how many foams do we have?

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.690
And then it was this.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.658
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So now I feel like an expert

00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:52.820
on foams and emulsions, right?
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.226
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And there are only two

00:22:54.226 --> 00:22:58.924
dishes on the menu that doesn't have
a foam or an emulsion in some form.

00:22:58.924 --> 00:23:05.051
So I'm just gonna video demo these
dishes that have foams and emulsions.

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:06.552
Don't worry,
we're not gonna do all of them.

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:10.018
We're gonna do these because I think
they're different kinds of foams and

00:23:10.018 --> 00:23:10.631
emulsions.

00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:13.317
Okay, so
I'll go through these one by one and

00:23:13.317 --> 00:23:17.500
then you can see the various ways
we incorporate foams and emulsions.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.966
But keep in mind that as a chef, there
are certainly different kinds of chefs and

00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:27.044
different ways to go about it,
but I don't look at a dish and

00:23:27.044 --> 00:23:31.041
tell myself let's put a foam on there or
an emulsion,

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:36.427
I try to create some kind of experience
for the guest who's having this dish and

00:23:36.427 --> 00:23:40.058
then work backwards and
see how we can achieve that.

00:23:40.058 --> 00:23:44.707
And in that sense I think it's like if
your were to think about building a house

00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:49.068
or designing a building, and
then there's all this engineering behind

00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:52.806
it that gives that structure support and
allows it to happen.

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:58.436
And that's how I kinda see working with
foams and emulsions in our kitchen.

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:03.610
So The first dish is a little soup,
1,000 year old quail egg which

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:08.250
is basically a base cooked egg, or pidan,
or century egg it goes by different names.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:12.940
Potage is a soup and
that's where the emulsion will be and

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.360
then ginger is pickled ginger,
some acidity that pairs well and

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.720
classically with
the thousand year old egg.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.109
So, Dave you want to join me here and
maybe help

00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:29.169
explain some of these things that I do?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:31.920
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So this is basically bacon

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.450
rendering out in a lot of butter.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.687
So a ton of fat coming
out of here [LAUGH].

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.210
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: What is on top?

00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:40.760
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.360
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Says onion cabbage.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.880
We're basically making a simple soup.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.560
And I don't think you think
of a soup as an emulsion.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.090
But I'm sure all of you have had
a soup that's really greasy.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.090
To me, that's not an unemulsified soup.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.540
And what gives you kind
of the velvety texture of

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.550
a nice made soup is that it's an emulsion.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.470
And the fat is evenly
disbursed in that system.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.870
So here we're adding chicken stock,
we're letting that cook.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.430
So we'll cook that until it's soft.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.670
Is that a foam?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: That's a foam, but

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.710
it's made of an emulsion.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, so

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.260
now we're pureeing the whole thing.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:24.000
Some seasoning and then we add a little
bit of whey protein to help emulsify it.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.680
And then, you can see it almost turn into
this very thick mayonaisse-y like texture.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.760
That's just a little bit of cayenne.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.810
But there's a point where it emulsified
and becomes almost like pudding.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.690
And, [COUGH] and
it started to happen right around here.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.380
So this is the thousand-year-old
quail egg that I was talking about.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.200
This is basically a base cooked egg.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.570
We brine it for a couple of weeks
in a solution of lye and puer tea.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.760
And then we age it for another four weeks.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.350
And basically what happens is it
turns into this kind of wobbly gel

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.970
with a very creamy, kind of sticky
yoke texture which is this here.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.938
It taste a lot better than it

00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:20.216
looks trust me [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So

00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:25.740
this a ginger sour cream which is
an infusion of ginger and sour cream.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.030
And then this is the potage.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:32.200
And this is a little bit of cooked
cabbages that have been juiced to kind of

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.470
echo the cooked cabbage in the soup,
but kind of a fresh version of that.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.819
And then we serve that with
the thousand-year-old quail

00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:41.510
egg.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.810
the sour cream is itself an emulsion.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.850
And then he's made
an emulsion on top of this.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.390
So this is an emulsion
on an emulsion [LAUGH].

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.888
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So that is the first dish.

00:26:51.888 --> 00:26:54.572
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: [APPLAUSE] Okay, so

00:26:54.572 --> 00:27:01.785
this second dish is an oyster
pork belly in kimchi,

00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:06.312
so this is kind of a fun version of

00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:12.270
a classic pairing in Korean cuisine.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.210
Really here it's the kimchi
that we first ferment,

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.350
and we make a stock, and we do
a couple of different things for that.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.220
So the first thing is, making kind of
like, it's basically like a quick kimchi.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.980
I wanna make kimchi this way if I was
actually going to serve the kimchi itself.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.690
But we start with cabbage,
some dried chili powder,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.450
just a little bit of anchovy essence.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.690
And then we actually ferment this.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.050
In a bag.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.670
So the fermentation
happens pretty quickly.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.000
It takes about three or four days.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.100
We actually don't serve this
because the texture of this and

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.360
the flavor of this is really not really
good, but when you make a stock with it,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.280
it's actually very powerful and very
strong, so that's why we make it this way.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.990
So all we're doing is taking that kimchi,
covering it with a little bit of water,

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.380
and then simmer it.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:12.310
And then we get this very intense,
spicy, sour flavored liquid.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:16.730
Okay, so that liquid is the base for
two things that we do for this dish.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.580
The first thing that we do is
add a little bit of starch and

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.930
we lay it out on these acetate sheets.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:26.160
And then we get even layer that dries and

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.730
right before it's fully dried,
we're able to cut it into precise squares.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:38.476
So that's the squares and then it's still
has some moisture so it's appliable so

00:28:38.476 --> 00:28:43.035
we can take that and put it into
a mold make a little cup out of it.

00:28:43.035 --> 00:28:44.990
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.800
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And then once it's

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.850
in that shape we dry it
further until it's crispy.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.720
So that's the kimchi cup.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.670
The other part of the kimchi juice that we
made, we make a gel using a jgelling gum,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.390
and then we basically set it to gel and
then puree it.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.518
And we're pureeing this with a few things.

00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:04.329
One is

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.390
a bit of soy lecithin some different
seasonings, and a little bit of skim milk.

00:29:16.977 --> 00:29:21.561
So this looks like a really
really thick puree and it is, but

00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:26.160
the reason why we do that is so
that we can whip it into a foam.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.890
And one thing about this dish that's
important is that we have this hot

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.620
pork belly with this ice cold oyster.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.470
And that's something that we wanted to try
to maintain even in a really small bite.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.090
So we take that puree.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.660
We put it into a kitchen mixer.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.150
And we whip it until it's really,
really dense like shaving cream

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.550
So you can see how thick that gets.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.190
And this is just a single we should have,

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.686
we gonna put it up, [SOUND]

00:30:12.107 --> 00:30:17.037
Well we're just trimming it up so it fits
in the cup, but then in the cup, [LAUGH]

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:21.967
It's too big, so in the cup we take a
little bit of the rendered pork belly, and

00:30:21.967 --> 00:30:26.900
we make a powder, and we add hot pork
belly and kimchi that's mixed together,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.039
and then we add the foam
that separates the hot pork

00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:32.770
belly from the cold oyster.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: See how

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.400
solid it is?
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Yeah.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.215
So that's the oyster, pork belly kimchi.

00:30:39.215 --> 00:30:43.128
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:30:43.128 --> 00:30:45.301
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So

00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:46.270
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.661
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: What I find really cool

00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:52.564
is that you can make something that's so
solid just starting with a liquid, and

00:30:52.564 --> 00:30:54.697
mixing gas into it.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Yeah,

00:30:54.697 --> 00:30:58.600
I think it's pretty cool.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.990
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: It's cool, it keeps

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.070
the heat apart.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.900
the next thing is this sausage.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.335
And I was not sure if this was really an
emotion, I had to ask Dave this morning.

00:31:08.335 --> 00:31:10.870
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: But I know it's okay.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.490
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: We define it

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.580
as being an emulsion in this class.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.910
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Actually it is.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.610
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So this is another

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.410
kind of surf and turf kind of dish.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.490
A little small snack that, this is
all little snacks before you start.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.452
The food is not this small for
most of the meal.

00:31:24.452 --> 00:31:25.000
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.770
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So this is a fermented

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.530
pepper sauce that we make
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: It's fermented pepper based

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:35.060
and we add different seasonings, and
then we add sesame oil at the end.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.990
And it's kind of like a thick,

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.440
kind of really spicy sauce,
but we just use a drop of it.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.360
This is what an emulsion is.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.850
So we take pork and we add aromatics,
ginger, scallion, garlic,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.970
green scallions and
we add mung bean jelly noodles and

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.030
sweet rice, and we mix it altogether,
and that's the base.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.320
And this is all pork blood.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.691
So we're making the base of
a pork sausage or boudin noir.

00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:08.297
And to this mixture,
we emulsify sesame oil, and

00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:12.254
sorry, this is some other seasoning mix.

00:32:12.254 --> 00:32:14.950
I don't think that's really
important at this point.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:15.680
But after this step,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.630
we emulsify the sesame oil, and
you end up with an emulsified sausage.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.500
And I don't know how many of you have made
sausages before, but sometimes you make

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.150
a sausage and then you go to cook it,
and all this fat comes out, right?

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.320
And it's really dry and

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.790
the texture's not good, and
that's from the sausage breaking.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.474
But this one, well,
you can see how thick it is here.

00:32:36.474 --> 00:32:37.841
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So what's interesting here,

00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:41.550
Cory, is not only is it an emulsion,
but it's filled with solid particles.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.170
So that's the one thing
I didn't talk about.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:47.600
I talked gas, bubbles, liquid drops.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.520
You can also have solid particles in
the fluid, and that's called a suspension.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.399
This is the third of the three different
classes of materials like this.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:57.700
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So after its cooked,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.540
you can see that its retained its shape.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.310
And we can actually saute this
without it rendering out all of

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.970
the oil that we emulsified in.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:11.593
This is a little bit of squid,
and we just square that squid so

00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:15.356
we can wrap it around the blood sausage.

00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:21.098
And then we gently poach it so
that it's almost raw, but

00:33:21.098 --> 00:33:26.240
it's just a little bit further because
it's been cooked and it crawls out.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.422
This is that fermented pepper
sauce we had in the beginning,

00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:33.130
the port sausage or the blood sausage.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.324
And then some pickled radishes,

00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:44.290
sesame leaf,
a bit more of that spicy sauce.

00:33:46.301 --> 00:33:50.646
The squid goes right on top, and
then it gets glazed with a pork and

00:33:50.646 --> 00:33:52.227
squid flavored sauce.

00:34:00.862 --> 00:34:10.046
Okay, so that's the squid.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:34:10.046 --> 00:34:12.103
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, this is a fun dish,

00:34:12.103 --> 00:34:16.070
because it has both a foam and
an emotion, right?

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.430
That's super exciting, so.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:21.529
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: We start here with

00:34:21.529 --> 00:34:26.383
something that you saw when Dave was
talking about, which is the mayonnaise.

00:34:26.383 --> 00:34:31.687
Now, I realized I only need to use
20 grams of this egg yolk now,

00:34:31.687 --> 00:34:34.010
but this is three egg yolks.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.520
Some horseradish juice,
mustard, some seasoning,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.372
basic mayonnaise flavor with-
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So that's 20 grams?

00:34:45.372 --> 00:34:48.341
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: It's a little bit more, but

00:34:48.341 --> 00:34:54.278
this is about 500 grams of oil.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So at most 50 grams?

00:34:54.278 --> 00:34:57.184
500 grams of oil and 50 grams for

00:34:57.184 --> 00:35:00.764
everything else.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So

00:35:00.764 --> 00:35:04.435
you can see this come together, and
you can just see how thick this gets.

00:35:09.502 --> 00:35:12.566
Yeah, it comes together fairly quickly

00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:19.283
But also,
the only water in there is the vinegar and

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.375
the horseradish juice, so-
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: And

00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:23.280
a little bit from the egg, yeah.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.310
So you can see that roughly speaking,

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:31.890
it's 50 grams of water at most and
500 grams of oil.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.790
That's roughly one in ten.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.980
So it was roughly 90% by volume through
the drop phase, which is the oil phase.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.410
That's why it's so stiff.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.260
It's way up on the stiff side.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So here,

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.000
I'm making a little batter.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.168
So this is a corn starch batter for
a tempura.

00:35:47.168 --> 00:35:50.002
And when I was coming up on being
trained on how to make a tempura,

00:35:50.002 --> 00:35:53.240
people had this thing where they
used club soda in the batter.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.720
And you put that club soda batter in
a fryer, and it kind of explodes, right?

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.470
And then in about ten years ago,
when I was working with some siphons,

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.620
l realized l can just make that soda
in a charger and do it last second.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.931
And so that's a batter that we use,
which is basically a charge of CO2.

00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:16.242
The batter goes in, and
the batter itself is a foam.

00:36:16.242 --> 00:36:18.780
So this is dried jellyfish that we're

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.392
coating in a little bit of starch
just to help adhere the batter to it.

00:36:23.392 --> 00:36:28.672
And then we kinda lay it
out into these strands,

00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:36.205
and basically wrap a shrimp or
use the jellyfish to wrap the shrimp.

00:36:45.861 --> 00:36:48.440
Has everyone here tried dried jellyfish?

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.532
Highly recommend it, it's very good.

00:36:52.532 --> 00:36:56.870
And it has a snappy texture that kinda
enhances the crispiness of the batter.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.170
So what we do is we'll wrap
that around the shrimp.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.140
And then we'll discharge a little
bit of that batter that was

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.090
in the soda charger with carbon dioxide.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:11.960
And then-
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: There's

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.946
the foam.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Yeah.

00:37:22.933 --> 00:37:27.645
And then we'll fry that for a minute,
just to get it crispy and cook the shrimp,

00:37:38.023 --> 00:37:41.620
But it ends up being a very,
very flaky batter.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.875
And I assume that has a lot to do with the
gas that's trapped in there, right, Dave?

00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:46.656
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Mm-hm.

00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:51.178
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So we get a nice piece of

00:37:51.178 --> 00:37:54.306
fried shrimp, season it.

00:37:54.306 --> 00:37:59.110
We glaze it a little bit with this kind
of sweet, spicy horseradish syrup.

00:38:06.171 --> 00:38:09.661
And then this is some of that
mayonnaise that we made,

00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.310
the horseradish flavored mayonnaise.

00:38:16.076 --> 00:38:19.629
A little bit of chili powder,

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:25.366
And some cilantro leaves.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.826
This is just gold flakes,

00:38:36.826 --> 00:38:42.323
just because gold flakes.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:38:42.323 --> 00:38:43.951
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And then some fresh grated

00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:44.917
horseradish.

00:38:48.152 --> 00:38:52.967
And then the jellyfish itself is
just kinda little fried shrimp with

00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:54.666
a dipping mayonnaise.

00:38:58.433 --> 00:39:03.161
Okay, that's the jellyfish.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:04.090
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thank you.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:08.009
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:39:08.009 --> 00:39:08.641
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, so

00:39:08.641 --> 00:39:13.541
this next one is actually a dish that
I wanted to do today, because Dave and

00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:18.300
I did something with this when he
visited San Francisco a few years ago.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.330
What did we talk about at that time?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: We talked about

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.146
the elasticity of the shell.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: We mentioned the elasticity,

00:39:24.146 --> 00:39:24.963
right?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Exactly, so

00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:29.032
I'll show you this, and then I'll tell you
a little story from my perspective of this

00:39:29.032 --> 00:39:31.076
shark fin.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So,

00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:35.207
this is just to kinda identify
the things to look for.

00:39:35.207 --> 00:39:38.205
The egg white in this dish
is actually a custard, so

00:39:38.205 --> 00:39:40.450
there's many ways to make a custard.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.360
This is an egg white custard,
and that's the emotion.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.133
We take some ham stock, and
we emulsify that to it,

00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:54.560
and that becomes a cooked
egg white custard.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.490
But here, we're making a broth.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.280
That's associated with shark fins.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.020
So shark fin soup,
those is a faux shark fin soup right?

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.470
This is not real shark fin.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.620
So we make a soup that's flavored with

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.760
that kind of traditional
flavors of shark fin soup.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.250
And two, we add some locust bean gum,
and alginate and

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:17.580
we extrude it into this calcium vat
to get these gels, gel noodles.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.510
And then we cut them at a sharp bias to
get strands that look like shark fin.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.460
And anyone who's ever had shark fin soup,
it's really a textural experience.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.230
And the flavor is really about the broth.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.370
And it was kind of like a, kind of
a fun dish that we did when we open.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.040
We've done it in different iterations.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.670
But that's the shark fin that we're

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.400
serving.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.550
this is really a gel that Cory made and
he told me that he spent about a year and

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:45.140
a half to experiment,
to get the texture just right.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.260
So, he says that mouth fill and

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.618
texture is very important.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So, this is the custard mix

00:40:49.618 --> 00:40:53.827
that we are making, that was the ham
stock that we made, we passed that,

00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:56.950
we combine it with some egg whites,
some seasoning.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.170
And then we add, sorry,
we're about to seam the custard right now.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:07.880
So this is some Dungeness Crab
which is a local bay area crab or

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.010
a Pacific Northwest crab.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.219
And then this is some of that.

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:16.680
And when we were mixing that with the egg
white, there's a lot of air trapped in it.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.960
So we actually put that in a vacuum
sealer to remove the air, so it's a foam.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.060
And we're actually trying to
get the air out of the foam,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.640
so that you don't end up with
bubbles in your custard.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.770
And then, this is some of that soup
that we turned into noodles, but

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.470
it's also a glaze,
a very rich chicken flavored soup.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.720
And then we add some luxurious
stuff back in like Jinhua ham, and

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.340
black truffles because we
are doing a fake shark fin so

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.870
we wanna include some kind
of special ingredients.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.410
And if you look at those strands they
actually look just like a real shark fin,

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.910
and on the palate as well.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:53.840
They have a snap, and a texture to them
that's really similar to raw shark fin.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.321
So that's the shark fin with Jinhua ham,

00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:05.010
egg white, and black truffle.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:09.390
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, so this one is bread.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:14.200
And it's kind of It's kinda interesting,

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.800
I think Hal McGee did a lecture
here a few times, a couple times.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.430
And he wrote an interesting
article about how great is a foam.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:28.020
And I don't think as a chef you
go around and you're cooking and

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.450
you're like, there's a foam,
there's a mushroom,

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.305
there's that.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:31.200
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: When you start to think

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.190
about it that way,
it's really interesting.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.405
And basically, it helps you to
understand a lot of what is happening.

00:42:37.405 --> 00:42:41.126
There's a certain kind of crust and
a certain kind of crumb and

00:42:41.126 --> 00:42:45.493
certainly a certain kind of flavor that
we are looking for in our bread and

00:42:45.493 --> 00:42:47.283
they are actually all related.

00:42:47.283 --> 00:42:52.009
So the gas that's being produced by you
proofing the bread is also allowing for

00:42:52.009 --> 00:42:53.870
a different kind of flavor, or

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.200
the flavors changing as those
gases are being released.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.939
By baking something that
has more air in it,

00:42:59.939 --> 00:43:02.810
you're getting a different type of
crumb and a different type of crust.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:07.290
So we started with just some
starter grade flour and water.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.837
And then we added the starter,
and we let that proof.

00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:14.721
And you can see that its quite elastic,

00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:19.310
and you can almost see how airy it is.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.240
It's very wet.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.880
It's kind of like a batter
more than it is a dough.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.490
And then we'll put it into
these little bread molds, and

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.350
we'll let that proof for
about five to six hours.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:38.100
And then you can see how it rises and how
much gas is being produced in that foam.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.550
This is that same amount after
its proofed and then we bake it.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.140
After it's baked,

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.870
is that still considered a foam?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: It's a solid

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.660
foam.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Solid foam.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.367
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So the outside of a liquid

00:43:50.367 --> 00:43:55.571
form is a liquid surrounding the bubbles,
but if you solidify it, which you

00:43:55.571 --> 00:43:58.578
do when you bake, it becomes a solid form.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So

00:43:58.578 --> 00:43:59.839
here, were making the butter
that comes with it.

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:04.143
So we start with a little bit of water and
we do this at,

00:44:04.143 --> 00:44:07.980
you can see, 37 degrees Celcius.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.568
We basically make a butter
that is still emulsified and

00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:16.094
we can pour into these little molds
that kind of look like honeycomb.

00:44:20.205 --> 00:44:24.170
So there's an emulsion here as well.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:25.905
But this is the butter
after it's been set.

00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:29.735
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Just like a solid foam,

00:44:29.735 --> 00:44:32.577
it solidified the continuous phase,
which in this case,

00:44:32.577 --> 00:44:33.650
is the foil.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: So

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.410
this is solid emotion basically, right?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Yeah,

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.660
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.490
then we drizzle some honey that's been
infused with ginsing on a honey comb.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.380
It's basically honey butter, you know.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.360
And then when we cut the bread open,
you can see, I guess the solid foam and

00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:00.645
you can see the air or
the gas that was inside of it.

00:45:08.357 --> 00:45:13.817
Yeah, see all of

00:45:13.817 --> 00:45:19.283
those pockets?

00:45:25.903 --> 00:45:31.985
So that is the sprouted
grain bread with honey and

00:45:31.985 --> 00:45:36.680
ginseng.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.125
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, does everyone

00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:40.030
know what xiaolongbao is?

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.890
It's like a soup dumpling or
Shanghainese dumpling.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:47.049
I decided to do this dish today because,
one,

00:45:47.049 --> 00:45:52.247
there's actually a foam in the batter,
or the dough, just like the bread.

00:45:52.247 --> 00:45:55.909
But it's actually,
we're taking, basically,

00:45:55.909 --> 00:46:01.629
the opposite approach to the blood
sausage, which was an emulsified sausage.

00:46:01.629 --> 00:46:05.961
And we're intentionally making a sausage
that's not emulsified to get a certain

00:46:05.961 --> 00:46:06.470
effect.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:12.100
So we start with this filling, and
this is lobster and shrimp being ground.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:21.330
To this we make a lobster consume, or
lobster stock, and turn that into a gel.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.090
And we grind that as well.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:28.300
We also take clarified butter,
and grind that as well.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.660
Everything gets mixed with lobster coral.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.040
So you have almost equal parts
of the clarified butter,

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.650
this gel that you see going through.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.020
In the top,
you can see that it's this brown gel.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.500
That's the lobster stock, and
then we roll them into these little balls.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.410
So right now,
they kind of look like a sausage, right?

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:50.557
Just like the blood sausage, or
it's all suspended in emulsion.

00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:58.077
And then this is the dough, and we use a
yeast dough because we want to air it and

00:46:58.077 --> 00:47:03.072
when you bite into it,
it's softer than a cold dough.

00:47:03.072 --> 00:47:07.410
And that allows you go get some strength
in the dough and it can be thicker.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:13.967
But when you bite into it,
it's not this hard, firm wrapper.

00:47:13.967 --> 00:47:16.975
So this is dough,
after we've sheeted a few times, and

00:47:16.975 --> 00:47:20.239
we punch these little circles,
and then we roll them thinner

00:47:20.239 --> 00:47:24.600
to get the sides a little bit thinner
because that's the part that gets pleated.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:32.085
And then we roll and we put inside of it
the parts that we made or the filling,

00:47:32.085 --> 00:47:37.312
which is basically the sausage that
we want to break when we cook it,

00:47:37.312 --> 00:47:41.733
or we want to separate into liquid and
fat when we cook it.

00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:45.296
So,

00:47:55.969 --> 00:48:01.978
After we steam it, we serve it on this
thing, so that's how it gets served.

00:48:01.978 --> 00:48:06.840
But if you never had one before, I think
the next shot will kind of give you

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.730
an idea of what it's
like when you eat one.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:13.318
So you have this dumpling that's
like super, super hot, and

00:48:13.318 --> 00:48:17.941
then you bite into it, and then you expect
it to be like sausage filling like most

00:48:17.941 --> 00:48:21.667
dumplings, but when you actually
bite into and break the skin,

00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:25.876
you get this huge rush of hot, well,
in this case, clarified butter and

00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:30.154
lobster consomme that just kinda gushes
out and it's just kind of a really

00:48:30.154 --> 00:48:36.650
impactful bite.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: That's

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.510
when you break the emulsion.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.780
You cause the drops to coalesce.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.751
And that's what he's done when he's
heated, and so it's no longer an emulsion,

00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:47.233
it's just a mixture.
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Okay, so

00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:51.003
that's the lobster xiaolongbao.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:48:51.003 --> 00:48:52.135
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thank you.

00:48:52.135 --> 00:48:56.895
Okay, so this is the last dish, and

00:48:56.895 --> 00:49:01.850
this is kind of like a sweet dessert.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:06.150
And this starts off with, when you
guys think about a foam in food, for

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.130
me the first thing, I don't know,
what is the first thing I think about?

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:10.530
What is the first thing you think

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.610
about, Dave?
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: Depends.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.544
If it's in the morning,
I think of the foam on top of a coffee,

00:49:14.544 --> 00:49:17.235
if it's in the evening,
I think of foam on top of a beer.

00:49:17.235 --> 00:49:20.240
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.140
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: How about you?

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.830
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: I think of a meringue.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.640
That's the first thing that comes to mind.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: You have a sweet tooth.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.580
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And really, a macaroon.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.318
So this is a French style meringue.

00:49:31.318 --> 00:49:34.360
First, we made the egg whites, and
now we are whipping separately the cream,

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.960
and then we combine the cream and
the egg whites, so

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.390
we have two foams being mixed together
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: And here,

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.240
we have creme fraiche,
which is basically like sour cream.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.541
And we add gelatin to that,
and we mix that in,

00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:52.290
trying to maintain as much
of the air as possible.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.600
Try to keep it as light as possible.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.857
And then,
we pipe it into these little half-dome or

00:49:58.857 --> 00:50:02.240
half-sphere molds, and then, we freeze it.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.240
And the reason why we want it to be airy
and frozen is so that when you bite into

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.140
it you're not biting into this solid,
dense like ice cube, right?

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.040
If you were to take those same flavors and
not whip it and put it in the freezer and

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.920
you were to bite into it,
it would be a terrible experience.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.590
But because it's so

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:24.670
light, it just kind of gives way to you
and it melts very quickly in your mouth.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.500
And that's a nice sensation.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.676
This is a winter melon that
I'm trying to break apart.

00:50:30.676 --> 00:50:38.600
We clean up the winter melon, we take
the seeds, we take the rind off, and

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:44.190
we cut it into small pieces that we braise
in a little bit of chrysanthemum tea.

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.680
So it is actually kinda savory.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.800
It's sweet, but
it's still somewhat savory.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.876
And chrysanthemum is a pretty delicate
flavor, especially the flowers, so

00:50:56.876 --> 00:51:00.897
we wanna combine it with something that is
not too assertive like winter melon, and

00:51:00.897 --> 00:51:03.200
then a little bit of fresh cream.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.990
So we cook that down here, and
then we end up with this kind of

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:14.160
cold, almost puree sauce of winter
melon that still has some texture.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.630
This is some oil being mixed with
the greens of the chrysanthemum,

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.564
not the petals, but the greens.

00:51:20.564 --> 00:51:26.580
And we'll make a really bright,
flavorful herbal oil, and

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:33.390
so we put a little bit of that
green chrysanthemum oil down first.

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:41.108
And then, after the whipped meringue and
cream has been frozen,

00:51:41.108 --> 00:51:45.530
we can take it out of the molds and
we can put it here.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.020
And that thing is so light,
it probably weighs like maybe five grams.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:58.130
And then some of the braised winter melon,
and all this is served very cold.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:06.970
And then, we took some of
the chrysanthemum tea liquid,

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:12.140
sweetened it, thickened it a little bit so
it comes as glaze on top, and

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:18.683
then we finish with some
candied chrysanthemum flowers.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:29.868
So that's the last dish.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

00:52:29.868 --> 00:52:34.080
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thank you.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.180
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: So we'll take questions,

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.410
but let me start.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:41.795
So Corey, maybe you could explain, you
don't think of foams and emulsions, but

00:52:41.795 --> 00:52:45.502
what do you think of when you use them?
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: I think of the experience

00:52:45.502 --> 00:52:47.270
that someone will have texturally.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:55.300
I think that when you have a foam,
it really does effect how things taste.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.020
And if you have something that's really
refreshing, let's say a lemonade, for

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.840
example, and you were to turn that into
a foam and you're really thirsty and

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.300
you wanna have this great refreshing
glass of lemonade, it's gonna be not

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.695
as refreshing, and it's sure gonna affect
how you perceive that cup of lemonade.

00:53:11.695 --> 00:53:14.194
The same thing with an emulsion.

00:53:14.194 --> 00:53:19.460
Again, if you have a lemonade and
you wanna add to that

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.450
a little bit of oil on top and you have
them just like that, it'll be broken.

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:27.030
But if you were to emulsify it together,
drinking that

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.120
will be a totally different experience.
&gt;&gt; Dave Weitz: All right, so

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.580
you're taking two fluids and
you're making it from

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.670
something that just flows like a liquid
into something that's more solid-like.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.220
But it's not so solid like that, so

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.780
you can bite, you can chew it,
you can just break it with your tongue.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:54.047
So it's a very, very soft solid, and
that's the amazing thing about these.

00:53:54.047 --> 00:54:00.750
Okay, so let's thank Corey one more time.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.436
&gt;&gt; Corey Lee: Thank you.
