recommend there is that if if you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
recommend there is that if if you
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.359
recommend there is that if if you
haven't done it just go do the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
haven't done it just go do the
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.220

calm because what you're describing

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
calm because what you're describing
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590
calm because what you're describing
sounds very much like high levels of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
sounds very much like high levels of
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.050
sounds very much like high levels of
negative emotionality or neuroticism and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
negative emotionality or neuroticism and
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.820
negative emotionality or neuroticism and
you might want to find out if that's the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
you might want to find out if that's the
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220
you might want to find out if that's the
case because if you're much higher than

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
case because if you're much higher than
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799
case because if you're much higher than
average in neuroticism then you're going

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
average in neuroticism then you're going
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630
average in neuroticism then you're going
to be questioning yourself all the time

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
to be questioning yourself all the time
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190
to be questioning yourself all the time
and you might want to figure out if

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
and you might want to figure out if
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799
and you might want to figure out if
that's actually a trait and if it is a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
that's actually a trait and if it is a
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.180
that's actually a trait and if it is a
trait well then that gives you an

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
trait well then that gives you an
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650
trait well then that gives you an
explanation of it and then you might

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
explanation of it and then you might
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.680
explanation of it and then you might
also note that your levels of negative

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
also note that your levels of negative
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.959
also note that your levels of negative
emotion are not well matched to your

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
emotion are not well matched to your
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.630
emotion are not well matched to your
likely skill now that doesn't

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
likely skill now that doesn't
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729
likely skill now that doesn't
necessarily help you learn to cope with

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
necessarily help you learn to cope with
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520
necessarily help you learn to cope with
it but sometimes identifying the reason

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
it but sometimes identifying the reason
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840
it but sometimes identifying the reason
is useful and there's another

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
is useful and there's another
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670
is useful and there's another
possibility - is that your mode is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
possibility - is that your mode is
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170
possibility - is that your mode is
dysregulated and that you're depressed

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
dysregulated and that you're depressed
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.520
dysregulated and that you're depressed
so that's another thing to consider if

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530
so that's another thing to consider if
 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.710
so that's another thing to consider if
you if you do find that you have high

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
you if you do find that you have high
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270
you if you do find that you have high
levels of neuroticism but you're not

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
levels of neuroticism but you're not
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100
levels of neuroticism but you're not
depressed then one of the things you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
depressed then one of the things you
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380
depressed then one of the things you
might do is write down all the reasons

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
might do is write down all the reasons
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090
might do is write down all the reasons
like really think them out you know I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
like really think them out you know I
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880
like really think them out you know I
mean really get serious about this write

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
mean really get serious about this write
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.070
mean really get serious about this write
down all the reasons why you might give

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
down all the reasons why you might give
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050
down all the reasons why you might give
yourself more credit for intelligence

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
yourself more credit for intelligence
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450
yourself more credit for intelligence
than you have and part of that could be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
than you have and part of that could be
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.179
than you have and part of that could be
like a really deep reconsideration of

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
like a really deep reconsideration of
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370
like a really deep reconsideration of
successes you've had in the past with

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
successes you've had in the past with
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.789
successes you've had in the past with
complex intellectual issues because

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
complex intellectual issues because
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.469
complex intellectual issues because
imagine that you're serving as your own

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
imagine that you're serving as your own
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719
imagine that you're serving as your own
defense attorney against a very critical

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
