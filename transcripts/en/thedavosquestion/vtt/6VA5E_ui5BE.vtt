JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Last year, I volunteered
in Ethiopia.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.690
And one of the things I saw there, female
genital mutilation, has

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.160
completely changed the path of my life.
I realized I couldn't look away from this

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.700
urgent issue.
So I came back to London and volunteered with

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.570
an organization.
And a friend sent me a link to the YouTube

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.480
Debates saying someone with
a urgent human rights cause had to go to Davos.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.059
And I thought, this is got to be it.
So why send me to Davos?

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.739
Because I want to ask those innovative and
intrepid world leaders to

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.140
put their hearts and minds and power behind
ending FGM.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:57.039
I've just found out that I am going to Davos.
Since I won, I've been doing a video diary

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.719
every day and really just
trying to raise awareness of the basics of

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.510
this very complex issue.
So what is FGF?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.660
It's very simply the removal of a girl's external
genitals, the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:18.340
clitoris, the labia, and in severe cases,
the wound that's left is sewn

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.370
up, so there's only a tiny hole left.
I'm just pleased the day is here, actually,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.150
because it's been a lot of
prep to get to this point.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.290
It's night one in Davos and as you can see,
it's absolutely beautiful.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.230
My belief is that issues like this can't stay
on the margins, that they

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.370
really have to be debated at the highest levels.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.020

BILL CLINTON: I'll follow up.
Bless you.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.450
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I'm really delighted
I entered this competition.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.370
Who would have thought ten days later I would
go from my kitchen table

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.740
to Davos?
But let's not be complacent.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.690
This is just a few days at Davos.
There's so much more to be done.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.000
There's still 3 million girls a year being
cut.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So what can we do together today to help do
something about this?
