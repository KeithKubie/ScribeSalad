what is the evolutionary reason for
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.070
what is the evolutionary reason for
having consciousness I think that was

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
having consciousness I think that was

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500
Toby who asked that God Only Knows
 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.140
Toby who asked that God Only Knows
that's been a problem that people have

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
that's been a problem that people have
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.419
that's been a problem that people have
been hammering on for a long time I mean

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
been hammering on for a long time I mean
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490
been hammering on for a long time I mean
that's the so-called zombie problem that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
that's the so-called zombie problem that
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.099
that's the so-called zombie problem that
David Chalmers has described which is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
David Chalmers has described which is
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.470
David Chalmers has described which is
something like how do you know that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
something like how do you know that
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570
something like how do you know that
other people aren't exactly like you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
other people aren't exactly like you
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509
other people aren't exactly like you
except acting in a completely determined

except acting in a completely determined
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.320
except acting in a completely determined
manner and devoid of consciousness I

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
manner and devoid of consciousness I
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.970
manner and devoid of consciousness I
don't know what the evolutionary reason

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
don't know what the evolutionary reason
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770
don't know what the evolutionary reason
is for consciousness I mean I can

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
is for consciousness I mean I can
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930
is for consciousness I mean I can
speculate like what consciousness seems

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
speculate like what consciousness seems
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.150
speculate like what consciousness seems
to be at least in part is a mechanism of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
to be at least in part is a mechanism of
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.060
to be at least in part is a mechanism of
repair so a lot of the things that you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
repair so a lot of the things that you
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880
repair so a lot of the things that you
do are unconscious you know like when

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
do are unconscious you know like when
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.170

you're driving if you're an expert

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
you're driving if you're an expert
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170
you're driving if you're an expert
driver you're you're using your eyes to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
driver you're you're using your eyes to
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389
driver you're you're using your eyes to
watch the road and your eyes are moving

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
watch the road and your eyes are moving
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.170
watch the road and your eyes are moving
your hands and your arms but you're not

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
your hands and your arms but you're not
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910
your hands and your arms but you're not
really thinking about what you're doing

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
really thinking about what you're doing
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290
really thinking about what you're doing
you're not attending to it consciously

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
you're not attending to it consciously
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330
you're not attending to it consciously
because you've built circuitry already

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
because you've built circuitry already
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.429
because you've built circuitry already
specialized circuitry that handles all

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
specialized circuitry that handles all
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670
specialized circuitry that handles all
those tasks now what happens when you're

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
those tasks now what happens when you're
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.840
those tasks now what happens when you're
driving let's say that you make a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
driving let's say that you make a
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210
driving let's say that you make a
mistake well then what happens is you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
mistake well then what happens is you
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100
mistake well then what happens is you
consciously attend to the mistake and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
consciously attend to the mistake and
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999
consciously attend to the mistake and
you attempt to revise the part of the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
you attempt to revise the part of the
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.010
you attempt to revise the part of the
automatic structure that produced the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
automatic structure that produced the
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.170
automatic structure that produced the
error so imagine this imagine you're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
error so imagine this imagine you're
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.370
error so imagine this imagine you're
playing the piano and you're playing a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
playing the piano and you're playing a
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.200
playing the piano and you're playing a
very complicated sequence and you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
very complicated sequence and you
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.730
very complicated sequence and you
stumble over part of it so you're

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
stumble over part of it so you're
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.380
stumble over part of it so you're
zooming along and you stumble over part

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
zooming along and you stumble over part
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270
zooming along and you stumble over part
of it and then you attend to that you go

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
of it and then you attend to that you go
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.359
of it and then you attend to that you go
back and you slow down and you move your

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
back and you slow down and you move your
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999
back and you slow down and you move your
fingers slowly and you try to reprogram

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
fingers slowly and you try to reprogram
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460
fingers slowly and you try to reprogram
those little automatic units that have

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
those little automatic units that have
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710
those little automatic units that have
handled that part of it you repair them

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
handled that part of it you repair them
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660
handled that part of it you repair them
and and reprogram them and you get

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
and and reprogram them and you get
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249
and and reprogram them and you get
faster and faster out it as they

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
faster and faster out it as they
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.810
faster and faster out it as they
automatize and then you go so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
automatize and then you go so
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.050
automatize and then you go so
consciousness seems to be something that

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060
consciousness seems to be something that
 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.240
consciousness seems to be something that
watches what you do automatically checks

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
watches what you do automatically checks
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730
watches what you do automatically checks
for errors and then repairs it and so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
for errors and then repairs it and so
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.399
for errors and then repairs it and so
that's its function now you might ask

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
that's its function now you might ask
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.889
that's its function now you might ask
why a repair mechanism like that would

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
why a repair mechanism like that would
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.289
why a repair mechanism like that would
have to be associated with awareness and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
have to be associated with awareness and
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.350
have to be associated with awareness and
answer that is not only do I not know I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
answer that is not only do I not know I
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600
answer that is not only do I not know I
don't think anyone knows if I was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
don't think anyone knows if I was
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029
don't think anyone knows if I was
speculating and which I've done

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
speculating and which I've done
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890
speculating and which I've done
I think consciousness actually plays an

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
I think consciousness actually plays an
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.790
I think consciousness actually plays an
integral role

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
integral role
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
integral role
in being itself because I'm not

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
in being itself because I'm not
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990
in being itself because I'm not
convinced that there would be any being

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
convinced that there would be any being
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.960
convinced that there would be any being
of any recognizable sort without a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
of any recognizable sort without a
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.760
of any recognizable sort without a
conscious observer so I think

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
conscious observer so I think
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.210
conscious observer so I think
consciousness is actually like a center

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
consciousness is actually like a center
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.360
consciousness is actually like a center
point of the cosmos in some sense and I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
point of the cosmos in some sense and I
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.860
point of the cosmos in some sense and I
think it's because of ideas like that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
think it's because of ideas like that
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.670
think it's because of ideas like that
that the grand archetypal idea of the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
that the grand archetypal idea of the
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.530
that the grand archetypal idea of the
soul has emerged and I think it's

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
soul has emerged and I think it's
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.700
soul has emerged and I think it's
correct so but how to precisely

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
correct so but how to precisely
 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.630
correct so but how to precisely
integrate that with evolutionary theory

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640
integrate that with evolutionary theory
 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.720
integrate that with evolutionary theory
apart from the description that already

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
apart from the description that already
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.650
apart from the description that already
provided I just don't I just don't know
