00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay, it's time for a quiz. Play around with the programming

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.650
exercise on JSON and answer the questions that we're about to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.600
look at. Now you could certainly do this by looking at

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.070
the data manually or just by knowing things about artists, so of

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.670
course doing a little Googling. Please try to do it by

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.840
writing code, building on the code that you were given in the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.850
previous exercise. Okay, let's take a look at the questions for

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.660
this quiz. So, the first question is: how many bands named "First

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.790
Aid Kit" are there? Next, see if you can find the Begin-Area name for the band

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.870
Queen. Then find the Spanish alias for The Beatles. Dive into the data

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.520
and find the disambiguation for Nirvana. Now,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.100
the Nirvana I mean here is the band

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.270
that Kurt Cobain served as front-man for.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.150
And finally, please answer the question, when was

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.210
One Direction formed?
