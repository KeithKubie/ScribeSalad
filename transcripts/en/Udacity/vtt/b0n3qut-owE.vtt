00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, one important thing to notice is that this force of the ground pushing up on the ball

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is always going to be perpendicular to the ground.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is some sort of perpendicular force.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In fact, let's call it FN where N means normal.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Normal is just another word for perpendicular.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Before we move on, I want to point out something truly beautiful here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We just discovered a force.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We discovered that force by having real trust in our model, F = ma.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If this is true and there really is a force downwards,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there has to be, must be, a corresponding force upwards.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We call that the normal force.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In fact, we can verify the existence of the normal force

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with something as simple as a scale, like the one you might find in your bathroom.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Here you are, some person, your mass is m, and you're standing on a scale.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't like this picture, because people are hard to draw.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's simplify a bit. Here you are, standing on a scale again.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This time I've drawn you as a box.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
No offense. I don't think you look like a box.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But it's just easier and we can find that drawing things this way

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
will actually make solving later problems much easier.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We know that gravity is pulling you downwards with a strength mg.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That mg, by the way, is what we colloquially call your weight.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The scale, of course, is pushing up with a normal force.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, let's think. How big is that normal force?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Is it bigger than mg, equal to mg, or less than mg?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Remember, the total or net force on an object is equal to

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
its mass times the object's acceleration. Choose the best answer.
