00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.704
(drum beat music)

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.012
(moaning)

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.848
- I have been waiting for you.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.384 align:start size:84% position:16%
I never thought
I'd get to eat you.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.452
Oh.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.287
Oh, you are spicy mustard.

00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:25.525
My god, I'm going around back.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.395 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, look who's
awake from their coma.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.729
I'm Doctor Boyd.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.633
I see you've met our hospital
support dog Cheetah already.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.601
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.103
I'm sorry, did I have a sandwich

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.237 align:start size:72% position:28%
here?
- Excuse me?

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.072
A sandwich?

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.573
- Yeah, a sandwich.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.142
I had a turkey and swiss,
and it was right here.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.078
Honestly, I think your
dog ate my sandwich.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:48.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, Cheetah did
not eat your sandwich,

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.650
but we did detect
some heart murmurs,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.484
so we're gonna have
to run a couple--

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.052
- Look at her.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.754
She's freaking laughing at
me, like I'm some idiot.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.922
That dog ate my sandwich,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you're pretending
like she didn't.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.924
- Okay, how dare you.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.894
Cheetah has been working
in this hospital for years.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.428
She would never do
something like that.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.131 align:start size:97% position:3%
Besides, she specifically
eats these vegan dog treats.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.965
- Vegan?

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:06.799
(laughs)

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.301
Oh, that is rich.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.570
You're telling me that if
I threw a piece of steak

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
in front of that dog,
she wouldn't scarf it up?

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.973
You owe me a sandwich.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.108
- Okay, will you shut up
about the sandwich already?

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.444
- Turkey, swiss, spicy mustard.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
Why aren't you writing
any of this down?

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.314
- Okay, if there was a sandwich,

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.016
you've been in a
coma for a year,

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.517
so it wouldn't be edible.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:28.987
- Oh, well look who's a
doctor of sandwiches now.

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:30.456
- Well, I'm a doctor of hearts,

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:33.126
and yours is about to
explode, you moron.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.193
- Give me this food.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.761
- What, no.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.630
- She's eating my food, I'm
gonna eat her fucking food.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.931
Watch that.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.299
You see me eating
your fucking food?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.301
Oh, that is good.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.536 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, what are
you trying to prove?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.370
You're gonna have
a heart attack.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.471
- Tit for tat, baby.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.673
Tit for fucking tat.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.041
(yells)

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.878
(monitor beeping)

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.313
- Hey doc, quick question.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.316 align:start size:81% position:19%
How old is too old
for a sandwich?
