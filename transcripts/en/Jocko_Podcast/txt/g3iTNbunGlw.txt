Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. Jocko many times he said that liking a fight or liking to fight should be a part of every man's personality. Could you expand on that? I've always been interested in martial arts, but I've always been reluctant to fight and I would do anything not to. Does that make me less of a man? So obviously this was pretty fitting question for the situation. So this is obviously a good question. Uh, and a fitting question. Talking about being a man. Uh, I don't know if I said liking to fight should be a part of everybody's every man's personality or if I said that it is part of every man's personality and, and it, I think I said is part of their personality. And if I said that, what I think I should have said is most right? Most men, uh, have in their personality some level of interest of fighting, right?

Speaker 1:          00:58          We wrestle, we box, we scrap as kids look at the UFC. Right? Why is the UFC so popular right now? Because it's fighting and we have that, that's a, I read the other, that's a $7 billion organization. That's, there's a lot of people watching those fights. A lot of people want to watch those fights. We have boxing, we have wrestling, we have Jujitsu, we have Judy, we have Moitai. We've got all kinds of martial arts schools. So while I don't think the desire to fight is inherent in all men, right? I'm sure there's men out there that have not into it at all, but I think it's definitely a, a pretty strong part of many men now for this individual, particular, um, do, do I think that being reluctant to fight makes you less of a man? No, actually I think it's fine. The, you should be reluctant to fight.

Speaker 1:          01:48          I think everyone should be reluctant, but there's a lot of bad things that can happen in a fight. A lot of bad things. You know, first of all, you can get hurt, right? That's bad. You can get seriously hurt. You can get killed, you can get killed. You can get punched one time, fall down, hit a curb and die. You can think you're going to get in a fair fight with someone. They can stab you in the neck and kill you. Right? These things can happen. Even if it's not that bad, you can hurt someone else. Now you're getting lawsuit, now you're getting put in prison. Right? So there's all kinds of bad things. So being reluctant to fight is actually a good thing and it's something that men should have. And actually the more you know about fighting, the more reluctant you will be.

Speaker 1:          02:26          I was way, the less I knew in my life about fighting the more, or sorry, the more I actually knew about fighting, the more reluctant I became to fight cause I realized all the risks that are involved. Part of that was maturity. Sure. But the reality is you look at someone and you go, Whoa, I don't know who that person is. A they, they might be training. I'm over here thinking I've been training Jujitsu for f eight months. I'm ready to kick this guy's ass. Meanwhile, you don't know that guy as a purple belt. Guess what's gonna Happen to you? You're getting crushed. Or that guy wrestled in high school. He's about to double leg you and slam you on a curb. Yeah, you're going to die you. So you should be reluctant to fight. That's a good thing. Now, that being said, I do recommend that you are prepared to fight.

Speaker 1:          03:15          I definitely recommend that, and there's going to be a big dichotomy here. I'm gonna get to, but you should know some basics, right? You should understand threats. You should know how to contend with other people. You should. You should know some boxing. You should know some wrestling. You should know some boys. I should know some Jujitsu for sure, because here's the dichotomy. This is the, this is a big dichotomy, and think about it. It's 100% true. This, this individual says he would do anything not to fight, would do anything not to fight. Let me tell you, the best thing you can do as a human so that you don't have to fight is actually learn how to fight. That is the best way to not have to fight as if you know how to fight. If you know how to fight, people aren't gonna want to fight you.

Speaker 1:          03:58          You don't even have to say anything. They can tell. You can tell when you meet somebody. You can tell if that person, oh, if you're, if you're ready to fight, people don't want to fight you. The more eager you ought to fight, the less people want to fight you. If you don't know how to fight and and bullies, because that's what we're talking about. Bullies see that you don't want to fight. Guess who they're coming after. You now guess what? Now you have to fight. But if you know how to fight and you have that confidence and you have that understanding and you learn simple things like avoidance and you learn, you have better situational awareness, you become a threat to the people that want to fight you. If you become a threat to them just by just by your knowledge alone. So No, you're not less of a man because you were elected to fight.

Speaker 1:          04:43          You actually should be reluctant to fight, but you should learn how to fight because the best way to avoid fighting, the more equipped and prepared to fight you are, the less you will have to fight, the less you will be put in positions where you have to fight and the better the outcome will be if it does happen to occur. Yeah. Yeah. Interestingly, like a lot of the people that you meet in Jujitsu or, or just like this where I'm interested in martial arts but I'm not interested in fighting. No, for sure. For sure. And then they learn and then I get, well there's a strong component of nerds in Jujitsu, right? Strong component. Really strong of of, you know I'm saying it jokingly, but there's just a studious type students type people that aren't super physical there. More cerebral than they are physical. There's a ton of people like that.

Speaker 1:          05:36          And you know what? They'll do choke you out. They will end up being real good. Yeah. They wind up being real good cause they're like, Oh I, I understand this. There's a, this is a game that I can learn. And then I can crush and that's good and now I have more confidence on him for worry about it anymore. Again. It's interesting how that third or that, that additional element that they're not really used to like how you say nerds and you know, we'll just say like people who are more cerebral within physical. Yeah. It's that maybe they didn't play high school sports, right? Yeah, totally. We're studying because they were working on a computer, right? Yeah. Cool. Right on. Yeah. They were playing music, right? Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. And then now they get into this highly physical situation cause just to, let's face it, that's physical.

Speaker 1:          06:17          That's your whole body. It is physical as well as the book can be and but you get in and you're just finding success just by learning it. It's not like football where it's like, sure I know how to catch. I can't run fast though and I can't, I'm not big and strong or whatever, so I'm just getting smashed, you know, I can. But this, it's kind of like the more you know, the better you are kind of thing and sure. Physical attributes help you for sure. But even that much, yeah, there's, there's you being stronger as great. Yeah. You know, Dean was talking about the city on the map. The stronger guys not always going to win. The more athletic guys not always going to win. Sometimes they do. There's various categories that will bring you a victory. One of the strongest categories that you could have.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Well the, this strong, the strongest category is your technique because no one wants to do because no one wants to do. And so you're smart people, your cerebral people that come in and go, oh, I can apply, I can apply this knowledge the same way I apply my skills in accounting. James Nielsen, world's toughest accountant, he's an accountant, he's a back. So that's just the reality and yeah, and that's why, so now they're in, that's why people get addicted to, because it's like this element of physicality, like a physical fighting, more fighting sport by the way, combat sport. And now they're in the end, they're good at, they're good at something physical for the first time and they're still smart as smart can be. You know, like they always were. So now they got that and that additional, um, like pay off, you know, that's where they get it to additional power.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Yeah. I recognize that with the kids that come to Jujitsu, the oftentimes, and it's not an always, oftentimes the kids that get really into Jujitsu are kids that are smart and, but they haven't done a lot of other sports yet. And it's exactly what you're saying. It's very noticeable with kids. The kid that played baseball his whole life and he comes in there, he actually doesn't like it at first and maybe doesn't even want to do it because he's getting choked by someone that seems all nerdy to him. Yeah. And he knows I could throw a baseball further than this guy and so it makes him mad and he doesn't want to train. Yeah. But oftentimes it's the kids that come in that really haven't done too much athletically and you know, they're, they got picked on. We got, we've, I've had a lot of bullies come to mind, Jujitsu kids program. The reason they're there is because they got bullied. And once I started training six months, they're not getting bullied anymore, and a year later they're a different person. Yeah. There are different kid, confident, assured themselves not backing down, not being jerks, not being bullied themselves, but just confident. Yeah. So yeah.
