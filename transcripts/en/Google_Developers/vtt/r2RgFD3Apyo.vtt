00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.550
Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.049
I'm Andrew [? Broggan. ?] And
welcome back to the Mobile Ads

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.750
Garage, where videos
of mobile ads code

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.117
arrive just like old
batteries-- free of charge.

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:11.700
In our last episode, we covered
how to implement interstitials

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.210
in iOS and Android.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.939
Today, with the help of
Gary the Graphics Guy,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.480
we're going to show
you the best ways

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.434
to use them by focusing
on where, when, and how.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.850
One of most important things
to consider with interstitial

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.266
is where you're
going to show them

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.620
within the flow of your app.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.710
Ideally, you're looking for a
natural break in the action.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.960
Between levels in a
game is a great one.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.880
Switching between
articles or activities

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.290
is another good spot.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.410
You're looking for places where
the user is expecting a pause.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.840
If they're not in
a hurry, they're

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.860
more likely to consider
what the ad has to say

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.270
and they're less likely
to feel interrupted.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.810
That's important,
because you never

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.290
want to disrupt
the user right when

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.070
they're trying-- [SIGH]
--trying to do something.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.130
Dude, Buckets o' Cheeze?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.030
I think that would
give me hypertension.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.230
Picking pauses in the action
for your interstitials

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.438
can also help keep you in
line with AdMob's publisher

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:02.370
policies.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.330
For example, to
make sure users are

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.794
able to identify which
app is showing them an ad,

00:01:06.794 --> 00:01:08.960
an interstitial should never
be the very first thing

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.392
they see when launching your app
or the last thing on exiting.

00:01:12.392 --> 00:01:14.850
Another thing that can set a
good spot apart from a bad one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550
is user expectation.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.640
For example, if you had a game
in which people tap like crazy

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.181
on the screen,
make sure you don't

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.680
show an interstitial
right when they

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.009
think a new game is starting.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.300
They could end up tapping on
the ad accidentally, which

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.990
is a bad clickthrough.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.370
Just like we talked in
our episode about banners,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.070
it's a part of a
publisher's job to make

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.970
sure people don't
accidentally tap on ads

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
when they're trying
to do something else.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.090
So that's the where part.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.841
Now let's talk when.

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.364
When is mostly a
question of how often.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:44.530
There's a balance to find
between showing enough ads

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.250
that you can hit
your revenue goals,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.090
but not so many that you
flood your user with ads.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.280
Are you dissatisfied with
your current shampoo?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.040
No.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.899
Thank you.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.940
Want to see a movie about
a cat that plays chess?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.500
It's called "Checkmeow."

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.430
I'm all set, really.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.850
Even if it's something the
user might be interested in--

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.260
Dude, cupcakes in the hallway.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.760
Cupcakes in the hallway.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.580
-it's just too much.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.350
Is your dog getting
enough fiber?

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.550
I got to start shaving
my neck beard better.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.230
If the flow of your
app is dominated

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.180
by one screen or activity, it's
easy to keep track and avoid

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.420
this kind of thing.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.670
Imagine an app with
multiple activities, though.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.460
If you show an interstitial
every time the user switches,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.090
a new user who's
poking around the app

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.910
might end up seeing a whole
lot of ads very quickly.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.720
On the plus side, this is
an easy problem to fix.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.140
You can keep a
time stamp of when

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.764
the last interstitial
was shown to make

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:39.806
sure you don't overdo it.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.680
Or you could only show
an ad every other time

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.900
the user switches activities.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.440
And so on.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.940
All right.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.099
So that's where and when,
which just leaves us with how.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.640
The big thing I want
to touch on here

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.723
is how to make sure you
have an interstitial ready

00:02:51.723 --> 00:02:53.130
when you need one.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.137
You might remember these
steps from our last episode.

00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.720
Interstitials are
bigger than banners,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.540
and can take a little
extra time to load.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.240
So they're requested
asynchronously,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.602
before they're needed.

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:04.560
You can start that process
pretty much as early

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.434
as you want in order to
make sure you're done

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:08.200
loading when the time comes.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.460
The important thing is that
the ad waits for the user,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.760
so the user never
waits for the ad.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.260
I don't know about you, but the
last thing I ever want to do

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.287
is sit around as-- [BEEPING]

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:26.992
Oh, for the love
of-- Home button.

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.200
So make sure you give your
app enough time for its ad

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.129
requests.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.670
Even if that means
you sometimes load

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.240
an interstitial that you don't
end up displaying, that's fine.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.520
So now you know the
where, when, and how.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.949
That's all for this episode.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.240
Here are some links to our
interstitial guidance pages,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.489
which have some great tips
on how to use interstitials

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.310
effectively.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.820
And don't forget to check
out AdMob's no-nonsense guide

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.190
to app monetization.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.190
It's an overview of
monetization strategies

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.340
that includes code and
tips from other engineers.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.590
As always, if you've got a
technical question relating

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280
to anything you've just seen,
stop by our support forum.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.610
And if you've got a question
about this video series

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.400
or an idea for something
we could cover,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.600
leave a comment below, and Gary
and I will see you next time.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.300
So you want to go check
out those cupcakes now?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.390
Yes.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.360
Yes, I would.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.410
