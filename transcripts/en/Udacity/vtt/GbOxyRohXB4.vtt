00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.320
We've now seen a few
improvements to the naive

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.650
version of the Ford-Fulkerson method.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.568
But this isn't the end of the story.

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:10.092
There are some even more sophisticated
approaches that improve the run time

00:00:10.092 --> 00:00:13.820
even further, also based on
the idea of augmenting flows.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.650
There's also a family of
algorithms called push relabel,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.410
that allow the internal
vertices to absorb flow

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.750
during the intermediate
phases of the algorithm.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.590
In practice,
these seem to perform the best.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.679
Beyond just seeing the algorithms in
this lesson, we examined the max-flow,

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.850
min-cut theorem.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.347
This was more than just a trick for

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:33.499
proving the correctness
of forward focusing.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.134
It's part of a larger pattern of duality
that provides important insight in

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.760
a variety of contexts.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.310
We'll discuss this
more in a later lesson
