Now you are going to play the role of a learner.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've given you three positive examples and three negative examples,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and what I'd like you to do is craft a regular expression

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that accepts the three positive examples but rejects the three negative examples.

00:00:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Quite a bit of room for creativity here. Go try it out.
