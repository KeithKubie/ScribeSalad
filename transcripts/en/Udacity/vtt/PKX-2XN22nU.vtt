00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.110
In the previous question we had this polynomial, y equals x cubed, which has an

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.384
odd degree. It starts really low on the left hand side and then it increases

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.926
and increases until it's ending up high on the right side. Now what if instead

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:16.376
of a polynomial was an odd degree like this one? We have one with an even

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:20.225
degree, like this one, y equals x to the 4th. Tell me about this graph on the

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.920
left hand side over here. Is it coming from up high or is it coming from down

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.689
low?
