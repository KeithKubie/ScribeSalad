00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:13.288
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:15.129
It's the winter of 1890.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.308
Dr. William Halsted is the chief surgeon
at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:23.999
The scrub nurse under Halsted,
a woman named Caroline Hampton,

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.869
begins to develop a severe reaction
to the strong disinfectants

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.139
used to scour her hands and arms
before surgery.

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:36.140
Halsted takes an interest in her plight.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.829
In a moment of vision, he asks
Goodyear rubber company

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.738
to experiment with the production
of a pair of thin rubber gloves.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:50.159
They fit Caroline, well, like gloves,
and her hands begin to recover.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.600
In fact, the gloves are such a success

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.311
that the good doctor orders more
for his team and for himself.

00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.930
From these early experiments,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.910
a multibillion dollar rubber glove
industry is born.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.640
And it turns out the doctor didn't
just want to protect the nurse's hands.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.541
He also wanted to take them
in holy matrimony.

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:12.381
Halsted and Caroline were married

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:16.781
just a few months after he gave 
her that first pair of gloves.
