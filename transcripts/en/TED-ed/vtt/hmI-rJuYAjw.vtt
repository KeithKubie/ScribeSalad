00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.250
The world’s largest orchid 
grows several meters tall.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.119
The tiniest is practically invisible.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.329
Some bloom high up in trees,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.689
while others live underground.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.049
All in, there are around 28,000 species 
of orchid on earth –

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:29.459
about as many as all the bird, 
mammal and reptile species combined.

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.799
They grow all over the world,

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.969
bearing every imaginable colour, shape, 
and pattern.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.224
And there’s a cunning purpose 
behind these elaborate displays:

00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:42.942
many orchids trick insects,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.942
sometimes even into having sex with them.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:48.212
Like other flowers,

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:50.742
most orchids need to attract insects

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:54.224
to gather their pollen and 
carry it between plants.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.394
But unlike most flowers,

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:59.864
which attract a range of pollinators 
with sweet nectar,

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.864
these masters of deception 
deploy other tactics–

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:06.954
like pretending to be an insect’s mate,

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:09.144
letting off alluring scents,

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:12.604
and mimicking the appearance 
of other species.

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:17.104
One of their most intriguing methods 
is sexual deception.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.354
Through a combination of sexy shapes 
and pheromones,

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:23.524
orchids convince insects 
to mate with them.

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:25.694
Take the bee orchid,

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:30.804
whose petals look almost exactly like 
the velvety body of a bee.

00:01:30.804 --> 00:01:35.191
This disguise is so convincing 
that male bees land on the orchid

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.531
and try to have sex with it,

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.911
picking up pollen as they go.

00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:44.207
Other orchids have evolved contrasting 
colours and ultraviolet spots–

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:48.397
invisible to humans but 
irresistible to insects.

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:51.637
Still others have tactile ‘love-handles’

00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:56.477
that ensure insects are positioned 
precisely for pollination.

00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:59.957
When a male wasp lands on the
hammer orchid, for example,

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:04.717
his enthusiastic mating motion 
flips a hinge in the flower,

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:07.717
forcing his body into the pollen.

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:09.167
At the next flower he visits,

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:14.127
that same hinge pushes his pollen-covered 
body onto the stigma,

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:15.627
fertilizing it.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:18.537
Some orchids make such convincing mates

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.347
that insects even ejaculate on them,

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:23.767
wasting valuable sperm.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:28.147
But the most vital component of 
sexual deception is scent:

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:33.331
orchids mimic the precise scent 
of a single insect species.

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.491
This is possible because many insects 
and flowers

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.763
produce simple organic compounds 
called hydrocarbons,

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:44.773
which form a layer that protects 
their bodies from drying out.

00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:48.983
The precise blend of compounds 
in this layer is species-specific.

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:53.086
Its scent can double as a way for insects 
to attract potential mates,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.816
known as a sex pheromone.

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:58.266
Over the course of many 
thousands of years,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.466
random compound combinations 
have given some orchid species

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:08.064
precisely the same signature scent 
as particular insect species.

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:11.800
This matching scent allows them to 
attract male pollinators

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.160
who fall over and over again

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.640
for the flowers masquerading as females

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.630
of their own species.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.390
Sexual deception isn’t the only trick 
orchids have up their sleeves.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.326
Their oldest scam is mimicking the shapes 
and colours

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.996
of other nectar-producing flowers—

00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:31.096
but without the sweet nectar.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:36.036
Some orchids also masquerade as places 
where insects lay their eggs.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:40.083
One species not only has the colour and 
appearance of rotting meat;

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.901
it emits a scent of decay as well–

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.841
drawing in flies who deposit 
their eggs on the flower

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:48.431
and unwittingly pollinate the plant.

00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.431
Other orchids look and smell just like
the fungi on which certain insects

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.201
lay their eggs.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.831
Where do all these bizarre adaptations 
come from?

00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:02.769
Random genetic mutations in orchids 
may result in a trait–

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.339
like a scent or a shape–

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:09.349
that, by chance, matches the needs 
of a single insect species.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.279
The huge diversity within the insect 
world also increases the likelihood

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.329
that an orchid will find 
a unique audience.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.459
Able to make more seeds and offspring with
the help of its dedicated pollinators,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.839
the orchid successfully reproduces 
in isolation,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:28.499
and becomes a new species.

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:33.219
But because of their dependence on 
sometimes just one pollinator species,

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.099
orchids are also vulnerable,

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.759
and many quickly go extinct.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.009
Over time, though,

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.379
more orchid species have formed 
than died out,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.519
and orchids are some of the most diverse 
flowering plants.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:50.047
They have such exuberant and otherworldly 
shapes

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:53.517
that they occasionally deceive 
human senses, too:

00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:57.777
In their petals we see what appear 
to be tiny, dancing people,

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:00.077
monkey’s faces, spiders,

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:02.947
and even birds in flight.
