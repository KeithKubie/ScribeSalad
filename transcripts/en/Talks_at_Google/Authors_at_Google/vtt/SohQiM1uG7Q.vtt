DOM JOLY: OK, but--

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.570
MALE SPEAKER: So please welcome
with a round of applause,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.765
from there to here, Dom Joly.

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:04.598
DOM JOLY: Thank you.

00:00:04.598 --> 00:00:06.178
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.920
Are we sitting on these?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.680
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I am.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.930
DOM JOLY: How to make me
more uncomfortable and weird.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.190
OK.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.510
MALE SPEAKER: They're not the
most comfortable of chairs,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.630
but--

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.280
DOM JOLY: I would just
like to say I'm over 30,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.350
and I seem to be the only person
in this entire building that

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.272
is.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.851
You just get an
email when you're 30,

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.100
just hopefully-- you're right.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.180
Oh, thank god.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.800
Yeah, dial up.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.663
Remember dial up?

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:28.162
Amazing.

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.934
MALE SPEAKER: It's
[INAUDIBLE] "Logan's Run."

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.808
Do you want to talk
about yourself, the book,

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:34.340
where the book's come from?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.548
DOM JOLY: Whatever you want
me to talk about, really.

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.617
MALE SPEAKER: With why
the book and why now?

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:39.950
DOM JOLY: Why the book, why now?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.400
Well, for someone that's
said-- and I really meant it--

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.525
I didn't think anyone should
write an autobiography

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:46.960
till you're I think at least
60 and definitely, like,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.080
you've finished.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.250
I've now done two.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.257
But in my defense, the first
one was in 2004, straight

00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:53.412
after "Trigger Happy."

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:54.870
And someone approached
me and said,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.920
would you like to
write an autobiography?

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.580
And I said, absolutely no way.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.140
No way.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.431
And then they told me what
the advance was going to be,

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:02.594
and I went, yeah, OK.

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:03.447
Possibly.

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:05.530
And actually, weirdly, I
had this exact same thing

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.460
with Lily Allen once.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.700
I'm going to name
drop straight away.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.520
I was doing this reality
show where I was a paparazzi.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.770
And I'd spent two weeks
completely forgetting who I was

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.145
and just chasing
celebs and being

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:17.436
hit around the head with stuff.

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:19.090
And on the last
night, I'd finished.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.660
And I just got Lily Allen.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.030
I went back to a bar in
SoHo and I was relaxing.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.167
And Lily Allen walks in.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.250
And I'm like, fuck, I'm
still-- and I thought, no.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.607
I'm not paparazzi mode anymore.

00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:29.690
And she makes a beeline
for me, and she sits down.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.524
She's chatting away.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.315
And I'm trying to
pretend it's really cool.

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:34.080
But this is when she
was at her coolest.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.550
And I'm just going,
yeah, just sitting here

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.980
with Lily Allen, totally cool.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.150
And she's moaning away.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.960
She's going, oh, you know,
all this stuff's going on.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.860
And now they've asked
me to write a book.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.610
And I think, maybe
this is the time for me

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.440
to step in as an elder
man of show business.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.370
I said, Lily, you know
if you want my advice,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.460
you're topping the charts.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.860
You're really cool
at the moment.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.520
Don't stretch yourself too
wide by doing a book as well.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.140
Why would you?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260
And she goes, well, they've
offered me $800,000.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.502
And I'm like, OK, yeah,
maybe do the book.

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:01.960
But actually, as
it turned out, she

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.720
had to hand the advance
back because she

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.690
didn't manage to do the book.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.110
So though you go.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.985
So I have written it.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:09.250
And I have like weirdly a lot
of people-- I'm quite surprised.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.760
I'm not going to name
names-- Russell Brand--

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.150
but how many people that you
do assume would be smart enough

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.251
to write their own book
actually don't write it.

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.000
I mean, I'm sure they
have an input in it,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.855
some more than others.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:21.480
But it's weird.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.855
There are a lot
of ghost writers.

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.705
But I did actually
write my book myself.

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:28.049
MALE SPEAKER: What I
got from your book--

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.340
DOM JOLY: Was deep unhappiness.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.750
MALE SPEAKER: No, no.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.550
It's when you did
"Trigger Happy TV"--

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.900
DOM JOLY: Yeah.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.260
MALE SPEAKER: --which you're
probably best known for still.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.050
DOM JOLY: Yeah, thanks, yeah.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.216
MALE SPEAKER: A lot of the--

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:36.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.480
I mean--

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.805
DOM JOLY: Yeah,
no, no, it's fine.

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.280
MALE SPEAKER: A lot of it
was found in the edits.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.480
DOM JOLY: Yeah, oh, absolutely.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.016
MALE SPEAKER: And I
wondered with the book,

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.015
was it the same process?

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:45.710
Did you write a
lot and edit down?

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.170
DOM JOLY: No, it's really weird.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.878
I'm the world's most--
one of the reasons

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.180
I've had such an odd career
in all sorts of ways, ups

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.720
and down, is I'm
so easily bored.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720
And I can't really
stick to anything.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.400
And actually the only
thing I've ever really put

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.660
just total focus in was
"Trigger Happy," weirdly,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.016
and it was kind of when
there was no pressure.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.140
I didn't know "Trigger
Happy" was going to be huge.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.740
It was the first
comedy show I'd done.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.370
It was literally
like I'd suddenly

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.850
got in a situation where
me and my new best friend,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.034
Sam, who I made it with,
who I met in a bar, as I

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:15.200
was telling my girlfriend
that I had the opportunity

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.820
to make this show, but I
couldn't afford a cameraman.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.440
And literally Sam was the
barman, leaned over and goes,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.120
I can do that.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.480
Nobody believes the story,
but that is how we met.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.160
So we did "Trigger
Happy," really

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.550
thinking we're still excited
we're going to be on telly.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.790
And everyone left us alone.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.960
We spent a year.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.640
We basically had
fun, all the things

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.270
that afterwards came when
advertising agencies would

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.990
ring us up and offer stupid
money if we did an ad

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.497
in the "Trigger Happy" style.

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:40.330
And we'd nod going,
well, it's quite tricky.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.287
The "Trigger Happy" style
was just me making Sam laugh,

00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:45.078
and he'd shake the
camera, and that was it.

00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:46.592
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.300
But essentially "Trigger
Happy," I think,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.040
is a pretty good
hidden camera show.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.810
But I think where it
really differentiated

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.550
was when we went into the edit.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.960
And I'm kind of a
frustrated musician.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.180
I love music.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.410
I was in a band, but sadly
have no musical talent.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.877
But I've always loved
loads and loads of music.

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:05.710
It was never like thought
through like this.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.470
But when I go into
the edit, it just

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.510
made sense to me to
put my favorite moments

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.356
of my favorite
tracks over stuff.

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:15.480
And I remember the first
time we gave something in.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.076
It was the dogs, fighting dogs.

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:19.450
We used to have two dogs that
used to beat each other up.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.366
Like a lot of other
things in "Trigger Happy,"

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.400
that started with a vague point.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.020
We used to walk
through-- around here,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.490
actually, because we were
based on Charing Cross Road.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.512
And it was when all the CCTV
cameras just started going up.

00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:32.720
And you used to see all
these things and think, well,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.890
who watches these cameras?

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.890
Who's just monitoring it?

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.340
So it just made us laugh to
have the idea of setting up

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.570
two dogs, one tied to a chair,
and there's an execution scene.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.647
And we just love the idea
that somewhere in some bank

00:04:45.647 --> 00:04:48.230
someone's spooning through, it's
like, what the fuck was that?

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:51.650
So they used to start on
a camera and swoop down.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.900
But after a moment we just
thought, it doesn't matter.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.135
Just do that.

00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:56.510
And the first time
we gave it in,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.680
I had some weird U2
opera tune on it.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.500
It was all quite weird,
because you think,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.374
this is quite moving.

00:05:02.374 --> 00:05:03.920
But actually, it's just a dog.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.185
And someone at Channel
4 said, don't you

00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:08.620
think you should put
some cartoon music on it?

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.179
And I was just like, oh my
god, you so don't get this.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:12.720
So to answer the
question a long way,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.800
yes, we spent a long
time in the edit.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.880
And I think a lot of
it was about the music.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.600
Music was incredibly
expensive to clear abroad.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.320
The only place that bought
the entire soundtrack

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.830
was Germany, weirdly.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.740
And I didn't sell it
to America for ages,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.960
because if it went
to America, it

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.590
had to go with a
terrible sound alike.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.150
So all these great songs I'd
chosen, someone in his basement

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.680
just did sort of literally
like a homemade version of it.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.210
And it was just
like, oh, I can't.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.485
But in the end, I gave up.

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:42.110
And it did get to
the States like that.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.276
So yeah, the edit was what
it was all about, really.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:46.415
And I think people don't
appreciate that, really,

00:05:46.415 --> 00:05:47.790
because I think
in a funny sense,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.470
if you took all the
music off, you've

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.110
got a reasonably funny
hidden camera show

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.830
where the punchline is either
me running away or telling

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.080
someone I've had a
shattering nervous breakdown.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.931
But I think the music gave
it unwarranted depth, maybe.

00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:03.180
MALE SPEAKER: There were
three soundtracks, three CDs.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.490
DOM JOLY: There were three
CDs, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.440
I mean, that was
the coolest thing.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.240
I got a gold record
for the soundtracks.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.370
And I've never felt
more of a fraud.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.476
Because part of me is
like, that's the dream.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:14.600
When I grew up, I didn't
dream of being a comedian.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.960
I sort of, I suppose,
dreamt of being a rock star.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.010
And suddenly I've got
my own gold record.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.475
But what's it for?

00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:22.037
It's a bit like being a DJ.

00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:23.995
I'm sorry, I don't see
the skill in being a DJ.

00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:25.790
You're playing someone
else's records.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.790
I mean, that's it.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.206
So maybe you can
choose good ones,

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.027
but then to be
given a gold disk.

00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:31.110
Oh, that was me, actually.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.280
It was great.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.980
The best music story about it
was probably the most requested

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.920
song-- because a lot of
people commented on the songs.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.427
And we even had a
couple of bands--

00:06:40.427 --> 00:06:42.260
there was one called
the Honey Smugglers who

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.620
are the most obscure band.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.620
And I don't know how I
heard their one song.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.380
But after I put it
on "Trigger Happy,"

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.421
they got back together,
which was quite exciting.

00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:51.480
They lasted three months
and then broke up again.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.890
But the most requested
tune was Gordon Lightfoot,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.220
"If You Can Read My Mind."

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.010
And that was on
this mad portrait

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.100
artist in [INAUDIBLE] Square.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.964
And I hadn't heard
of Gordon Lightfoot.

00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:03.380
But now I'm married
to a Canadian.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.570
And I know that he's probably
the most famous Canadian apart

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.310
from Celine Dion,
and that song has

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.829
been covered by so many people.

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:11.120
But at the time, I didn't know.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.090
And we kept getting these
requests, what is this song?

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.055
And someone said, you
know what-- again, it

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:17.930
was me trying to be a
pop star-- why don't we

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.600
get hold of Gordon Lightfoot?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.820
He's probably living
in some, you know, log

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.265
cabin in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:25.140
And we'll tell him it's
a big hit in England,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.280
and we could make a video like
Vic Reeves did with "Dizzy,"

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.040
and we'd get the
[INAUDIBLE] number one.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.830
I was so excited.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.530
So we contacted his
people, sent the request.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.190
Nothing came back,
nothing came back.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.815
Finally I rang up,
and they said, well,

00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:38.710
can we see the show?

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.160
So we sent them the show.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.420
Time tick, nothing came out.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.020
So finally I'm
like, fuck's sake.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.506
So I had a vision of someone
running up a long path

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:46.880
to Gordon saying,
Gordon, Gordon,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.980
you're going to be back.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.085
So finally I ring
up and go, look,

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:50.050
is this going to happen or not?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.530
And they go, afraid it's a no.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.680
And said, well, why?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.280
And he said, Gordon
saw the show,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.130
and well, he just
thought it was shit.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.391
So there you go, Gordon
Lightfoot-- wanker.

00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.940
MALE SPEAKER: With
the later series,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.680
you seemed to
thrive under having

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.810
less control from the powers
that be, and so forth.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.840
DOM JOLY: I think all
telly, and probably

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.129
all business in a funny way,
must thrive from-- well,

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:15.670
I don't know.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.760
It's an odd thing.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.136
I think when you have a
certain level of-- I don't

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:22.389
know how to explain it, really.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:24.680
The odd thing to me is when
"Trigger Happy" was unknown

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.920
and it wasn't a hit at all, we
were totally left on our own.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.290
And I think certainly
in comedy, when

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.150
people say, as they often do
on Twitter, "you're not funny,"

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.630
I'm like, well, that's a
very subjective thing to say.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.429
Because if I find it
funny, then it is funny.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.190
It's just you don't
find it funny.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.140
But the one thing that
definitely isn't funny

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.210
is if 10 people get together
and decide what's funny.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.440
You end up with the
equivalent of the Eurostar

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.466
interior decoration where
someone just thought,

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:53.840
you know what,
yellow and gray is

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.960
going to offend the
least amount of people.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.570
So to me in comedy,
even if you're

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.357
doing something that's literally
everyone saying is awful,

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.190
if you find it funny,
that's all you can do.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.770
The moment you try and guess
what other people find funny

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.120
or listen to a
committee, you're fucked.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.470
And the irony of telly is
that "Trigger Happy," no one

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.950
knew who we were, so we
totally were left alone, even

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.460
into the edit and everything.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.910
And then the moment it was a
hit, logic should tell you,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.020
well, it ain't broke, fix it.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.775
Because everyone then jumps in.

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:23.660
Because they want
to be part of it.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.577
And it instantly
goes to pot, really.

00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:30.535
MALE SPEAKER: Because it
was, when it launched,

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:32.868
sandwiched between "Friends"
and "Frasier" on Channel 4.

00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:34.980
DOM JOLY: It was insane.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.650
I'd never been on
telly apart from,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.500
I'd done some stuff on the
Paramount Comedy Channel, which

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.170
was this weird channel
that only played sort

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.024
of imported American shows.

00:09:44.024 --> 00:09:46.190
But when I was there, it
was just a really odd time.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.490
For two years, there were all
these people doing little shows

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.320
that we'd put out
between the programs.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.644
They were called interstitials.

00:09:52.644 --> 00:09:54.810
And in telly, normally you
never get the opportunity

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.434
to practice.

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:58.600
Literally, you're either a
stand up or someone else,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.190
and you become well known, and
then your first thing you do

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.720
is on telly.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.126
And that's a very tricky thing.

00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:04.500
Whereas if you're
a stand up, you

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.780
spend years honing
your craft and stuff.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.715
But for some reason,
we all got lucky.

00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:09.590
We were paid nothing.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.715
But at that time at Paramount
Comedy Channel, which

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:13.820
is just up the road
in [INAUDIBLE] Place,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.080
Sasha Baron Cohen was
doing some early Borat,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.530
as it turned out then.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.370
Lee Francis is in
the art department.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.850
Little Britain were wandering
around doing a weird show

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.200
called "Mash and Peas."

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.546
Simon Peg was doing an odd
show with Edgar Wright.

00:10:26.546 --> 00:10:27.420
I mean, it was crazy.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.050
And I was looking at all
these people thinking--

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.250
it was almost like a bit
of a "Saturday Night Live"

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.460
sort of thing.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.015
Except they've all gone on to
do incredibly well in comedy,

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.630
apart from me, and
I've written this book.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.591
But no, it was good.

00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:37.840
I can't remember the question.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.350
MALE SPEAKER: How did you
cope with that level of fame?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.060
DOM JOLY: Very badly.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.520
Very badly in all sorts of ways.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.040
And I think I only
didn't understand why,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.791
because it's not like
I want to be famous.

00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.248
Because I'm not
interested in fame.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.010
But I definitely want
to be successful,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.170
because it allows you to do
these things you're enjoying.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.832
And weirdly, I just
read an interview

00:10:55.832 --> 00:10:58.890
with Louis Theroux who kind
of disappeared as well.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.710
He was getting big at the
same time as "Trigger Happy"

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.790
with weird weekends.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.915
And he went off to LA.

00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:05.290
And I never quite
understood why.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.970
And he said he went from making
these documentaries that he

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.740
really enjoyed, and
also an important part

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.350
was that people didn't really
know who Louis Theroux was.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.807
The moment you kind of felt,
is he going to stitch you up,

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:17.140
it would've been more difficult.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.740
And he said, suddenly
he went from making

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.114
shows he was really
interested in

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:23.357
that people liked to suddenly
being constantly told, oh,

00:11:23.357 --> 00:11:24.940
is he going to be
able to do it again?

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.835
Like, are you going
to get the ratings?

00:11:25.835 --> 00:11:27.990
And I suppose that's
just show biz, really.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.680
But it's deeply unpleasant.
because then you start, A,

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.620
getting worried, so you start
making bad decisions, I think.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.560
And then in the end, you
either go completely against it

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.490
and say, fuck you, and
everyone hates you,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.040
or you completely toe the
line and make appalling stuff.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.152
And I think I've
done both, actually.

00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:44.610
I've done the full
gamut, you know.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.026
MALE SPEAKER: And when you
were making "Trigger Happy TV,"

00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:52.290
the book said you got arrested
a fair bit, or throughout.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.384
Youve not been beaten up.

00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:54.300
DOM JOLY: No, weirdly.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.425
I mean, think, I'm the
first person getting beaten.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:12:00.900
I have this really odd ability
to get people to the stage

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.240
where they want to beat you up.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.770
Although, in my defense, my
comedy is not [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.720
It's really easy to
get people angry.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.190
You just find out what they
love-- their car, their garden,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.365
and just turn up.

00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:11.740
And now it's the
council's turned

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.270
your garden into a public loo.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.480
Step back.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.832
They all get mental.

00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:17.290
I didn't want to
make people angry.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.272
My whole thing,
almost, it was annoying

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.730
that people had to
sign afterwards,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.670
and you let them
know, which we did.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.550
Because I kind of love
the idea of just inserting

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.550
this surreal moment
into someone's day.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.390
So in my mind, I always
loved someone coming home

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.819
and the wife saying,
how was your day today?

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.110
And he goes, yeah, it was good.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.193
It was good-- a bit weird.

00:12:36.193 --> 00:12:38.440
I was in the park, and
a scout approached me

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.870
and asked me to mark him out of
10 for his homoerotic dancing

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.870
badge.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.590
And I love that.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.370
It was the idea that this
weird world is going on.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.810
And if I had to admit,
the person I probably

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.680
nick most ideas
from, I don't know

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.592
if anyone knows the cartoons
by Gary Larson called

00:12:54.592 --> 00:12:56.800
"The Far Side," which you're
all too young, probably.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.990
But it was amazing.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.740
Yeah, thank you.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.390
You know.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.800
And he was all about things
like a bunch of sheep

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.619
in a field, chatting
aways and smoking.

00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:05.410
And one of them shouts,
"car!" and they all

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.576
go back down, sort of thing.

00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:10.360
And so I love that kind of
odd, slightly surreal humor.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.400
But then again, I think
when your success,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.830
you even start
believing yourself

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.120
that you meant more than that.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.950
Because analyzing
comedy is terrible.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.289
All I want to do is be funny.

00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:21.330
And there was a scene--
a terrible one, actually,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.130
it wasn't even funny-- where
I'm a Chelsea pensioner pushing

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.260
a pram down the steps.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.440
Really not funny, looking back.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.380
And if anything, it
was a sort of mild piss

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.629
take of that scene in
the-- what's the movie?

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:37.670
AUDIENCE: "Untouchables."

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.910
DOM JOLY: "Untouchables,"
thank you very much.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.150
But "The Guardian"
reviewed it saying,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.115
incredibly brave reworking
of Eisenstein's "Potemkin."

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:45.810
And I'm like--

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.214
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:48.630
You know, which
was a famous scene

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.171
on the steps in
"Russian Revolution."

00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:51.220
So I was like, of course.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.130
That's exactly what I meant.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:53.900
So yeah.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.370
MALE SPEAKER: And well, from
filming "Trigger Happy," three

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.780
seasons, were there?

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.210
DOM JOLY: There were two
seasons of six shows eat.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.950
And then I wanted to, again,
this is my first huge career

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.540
mistake.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.980
The one thing I've
learned is never ever--

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.420
MALE SPEAKER: There's a table.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.890
DOM JOLY: Never
make any decision

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.459
that's important straight
after you've just

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:12.500
finished doing something.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.291
And I'm sure that
applies in anything else.

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.362
Because you're sick
to death of it.

00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:17.070
You're knackered.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.945
You're disillusioned.

00:14:17.945 --> 00:14:19.680
You probably hate
everyone you're with.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.222
So the moment you finish that,
that is not the moment to say,

00:14:22.222 --> 00:14:24.513
ooh, I'm not going to do
another "Trigger Happy," which

00:14:24.513 --> 00:14:25.620
is what I told Channel 4.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.569
What you need to
do is say, I'd like

00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:29.610
to do some vanity projects
for a couple of years,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.849
and I'll give you a "Trigger
Happy" every two years

00:14:31.849 --> 00:14:32.640
when I'm refreshed.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.521
As it was, I treated it a
bit like a band, really.

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:36.270
I was like, right.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.394
We've made our great album.

00:14:37.394 --> 00:14:38.540
Now let's leave.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.850
I'm never going to do it again.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.600
And then Channel 4
said, will you at least

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.820
do two Christmas specials?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.487
And I said, naw.

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:45.570
And then they offered me
a stupid amount of money.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.940
I went, yeah, yeah, OK, I will.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.932
And they were
actually quite good.

00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:50.140
But then we kind of fell out.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.223
I fell out with Channel 4.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.240
It was quite odd.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.080
And just as I was
wondering what to do,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.030
I got a call from the pope, or
Alan Yentob, as we call him,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:01.230
who's this weird head of the
BBC who literally pillages

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.630
the modern art galleries
to put in his-- I mean,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.280
he's like a sort of war
lord at the top of the BBC.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.750
And he took me to
the River Cafe.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.450
And I wasn't quite sure
what I was doing there,

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.042
and he took a call halfway
through. (WHISPERS) Sorry.

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:12.866
Mick Jagger.

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:13.870
And I was like, what?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.750
Who is this guy?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.331
And I slowly realized he
was luring me to the BBC.

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.830
And A, I thought,
well, that's good,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.829
because I can go somewhere
else and start again.

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:24.320
And he kept saying, the thing
about the BBC is we're public.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.390
We're paid for by the
people, by the license fee.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.060
There's no ads.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.518
So we're not
interested in ratings.

00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:30.550
There'll be no pressure.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.120
We just want you
to make whatever

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.860
it is you want to make.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.630
I thought, that
sounds brilliant.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.110
The moment I got to
the BBC, I realized

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.110
that was total bollocks.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.590
I mean they're so obsessed with
ratings that I got terrified.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.150
But on top of that, when
you work for the BBC,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.000
things change.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.167
On my second day at the
Beeb, I got given an office.

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:47.291
And I'm sitting there
thinking, I've got an office.

00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:48.430
This is so exciting.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.850
And a guy comes
in looking almost

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.940
like one of the two
Ronnies, like a BBC workman.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.149
And he goes, Mr. Joly,
everyone who gets

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:56.440
a new office gets it decorated.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.922
So I just wanted to know what
color you'd like it painted.

00:15:58.922 --> 00:16:00.630
I'm like, I hadn't
even thought about it.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.020
He goes, well, we're
going to paint.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.250
So what color would you like?

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.380
And I went, red.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.110
So he goes, all right,
and off he went.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.380
Two days later in the
mirror, huge page saying,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.490
"Trigger Happy" star has
tantrum, refuses to start-- no,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.890
sees red, refuses to
start work at the BBC

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.760
until his suite of
offices are painted red.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.080
And I'm like, fucking hell.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.510
So I suddenly realized that
we weren't little punky people

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.330
on the outside.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.030
And suddenly you're
on your pedestal,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.290
and the only way was down.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.010
And that's terrifying,
especially when

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.567
I'm just much happier being
a sort of little irritant,

00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:33.400
really, on the side.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.275
I'm much happier doing
that, which luckily is

00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:36.728
what I've come back to being.

00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:38.644
MALE SPEAKER: What's the
most outlandish thing

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:40.372
a tabloid has lied about?

00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:41.830
DOM JOLY: Well, my
favorite one was

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.169
I found out-- I'm sort of
quite estranged from a lot

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.710
of my family, which
I went buoy with.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.250
But I've got quite
an odd family.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.220
And my sister I hadn't spoken
to for about eight years.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.095
She lives in Lebanon.

00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:52.230
And my dad and I
sort of barely spoke.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.440
And he lived in France.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.710
And suddenly I get
two calls from them,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.650
which was rare enough.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.964
And my sister said,
just to let you know--

00:16:58.964 --> 00:17:00.880
this is just as "Trigger
Happy" is happening--

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.900
someone from "The Daily
Mail"-- and this is in Beirut,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.720
in the middle of the war.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.511
I'm like, fucking hell,
how'd he get there?

00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:07.050
He was knocking on
the door, trying

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.924
to ask questions about
you, because they were

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:10.849
doing a piece on my background.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.744
She goes, I'm not sure
if I helped you or not,

00:17:13.744 --> 00:17:14.869
but I set the dogs on them.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.118
I was like, fucking brilliant.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:16.900
That's great.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.280
And then my dad, a
man who literally I've

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.720
had probably four
conversations within 10 years,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.785
all about cricket,
rings me up, out

00:17:23.785 --> 00:17:25.410
of the blue, very
awkward conversation.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.250
And he says-- and obviously
he's feeling a bit

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.500
guilty about our relationship.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.850
He said, a man, very nice
man, from "The Daily Mail"

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.805
turned up at the door,
asking about you.

00:17:32.805 --> 00:17:34.430
So I hope you don't
mind, I let him in.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.940
And I was like, what?

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.200
And then I gave him a
couple of photos as well.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.110
And I was like,
what are you doing?

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.197
So when the expose
came out, I was like,

00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:43.280
what are they going to do?

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.180
And it literally
said, exclusive,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.130
"Trigger Happy" star
is middle class.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.500
I was like, OK, if that's
the best you can do.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.810
But then they had two pictures
my dad had given of one of me

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.305
on a pony and one of me naked.

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:57.180
It was about when I was
about four years old.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.069
It was like, oh.

00:17:58.069 --> 00:17:59.610
So I've been all
right with tabloids.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.680
I've kind of kept away
from them, really.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.624
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, and do
you think that you seeking out

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.730
new challenges and being
an irritant, as you say,

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.849
do you think that led
you to be-- you've

00:18:06.849 --> 00:18:09.140
done a fair number of those
"I'm a Celeb" and "Splash!"

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.794
and so forth.

00:18:09.794 --> 00:18:12.210
Is that the reason you chose
those, or just the challenge?

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.001
DOM JOLY: Well, I think
there's two things.

00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:16.800
One thing the book kind
of talks about is my life

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.150
makes total sense to me.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.920
Because I think most
people when they're,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.860
for instance, like a hidden
camera comedian in England,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.317
hidden camera is seen
really as a bit rubbish.

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:26.400
And most of it is rubbish.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.690
It's just people shouting.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.690
It's a bit crap.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.040
In America, because hidden
camera-- a lot of people

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.600
don't realize, it
is all improvised.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.420
There's no scripts.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.840
When I go up to someone,
I'm making it up as I go.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.190
And that's quite a skill.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.780
But in England,
there's nowhere to go

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.670
with that really apart
from that awful show,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.260
was it "Whose Line
is it Anyway,"

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.384
which always ended up with
John Sessions pretending

00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:46.190
he was in a lift.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.415
In America, people who
do this sort of thing

00:18:48.415 --> 00:18:50.012
move on to do things
like "Curb Your

00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:51.470
Enthusiasm," "Spinal
Tap," which is

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.850
all sort of improv and comedy.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.250
And it's kind of
quite respected.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.770
So here, if you
look at "Fonejacker"

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.166
or if you look at Ali
G, what you really do

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.540
is you make your
name doing that.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.177
And then you become an actor.

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:05.010
And I have no interest
in becoming an actor.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.320
My only skill is
making up my own stuff.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.462
I don't want to spout
someone else's stuff.

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:11.920
So for me, when "Trigger Happy"
happened, I thought, great.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.474
This allows me to write for
newspapers, go travel writing,

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.140
and write travel
books, which I've done.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.350
I've written books and
gone skiing in Iran

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.711
and weekended in Chernobyl,
and gone to North Korea.

00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:22.460
But the problem is
that the sort of people

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.810
who like "Trigger Happy"-- I
don't want to say this exactly,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.230
but not great readers,
maybe, let's say.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.560
And the people who
love travel books

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.420
are possibly not the greatest
fans of hidden cameras.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.240
So I've got these
two odd fan bases,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.890
that if they met in a room
would hate each other probably.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.130
And one side might actually
beat the other side up.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.140
So it's quite odd to do.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.019
So when I did comedy,
it would pay the bills.

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:46.560
And then I'd go and
do what I wanted,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.560
which is travel writing,
which, let me tell you,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.680
does not pay anything.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.010
I mean, you basically
fund your own travel,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.510
but the good thing is someone
will read about it afterwards.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.980
That's the only good thing.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.790
And then when comedy
stopped for a bit,

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.270
the reality shows
were, literally,

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.520
another way of just
paying the mortgage

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.980
so I could go traveling.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.510
"I'm a Celeb," I kind
of was in so two minds.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.200
They ask everyone every year.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.000
As far as I can
see, "I'm a Celeb"

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.420
has a list of 3,000 celebs.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.890
And every year, they send out
this mass email that goes,

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.590
we'd love you to be
on "I'm a Celeb."

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.339
And depending on the
state of your career,

00:20:18.339 --> 00:20:19.410
certain people say yes.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.930
And then once they've got the
pool of people who said yes,

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.354
they cast it.

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:25.770
So they'd asked me for about
eight years, and I'd said no,

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.969
despite loving the show.

00:20:26.969 --> 00:20:29.510
And then just as they asked me
that year, I suddenly thought,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.650
A, hmm.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.730
I need a bit of money.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.991
B, I genuinely thought,
actually, it might suit me.

00:20:34.991 --> 00:20:37.240
Because it's one of the few
places-- one of the people

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.480
who was in there with
me was Jenny Eclair,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.430
who I really loved.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.914
I don't know many comedians,
but Jenny weirdly, was

00:20:41.914 --> 00:20:43.580
quite frightened in
there, because she's

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.190
used to doing stand up.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.480
She's got a routine.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.780
She controls her comedy.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.155
So she was always
worried when we

00:20:49.155 --> 00:20:51.310
were set a task, because
she's not good at improv.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.580
Whereas for me, it was a joy.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.379
They told me to be a
spy and lie to the camp

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.545
and pretend to speak Korean.

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:57.440
I'm like, hello.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.927
This is exactly
what it should be.

00:20:58.927 --> 00:21:00.510
So yeah, that's why
I did those shows.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.560
The only one I do
regret is "Splash!"

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.600
If I have to talk
about it, the reason

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.580
I did "Splash!"-- A,
"Splash!" hadn't gone out.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.985
So the way these
shows are sold to you

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:12.000
is always very different
from how they are.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.810
MALE SPEAKER: Training
with Tom Daley.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.518
DOM JOLY: It was sold
to me as, would you

00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:17.210
like to learn an Olympic skill,
high diving in particular.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.700
And I weirdly have a bit of
a back history in diving.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.640
I get a calendar
every year of my kids.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.252
We jump off these cliffs.

00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:24.710
And I'm pretty good
at jumping off.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.710
But there are always these
annoying 15-year-olds

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.010
who turn up and do a flip.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.135
And in the back of my mind
I thought, just before I

00:21:30.135 --> 00:21:32.900
get too old, I'd love to just
have one dive that kind of

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.100
shows them up a bit.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.975
So they go, Tom Daley's
going to teach you.

00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:37.266
I'm like, well, it's brilliant.

00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:38.380
What could go wrong?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.400
It was, A, it was ripoff.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.480
Tom Daley turned
up probably twice

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.190
for about 10 minutes, filmed
going, mmm, that's good,

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.442
and then disappeared.

00:21:46.442 --> 00:21:47.900
Secondly, what I
didn't realize was

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.665
the show was designed as a sort
of homoerotic TOWIE spin off.

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:54.850
And the first guest was
when we had a costume thing.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.310
I go, what do you mean, costume?

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.730
I'm not wearing
Speedos, but we're

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.063
going to be wearing swim trunks.

00:21:59.063 --> 00:21:59.690
They go, oh no.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.290
And it was all
tassels and stuff.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.800
And I was like, oh my god.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.570
Then Joey Essex turned
up, and I met him.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.770
And I just couldn't understand
if he was real or not.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.700
First two times I
met him, genuinely,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.900
he was locked in the loo
and couldn't get out.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.041
And I had to release him.

00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:15.540
Genuinely.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.790
And I thought he's either
the greatest improv comedian

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.320
that exists or he's so stupid.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.400
It's like, how did he
get here sort of thing.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.140
And then come the night, I
was actually doing quite well.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.640
In rehearsal, I was
the first person

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.810
to go off the 10 meter board,
which is seriously frightening.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.400
And I thought, you know
what, I'll be all right.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.570
My kids come along.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.395
It's probably the first thing
my kids have come to, my wife.

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.020
It's all there.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.726
It's live.

00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:38.350
And I get so nervous
beforehand that me

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.940
and [INAUDIBLE] consume a
whole bottle of champagne.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.400
I'm totally pissed.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.575
Adrenaline hits me so badly.

00:22:45.575 --> 00:22:48.200
I go out, and they announce your
name, and I'm like in a dream.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.890
I go to the top, and I just
think, get over the dive.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.379
And Vernon Kay's up there
going, so, Dom, how you feeling?

00:22:53.379 --> 00:22:54.920
I'm like, I don't
fucking-- I don't--

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.450
And everything I'd learned went.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.770
And I just jumped.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.300
And I literally
went in slow motion.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.380
I felt myself go over.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.900
And I thought, fuck, this is it.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.160
I'm going to land on my back.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.775
I'm either going to die or
be paralyzed, live on air,

00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:09.470
in a homoerotic reality show
in front of my children.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.900
And I hit the water.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.060
It hurt like nothing
I can describe.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.020
And I came up.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.610
And I was sort of like that.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.870
There wasn't even a
murmur from the crowd.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.870
It wasn't even sympathy.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.220
It was just like, fucking hell.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.370
And I was just like that.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.370
And all I can see was my
daughter who's just, oh shit.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.790
So that was probably the lowest
moment in my career, yeah.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.530
But the joy of doing what
I do, becasue I write,

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.940
is even then I
thinking, actually, this

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.220
will be funny to write about.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.187
And I suppose that's
the one good thing.

00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:39.395
If I travel write, obviously
I'd love to go somewhere

00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:41.470
and it's brilliant, and I
stay in an amazing hotel,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.310
and everyone's lovely,
and I have a nice holiday.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.740
But if, like everyone,
and you go on a trip

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.810
and it turns into a nightmare,
I'm always thinking,

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.995
well, actually, this is
going to be a lot funnier

00:23:47.995 --> 00:23:49.130
to write about.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.190
So always part of me is
thinking, things go wrong,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.927
I can use it.

00:23:53.927 --> 00:23:55.510
MALE SPEAKER: From
the travel writing,

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.600
what was your biggest
blag you reckon?

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.950
And we'll take some questions.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.480
DOM JOLY: Holy fuck, my life--
all travel writing is blag.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.938
It's insane, because
travel writing

00:24:02.938 --> 00:24:06.530
pays zero money because
they basically say, look.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.120
We'll probably be able
to organize a free hotel,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.419
sometimes a free flight.

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:11.960
So what, you want
to be paid as well?

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.660
And you're like,
well, kind of, yeah.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.950
So there's two types
of travel writing.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.240
There's what I call the
Piers Morgan travel writing,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.470
"Mail on Sunday," where Piers
Morgan takes his wife and two

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.340
kids to Lamborghini
world in Dubai,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.160
which is just the
sort of place he'd go.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.250
Hello, Piers.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.430
And all is paid.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.310
He insists on first class there.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.840
He wanders around
Lamborghini world.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.680
He stays in the
hotel for two nights,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.257
comes back, writes literally
an article saying, my kids

00:24:35.257 --> 00:24:36.590
and I went to Lamborghini world.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.506
We drove Lamborghinis.

00:24:37.506 --> 00:24:38.420
It was amazing.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.350
And that's it.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.350
And then there's
proper travel writing,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.814
which to me is about going
somewhere off the beaten track,

00:24:43.814 --> 00:24:45.480
trying to really get
an adventure, which

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.314
is more and more hard.

00:24:47.314 --> 00:24:49.230
Because nowadays, it's
very difficult anywhere

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.104
where you're not 100
meters from a Starbucks,

00:24:51.104 --> 00:24:52.870
even if you're in
Libya or wherever.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.430
So things like North Korea--
but in fact, the only place

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.939
you can really
go, unfortunately,

00:24:56.939 --> 00:24:59.230
are places that are either
in the middle of a civil war

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.740
or under a horrible
dictatorship.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.285
So you have this odd,
should I go there or not?

00:25:03.285 --> 00:25:04.660
And that's proper
travel writing.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.990
And in the old days,
people like "Sunday Times"

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.690
would pay for that.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.140
But now more and more it's all
about advertising, weirdly.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.879
Because Google, I think,
says the algorithms--

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.920
they're all trying to
drive you to their website.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.360
And they don't want
this sort of thing.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.984
So now travel writing
in "Sunday Times"

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:21.280
is lists of world's
top 10 beaches

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.530
and best honeymoon things.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.354
And that's probably
Google's fault, or Buzzfeed.

00:25:25.354 --> 00:25:26.770
MALE SPEAKER: On
that, does anyone

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.930
have any questions [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.460
We've got a mic in the back.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.982
DOM JOLY: Well, I can
hear you probably.

00:25:33.982 --> 00:25:36.330
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
your thoughts on a show

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.053
like "Revolution Will Be
Televised," [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:40.053 --> 00:25:45.150
hidden camera,
[INAUDIBLE], family show.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.652
It's kind of a similar
point where you left off.

00:25:47.652 --> 00:25:49.360
It's on a couple of
shows here, you know,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.895
that will recognize
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:50.895 --> 00:25:53.080
is kind of an extension
strategy, I guess.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.604
Do you think it's
the end for them?

00:25:54.604 --> 00:25:56.520
DOM JOLY: See, I should
never slag off comedy,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.228
but I'm going to.

00:25:57.228 --> 00:25:57.980
I hate that show.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.550
And I'll tell you why I hate it.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.360
I started off, the first job I
got on "The Mark Thomas Comedy

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.100
Product," which was basically an
English version of the "Michael

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.740
Moore Show" before
Michael Moore.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.762
And Mark is a stand
up who you might know.

00:26:08.762 --> 00:26:10.220
He's a bit of a
political activist.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.969
And he can get a bit
annoying occasionally

00:26:11.969 --> 00:26:13.880
with his militant setting.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.410
But the idea at
the time was good.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.632
It was like, let's take on MPs
and set them up and do stunts.

00:26:19.632 --> 00:26:21.090
And I think that
was the first one.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.620
And I was the
research on that show,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.920
and that's where I started off.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.580
And then when I was doing early
stuff for "Trigger Happy,"

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.330
I took that on. and I was
attacking Cool Britannia

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.590
and putting fake
Millennium Domes

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.667
in Peter Mandelson's
garden and standing

00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:34.750
as a teddy bear and stuff.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.610
And it was kind of
odd surreal activism.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.380
And when we went to Channel
4 to pitch for the show,

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.070
I was actually
pitching show which

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.744
was about taking
on Cool Britannia,

00:26:43.744 --> 00:26:45.410
and it was kind of a
bit like that show.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.140
And the commissioning
editor had just

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.530
finished doing Chris
Morris's "Brass Eye," which

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.586
literally she'd been in nothing
but legal battles for a year.

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:54.460
And she just went, ah,
fuck, not another one.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.490
She said, please.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.064
If you can do anything
that wasn't socially based,

00:26:58.064 --> 00:26:59.730
so she said, can you
do something silly?

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.460
And that's how "Trigger
Happy" happened.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.670
With "The Revolution
That Must Be Televised,"

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.430
my problem with it,
genuinely, is that I just

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.690
don't think it's that funny.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.660
And I think you either
have to do something

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.172
where you're being funny,
and if you make a point,

00:27:14.172 --> 00:27:15.380
it's kind of as a side thing.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.800
Or you have to literally
be, I'm a hardcore whatever.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.070
And I think they're
not that political,

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.230
but they're not that funny.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.597
And so they end up
kind of just shoving

00:27:25.597 --> 00:27:26.680
microphones in their face.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.810
But then maybe I'm just old and
I don't know comedy anymore.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.700
I don't know.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.485
I love the name of the show.

00:27:31.485 --> 00:27:32.860
And I kind of
think, yeah, you're

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.735
exactly what I was, an annoying
little posh bloke 20 years ago.

00:27:35.735 --> 00:27:37.360
So probably that's
why I don't like it,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.901
because they're on
telly and I'm not.

00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:39.948
And they won a BAFTA.

00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:41.590
So did "Fonejacker."

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.524
I didn't win a BAFTA,
so yeah, that's why.

00:27:43.524 --> 00:27:44.440
But good luck to them.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.820
And the other thing
they do-- sorry--

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.050
when they go to America,
what I've realized, again,

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.383
is the classic way all shows go.

00:27:49.383 --> 00:27:50.940
You do two shows.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.200
Your second show's probably
a bit more successful.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.840
And then the third show, it's
called the "On the Buses"

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.630
Spanish holiday thing.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.660
You suddenly think, fuck,
we can get people to come.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.030
So I started seeing if
I could get madness.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.154
You get cameos.

00:28:04.154 --> 00:28:06.820
And then once you've got all the
cameos of the people you want--

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.866
so Ricky Gervais did it well
with "Extras"-- you then think,

00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:10.990
where can we go on holiday?

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.820
We should go to do
an American show.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.348
And they very rarely
work when you go abroad.

00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:17.514
So I didn't answer anything
there, but there you go.

00:28:17.514 --> 00:28:18.382
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:28:18.382 --> 00:28:18.816
It's good to hear
your opinion on it.

00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:19.250
Appreciate it.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.660
DOM JOLY: I'm really sorry
if you are watching this.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.730
I hate slagging off
other comedians.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.210
I'm not slagging him off.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:22.960
It's just whatever.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.928
AUDIENCE: Have you seen
much of YouTube videos,

00:28:24.928 --> 00:28:26.896
because prank videos are
quite big on YouTube,

00:28:26.896 --> 00:28:28.126
and I wonder if
you've seen them,

00:28:28.126 --> 00:28:30.792
or what "Trigger Happy" would've
been like if you'd done it now.

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.920
DOM JOLY: Two things, really,
the reason "Trigger Happy"

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.962
happened was because it
was just at that year

00:28:36.962 --> 00:28:39.720
where cameras became
available in the shops.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.220
They were called
three chip cameras,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.350
which now when you look at
the quality, it's awful.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.600
But it was the first
time that for a grand

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.530
you could buy a
camera which you could

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.970
use which was, at the time,
good enough to go on telly.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.460
A year before that, if you
wanted to film anything,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.590
you had to hire a proper
cameramen, proper sound man.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.510
Nothing wrong with that,
but they cost money.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.670
So it meant you only had
a limited amount of time.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.282
And suddenly we
bought that camera,

00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:03.990
and we just filmed
and filmed, because it

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.390
wasn't costing any money.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.570
So that was huge.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.530
But if YouTube
had existed then--

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.420
and it came probably
five years afterwards-- I

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.450
wouldn't have bothered
going to TV channels.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.640
Why would I go to a
TV channel and say,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.530
can I give you 90% of my
earnings to put it out?

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.370
I would have set up
a YouTube channel.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.110
And if it worked well enough,
worked out some sort of deal--

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.690
I don't know how you pay
them-- but there you go.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.440
So yeah, I think
YouTube's great for that.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.150
And weirdly, pranks
and cats seem

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.130
to be the things
that really work.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.790
And ironically, there is no hub.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.740
If you want humor, you go
to College Humor or UNILAD,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.240
or I'm sure there's
many cat websites.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.970
But ironically, there
is no go-to site

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.074
for hidden camera stuff,
which gives me an idea, which

00:29:47.074 --> 00:29:48.240
is what I'm doing right now.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:53.557 --> 00:29:55.056
AUDIENCE: Can you
just give us a bit

00:29:55.056 --> 00:29:56.514
of an insight to
your crazy process

00:29:56.514 --> 00:29:59.337
that gave rise to so many of
those pretty exquisite seeds?

00:29:59.337 --> 00:30:00.670
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I will say--

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] or was
that a collaboration somehow?

00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:04.848
DOM JOLY: I always
say this as a joke,

00:30:04.848 --> 00:30:07.024
but genuinely, it's kind
of probably why I predated

00:30:07.024 --> 00:30:08.940
having walked around
your offices, the concept

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.605
of the hot desk and the
sleep pod and stuff.

00:30:11.605 --> 00:30:12.980
When we first
started, because we

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.170
didn't know how to
come up with ideas,

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.749
we'd heard about this thing
called the writing room.

00:30:18.749 --> 00:30:20.165
And we were trying
to be grownups.

00:30:20.165 --> 00:30:21.706
We thought, fuck,
we're on Channel 4.

00:30:21.706 --> 00:30:24.070
So we'd sit in a room
together and literally

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.570
stare at each other, me and
Sam, and have no ideas at all.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.750
And then we realized
the best way

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.666
to have ideas, especially
for "Trigger Happy,"

00:30:29.666 --> 00:30:32.070
because it was about stuff,
was just to go and do things.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.339
So I think we blagged--
I think, yeah, Sam and I,

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:37.130
we went interrailing,
which was just crazy.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.720
We got Channel 4 to pay for
us to go on a two week railway

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.070
journey around Europe.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.910
And I think I got
two ideas from that.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.580
We went up to
Scotland to play golf,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.660
didn't get any ideas from that.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.640
But we got arrested.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.574
Because on the way down,
we couldn't resist.

00:30:51.574 --> 00:30:53.490
It's a horrible joke,
and I'm not proud of it.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.590
But we went through
this tiny little town.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.570
And there was this sign
outside this building,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.890
and it said, West Highland's
Dyslexic Association.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.320
And it was so weird, and
it was like the only thing

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.200
in this village.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.180
And so I'm not proud of this.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.805
It's not funny.

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:09.440
But we did instantly get a
little sign, put it on a board,

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.210
and wrote, stop this
now but all misspelled

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.350
and just stood outside it.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.434
And it just made us laugh.

00:31:14.434 --> 00:31:16.933
And of course they thought we
were having a go at dyslexics,

00:31:16.933 --> 00:31:17.769
which we weren't.

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:19.810
But to answer your question,
genuinely I normally

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.490
answer this really glibly
and just say, in the pub.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.279
But genuinely, that
is what happens.

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:26.820
The only real difference with
something like "Trigger Happy,"

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.290
see everyone goes
out with mates,

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.790
and you get a bit pissed.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.060
And you all have funny ideas.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.262
But most of us,
possibly not at Google,

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:35.095
then wake up the next
morning and think, oh,

00:31:35.095 --> 00:31:37.275
that was a good
night, go to work.

00:31:37.275 --> 00:31:39.092
And I was suddenly
in the stage where

00:31:39.092 --> 00:31:41.050
you'd wake up and think,
fuck, that was a good.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.710
You'd wait till you were
sober to check it was good.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.235
And then you'd ring someone up.

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:46.610
So for instance,
a great example,

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.550
of my favorite sketch
of ever is the snail,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.930
just because it's kind
of perfect, really.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.900
And it was this snail coming
up to a zebra crossing,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.982
walking totally normally,
waiting by the zebra crossing.

00:31:56.982 --> 00:31:59.190
Obviously it was some very
sad David Bowie music just

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.390
to make it arty.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.650
And then everyone stops.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.940
And then I get on the
floor, and I crawl really

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.320
slowly across the floor.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.459
And then I get up and
walk across normally.

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.000
Now there's so many
elements to that.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.674
I remember thinking suddenly--
because you get into the mood.

00:32:12.674 --> 00:32:14.590
You see a milkman, you
think, [GASPS] milkman.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.800
And I suddenly was in
the pub, and I remember.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.425
It was a Cock &amp; Bottle
in Notting Hill.

00:32:17.425 --> 00:32:19.340
And I go to Sam, I go, snail.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.210
Snail.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.500
And the great thing
was we both realized

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.410
we're probably in the
only country in the world

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.326
where that would work.

00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:28.906
If I went to a road in America
and started crawling across it

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:31.610
as a snail, I'd be run
over by a monster truck.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.409
A redneck would get out and
sort of beat me to death.

00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:35.950
But there is one
bit when you rewatch

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.059
that, if you ever do rewatch it,
I'm going across really slowly.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:40.850
And as a cab there and
there's another one.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.510
And as I'm crawling across,
Sam's hidden in a garden.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.110
I suddenly realize there's a
gap, obviously, between the two

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.930
cars.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.190
And if there was a
motorbike coming,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.870
it wouldn't see the snail.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.890
And so halfway across
I suddenly think, fuck.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.330
If I'm in the middle
and a motorbike comes,

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.163
I'm going to be hit.

00:32:55.163 --> 00:32:57.680
So sort of speed up a
bit and then slow down.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.740
So in hindsight, I've
looked at that sketch.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.740
And I've thought, if I
was really perfectionist,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.096
it should have had a tiny
bit of slime coming out

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.210
the back of it.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.770
But apart from that,
it was perfect.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.180
And that was a classic example
of how we overplayed it.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.017
We did it, the first
time, it worked perfectly.

00:33:13.017 --> 00:33:14.850
And literally the first
time we ever did it,

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.891
it was on Red Cliff Gardens,
and that was the one

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:18.210
we used in "Trigger Happy."

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.280
So we should have
just said, right.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.870
Let's move on.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.800
But we were so
excited and laughing.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.730
Sam goes, do it again.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.080
Do it again.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.330
And I go, yeah, all
right, I'll do it again.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.250
So same thing happens.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.900
I go up, crawl across, and
suddenly I'm halfway across.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.280
I've just got past the motorbike
gap, and all I can see is feet.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.550
And I see that one of
the cars has stopped.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.910
There's two feet have got
out, like two pairs of feet.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.740
And they're walking towards me.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.570
And I was thinking,
fuck, are they

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.420
going to kick me in the face?

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.560
I couldn't move or get
out or anything like that.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.764
And I sort of look up,
and they're two policeman.

00:33:43.764 --> 00:33:45.680
So there's this fantastic
moment which kind of

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.549
reminded me of the
Paul Merton sketch

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:48.840
where he's a policeman on acid.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.764
And I can imagine him going,
we observe the gastropod crawl

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.055
slowly across a zebra crossing.

00:33:54.055 --> 00:33:55.870
But anyway, there's
this little standoff.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.135
And I finally go, all right.

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:58.874
Like that.

00:33:58.874 --> 00:34:00.290
And there's another
great silence.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.665
And then a policeman, he's
quite a sweary one, just said,

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:04.924
I have no fucking idea
what you're fucking doing.

00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:07.340
But if you don't fuck off now,
you'll be fucking arrested.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.880
So I stand up, and I sprint
off going, sorry about that.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.650
And we couldn't show
it, because we didn't

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.000
have the policeman's consent.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.420
But that's probably my
favorite off out clip.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.715
But basically the pub, yeah.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.456
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dom,
thanks for coming in.

00:34:26.456 --> 00:34:27.932
As a cricket fan,
it's a pleasure

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.259
of listening to your interview
on TMS the other day--

00:34:30.259 --> 00:34:31.550
DOM JOLY: "Test Match Special."

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.466
None of you know that.

00:34:32.466 --> 00:34:34.520
That is the highlight
of my entire life.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.429
I've just had [INAUDIBLE]
said no for the third time.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.190
This time quite
specifically, I'm

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.500
afraid he's not of our caliber.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.290
You know, yeah, I'm not ready.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.710
But "Test Match Special."

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.270
I was on.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.520
Does anyone know what that is?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.576
40 minutes with Agar.

00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:48.909
It's like their lunchtime in
the middle of a test match.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:49.670
AUDIENCE: It's my dream.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.510
DOM JOLY: If you're a
middle class Englishman,

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.593
you've made it, basically.

00:34:52.593 --> 00:34:55.170
Like my dad died before--
that would be the first thing

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.410
I've ever done that my dad
would go, oh, that's good.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.910
Yeah.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.030
So I enjoyed that.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.260
AUDIENCE: So my
question is, if you

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.420
were offered to trade
your whole career

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.300
as it happened for maybe
Alistair Cook's, or you said

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.231
you were a bit [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:11.231 --> 00:35:13.230
DOM JOLY: I'm more a
batsman, I think, but yeah.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.760
AUDIENCE: Would you take it?

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.509
DOM JOLY: So basically
the career I've had

00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:16.480
or internation--

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.669
AUDIENCE: Or Alistair Cook?

00:35:17.669 --> 00:35:18.960
DOM JOLY: It depends, isn't it?

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.910
Because he might
completely fuck up.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.720
Because I think the
only way I'd take

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.940
the swap is I'd, A, need to
be a successful cricketer.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.810
And Cook has his
moments, doesn't he?

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.765
But also you then-- however
good you are as a cricketer,

00:35:31.765 --> 00:35:34.700
your life's over
at 35, unless you

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.515
make the jump into commentary,
which Botham does, whatever.

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:40.479
And I think Cook is
to boring to do that.

00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:41.770
I don't think he would do that.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:45.485
So I'd have to be someone
that made the jump.

00:35:45.485 --> 00:35:46.670
AUDIENCE: KP?

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:51.240
DOM JOLY: Oh, see, KP-- sorry,
this is a cricket thing.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.860
KP is this Kevin
Pietersen, who's,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.110
apart from being South
African, which is a big problem

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.665
pain for England, is
probably our greatest player,

00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:58.873
but he's been such a wanker
that essentially the rest

00:35:58.873 --> 00:36:00.190
of the team don't want him in.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.320
And I think it doesn't matter.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.590
If he's good, he should be in.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.280
But the problem is, Piers
Morgan has literally

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.430
launched a one man
internet campaign demanding

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.750
that he should go back in.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.725
And I'm so annoyed
by Piers Morgan

00:36:12.725 --> 00:36:14.100
that I don't want
KP on the team.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.250
So I think he's
probably doing it.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.355
Yeah, I wouldn't mind being KP.

00:36:16.355 --> 00:36:16.900
He's quite good.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.400
Yeah.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.884 --> 00:36:20.175
AUDIENCE: So the answer's yes.

00:36:20.175 --> 00:36:20.470
DOM JOLY: You know.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.320
I'd like to do both.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.080
Is that possible?

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.080
I'd like to open with
batting and then go and do

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.001
the squirrel stuff.

00:36:25.001 --> 00:36:27.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.829
Maybe the England team mascot,
that's what I could be.

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:31.620
I don't think it's
going to happen anyways.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.270
It's too late.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.954
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dom,
thanks for very much.

00:36:34.954 --> 00:36:35.837
It's been really fun.

00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:36.670
DOM JOLY: Thank you.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.870
AUDIENCE: Quick question,
from "Trigger Happy" days,

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.470
was there anything that
was cut by Channel 4

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.214
that you thought was brilliant
and that you could talk us

00:36:44.214 --> 00:36:44.800
through now.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.258
DOM JOLY: See,
that's really funny.

00:36:46.258 --> 00:36:48.265
They didn't actually
have power of it.

00:36:48.265 --> 00:36:50.510
I had power of final cut.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.175
But you couldn't be
a complete wanker.

00:36:52.175 --> 00:36:54.050
Basically, we spent all
the time in the edit.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.360
You got the show.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.200
And then the commissioners
would come in.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.650
And even if it was the
most perfect program ever,

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.430
which it never was,
they wouldn't have a job

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.440
if they didn't sort
of say something.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.690
So our plan, our
cunning plan, which

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.240
we thought was
really cool, was we'd

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.220
make the show
beautiful and great,

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.910
and then we'd always put
in something really shit

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.500
that we hated, and
it just stuck out.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.130
And the idea was
they'll come in,

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.686
and they'll say, well, love
it, but apart from that.

00:37:20.686 --> 00:37:22.810
And we'd sort of go, oh,
really, you don't like it?

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:24.370
And then look like we're
really [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.030
We'd be like, OK,
we'll take it out.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.870
And I swear, we
did it three times.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.200
And two of the three times, that
was the bit they liked best.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.950
And they literally got
angry when we took it out.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.310
So we kind of gave that up.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.365
So they never cut anything out.

00:37:38.365 --> 00:37:39.740
But there were a
couple of things

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.350
we did which Fergie-- two
weirdest celebs I ever did,

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.420
Fergie, Princess Fergie,
whatever her fucking name is.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.630
I was at some weird
drinks party somewhere,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.752
and I was trying to get people
as this celeb interviewer.

00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:54.710
And I didn't know Fergie
was going to be there.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.400
And I suddenly see Fergie
walking towards me.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.300
And Sam's there with
this tiny camera.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.580
And I'm holding a microphone.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.510
So I'm like, fuck it,
we're going to do it.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.600
So I go up to her, and her body
guards are-- I go, excuse me.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.190
Can we have a chat.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.340
She goes, yeah,
yeah, yeah, totally.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:06.860
So I go, great.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.370
I have no idea what
I'm going to do.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.825
And I go, you're live right
now on "Good Morning, Mexico."

00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:12.269
I think I say
something like that.

00:38:12.269 --> 00:38:13.935
And she literally
didn't bat an eyelash.

00:38:13.935 --> 00:38:14.400
Oh.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.540
And so I go, tell us about all
your great work in America.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.498
And she starts talking.

00:38:17.498 --> 00:38:19.647
And about 10 seconds in,
I suddenly go, sorry,

00:38:19.647 --> 00:38:20.230
Your Highness.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.912
We've just gone for an ad break.

00:38:21.912 --> 00:38:23.370
So if we can just
hold oppositions,

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.717
and we're back in two minutes.

00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:25.550
And she went for it.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.014
And I said, can no
one move at all.

00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:28.930
We need to be in the
exactly the same position

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.480
when we come back.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.940
So for two minutes in the
middle of this drinks party,

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.470
Fergie's just
standing like this.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.970
And I'm like, this is fucking
the best thing I've ever done.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.530
And then I go, and
we are live again.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.850
Sorry, you were saying.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:42.850
And then she starts
talking again.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.000
I go, sorry, they've
lost interest.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.541
They're gone.

00:38:44.541 --> 00:38:45.562
And then she goes, what?

00:38:45.562 --> 00:38:46.395
And we went outside.

00:38:46.395 --> 00:38:48.520
And I said to Sam,
get in a cab now.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.420
We fucking got to put this out.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.000
And if the internet
had been around,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.836
I'd have just uploaded
that immediately.

00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:55.710
But I swear, I don't
know how they found out,

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.900
but by time we go back
to Charing Cross Road,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.070
it was in Sloane Square--
it was about 40 minutes--

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.190
there was a phone call
from Mishcon de Reya--

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.790
those terrifying
solicitors-- with literally

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.200
like, you show that, and
you'll be executed, whatever.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.010
And Channel 4 was so
terrified that they didn't

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.770
show that, which was annoying.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.540
And the other one,
which was more odd,

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.340
was Kate Adie, who I quite like.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.060
A lot of people I used to get
were really just an excuse

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.730
to meet them.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.390
And I went to the
Press Club where

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.075
Kate Adie was giving
some talk on being

00:39:22.075 --> 00:39:23.075
a foreign correspondent.

00:39:23.075 --> 00:39:25.800
And this is the woman that's
been in Tiananmen Square

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.400
and all this sort of stuff.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.750
And so I think, what am
I going to do, really?

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.560
Because I really like her.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.820
I don't want to take the piss.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.860
And so she comes out.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.350
And I think, right.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:33.310
I know what I'm going to do.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.000
So I start talking to her.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.417
I go, Kate Adie, you're a
huge foreign correspondent.

00:39:36.417 --> 00:39:38.000
You've been to all
these great places.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.510
How is it dealing
with these places?

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.780
And she starts talking.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.720
And suddenly Sam
shouts, incoming!

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.257
And I hit the deck.

00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:46.590
And I think that's really funny.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.080
It's a kind of nod towards her
foreign correspondent stuff.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.440
She just looks
literally like you've

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.810
farted in front of your mother.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.880
She's just like,
what is going on?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.640
And I stand up.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640
And then I'm so embarrassed.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.598
I do what I always did.

00:39:56.598 --> 00:40:00.211
I just run away, leaving
Sam to do what he always

00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:01.960
did, to pretend that
he's a freelancer who

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.168
doesn't know what's going on.

00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:04.909
And I have so many
recordings of Sam

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:06.700
on the phone to no one
going, I don't know.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.460
I was just booked to do this,
and I'm here with Kate Adie,

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.660
and the guy ran away.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.489
But what was surprising was Kate
Adie demanded to have the tape.

00:40:15.489 --> 00:40:16.780
And so we got this great thing.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.946
She said, give me that tape.

00:40:17.946 --> 00:40:18.750
It must be erased.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.930
And Sam went, no.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.530
And Kate Adie goes,
give me the tape.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.170
So I had this
recording of Kate Adie

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.040
trying to fucking censor
everything she was up against.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.626
And again, I said
to Channel 4, this

00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:30.000
is an amazing point about how
media kind-- they went, no.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.860
Can't show it.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.462
So those are the two I liked.

00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:35.920
Very long lunch
break you got here.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.930
Do you not do any work?

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.232
AUDIENCE: Tell the
damn squirrel story.

00:40:41.232 --> 00:40:41.940
DOM JOLY: Oh, the squirrel.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.670
OK, yeah, yeah.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.660
Well, technically, it
was a sort of loose areas

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.360
to who owned all those props,
because I had them made.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.690
So the squirrels I had made.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:54.370
I used to use-- there was a shop
called Escapade in Camden Town.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.060
And we used to think it was a
bit more punky to-- actually,

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.500
it's how we got some ideas.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.415
We'd go to Escapade.

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.097
It was this terrible
fancy dress shop.

00:41:01.097 --> 00:41:02.474
[BEEPING]

00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:05.480
Is that time up?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] auto.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:07.360
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON INTERCOM): May

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.300
I have your attention please?

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.710
May I have your
attention please?

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.020
DOM JOLY: Is this like
your emergency call?

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.990
I've got to go somewhere?

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.656
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): Fire alarm

00:41:13.656 --> 00:41:15.950
in the building
has been activated.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.435
AUDIENCE: It wasn't me.

00:41:17.435 --> 00:41:19.601
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON INTERCOM):
is being investigated.

00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:24.365
Please remain at your workplace
until further information.

00:41:24.365 --> 00:41:26.690
DOM JOLY: Somebody's
freaking out in a sleep pod

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.084
right now-- like, fuck!

00:41:28.084 --> 00:41:28.790
I can't get out.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.040
MALE SPEAKER: We'll just
carry on with that happening.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.420
DOM JOLY: I'll just
quickly finish this one.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.210
So we used to go
Escapade and literally

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.390
flick through that
terrible book of costumes.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.872
[BEEPING]

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.450
Is this you guys doing me?

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.660
It is, isn't it?

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.045
I've finally been done.

00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:43.390
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON INTERCOM): May

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.190
I have your attention please?

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.805
The fire alarm in the builidng--

00:41:46.805 --> 00:41:48.157
DOM JOLY: It's killing
the vibe, I think.

00:41:48.157 --> 00:41:49.823
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): activated.

00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:51.200
[INAUDIBLE] this fire alert is--

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.658
DOM JOLY: The story
is in the book.

00:41:52.658 --> 00:41:54.680
I could sell it.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.942
Basically I got flooded.

00:41:55.942 --> 00:41:57.650
A loss adjuster came
to my house to check

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.130
all the stuff that got flooded.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.505
And she was American, because
so many people got flooded,

00:42:01.505 --> 00:42:03.960
they'd flown people who'd
done Hurricane Katrina.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.820
And I had all this
stuff in the courtyard,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.980
and she starts noting it.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.325
And she goes, OK, we've
got some boots, clothes,

00:42:10.325 --> 00:42:14.500
three giant squirrels, and
one six-- what is that, sir?

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.470
I go, it's a six-foot turd. and
she goes, one six-foot turd.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.020
And they paid up
for the whole lot.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.696
But I don't have the
squirrels anymore.

00:42:20.696 --> 00:42:23.056
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry, we'll
end five minutes early

00:42:23.056 --> 00:42:24.270
with the fire alarm.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.728
So you're going to
sign some books.

00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:28.430
If you didn't grab a book,
there's ones on there to grab.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:29.090
DOM JOLY: Where am
I doing that, here?

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.558
MALE SPEAKER: Please give Dom
a massive round of applause.
