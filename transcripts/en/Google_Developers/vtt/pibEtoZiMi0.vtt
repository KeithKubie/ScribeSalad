00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; All right, Tim, can you introduce your
company and your products?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.190
&gt;&gt; MOORE: My name is Tim Moore. I work at
a company called Atlassian. We develop productivity

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.029
tools for technical teams. Best known product
is probably JIRA, which is an issue tracker,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.820
a place to track your bugs or support issues
or anything like that. We also have a product

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.320
called Confluence, which is our Enterprise
Wiki. You can use it for documentation, for

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.600
requirements planning, really for any kind
of collaborative document management. We also

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.110
have a series of other development tools.
The one is called FishEye. That's for source

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.510
code repository management and exploration.
We got one called Crucible, which is for source

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.030
code review. One called Crowd, which is a
single-sign on tool. One called Clover, which

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.519
is a test coverage tool so that you can test--you
can track the metrics of how well your tests

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.649
are actually testing your code. And, Bamboo,
which is a continuous integration server for

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.890
forming builds. The company is based on Australia.
It's been around 2002. But we also have offices

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.640
in San Francisco and Amsterdam. And, I work
in the San Francisco office as a developer

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.319
for about the last 18 months.
&gt;&gt; All right. What Google technologies do

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.090
you use?
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Mostly we're using OpenSocial. So,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.810
we're making a real big push now to take OpenSocial,
which has already sort of proven itself as

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.789
a social networking technology, and we're
using Enterprise because we've decided that

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.119
development and really all kinds of business
activities are inherently social activities.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.910
So what works well for social networks also
works really well for Enterprise applications.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.709
&gt;&gt; Right. What was involved in your decision
to use the OpenSocial platform?

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:57.129
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Well, a lot of it is that JIRA,
our issue tracking tool, has a configurable

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.629
dashboard that can be used to display data
about your issues. We thought it would be

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.759
even better if we could display data from
the other products that we sell, and even

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.260
other products that we don't sell, side by
side with your issue information. And we look

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.970
at iGoogle and saw how that was able to pull
content from lots of different developers,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.700
put them all in one place and display that
information next to each other and said, "Wouldn't

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.030
it be cool if dev tools work this way?" And,
you could pull your issues and your source

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.049
code activity and code review activity and
your builds all into a single unified dashboard.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.689
And when we saw that OpenSocial was based
off of Google Gadgets, we thought that this

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.180
would be the ideal technology to build our
new dashboards off of it. And the more we

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.790
thought about it, the more we thought that
we could bring in other aspects of OpenSocial

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.659
as well because, you know, if you think about
a Wiki, it's really kind of a social network,

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.999
if you think about source code repository,
the different committers to that project are,

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.590
in a way, members of a social network.
&gt;&gt; Have been there any major challenges that

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.840
you've encountered on the platform?
&gt;&gt; MOORE: I think the biggest challenge that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.139
we've had is that, a lot of what OpenSocial
was built for was websites that have a single

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:20.319
company controlling them with whatever deployment
architecture they need. Whereas we sell package

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.639
software that's mostly installed by our customers
on their own servers behind their firewalls.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.219
And OpenSocial wasn't necessarily designed
for that kind of deployment scenario so we

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:36.370
had to find ways to make that work. So, one
example was that, a lot of OpenSocial gadgets

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.290
have URLs that are hard coded to access data
from a certain web service at a certain URL.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.159
Well, we wanted our gadget developers to be
able to develop gadgets that can be installed

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.609
into any customer's instance of our software
and we'll contact back to that software to

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.920
get data. So we actually a developed kind
of a templating layer that sits on top of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.810
the gadget specification and allows you to
embed macros within your gadget spec that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.969
are transformed when you install that gadget
into a server, and so, for example, the URL

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.529
for that server or the OAT information for
that server. And so, it takes a generic gadget

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.380
and customizes it for the server that is installed
on.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.590
&gt;&gt; How has providing an application with platform
helped your business?

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.150
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Well, all of our software has been
extensible pretty much since it was built.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.140
We have a rich plug-in API for all of our
software and we've got a large ecosystem of

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.190
developers. Some of them are commercial developers
that sell products that work on top of our

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.140
software. Some of them are open source developers.
And we actually have made a lot of open source

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.600
plug-ins available ourselves so that people
can use this as a learning tool. So, even

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.250
though we're just kind of starting with the
OpenSocial stuff, our first OpenSocial implementation

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.310
is JIRA 4, which is going into beta this week.
We do kind of have a history of providing

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.940
an API layer for developers to build on our
software, and it's been incredible the innovation

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.560
that we've seen, people build on top of our
software and even entire businesses that are

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:20.130
based on building plug-ins for JIRA and Confluence.
So we're really excited about OpenSocial because

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.350
our softwares traditionally had Java APIs,
which is great if you're a Java developer.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.120
Many of our customers are not. OpenSocial
allows you to build integrations based on

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.760
just HTMLs, CSS, JavaScript, simple Web technologies
that a lot of people understand. And so, it's

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.740
going to open the door to even more extension
and integration by a bigger audience of developers.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:52.480
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice for developers looking
to write OpenSocial apps?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.650
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Well, developers who are writing
OpenSocial apps for our platform or gadgets

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.080
for our software are--we recommend that they
start with simple stuff and it's really a

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.890
good idea to get familiar with the gadget
technology by writing gadgets for iGoogle,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.990
and then start to learn about how we provided
extensions on top of that for our own software.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.590
A great resource that we just launched today
is a microsite on our website for OpenSocial,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.330
and especially OpenSocial and the Enterprise.
If you go to www.atlassian.com/opensocial,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:32.610
you can see videos, documentation, links to
resources for developers and end users. So

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.030
it's a great resource for anybody who's interested
in this technology.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:44.590
&gt;&gt; Very cool. Very cool. So what's the most
lucrative OpenSocial container that you've

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.670
created?
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Well, most of what we've worked

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:52.030
with other than our own containers are Google's
containers. We're really excited especially

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.730
about the ability to embed gadgets in Gmail.
We think that's going to be really useful

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.020
for a lot of people who tend to live their
lives in email but want to see data from either

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.330
Atlassian or other applications juxtaposed
with their email and provide an easy way to

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.440
interact with a lot of different application
without having to leave their page. We're

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.890
also obviously really excited as is everybody
here about the Google Wave stuff. And we're

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.530
really interested in seeing if our gadgets
are going to work in that too, we hope so,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.720
and I don't see why not.
&gt;&gt; Right. All right, Tim, I want to thank

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.000
you for your time today.
&gt;&gt; MOORE: Thank you.
