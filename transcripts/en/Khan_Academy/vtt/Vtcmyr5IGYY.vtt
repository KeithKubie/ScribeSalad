00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.239
- [Voiceover] So, we're
given this function, f of x,

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:05.014
and it equals this rational
expression over here

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:07.522
and we're asked "What does f of x approach

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:10.283
"as x approaches negative infinity?"

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:13.424
So, as x becomes more and more
and more and more negative,

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:14.887
what does f of x approach?

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:16.126
And, like always, pause the video

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.317
and see if you can think
about that on your own.

00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:20.636
Well, one thing that I like to do

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:23.330
when I'm trying to consider
the behavior of a function

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.294
as x gets really positive
or really negative

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:27.464
is to rewrite it.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:28.869
So, f of x,

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:29.983
I'm just rewriting it once,

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:34.902
is equal to 7x-squared, minus 2x

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:39.269
over 15x minus five.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.923
Now, an interesting technique
to think about what happens

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:44.544
to the different terms
as x gets very positive

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.676
or x gets very negative,

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:50.007
is to divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:54.560
by the highest degree term
of x in the denominator.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.228
And the highest degree term
of x in the denominator

00:00:57.228 --> 00:00:59.672
is the first-degree term.

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:01.679
We have just a single x there.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.454
So, let's multiply both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:07.612
by one over x, or another
way of thinking about it

00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:10.422
is we're dividing both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:10.422 --> 00:01:11.624
by x.

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:13.321
And if we're doing the
same thing to the numerator

00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.244
and the denominator,

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:16.207
if we're multiplying or
dividing them by the same value,

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:17.344
I should say,

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:19.843
well then, I'm just really
just multiplying it by one.

00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:21.782
So, I'm not changing its value.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.532
This will make it a little
bit more interesting,

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:25.672
and a little bit easier for
us to think about what happens

00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:28.446
when x becomes very, very, very negative.

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:30.359
So, 7x-squared divided by x,

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.789
or being multiplied by one
over x, is going to be 7x.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:39.914
2x times one over x, or 2x
divided by x, is just two.

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:43.118
And then all of that over

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:47.160
15x divided by x, or 15x over x,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.923
is just going to be 15.

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.777
And then you have five over x.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:56.382
Five times one over x
is equal to five over x.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.557
Minus five over x.

00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:02.396
Now, this is equivalent, for our purposes,

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:04.968
to what we started with but it
makes it a little bit easier

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:07.160
to think about what happens when x

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.906
gets very, very, very, very negative.

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:11.888
Well, when x gets very,
very, very, very, very, very,

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:13.318
very negative,

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:17.379
this is going to become a
very large negative number.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.950
You subtract two from it,
it really won't matter much.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.703
You divide that by 15, well,
that's not gonna matter much.

00:02:22.703 --> 00:02:25.476
And this is just going to
become very, very, very small.

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.290
You're taking five and
you're dividing it by

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.701
ever-larger negative numbers,

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.104
or more and more negative numbers.

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:33.509
So, this right over here
is gonna go to zero.

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.102
This thing over here is
gonna go towards infinity.

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:39.463
Or, I should say, it's gonna
go towards negative infinity.

00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:42.583
Seven times a negative trillion,

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.095
seven times a negative googol,

00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:45.438
seven times a negative googolplex,

00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:47.326
we're getting more and
more negative numbers,

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.610
this is gonna get, this is going

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.293
to approach negative infinity.

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:52.149
Doesn't matter that you're
subtracting two from that.

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.990
In fact, that'll get even more negative.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.430
And it doesn't matter if
you then divide that by 15,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.015
you're still approaching
negative infinity.

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:01.631
If you had a arbitrarily negative number,

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.882
you divide it by 15, you still have

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.955
an arbitrarily negative number.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:07.023
And, so, you could say
that this is going to go

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:09.513
to negative infinity.

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:12.024
Now, another way that you
could've thought about it.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.515
This is actually how I do think about it

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:15.031
when I'm trying to,

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:17.110
when I see these types of problems.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.477
I say, well which terms in the numerator

00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:21.125
and the denominator are going to dominate?

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:22.708
And what do I mean by "dominate"?

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:26.213
Well, as x gets very positive
or x gets very negative,

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:28.579
another way to think about
it is the magnitude of x

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.597
gets large, the absolute
value of x gets large.

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:36.335
The higher degree terms are
going to grow much faster

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.093
than the lesser degree terms.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:42.277
And so, we could say that for large x,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.907
for large x,

00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:53.519
and when I say "large" I
mean high absolute value.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.740
High absolute value.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.111
And if we're going to negative infinity,

00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:00.640
that's high absolute value.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.677
So, f of x is going to
be approximately equal to

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.308
the highest degree term on the top,

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.804
which is 7x-squared, divided by

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.891
the highest degree term on the bottom.

00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:14.833
15x is going to grow, in
fact, this is right over here,

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:15.758
this constant.

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:17.928
So, as this becomes larger
and larger and larger,

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:20.074
this is going to matter a lot, lot less.

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.601
So, it's going to be approximately that.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.178
Which is equal to

00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:28.008
7x over 15.

00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:29.678
Well, even here, if you
think about what happens

00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:31.686
when x becomes very, very negative here.

00:04:31.686 --> 00:04:33.333
Well, you're just gonna get larger,

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.824
you're gonna get more and more and more

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:37.008
negative values for f of x.

00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:39.863
So, once again, f of x
itself is going to approach,

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.413
is going to go to, negative infinity

00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:45.114
as x goes to negative infinity.

00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:47.512
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:48.820
So, here they're telling us to find

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.306
the horizontal asymptote of q.

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.608
A horizontal asymptote,
you can think about it as

00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:58.859
what is the function
approaching as x becomes,

00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:00.411
as x approaches infinity,

00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.799
or as x approaches negative infinity.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.811
And just as a couple of examples here.

00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:08.652
It's not necessarily the q
of x that we're focused on.

00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:09.863
But you could imagine a function,

00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:12.155
let's say it has a horizontal asymptote

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:16.596
at y is equal to two,

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:18.236
so that's y is equal to two there.

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.110
Let me draw that line.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.762
So, let's say it has a
horizontal asymptote like that.

00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:25.476
Well then the graph could
look something like this.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:28.247
It could look, let me
draw a couple of them

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:30.410
that have horizontal asymptotes.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.659
So, maybe it's over
here, it does some stuff,

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.587
but as x gets really large,
it starts approaching,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.941
the function starts
approaching that y equals two

00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:41.688
without ever quite getting there.

00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:44.308
And it could do that on this side as well.

00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:48.912
As x becomes more and more negative.

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:51.957
As it gets more negative, it approaches it

00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:53.634
without ever getting there.

00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:56.407
Or, it could do something like this.

00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:59.526
You could have, if it has
a vertical asymptote, too,

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.659
it could look something like this.

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.012
Where it approaches the
horizontal asymptote

00:06:05.012 --> 00:06:07.998
from below, as x becomes more negative,

00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:12.059
and from above,

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.659
as x becomes more positive.

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.032
Or vice versa.

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:17.475
Or vice versa.

00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:20.665
So, this is just a sense of
what a horizontal asymptote is.

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.591
It'll show you what's
the behavior, what value

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.551
is this function approaching,
as x becomes really positive

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.897
or x becomes really negative.

00:06:27.897 --> 00:06:29.001
Well, let's just think about it.

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.352
We could essentially do what we just did

00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:32.033
in that last example.

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:34.879
What happens if we were to,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.413
if we were to divide all of these terms

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:41.713
by the highest degree
term in the denominator?

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.245
Well, if we divide, so q of
x is going to be equal to,

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:47.706
the highest degree term in the denominator

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.893
is x to the ninth power.

00:06:49.893 --> 00:06:53.584
So, we could say six,

00:06:53.584 --> 00:06:55.967
6x to the fifth divided by x to the ninth

00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:59.406
is going to be six over x to the fourth.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:04.884
And then minus two times x to the ninth.

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:08.665
All of that over three over,

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:10.432
I'm gonna divide this by x to the ninth,

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:12.563
x to the seventh, plus one.

00:07:13.753 --> 00:07:16.658
Well, if x approaches
positive or negative infinity,

00:07:16.658 --> 00:07:18.808
six divided by arbitrarily large numbers,

00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:20.622
that's gonna go to zero.

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:22.745
Two divided by arbitrarily large numbers,

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:24.328
whether they are positive or negative,

00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:27.275
that's going to go to zero.

00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:29.804
So your numerator's
clearly gonna go to zero.

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:31.845
This term of the
denominator, three divided

00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:33.288
by arbitrarily large numbers,

00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:35.392
whether we're going in the positive

00:07:35.392 --> 00:07:37.285
or the negative direction,

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:40.105
it is gonna approach zero.

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:42.186
It'll approach zero from
the negative direction,

00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:45.749
or we could say from below.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:49.288
If we're dealing with very negative x's.

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:51.261
If we're dealing with very positive x's,

00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:53.230
then we're going to
approach zero from above.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.434
We're gonna get smaller and
smaller positive values.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:57.130
So, all of these things go to zero

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.250
and this right over here is
going to be, would stay at, one.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.496
And so if you're approaching
zero in your numerator

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:04.345
and approaching one in your denominator,

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.934
the whole thing is going to approach zero.

00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:08.549
So, in the case of q of x,

00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:11.170
you have a horizontal asymptote

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.259
at y is equal to zero.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:16.401
I don't know exactly
what the graph looks like

00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:19.175
but we could draw a horizontal
line at y equals zero

00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:20.608
and it would approach it.

00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:23.301
It would approach it from above or below.

00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:26.007
Let's do one more.

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:32.652
What does f of x approach as x
approaches negative infinity?

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:36.373
Well, let's divide all of these terms

00:08:36.373 --> 00:08:38.437
by the highest degree that
we see in the denominator.

00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:40.184
We see an x to the fourth.

00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:43.348
So, 3x to the fourth divided
by x to the fourth is three.

00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:46.013
Minus seven over x-squared,
I'm just dividing

00:08:46.013 --> 00:08:50.147
by x to the fourth, minus
one over x to the fourth,

00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:53.835
over, x to the fourth divided
by x to the fourth is one,

00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:57.312
minus two over x, plus
three x to the fourth.

00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:59.955
This is an equivalent,
this right over here is,

00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:02.084
for our purposes, for thinking
about what's happening

00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.147
on a kind of an end
behavior as x approaches

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:06.015
negative infinity, this will do.

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:08.453
I've just divided everything
by x to the fourth.

00:09:08.453 --> 00:09:09.458
And so what's gonna happen

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:11.024
as x approaches negative infinity?

00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:13.125
This is going to approach zero.

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.299
This is going to approach zero.

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:17.393
This is going to approach zero.

00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:18.966
And this is going to approach zero.

00:09:18.966 --> 00:09:20.938
And so, as all of that
stuff approaches zero,

00:09:20.938 --> 00:09:23.347
what we're left with is
we're going to approach,

00:09:23.347 --> 00:09:25.469
we're going to approach three over one,

00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:27.561
or we could say just three.

00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.918
Another way you could
think about doing these

00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:31.655
is look at the highest degree terms.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.869
3x to the fourth, x to the fourth.

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:35.209
Ignore everything else because they're

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:37.893
going to be overwhelmed by
these higher degree terms.

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:40.482
So, you could say f of
x is approximately equal

00:09:40.482 --> 00:09:43.986
to 3x to the fourth over x to the fourth

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:48.103
for large magnitude x.

00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:50.563
Magnitude x.

00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:52.795
And very negative is still
a very large magnitude,

00:09:52.795 --> 00:09:54.513
large absolute value.

00:09:54.513 --> 00:09:57.571
And so, 3x to the fourth
divided by x to the fourth,

00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.015
f of x is going to be
approximately equal to three.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:02.560
Or it's going to approach three.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.812
So, that's another way that
you could think about it.
