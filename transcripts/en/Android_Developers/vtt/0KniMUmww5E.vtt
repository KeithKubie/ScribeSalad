ANDREAS PREUER: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.610
Thank you so much for coming
to Secrets to Apps and Game

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.160
Success on Google Play.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.850
My name is on Andreas Preuer.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.400
This is Brian Quimby.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.210
We both work on Google Play in
business development and help

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.672
game and app developers to be
successful on the platform.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.890
So I guess I use this.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:40.590
BRIAN QUIMBY:
Strong start, guys.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.530
Here we go.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.280
ANDREAS PREUER: And
you already know that.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.929
There we go.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.970
BRIAN QUIMBY: So previously,
through Google Play,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.230
I worked on a team that
helped game and app developers

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.490
to get additional users.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.280
And so many app developers
told me, hey, Andreas,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.200
I have a problem.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.790
Conversion tracking is
difficult and really

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.520
getting a good understanding
of where my users come from

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.470
was a big deal and a
big challenge, actually,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.880
for many app and
game developers.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.120
So that could be any of
the traffic sources--

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.060
it could be YouTube.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.809
It could be Surge.

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.130
It could be AdMob.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.980
Any of the organic
traffic sources.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.610
And it was really a challenge.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.380
So, to overcome
this challenge, we

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.020
announced at I/O, and
new tool, a new report,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.860
that helps you getting a better
understanding about your user

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.880
acquisition channels.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.900
And so this is actually the
report that you can see here.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.250
So you can follow, now, your
users from the Play Store

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.170
listing, to the install,
and to the purchase.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.030
And so this report
is really beautiful

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.905
to get the full
understanding of your funnel.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440
The great thing is
you can even follow

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.740
you can even follow your users
to the next stage, which is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.330
actually the repeat purchasers.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.820
But that's not everything.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.000
Beyond the funnel,
you can actually

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.820
also see the traffic sources.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.520
The traffic sources can
be organic on Google Play.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.970
But it can be also, beyond
that, any third party traffic

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.968
source that you have.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.090
And so you can drill
down on the traffic

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.890
sources that can be Google
search keywords that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.950
can be u.t.m.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.470
tagged traffic or any
third party traffic source

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.160
that you have.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.430
And so now, with this full
understanding of your traffic

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.000
funnel, so from the user who
comes to the Play Store listing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.270
to the installer, the
purchaser, the repeat purchaser,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.550
you have a full
understanding of that funnel.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.730
But on top of that, you also
know where the users come from.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.440
This allows you to take action.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.340
And you can optimize
your store listing.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.390
So I want to dig into
this a little more.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.960
How to optimize
your store listing.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.930
When you get started,
initially, it's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.080
very important to really think
about your icon, your app

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.760
icon and your game icon.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.400
This every user
to find your app,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.840
your game, not only in the Play
Store, but also on the phone.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960
And so you can do
a couple of things.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.270
One recommendation that we
have is keep your icon fresh.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.850
You can even seasonally
adjust it for holidays.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.560
The second very important
piece is your title.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.710
Think about it.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.380
Keep it short.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.870
Keep it unique.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.830
You can see here,
actually, a word play.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.380
And really keep it
unique and special.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.430
At the same time, be
thoughtful about your brand.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.490
You may actually
have a version two.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.940
You may have a second
app at a later stage.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.860
Make sure that you are
thoughtful about your brand.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.170
And then, thirdly, it's
really important, also,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.210
to think about your description.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.260
There are a couple of
things to keep in mind.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.810
Keep it short.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.930
Keep it simple.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.785
But also have
bullet points there.

00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:04.160
And there is one
important thing.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.190
Whenever you write
your app description,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.120
also make sure to check
it out on your phone,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.625
to see the app description, if
everything is above the fold,

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:13.125
that you really
want to communicate.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.600
And so that brings me to
store listing experiments.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.459
Store listing
experiments is a product

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.299
that we launched to
really help you getting

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:25.590
a better understanding of
the performance of your store

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.560
listing.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.459
So that allows you to
understand how many conversions

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:31.750
do you actually get from the
users who visit your store

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.700
listing.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.850
And so you can test for various
different parts of the store

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.350
listing.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.210
It can be a title.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.970
It can be the description.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.470
That can be all
the graphic assets

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.385
that you have on
your store listing.

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.980
And so how does that work?

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.750
So we recommend that
you start with the icon.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.250
Our tests showed
that you actually

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.660
will see the most
impact on the icon.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.852
So test early and
make your first thing

00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:58.560
that you really, really
want to test out.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.860
And so there are a couple
of our best practices

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.130
here that we really
want to share with you.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.880
Start with an idea in
mind, some hypothesis

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.520
that you want to test for.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.984
Only test one thing at
one time to make sure

00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:17.650
that you can trust
your results, and you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.260
know what drove the impact.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.750
And then, also, iterate
and learn from that.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.790
And then also make sure
that the test that you run

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.870
is actually statistically
significant.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.620
Whenever you do so,
there is also actually

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.640
a banner within the
developer console

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.560
that shows you as soon as
the test is significant.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.030
And you can move on and be sure
that you can trust the results.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.290
And then, the great thing
about this whole feature

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.910
and this whole product
is that this is all free.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.682
There is not even
code needed for it.

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:52.980
We have a couple
of examples here.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.580
The first I want to
show you is congregate.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.740
They saw a 91%
increase in installs

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.640
just by testing the icon.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.880
That's pretty amazing.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.580
91% from the first control to
the last that you can see here.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.296
That's the variant C. A
91% increase in installs.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.960
Here is another example.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.900
Rovio tested three rounds.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.520
So they started the first part.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.350
And then they figured out, oh,
this is actually a good result.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.621
They continued a second
round, a third round.

00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:26.870
And then they really understood
which icon is actually

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.000
the best for their game.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.940
Here we have another example.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.270
One of our partners that
we work with closely

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.550
tested a very small thing
that's really just a screenshot

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.680
on a store listing of the game.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.130
The one thing they modified
it is actually showing,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.570
now, game play within
that screenshot

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.140
instead of just showing
the screen shot.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.750
And that little tweak actually
increased the conversion rate

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.365
by 6%.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
I will now hand it
over to Brian who

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.510
will talk to you about
alpha beta testing.

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:12.790
BRIAN QUIMBY: It's too bad
I will not have a clicker.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.370
But alas.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.320
Thanks a lot, Andreas.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.319
How cool is that, right?

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.510
Store listing experiments?

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.969
Free user testing.

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.010
Put some different icons.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.350
Put some different descriptions.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.800
Figure out what's converting
best for your users.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.090
So now that you have that
solid Play Store listing,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.760
I kind of want to back up a
little and talk about some

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.450
of the best practices related
to actually releasing your app.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.160
So what Google Developer
Console provides

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.220
is an easy way for you to
prototype, iterate, test,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.570
and then eventually launch your
app, with alpha beta testing,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.850
and staged rollout outs.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.010
So this is one at
the top reasons

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.060
that developers tell us Play
is such a fantastic platform

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.640
to develop for.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.780
This is a unique tool.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.696
It's going to let you
get high quality results

00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.740
and really take control
of your app rollouts.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.960
And we see most of our
successful developers

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.640
using these features.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.610
So you're going to start
with an alpha test,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.790
upload that APK, set
it to the channel,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.420
move on to beta
testing, and then,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.470
once you're convinced that
that package, that new release

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.220
that you have is good, we
can do staged rollouts,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.400
releasing that APK to only a
percentage of your developers

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.334
before moving on to
your full rollout.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.000
And we've got that
stat up there, right?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.455
80% of the most
successful apps at Play

00:08:25.455 --> 00:08:28.858
are using these staged rollouts
in alpha and beta testing.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.250
So beta testing.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.090
Very awesome feature
on Google Play.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.190
You can distribute your app
to only a subset of users

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.999
and get their feedback, rather
than releasing it to everyone

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:46.040
at once and then, you
know, crossing your fingers

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.280
and hoping you're not crashing
on some random device.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.780
So beta testing, users are
going to opt in to be testing.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.760
They can't leave reviews.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.440
And they're not going
to be able to leak

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.130
confidential features, or
something, by posting something

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.135
on your page.

00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:02.760
You're going to be able to have
two different versions that you

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.360
can beta test with.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.390
And if you haven't ever
launched on Play yet,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.740
we definitely recommend
you're starting out

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.270
with using beta testing, so
you can get the app out there,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.436
make sure that things are
working out right-- again,

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:15.150
before you move on to
that full roll out.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.691
And then, if your
app's already live,

00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:19.070
you can test new features
in the beta channel.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.860
Put the new APK up there,
upload it, release it out

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.320
to a subset of those users.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.236
Good to go.

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:25.610
This is what the
beta testing tab

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.180
looks like within the
developer console.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.240
You see you've
got the production

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.800
one on the left, beta testing,
and then alpha testing.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.370
And just upload something to
alpha testing or beta testing

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.590
channel.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.650
You're just going to click
on that Upload New APK button

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.315
right there.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.220
So two ways that we can
go about testing our new

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.910
build, open or closed.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.890
Closed alpha or beta testing
is invite only and managed

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.460
through Google Groups.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.120
No more of the G+ communities,
if that was something that was

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.802
irking you.

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:56.260
So this means all
you have to do is

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.142
add an email
address to the group

00:09:58.142 --> 00:09:59.600
and then send your
users that link.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.917
They can download the
alpha and beta builds.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:03.750
Now, the other way you
can do it is actually

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.974
have an open alpha
or open beta test.

00:10:05.974 --> 00:10:07.390
This is going to
give you a custom

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.745
URL that you can then send out
to as many users as you want.

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:12.370
If you want to tweet
it to some people,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.340
if you want to send it
out, maybe, an email

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.710
list that you have for your
power users or subscribers.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.420
So a number of top
developers have

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.550
seen a lot of great success,
starting with maybe the closed

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.131
testing, moving over to
the open testing now.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.530
Throwing up an example.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.780
Quick case study for you guys
to help convince you that this

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.780
is an awesome way to go.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.730
This is the "Guardian," a
great newspaper out of the UK.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.480
Over the past six
month period, and they

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.960
trialed every one of
their new features,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.530
first in the beta channel.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.920
They uploaded a new nightly
build to the alpha channel

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.630
and then eventually
pushed out to the public.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.890
And so beyond just
getting the feedback,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.700
it's a safe place for them to
test, innovate, and experiment

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.170
without any danger to the brand.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.700
No one who's seeing
the live version

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.030
is not expecting any--
oh, it's crashing.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.020
There's too many bugs.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.400
Everything is only
in that beta channel.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.180
And again, everything's
opt in as well.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.340
So these users are
seeing the link.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.940
They're clicking
become a tester.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.689
And that's how they're getting
access to those new builds.

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:15.730
For the "Guardian," it
used to take about a month

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.110
or so to launch new features.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.097
Now it's going down to
just even a week or two,

00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:22.180
and they're able to push
some of these things out.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.270
So now that you
have a beta build

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.040
that you're confident with,
maybe you started with alpha,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.990
you moved to the beta channel,
tried some in the open beta

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.360
testing, maybe had the
closed beta testing at first

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.120
to work out any
new bugs or kinks,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.490
now it's actually time
to push to production.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.480
Even then, though,
we can still only

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.170
distribute that to a subset
of users to keep on testing,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.170
keep on iterating, and
make sure that everything

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.320
is going to be good to go.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.980
This is staged rollouts.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.320
You can roll out that new APK
to a controlled percentage

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.600
of users.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.100
These users are
selected randomly.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.370
They won't know what
build they're getting

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.680
when they go to the Play Store.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.690
But you're going to have
access to detailed logs, crash

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.650
reports, analytics.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.320
You're going to see
which is happening

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.390
depending on which version
of the APK that people got.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.010
All you've got to do, click
Upload New APK to production.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.170
Then you're going to see
that staged rollout screen

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.420
with these percentages, right?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.980
5%, 10%, 20%, and then up
to 100% for full roll out.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.440
After you upload it, you're
looking at the crash reports,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.880
looking at bugs,
features, user feedback.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.560
You're going to
iterate even then.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.244
If you want to take a new APK,
bump that up, and then publish

00:12:29.244 --> 00:12:31.660
that out to other people,
you're going to have the ability

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.780
to do that, too.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.284
And then, eventually, once
you're confident in that build,

00:12:35.284 --> 00:12:36.950
you've gone through
the testing process,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.439
you've done a staged
rollout, you can hit 100%

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:42.105
and fully push that build out to
production for everyone to get.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.390
So cool, come on?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.203
Alpha beta testing.

00:12:48.203 --> 00:12:48.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:50.160
Yeah, there we go.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.510
Waking up in here.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.100
I know, I barely got to finish
my coffee this morning, too,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.510
it's all right.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.350
So we've got a great build live.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.870
But now I want to
talk real quick

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.280
about some of the
intricacies of developing

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.730
for those users in
international markets.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.500
Localization of your APK, and,
also, your Play Store listing,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.164
is going to be really
key to you guys

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.830
to make sure app is
successful no matter

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.310
where your users are located.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.950
Google Play, as you
know, massive reach.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.440
Truly a global platform.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.730
You're going to getting
users from all over.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.400
And once you have a good sense
that your app is working,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.794
your app is seeing
downloads, you

00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:31.210
want to make sure that we can
achieve your goals by really

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.930
reaching users in all
these different countries.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.480
So the first thing
to think about

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.500
once you want to
go international

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.340
is making sure that people can
actually understand your app,

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.680
understand your listing.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.130
And so we want to talk
about localization.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.850
You can localize the
strings within your APK.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.230
You can localize your
screenshots, your Play Store

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.740
listings.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.337
As a quick incentive,
quick plug,

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:55.420
if you come to the Google
Play office hours later,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.300
and you are interested
in localization,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.140
I have some coupons
that I can give you.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.140
And I'll walk through
how you can actually

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.300
use the localization services
provided within the Play

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.750
Developer consoles.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.180
Localization, making sure
that your app is translated.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.954
Two, pricing for local markets.

00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:13.120
Cool thing that we just
rolled out with Google Play,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.650
sub dollar pricing.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.010
So this is going to let you
have very, very low prices

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.510
depending on what
currency you want,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.010
depending on what region you
want to have your published in.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.590
And then three, right,
app performance.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.810
If your app is being launched
in different markets,

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.170
we might have to optimize
for smaller download

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.600
sizes, your ability to
work on Data Connections

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.744
that aren't as strong,
low memory use, right,

00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:35.660
the devices that people
have access to in some

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.505
of these different areas.

00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:37.960
We want to make sure
that we're really

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.293
thinking about these things
as we're developing our app.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.460
I just told you some
high level general tips.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.590
How can you guys find
specific tips out, though,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.590
for your apps?

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.360
Good news.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.910
Within the optimization tips
section of the developer

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.710
console, you'll see we now have
a lot of awesome localization

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.420
tips.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.540
So here's an example
on my to do list.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.410
Translate my product
descriptions,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.167
add localized graphics,
translate strings in my APK.

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.000
You're going to find
all of these tips right

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.416
within your developer
console now.

00:15:07.416 --> 00:15:09.500
So you can take action
on them and make sure

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.426
that your app is
good to go regardless

00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:14.300
of where the user are
who are downloading it.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.540
What I just talked
about, that first option,

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.100
translating your play store
listing, transiting your APK,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.720
super easy from within
the developer console now.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.840
After you just hit that store
listing, manage translations,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.870
you can add your own
translation text.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.640
Or you can purchase translations
for your Google Play Store

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.530
listing.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.390
If you don't provide
translation text,

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.030
Google Play is
going to either show

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.580
an automated translation
or the default

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.310
language for your application.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.810
And if you think
about that, neither

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.520
are really ideal if
you have a user who

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.600
speaks in their language
who's visiting your app,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.370
visiting your Play Store listing
and wants to download your app.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.470
So highly recommend either
adding your own translation

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.640
text for your Play
Store listing,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.015
or you can purchase
that directly

00:15:54.015 --> 00:15:56.790
from the developer console.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.700
In addition to your
store listing, as I said,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.991
you want to make sure that
your APK itself, the strings

00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:03.870
within it, are good to
go as well, regardless

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:04.990
of where your users are.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.430
Google makes the super easy
using the APK translation

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.390
service.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.712
You can either purchase
those strings again

00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:14.170
and purchase those translations
from the developer console.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.800
Or you can add those yourself.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.710
So to get there, within the dev
console, right at the bottom,

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.100
you're going to start
or check progress

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.620
under the APK translation
service, upload your XML file,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.560
select your target language.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.120
And I'll go into, real quick,
what that next screen looks

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.680
like in terms of
actually purchasing

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.650
translated text and
translation options, if you

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.810
want to do that.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.720
So you're going to be presented
with a list of third party

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.550
vendors who are pre-qualified
by Google to offer high quality

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.130
translations at
competitive prices.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.150
You can upload the
strings that you want,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.586
select the language
to translate into

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:51.210
and then choose your
translation vendor

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.852
based off price and time.

00:16:53.852 --> 00:16:55.310
Once you've purchased
translations,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.130
you get an email
from that vendor.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.910
And then the
lawyers make me say,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.160
the translations are an
independent business agreement

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.180
between you and your vendor.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.679
You'll need to work
with your vendor

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:07.220
to manage any translation
process and deliverables.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.210
Thanks guys.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.220
However, all built right
within the developer console.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.130
You're going to be able
to see the progress.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.010
[INAUDIBLE] It's great.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.685
Really good feature.

00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:21.480
Come on slides.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.980
Awesome.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.063
So last thing I wanted to
go over today, something

00:17:24.063 --> 00:17:25.650
called developer pages.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.030
This is a relatively new
feature that we just launched.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.120
This is going to let you have a
branded presence on the Google

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.094
Play Store.

00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.760
If you think about
it, when you actually

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.332
click on the developer name,
or the title of an app,

00:17:36.332 --> 00:17:38.790
you're going to see that page
that just has a bunch of apps

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.030
that that developer makes.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.197
This is going to transform
that sort of generic page

00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:43.988
into something that's
awesome and is really

00:17:43.988 --> 00:17:45.250
representative of your brand.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.410
Developer pages lets
you upload a graphic,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.660
explain what your
company is all about,

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.850
and even pick a special
app to feature at the top.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.710
The developer page is going to
give you a single destination

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.650
to promote all of your
apps on Google Play.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.460
And many of our top partners,
one in four, in fact,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.270
have already created their page.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.770
You can check out
any do right here.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.280
So they have that
nice banner at the top

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.880
with some promotional text,
graphics on top of that.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.510
You can see an icon for
the developer, explanation,

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.400
and then they have
that featured app.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.210
Easy to show off
your brand and cross

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.130
promote your apps with
Google Play Developer pages.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.460
That was it on mobile.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.260
And I know you guys,
mobile first, tablet first,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.400
but developer pages also look
great on desktop browsers.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.230
This is Yidio, really cool
app if you're a cord cutter

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.250
and want to see where
the different shows are

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:39.792
on right now.

00:18:39.792 --> 00:18:42.375
This is what the developer page
looks like on desktop, though.

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:44.540
Again, featured app there,
awesome graphic banner

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.630
at the top, some descriptions,
things like that.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.420
So, super tactfully,
how do we actually

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.280
build a developer page?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.822
And if we want to
get interactive,

00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:55.530
I see a lot of you
with your laptops out.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.780
Feel free to fire your
developer consoles right now.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.130
So literally take five minutes.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.400
We can walk through it together.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.480
On the left side, click
Settings, developer page.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.950
Add your information at the top.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.832
So we'll start out in English.

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:10.290
Put your promotional
text on there.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.850
It can be up to 140 characters.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.620
Nothing else is 140 characters
that I'm thinking about.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.030
So this is perfect
for right up here.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.460
You can add a
translation if you want

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.220
and then, again, stick your
company website up there too.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.460
You'll need a developer icon
and a large header image

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.550
at the top.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.390
And then, again, as
an optional feature,

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.280
you can also add a featured app.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.232
So if someone is visiting
your developer page,

00:19:36.232 --> 00:19:38.190
they're going to see that
app there at the top.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.170
You can also have your other
apps listed at the bottom.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.100
If you have a promotion,
or seasonal special,

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.310
you can rotate them featured app
at the top of your screen now.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.510
I see everyone really
clicking and intensely typing,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.900
so I'm going to assume
you're all building developer

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.960
pages with me right now.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.459
It's good.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.599
So that's actually
all I had to go over.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.390
A couple things, little
housekeeping items.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.550
So first off, as
Andreas and I mentioned,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.910
we work on the business
development team at Play.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.920
If you guys are interested
in working with us,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.170
two links up there at the top,
g.co/Play/Apps if you're an app

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.720
developer; g.co/Play/GamesBD
if you're a games developer.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.960
That will take to a form.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.001
You can fill that out,
let us know your thoughts,

00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:22.450
let us know your priorities,
tell us about your app a bit.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.600
And you can get back to us.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.320
Give us feedback.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.820
If you liked hearing me up here
ramble on about some things.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.361
If you didn't like
it, if you thought

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:32.182
Andreas was way better
than me-- which I tend to.

00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:32.890
Give us feedback.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.550
That's the forms
link right there.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.840
And then, as I
mentioned before, we're

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.130
going to be having office hours.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.540
So if you have
questions about Play,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.623
if you have questions about
the developer console,

00:20:40.623 --> 00:20:41.870
feel free to stop by.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.670
As I mentioned, we have coupons.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.370
For translation services you
can use some of those cool tools

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.560
we're talking about.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.900
And Google also just
released a new Secrets

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.097
to App Success book.

00:20:51.097 --> 00:20:52.930
So if you want to swing
by our office hours,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.910
we'll hopefully hook you
up with one of these.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.110
Lots of great content.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.440
And each of the topics
that we cover today

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.712
is also in this book
in a lot more detail.

00:21:01.712 --> 00:21:03.170
So with that, I'm
going to wrap up.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.299
I think we probably have
maybe 15 minutes or so

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:06.090
for some questions.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.090
Or we can walk around and
talk to you guys, too.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.770
AUDIENCE: So I have
a few questions.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.580
So you said icon of the app
is the most significant impact

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.520
you can do very quickly.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.030
And I'm assuming you
don't change the app,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:41.420
you don't change the icon in the
app itself, only on the store.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.250
Is that something that you do?

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.911
ANDREAS PREUER: So you
would modify the app icon.

00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:49.410
Obviously, that
makes the most sense

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.368
if you test it, actually,
at a very early stage

00:21:51.368 --> 00:21:52.910
of development.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.530
And so that's when you actually
want to test for the icon.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.670
And so you test it
both on a store,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.087
but also for the app itself.

00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:01.670
AUDIENCE: I guess
what I'm getting at,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.620
if I have a different
app icon in my app,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.090
I don't want to redeploy my
app just to change the icon.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.740
So I would change it
on the Play Store.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.410
But then the app itself
has a different icon.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.140
Is that something
that's OK, you think?

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.700
ANDREAS PREUER: I
believe it's better

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.490
if you keep it
consistent because it's

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.120
kind of like your brand, also.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.170
But it's also where
any user would

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.130
find your app again,
either on the phone,

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.560
but also on the Play Store.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.840
So you want to make sure
that it's kind of consistent.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.080
But clearly, when it's
actually at an early stage,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.430
you can easily test for it.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.180
And then you can actually test
various different iterations

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.820
without having to
update the app.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.740
So if that is at an early stage,
I think that's totally fine.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.200
But generally, make sure to
keep it consistent as well.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.020
AUDIENCE: OK, that
means if I want

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.519
to change the icon
for the holidays,

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:50.920
I would need to deploy a new
APK just to change the icon

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.861
and have a whatever.

00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:54.860
ANDREAS PREUER: So within
the developer console,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.490
you don't have to actually
modify or adjust the APK.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.980
So that's just a change
within developer console.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.080
So if I may, a couple
more questions.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.681
Do you expand the
number of [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:06.681 --> 00:23:07.930
for your translation services?

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.450
Because I used to use them.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.310
And then we would decide to
support some Nordic languages,

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.460
like Norwegian,
Swedish, Finnish, so on.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.730
And there were not available.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.332
So I had to switch to
a different service.

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:22.290
So is it something that
you guys keep changing.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.748
I haven't checked
for a few months.

00:23:23.748 --> 00:23:26.205
But is it something that
you're expanding constantly?

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:27.830
BRIAN QUIMBY: Yeah
I would check again.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.750
I'm pretty sure that there
are a lot of languages

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.980
that are covered right now.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.560
Off the top of my head, I
don't know the specific ones.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.260
But again, because
at least if you're

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.051
purchasing the translations
through Google,

00:23:37.051 --> 00:23:38.570
it's those third
party vendors, you

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.510
should be able to find
someone out there who's

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.885
been vetted by
Google who's going

00:23:41.885 --> 00:23:44.340
to be able to translate into
that language that you want.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.370
Also, you mentioned that if
you don't translate the store

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.870
description, it's shown
either in default language

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.760
or auto-translated.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.600
Do we have any
control over that,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.740
or it's like automatic
user setting?

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.531
BRIAN QUIMBY: Yeah,
I'm not sure if there's

00:23:58.531 --> 00:24:01.141
any specific control that you
have over saying which it is.

00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:02.890
The user will have
their default language.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.190
And then, if you go on
the Play Store desktop,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.500
right, there's that little
thing that pops up that says,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.990
do you want Google
to translate this?

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.060
And then they can click it.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.430
So I mean, I guess, there's some
control if the user clicks that

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.930
or not.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.790
But I mean, I'd say, best
practice is probably just

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.090
to have a translation in
there for whatever language

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.190
the user is in.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.060
AUDIENCE: OK, and the last
question is, developer page.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.240
Do you have any data on the
impact that it makes, is it

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.770
a worthy investment?

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.580
Should I just go
do it right now?

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.680
Do you have any-- anything?

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.340
BRIAN QUIMBY: Yeah,
so nothing specific

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.100
that we were going to share yet.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.290
But right now, it's
just a really cool way

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.894
to promote your brand.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:39.810
You saw it on desktop.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.340
You saw it on mobile.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.286
People are cross clicking
between your apps.

00:24:43.286 --> 00:24:44.660
It's a good way
that you can show

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.159
the different-- your featured
app, or some of the other apps

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:47.850
that you have.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.450
But yeah, I'm sure,
at some point,

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.660
that we'll release some
information on that.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.725
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'm
guessing for a single app,

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.224
if the developer
has just one app,

00:24:55.224 --> 00:24:56.390
maybe it's not as available.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.264
But I can clearly see,
if you have multiples,

00:24:58.264 --> 00:25:00.100
that's the way to promote.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.550
BRIAN QUIMBY: I mean, even if
you only have one app, though,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.490
you can still pin it to the
top and have that as sort

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.600
of your mini featured app.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.225
So I think it can
still be a strong way

00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:07.784
to promote your brand.

00:25:07.784 --> 00:25:09.950
ANDREAS PREUER: Also, the
cost is actually very low.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.400
Like, it's something
that takes you a minute,

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.510
and, at the same
time, there is no cost

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.050
associated with it itself.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:21.457
So it's pretty straightforward
and pretty easy to set up.

00:25:21.457 --> 00:25:23.290
AUDIENCE: Great talk,
thank you for sharing.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.850
I have a question related
to staged rollout.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.660
Can you elaborate
a little bit more

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.340
about the selection of
new and upgraded users

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.970
about upgrading for the
same percentage of users?

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.120
BRIAN QUIMBY: So once
you have pushed--

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.880
AUDIENCE: For example,
we released it for 10%.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.270
And we found some
critical issues in it.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.963
And we roll out the new APK
for the same percentage.

00:25:52.963 --> 00:25:55.380
What will happen?

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.320
BRIAN QUIMBY: Yeah, so it
gets a little tricky there.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.632
So we can sync real
quick afterwards.

00:26:00.632 --> 00:26:02.590
And I can show you there's
a nice support page,

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.740
actually, in the
developer page that says,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.210
yeah, so you roll out
the 10% or something.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.380
If you find an issue, and
you want to update it,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.420
how do you get that
update to go to the 10%

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.390
if you want to keep
iterating or something.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.931
So let me come over
there afterwards.

00:26:15.931 --> 00:26:18.490
And I'll show you the page.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.104
I believe so because,
again, we do want to push 10

00:26:22.104 --> 00:26:23.270
and you have issues with it.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.645
Then you're going to push it
to another 10% or something.

00:26:25.645 --> 00:26:28.090
So that's the point of the
staged rollout concept.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.600
But again, I'll show
you guys the actual page

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.620
where it outlines very,
very specifically how

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.807
you can do that.

00:26:33.807 --> 00:26:36.140
AUDIENCE: Actually, we're
quite familiar with this page.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.610
And the question is
exactly what was mentioned.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.650
Will the same 10%
of users receive.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.620
The update.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.470
BRIAN QUIMBY: I believe, so yes.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.850
But if it doesn't say so
specifically on that one stage

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.170
rollout bit, then I'm not
sure off the top of my head.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.215
But let's follow up.

00:26:54.215 --> 00:26:56.454
I want to get you that answer.

00:26:56.454 --> 00:26:58.530
AUDIENCE: Another part,
what is the percentage

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.910
between new and
upgraded users when

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.340
we roll out to the same 10%?

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:09.140
Will it be like 5% of new users
and 5% of operating upgraded

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.452
users, or something different?

00:27:11.452 --> 00:27:13.410
BRIAN QUIMBY: In terms
of who gets pushed that?

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:13.994
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:13.994 --> 00:27:16.076
BRIAN QUIMBY: I don't think
there's any specifics.

00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:18.080
I think it's pretty
arbitrary, intentionally,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.220
that it just pushes it to
a subset of your user base

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.480
out there.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.230
AUDIENCE: There is no
guarantee that there

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.320
will be any new users
or any updated users.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.549
BRIAN QUIMBY: I
don't believe so.

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:31.090
But, again, we can
follow up on that.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.120
Sorry, this is kind of
specific questions about it.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.860
But yeah, let's find out.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.943
AUDIENCE: Sure, thank you.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.400
Thanks.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.627
I have a few questions.

00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:51.252
I'll just do them
all at the same time,

00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:55.166
so you can respond in
whatever order you see fit.

00:27:55.166 --> 00:27:56.940
BRIAN QUIMBY: Sure.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.960
AUDIENCE: One is, do
you have any recommended

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:09.860
strategies for dealing with
sort of irrelevant user reviews?

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:16.070
For example, I work on an
app that, basically, you

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.030
can buy digital content on.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.680
And people are
sometimes disappointed

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.210
to realize that they actually
have to pay for the content.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.580
And they leave negative reviews
because of that disappointment.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.360
They give one star reviews.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.620
And it's not a fair
review of our app.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.080
Because we don't
advertise that we're

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.010
giving away anything for free.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.647
So that's one issue.

00:28:43.647 --> 00:28:45.480
BRIAN QUIMBY: So I can
take that real quick.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.730
So one of the cool things
within the developer console

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.564
is you can actually
respond to user reviews.

00:28:49.564 --> 00:28:51.396
So that's something
that we definitely would

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.776
recommend that developers do.

00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:54.650
So if you get a one star
review, particularly

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.690
if it's something where
the user should have known

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.970
they had to pay for something,
or there's an issue like that,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.450
you can respond to
that user review.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.000
And it's going to show
up right below that.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.333
AUDIENCE: Right, I mean, we're
definitely aware of that.

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:07.060
And we've tried that with a
very, very limited request.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.990
I mean, just most
users at that point,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.980
don't care enough to
update the review.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.050
Or they're still not happy with
like what-- it still doesn't

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.110
meet their expectations.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.340
So that's one thing
that I don't really

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.150
have a suggestion for
like how to improve,

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:30.370
but having some
sort of criteria,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.580
like, for example, the helpful
reviews sort of sorting,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.840
theoretically, could help.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.370
But we've noticed on
our app that doesn't.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:47.605
Some of those views are
actually ranked up high when

00:29:47.605 --> 00:29:48.730
it's sorted by helpfulness.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.340
So that's one thing, if like the
hopefulness could be improved,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.290
that could actually
help, at least, no maybe

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.942
with the average score, but
with the order of reviews.

00:29:57.942 --> 00:30:00.400
BRIAN QUIMBY: So one of the
things that some developers do,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.410
if, when you're responding to
a review that's particularly

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.480
negative, say, hey, go
ahead and contact us

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.881
at support@briansapp.com
something.

00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:08.630
And then you have a
sort of different form

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.090
that you can try to
resolve the issue.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.631
And then maybe that
could incentivize

00:30:11.631 --> 00:30:15.250
them to go back later and
actually update their review,

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.756
update the star
that they put there.

00:30:16.756 --> 00:30:17.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.760
ANDREAS PREUER:
You can also really

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.570
try and test various different
descriptions around it

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.560
to be very explicit about
like what your app is

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.160
all about so that users,
before they download it,

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.900
really get a good understanding
about what the app is all

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.400
about.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.733
And you can test various
different descriptions as well.

00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:36.210
AUDIENCE: So that goes,
actually, to my next question.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.610
There might be a way,
I'm not aware of it.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:45.030
It would be cool if you could
see the stats for many times,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.387
and if users actually
expand the description.

00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:48.970
Because the description
as you see it,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.970
normally, is just
like two lines.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.350
And you can't really
fit much in there.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.029
So it'd be interesting to see
a look how many of those users

00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:58.570
are actually reading
the description.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.170
Because I would suspect
that most don't.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.230
I mean, I typically
never do, myself.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.120
So that's one thing--

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.662
BRIAN QUIMBY: The show more, or
whatever, with the tab there?

00:31:08.662 --> 00:31:10.870
ANDREAS PREUER: So we don't
have any stats around it.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.760
But it's definitely
something-- anything

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.134
that you think is really,
really important to communicate

00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:17.590
to your users, make sure
to have it above the fold

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.010
so that most of the
users actually see it,

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.370
or all of the users see it.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.360
There's definitely a break
off as soon as you actually

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.770
have the expand.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.790
AUDIENCE: OK, and
with beta testing,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.390
again, I have very
limited experience.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:38.074
But as far as I understand,
there-- well, basically, I

00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:39.490
sort of felt like
it would be nice

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.150
if there were more
avenues to get input

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.120
from the beta testers.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.240
For example, if I don't have
access to a lot of devices,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.930
and I'm using my
beta testers to say,

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.880
OK, you have a Samsung device.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.660
You have a LG device.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.650
And one of these
devices has a problem,

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.330
an easier way for
that user to be

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.160
able to submit either
screenshots or screen

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.040
recording, or
something like that

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.280
to me, so I can see what the
issue is-- like it might not

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.150
be a crash.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.770
It might just be a layout
issue or something like that.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.600
So that would be really helpful.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.290
So more avenues of communication
and data collection, of course,

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.170
with the user's approval
in each individual case

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.456
for beta testers?

00:32:25.456 --> 00:32:27.830
ANDREAS PREUER: So there is
one way that you can do that.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.990
So for beta testing,
you can actually

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.860
now not only use the
group, but you can also

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.390
actually create a link.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.470
And that link can be
distributed through whatever

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.900
channel you want to.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.010
And so, if you start
a campaign, and it

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.430
could be, for example,
an AdWords campaign

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.840
where you can target
a specific device,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.830
then you can push out your
beta APK to a couple of users.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.620
They're all on that
specific device, which

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.520
allows you to learn
much more about users

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.250
for the specific device.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.250
That's one way to do it.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.710
And you can choose whichever
channel you use to push it out.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.630
But one way that
I'm familiar with

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.450
is, actually, if
you use AdWords,

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.040
and you just target,
specifically,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.314
users that have that
specific device.

00:33:09.314 --> 00:33:10.730
And you'll get
feedback from them.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.590
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.800
I'm talking about the next
step, where it's like,

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.970
if one of those devices
have a specific issue,

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.800
for example, a
layout issue, it be

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:24.330
nice if the user could submit
a screenshot, or a screen

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.952
recording, of that
issue more easily.

00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:30.160
Right now, I would have to
communicate with the user,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.830
ask them, hey, here are the
steps, record your screen,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.720
please.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.360
And then, you know, if they're
nice enough and savvy enough

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.770
to do it, they might.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.180
But more streamlined experience
for the beta testers themselves

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.460
would really be helpful.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.960
BRIAN QUIMBY: I
mean, you can always

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.290
have feedback mechanism
built within your app.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.280
So a lot of Google apps
shake to give feedback.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.350
Or you can click a
menu option and send

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.600
feedback, something like that.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.180
If you're doing closed
beta, right, you

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.580
have access to
that Google group.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.870
So you can always work out some
type of communication methods

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.500
around there.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.890
But yeah, definitely hear
your feedback, though.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.390
AUDIENCE: And is
there any mechanism

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.290
to provide rewards
for beta testers.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.580
Like if someone
was a beta tester,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.419
and they submitted an issue,
like you want to give them

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:13.210
a paid version or--

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.520
BRIAN QUIMBY: Gamify
it or something?

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.239
AUDIENCE: Is there a
mechanism for that right now?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.110
BRIAN QUIMBY: I don't think
built in within the developer

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:18.610
console.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.097
Alpha and beta
channels, there is.

00:34:22.097 --> 00:34:23.097
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:34:29.362 --> 00:34:30.820
AUDIENCE: What is
your appreciation

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.750
for prompting in app feedbacks,
like prompting the user

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.300
to give us some feedback
in the Play Store?

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.030
Does that work?

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.850
Is it recommended?

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.429
Is it-- what are your thoughts?

00:34:45.428 --> 00:34:46.719
BRIAN QUIMBY: What do you mean?

00:34:50.226 --> 00:34:52.600
AUDIENCE: A lot of apps pop
up with a dialogue asking you

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.300
if you want to rate
them now, later--

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.150
BRIAN QUIMBY: Oh, now or later.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.390
Yeah, I'm not sure off
the top of my head.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.570
There we go, screen saver.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.710
If I have any particular
our best practices

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.490
or anything around that.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.360
I can say--

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.315
AUDIENCE: If it works.

00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:07.440
BRIAN QUIMBY: If it works--

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.295
AUDIENCE: Or it's
annoying or something.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:10.670
BRIAN QUIMBY: I
mean, I certainly

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.410
find it annoying at some
spots, me personally.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.780
I'm not sure if we have any
best practices around when

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.880
you should ask for a rating,
or when you ask for feedback.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.830
But you know, I
would say just figure

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.420
out when a user is
going to be most

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.760
likely to click on
that call to action

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.981
and not find it annoying.

00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.480
So, you know,
probably someone who's

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.104
already engaged with
your app, probably

00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:32.480
someone who has spent a
certain amount of time

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.560
there, and maybe given you a
rating in a previous version

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.180
or something.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.870
I think there's definitely
some different signals that you

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.210
could use to figure out who
you should prompt with that

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.209
rather than just sort of
spam everybody with it.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.590
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.500
Have you had any
experience with people

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.920
having negative feedback
from a developer

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.650
standpoint in alpha
beta and wanting

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.950
to roll back to a production
and not be able to do so?

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:01.030
Like, say, for instance,
adding a certain feature

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:05.569
in a manifest, or raising target
SDK, and having that be bumped,

00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:07.610
and then not being able
to take a step backwards?

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.080
BRIAN QUIMBY: That's tough.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.770
Again, I'd say let's
meet afterwards,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.454
and we can look at the specifics
of when you roll a feature out,

00:36:19.454 --> 00:36:20.870
when you roll it
back, when you're

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.760
pushing a certain
percentage, pushing back.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.190
Because I don't want to
give any misinformation.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.820
But, you know, the
whole point, though,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.960
is, right, you're going
to be able to push it out

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.120
to a certain set of users.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.800
You're going to be able
to iterate and launch.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.180
And, I suppose, you
could always just,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.270
if you have a
previous version want

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.603
to roll back to, right, maybe
push that one out instead.

00:36:34.603 --> 00:36:36.800
But again, let's let's
sync afterwards instead

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.799
of me trying to tell you
off the top of my head.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.930
AUDIENCE: Have you guys seen
any successful strategies

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.960
for managing paid
upgrades in apps?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.762
And are you guys
working on anything

00:36:48.762 --> 00:36:50.220
to make that easier
for developers?

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.830
ANDREAS PREUER:
What's the question?

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.632
If we have seen any
successful premium apps?

00:36:58.632 --> 00:37:02.610
AUDIENCE: No, good strategies
for handling upgrades,

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.900
paid upgrades-- updates.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.050
AUDIENCE: Updates 2.0.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do 2.0,
be able to charge for it.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.700
Have you seen anyone
have any patterns that

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.190
are successful for that?

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.880
And are you guys
thinking about it

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.905
or have any idea towards that?

00:37:16.905 --> 00:37:18.280
ANDREAS PREUER:
Yeah, definitely.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.130
There are a couple of
examples out there.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.150
I'd really just look
at apps or games that

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.860
are doing this successfully.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.290
I don't want to actually
point one or the other that

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.420
is actually, of the
partners that we work with,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.480
point out here.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.040
But we can sync,
definitely, later on.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.350
It's also good practice
to kind of like,

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.250
if you have the same app,
or like, oh, think about,

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.160
is it hard to get
your users from app A

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.960
to app B. In many
cases, it's probably

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.020
better to actually
keep the users in there

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.760
and offer additional content
and potentially upsell

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.384
your content in there.

00:37:52.384 --> 00:37:54.050
There can be a break
off if you actually

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.590
want to push your
users to another app.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.090
But we can talk
about this in detail

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.881
later on in the office
hour if you want to.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.590
AUDIENCE: Hi guys.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.302
I really love the new user
acquisition capability

00:38:14.302 --> 00:38:15.510
within the developer console.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.270
But I feel there's a
bit of a feature gap

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.155
right now where you can't
really see a lot of visibility

00:38:20.155 --> 00:38:21.530
into what's
happening organically

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.640
within the store itself.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.020
So you can certainly
track things

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.364
that happen outside the
store, like an ad campaign.

00:38:27.364 --> 00:38:29.530
But you don't understand
what the organic traffic is

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.320
comprised of, so what keywords
are people searching for,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.750
which promotional positions
are driving traffic,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.750
and so on, and so forth.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.180
So that'd be a great
feature request.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.430
ANDREAS PREUER: Yeah, totally.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.840
So at this point, you can
see your keyword searches.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.800
You can see you UTM Tac traffic.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.550
So that allows you to
get an understanding

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.100
of your third party traffic.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.650
But you can not dig
into all of the details.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.260
And so definite
take that feedback.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.069
And that's something that
we're actively working on.

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.902
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.120
I know that you guys have a
lot of statistics on crashes

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.350
and that's sort of
thing, and particularly

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.370
looking at the user reviews
from the developer console.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.570
But as far as I
noticed, there's no way

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:34.190
to like export them to like
a CSV or something like that.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.970
Is that something that's coming?

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.135
Is that there, and
I just am blind?

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:46.490
ANDREAS PREUER: There's nothing
that I can share specifically

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.660
about an export functionality.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:54.050
But definitely, the reporting
that you can see for reviews,

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.640
you see actually quite a
lot of iterations there

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.680
and, actually, updates.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.152
So stay tuned on this.

00:40:01.152 --> 00:40:01.860
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.350
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.450
You talked about
optimizing prices

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.160
for different local markets.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.090
Do you have any guidance on
specifics for doing that?

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:19.590
You know, if I've got a
$0.99 app here in the states,

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.049
what do I do with that
in 100 other countries?

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:22.840
BRIAN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.870
I mean, some devs, with the
new sub-dollar pricing options,

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.590
are testing out a lot of
different pricing options.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.840
You have the ability within
the developer console

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.270
to use the currency converter.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.910
So you can click
real quick and then,

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.740
depending on whatever the
day's exchange rates are,

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.531
it's going to try to
figure out the pricing

00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:39.892
for the different markets.

00:40:39.892 --> 00:40:42.100
Yeah, it's still kind of
early days for some of this.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.460
So I think there are a couple
high level tips and strategies.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.850
And again, not to
plug Office Hours,

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.730
but I think we have
about two seconds left.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.880
So yeah, if you want
to swing by, you know,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.869
lots of good stuff also
in the app success book

00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:55.410
that we can give
you that covers some

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.576
of the international markets,
different monetization

00:40:57.576 --> 00:40:59.030
strategies, and
some of the stuff

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.886
you can do with the
sub dollar pricing.

00:41:00.886 --> 00:41:03.330
AUDIENCE: When are
your office hours?

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:07.280
BRIAN QUIMBY: I believe
they start at 1:15 today.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.510
The location, that's a
good question though.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:10.540
I think, not here?

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.540
ANDREAS PREUER: In here.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.000
In here.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.030
I'll be wearing the
same shirt, I promise.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.980
AUDIENCE: Actually, office hours
are out in front of grand hall.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.690
BRIAN QUIMBY: OK, there we go.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:21.949
Cool.

00:41:21.949 --> 00:41:24.240
I think other people are
coming in here kicking us out.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.570
So thank you.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.011
ANDREAS PREUER:
Thank you, everybody.

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:29.920
