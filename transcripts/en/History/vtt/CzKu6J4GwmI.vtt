00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.713
In the '18 100 women were
prohibited from shopping

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:05.880
NARRATOR: That's right.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.382
In the middle of
the Victorian era,

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.343
a woman's role in
public life was limited.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.011
Their duties were
confined to the home,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.640
turning flour into bread, fabric
into clothing, empty homes

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.935
into loving places for
their husbands to return to.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.104
Men dominated
America's growing city

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.022
centers, where they
worked and discussed

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.941
politics, business, money--

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.193
things women weren't even
supposed to think about.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.987
Many upper- and
middle-class women

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.905
had servants or
door-to-door salesmen

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.658
bring the goods they needed
directly to their homes.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.245
An unchaperoned woman on
the city streets was taboo.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.540
Women weren't even allowed
to shop on their own.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.542
And public bathrooms
at the time?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.586
For men only.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:48.006
But that would all change
with industrialization.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.716
Consumer goods were
being churned out

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.843
at an increasingly rapid pace.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:55.472
Clothing, furniture, flatware--
everything a home could need.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.308
And sellers knew there was
demand to match the supply,

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.518
so they set out to create a
place where it was socially

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.146
acceptable for women to
shop and, more importantly,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.523
spend time outside of
the house on their own.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:09.611
Behold, the department store.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.738
Victorian women
finally felt empowered

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.990
to go out in public
alone, to a place where

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.950
their needs were placed first.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.120
Department stores were somewhere
to feel at ease, to socialize,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.247
relax, and enjoy
modern amenities that

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.500
had long been reserved for men.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.585
To create a more
welcoming environment,

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.213
they were staffed almost
entirely by other women

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.299
and featured dining rooms,
nurseries, beauty parlors--

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.635
and, yes-- even bathrooms.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.887
And the stores themselves
were far from small.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.473
Most took up at least
an entire city block.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.434
By 1893, Marshall
Field's store in Chicago

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.771
contained 100 different
departments serviced by 23

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.398
elevators and 3,000 employees.

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:51.569
And as the shopping experience
evolved, so did social norms.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.489
Unaccompanied women on the city
streets became commonplace,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.991
and female foot traffic
came to determine the value

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.827
of commercial real estate.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.538
Today, we can't imagine a world
where women aren't allowed

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.040
to shop, even though
many of us are more

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.501
than happy to do it from home.
