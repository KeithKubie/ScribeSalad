1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:00,620
Okay.

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,360
In this video we'll look at how we can
compute marginals in a linear chain

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:05,380
conditional random fields.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:07,910
Yeah.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,900
So in the previous video,

6
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:13,901
we've seen how we could compute the
probability of a full sequence of labels y

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:18,080
given x, uh, and uh, uh, to do this,

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,430
we just take the exponential of the,

9
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:24,320
some of the urinary and pairwise factors
and then we have to divide by this

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,180
partition function.
In a previous video,

11
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:30,440
we've seen how we can actually compute
this partition function efficiently,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,560
even though it involves a lot of nested
sums over other potential labels at each

13
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:40,580
physician by computing, uh, an
Alpha table or a bed, a table,

14
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,880
we could actually, uh,
through a dynamic program,

15
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:48,050
get a very efficient procedure
for that is not exponential.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,410
The size of the sequence for
computing the partition. A function.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:54,670
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,710
So, uh, to do this, like I said,

19
00:00:56,711 --> 00:01:01,711
we had to precompute a table of a Noah
that we call alpha or a pre a table that

20
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:08,671
we call better for a where each
essentially computes the summation of the

21
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:13,630
exponentiate good luck
factors that involves, um,

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,690
all of the labels to either the left of
a given position or to the right of a

23
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:22,960
given position. And so now let's
assume again that we've done this,

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,460
a computation of either the
alpha. I actually have both
the Alpha and Beta table.

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,260
What we'll see now is an expression
for how to compute marginals,

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,770
uh, marginal probability over
the sequence. So for instance,

27
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:40,630
the probability of a single label
at a specific position, Kay.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,730
And,
uh,

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,730
what we'll see is that this expression
also requires the Alpha and Beta values.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,300
And specifically we'll assume that we're
using the stable implementation of the

31
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,900
often better table where we actually
have a table that contains the Lug Alpha

32
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:59,710
and the lug better, uh,
values. And this is again,

33
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:04,270
very important to actually implement
that variant of the computation or the

34
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:07,780
Alpha and Beta tables to get something
that's a numerically more stable.

35
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,900
So now here we're interested
in computing. Um, uh,

36
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,690
we'll and we'll see to the particular
marginals the marginal over a specific

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,350
position.

38
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,400
So the probability of a single label
in the sequence at a given position,

39
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:27,340
k or the pairwise,
uh,

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,870
they probably have a pair of
labels at a position k again,

41
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,970
so that's the first look at this one. The
marginal property over single position.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,250
Well again, we'll use the Alpha and Beta
tables. So remember that the Alpha table,

43
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,600
uh, essentially gives us the
uh, value of the luck of the,

44
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:50,470
some of the exponentiate
good luck factors for uh,

45
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,620
all the potential labels to
the left of a given position.

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,480
And the better gives us a
similar computation before
the log of the psalms or

47
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,300
the lug better table's going
to give us the log of the,

48
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:06,301
some of the exponentiate it a urinary
and pairwise potentials to the write ups

49
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,690
of given position.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,650
Now if we want to Compute p
of y k position k given x,

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,740
well that would correspond to the sum
over [inaudible] and the sum over why to

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,050
up to the sum over y came on this one
than the sum over y k plus one up to the

53
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,860
sum over y capital gain

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
of p of y where why here would be in bold.

55
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:46,060
That would be the whole sequence
given the sequence of inputs. Okay,

56
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,740
so that's just marginalization and
operation that we know from probability

57
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,660
theory gives us.

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Now the probability over just a y k at
the specific position came and we've seen

59
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:06,061
that the lug alpha value and the lug
better value actually gives us these

60
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,020
summations.

61
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,020
So Lug Alpha value performs the summation
over the labels from position one to

62
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,300
uh,

63
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,300
came on a swan and the lug bed attire
value gives us the lug summation of uh,

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
the value of the label or position.
K plus one up to a y came.

65
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,930
So actually specifically,
uh,

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,950
this sum here is going to correspond
to the Alpha came on this one value.

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,030
So, uh, remember this index
tells us, uh, from y one, two,

68
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:40,150
why came on a swan that, uh, it gives a,

69
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,030
that this bottle corresponds
to the summation of why one,

70
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:47,710
up to why came on this one.
And then similarly, uh,

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,740
this sum here with Chris
Bond to a better k plus one,

72
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,830
uh, that is the k plus one wins
that we've summed from, uh,

73
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,190
y capital k two Y K plus one.

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,830
So,
uh,

75
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,730
I won't go into detail as
to how we obtained this
expression or leave that as an

76
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:10,600
exercise, but we can show that
the property of yk given, uh,

77
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
the whole sequence x is
just the exponential of the
unitary factor at a position

78
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,530
case.

79
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,360
Our preference for whether we like seeing
the specific value of Y K at position

80
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:23,890
k plus,

81
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,130
well the Lug Alpha values and lug
better values for where we assume that,

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,870
uh, the label, that position case
taking the value. Why K here and here?

83
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,840
So these are the sons that
are conditioned on, uh,

84
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,230
the Kl label being equals
to being called to y k. Uh,

85
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,190
and same thing here and now
together probably distribution. Uh,

86
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,970
we need,
uh,

87
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,390
to make sure that this is normalized
so we can just normalize the numerator.

88
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,650
It turns out. And so we're
summing over all potential values,

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,130
which I'm getting to a name.
Why Prime K of the numerator?

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,950
So the exponential of, uh,
the urinary factor for, uh,

91
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,330
the position gay if we
assume the labeled takes,

92
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:13,331
why prime Kate as a value and then the
summation of everything to the left,

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,620
assuming why prime, assuming the KF
label, it takes value of our prime gay.

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,770
And in the summation to
the, uh, to the left,

95
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,260
the submission to the left submission
to the right, assuming that, uh,

96
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,670
the kids labeled takes value.
Y Prime King.

97
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,620
So actually this you can think of as just
doing the softmax non linearity on the

98
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,580
vectors of this term here.

99
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:42,440
The luck factor plus the log
Alpha luck, better values. And,

100
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,450
um, so, uh, you know,

101
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:48,290
the key to understanding why this makes
sense is that the log alpha and the lug

102
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,520
better values give us the sums over the
everything to the left and everything to

103
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,410
the right,
which is a sum we have to perform.

104
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:57,980
If we want to marginalize
out these value, uh, these,

105
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,570
these labels and get the probability
for only a single position.

106
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,000
And similarly using the same reasoning
if you want the probability of the

107
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,260
[inaudible] label and the k plus
one year label taking value,

108
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,110
why k and why k plus one,
then we'll have a,

109
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,190
that expression be the exponential
of the unitary factor for position k.

110
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,240
Also the urinary factor for position
k plus one plus the pairwise factor,

111
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
uh,
uh,

112
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,590
that expresses a preference between
the label position k and k plus one.

113
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,890
And then plus, while the summation
of everything that's to the left.

114
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,240
So from position one, two k minus one, and
then everything's, that's to the right.

115
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,400
So from position Cape Plus to
a till the end until uh, uh,

116
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,820
position capital king. And again,
to have this be a valid probability,

117
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:54,500
we need to divide by the summation over
all the values that the label could

118
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,410
take.
And they,

119
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:59,600
Cape Plus one yet labeled could take of
the exponential of essentially exactly

120
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:03,590
the same term. So we see the exponential
term here is exactly this term.

121
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:07,830
I've just replaced why gay by
y Prime K, uh, which is uh,

122
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:12,260
and y and y k plus one by y
prime keep plus one. So again,

123
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,650
this is also similar to
a soft max operation,

124
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,280
but this would be a soft Max
especial softmax over, uh,

125
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:24,281
if you want the matrix of
activations for all values of a y,

126
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,440
K and why k plus one for this,

127
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,470
the sons of urinary a pairwise
and log out the lug better terms.

128
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,501
All right,

129
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:38,420
so this is how you compute a marginals
in the conditional random fields.

130
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,100
And the reason I explained this now is
that particular we'll want to use this,

131
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,420
uh, to make a prediction, uh, that we, uh,

132
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,450
one procedure for performing
classification of each
and each position is going

133
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:51,890
to be to use this.

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,000
And we also use both of these marginals
in their linear chain conditional random

135
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,390
fields. Uh, when we'll want to
train the conditional random fields,

136
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,680
which is going to be the
topic of, uh, the, uh,

137
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,050
videos for the following week.
