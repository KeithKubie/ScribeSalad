00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.780
What's up movie connoisseurs?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.000
Do you think you know everything there is
to know about the weird and wonderful world

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of cinema?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Do you like testing that knowledge and bragging
to your friends about it?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well then, this is the video for YOU!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.220
Welcome to the Screen Rant Ultimate Movie
Quiz.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.250
If you can get all 10 of these questions right,
then you can consider yourself a serious movie

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.250
buff!

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.369
Keep your score as you go and then leave it
in the comment section below, no lying!

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.300
Let’s begin!

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.050
Jared Leto is currently starring as The Joker
in Suicide Squad, but he wasn't the first

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.460
actor that Warner Brothers sought out for
the role.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Do you know which leading man was the initial
choice?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850
A - Matt Damon
B - Jim Carrey

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.070
(Screen lights up C)
While Matt Damon has been heavily linked to

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.640
being given a role in the DC Extended Movie
Universe, and while Jim Carrey would undoubtedly

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.600
make a very interesting version of The Joker,
it was Ryan Gosling who was the first choice

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
for the role.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.550
However, the star of The Notebook wasn't willing
to sign on for the multi-picture deal that

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.590
the studio was requiring.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.040
The screenplay for 2016's remake of The BFG
was written by the late Melissa Mathison and

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.050
the movie itself was directed by Steven Spielberg.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.210
But which movie had the pair collaborated
on in this fashion before?

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.210
A - A.I.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.540
Artificial Intelligence
B - Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.950
C - E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
(Screen lights up C)

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.020
Prior to The BFG, the last movie to have its
screenplay written by Melissa Mathison and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.730
be directed by Steven Spielberg was E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.740
It was the highest-grossing movie of 1982
and if that success can be anywhere near emulated

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.500
by The BFG, it will be considered a huge success.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.220
Pretty much everybody knows that Heath Ledger
won a postumous Oscar for his portrayal of

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.730
The Joker in The Dark Knight, but the film
also earned numerous other nominations at

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.850
the 81st Academy Awards.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.650
Do you know how many it was nominated for
in total?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.170
A – 7
B - 8

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.890
C - 9
(Screen lights up B)

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.050
The Dark Knight was actually nominated for
a total of 8 Academy Awards, making it the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.049
comic book movie with the highest number of
nominations to date.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.439
The categories it was nominated for were Best
Supporting Actor and Best Sound Editing - both

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:27.060
of which it won - Best Sound Mixing, Best
Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.409
Best Film Editing and Best Visual Effects.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.769
The Avengers, like most other major movies,
had a pre-production working title that enabled

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.569
Marvel Studios to keep the project under wraps
until they wanted the world to know about

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.569
it.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.550
But what was that working title?

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.159
A - Group Hug
B - Come Together

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:52.219
C - Family Affair
(Screen lights up A)

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.310
As revealed in an interview by Loki himself,
Tom Hiddleston, prior to the movie's production

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.659
- and even in the early stages of filming
- The Avengers was referred to as "Group Hug".

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.120
It would later be released to theatres under
the name "Team Building".

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.329
After the title of the upcoming Rogue One:
A Star Wars story was revealed, Lucasfilm

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.769
were threatened with a potential lawsuit to
change the name out of fear of audiences confusing

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.629
it with which other movie?

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.430
A – Rogue
B - Operation Rogue

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.810
C - Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
(Screen lights up C)

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.989
It was Paramount who made the threat, relating
to their 2015 movie Mission: Impossible - Rogue

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.709
Nation, even though the two movies were set
for release more than a year apart.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.810
However, the two studios came to an agreement
that Rogue One could keep its name on the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.900
condition that information about it wasn't
released until after Rogue Nation had hit

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
theatres.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.440
The music for Star Wars: The Force Awakens
was, of course, composed by the legendary

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440
John Williams.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.129
For J.J. Abrams, this marked the first occasion
that a movie he directed wasn't being scored

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.159
by a certain other composer.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.269
But who had provided the score for his other
movies?

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.609
A - Michael Giacchino
B - Ludovico Einaudi

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.629
C - J.J. Abrams himself
(Screen lights up A)

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.379
American composer Michael Giacchino is the
man who provided the music for every movie

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.810
J.J. Abrams had directed up until The Force
Awakens.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.449
These included Mission: Impossible III, Cloverfield,
Star Trek and Super 8.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.450
The upcoming Harry Potter series spin-off
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.840
be set predominantly in New York.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.640
However, it was filmed in England, so which
former Royal Air Force base doubled as New

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.370
York's docks during production?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.410
A - R.A.F. Buckminster
B - R.A.F. Cardington

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.160
C - R.A.F. Carlisle
(Screen lights up B)

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.950
R.A.F. Cardington will double as New York's
docks in the J.K.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.760
Rowling-penned production.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.570
Located in Bedfordshire, the base boasts a
long and varied history, particularly in relation

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.040
to airships and balloons.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.540
Chris Evans is always in great shape when
he portrays Captain America in the Marvel

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.070
Cinematic Universe and he looked particularly
good portraying the titular character in Captain

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.530
America: Civil War, but do you know how the
film-makers made him look even more muscular

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.030
than he really was in the final movie?

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.320
A - CGI augmentation
B - He wore T-shirts that were too small

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.050
C - He was forced to pump iron seconds before
filming every scene

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.670
(Screen lights up B)

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.620
Costume designer Judianna Makovsky has revealed
that for all of Chris Evans's scenes in which

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.920
he wore civilian clothing, the T-shirts he
wore were purposely several sizes too small,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.220
which made it look as though his muscles were
truly huge and bulging.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.860
A lot of 2015's Inside Out took place inside
the main character Riley Andersen's mind.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.840
In her mind, there was a functioning TV studio
called Dream Productions.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.080
In order to depict Dream Productions, Inside
Out's writers visited a member of the movie's

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.360
cast on one of his TV shows to see how it
all worked.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.670
Which cast member was it?

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.680
A - Bill Hader
B - Kyle MacLachlan

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.800
C - Lewis Black
(Screen lights up A)

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.240
To see how a working TV studio operated, Inside
Out's writers visited Bill Hader on the set

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.800
of Saturday Night Live, which is located at
Studio 8H on floors 8 and 9 of the Comcast

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.090
Building in New York City.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.630
Popular composer Hans Zimmer, who composed
the score for DC movies Man of Steel, Batman

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.710
v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and The Dark
Knight Trilogy, has stepped down from composing

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.530
movie scores in the superhero business and
will not be composing the score for Justice

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.530
League.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.900
But who will be?

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.400
A - John Williams
B - Junkie XL

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.960
C - Danny Elfman
(Screen lights up B)

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.840
It will be Junkie XL, the Dutch composer who
assisted Hans Zimmer with the score for Batman

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.860
v Superman: Dawn of Justice, who will compose
the score for the Justice League movie.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.850
His other work includes Mad Max: Fury Road
and Deadpool.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.620
