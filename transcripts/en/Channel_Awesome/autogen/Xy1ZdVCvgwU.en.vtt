rattleballs and never robots they

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169
rattleballs and never robots they
 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.579
rattleballs and never robots they
weren't candy people they were robots so

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:36.589
weren't candy people they were robots so
 

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:41.919
weren't candy people they were robots so
how human or alive are they well I mean

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:41.929
how human or alive are they well I mean
 

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.600
how human or alive are they well I mean
that's it's a question that can easily

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.610
that's it's a question that can easily
 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.029
that's it's a question that can easily
come up and there could be huge debates

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039
come up and there could be huge debates
 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:47.679
come up and there could be huge debates
over tor whatever because people are

weird that way bringing it up but what

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:50.959
weird that way bringing it up but what
 

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.259
weird that way bringing it up but what
I'm saying is is that for me seeing the

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:53.269
I'm saying is is that for me seeing the
 

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:54.669
I'm saying is is that for me seeing the
whole destruction of the rattleballs and

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:54.679
whole destruction of the rattleballs and
 

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:55.509
whole destruction of the rattleballs and
all that it was kind of like okay

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:55.519
all that it was kind of like okay
 

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.939
all that it was kind of like okay
they're robots they did their purpose

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:57.949
they're robots they did their purpose
 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.040
they're robots they did their purpose
they were too good at it they needed to

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050
they were too good at it they needed to
 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.499
they were too good at it they needed to
be taken out well by me you obviously

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:02.509
be taken out well by me you obviously
 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.499
be taken out well by me you obviously
see like I need him in particular like

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:05.509
see like I need him in particular like
 

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:07.089
see like I need him in particular like
he formed a personality you know it's

he formed a personality you know it's
 

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:08.439
he formed a personality you know it's
the short circuit thing you know yeah I

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:08.449
the short circuit thing you know yeah I
 

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:10.389
the short circuit thing you know yeah I
exact I don't know where he forms of

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:10.399
exact I don't know where he forms of
 

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.949

of like what's living what's not and you
 

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.299
of like what's living what's not and you
know how much artificial intelligence

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:19.309
know how much artificial intelligence
 

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:20.619
know how much artificial intelligence
can lead to something living and stuff

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:20.629
can lead to something living and stuff
 

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:22.149
can lead to something living and stuff
but I always have an issue when it's

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159
but I always have an issue when it's
 

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:24.519
but I always have an issue when it's
just like just and then life happens

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:24.529
just like just and then life happens
 

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:27.249
just like just and then life happens

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:28.779
yeah no let's let's do this right you
know take like the memory of a person

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:28.789
know take like the memory of a person
 

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:30.669
know take like the memory of a person
somehow and I put it on disk and put

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:30.679
somehow and I put it on disk and put
 

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:32.199
somehow and I put it on disk and put
that disk in a robot it's like wait a

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:32.209
that disk in a robot it's like wait a
 

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:34.089
that disk in a robot it's like wait a
minute that's the memories of a real

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:34.099

I'm like I don't know it's like the you
 

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:06.189
I'm like I don't know it's like the you
know the Devils in the details there

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:06.199
know the Devils in the details there
 

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:07.720

it's like you know come on you don't

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.730
it's like you know come on you don't
 

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.210
it's like you know come on you don't
have to do this there's there's other

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:10.220
have to do this there's there's other
 

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.879
have to do this there's there's other
ways around this you know but I mean I

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:12.889
ways around this you know but I mean I
 

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:14.050
ways around this you know but I mean I
know the idea they're trying to get

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.060
know the idea they're trying to get
 

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.530
know the idea they're trying to get
across and they're trying to emphasize

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:16.540
across and they're trying to emphasize
 

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.150
across and they're trying to emphasize
so it's like I respect that but it's

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160
so it's like I respect that but it's
 

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.100
so it's like I respect that but it's
always like you know but but wait a

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.110
always like you know but but wait a
 

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.660
always like you know but but wait a
minute there's about 20 other ways this

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:22.670
minute there's about 20 other ways this
 

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.120
minute there's about 20 other ways this
for half of this so well I also think

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.130
for half of this so well I also think
 

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.030
for half of this so well I also think
with this one they were trying to show

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040
with this one they were trying to show
 

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.439
with this one they were trying to show
what Finn was following you know her a

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:32.449
what Finn was following you know her a
 

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:34.150
what Finn was following you know her a
hundred percent well that yeah that's

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160
hundred percent well that yeah that's
 

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.379
hundred percent well that yeah that's
why I was when I was worried if he was

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:35.389
why I was when I was worried if he was
 

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:37.389
why I was when I was worried if he was
gonna see him as like a cautionary tale

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399
gonna see him as like a cautionary tale
 

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:39.309
gonna see him as like a cautionary tale
yeah like that buddy he doesn't seem to

00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:39.319
yeah like that buddy he doesn't seem to
 

00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:40.449
yeah like that buddy he doesn't seem to
I mean they're both they're hitting

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:40.459
I mean they're both they're hitting
 

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.790
I mean they're both they're hitting
their hands on the table now and stuff I

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800
their hands on the table now and stuff I
 

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.470
their hands on the table now and stuff I
mean so or maybe it's leading to

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480
mean so or maybe it's leading to
 

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.120
mean so or maybe it's leading to
something I don't know I well I took it

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.130
something I don't know I well I took it
 

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.220
something I don't know I well I took it
as kind of him being like okay you could

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.230
as kind of him being like okay you could
 

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.379
as kind of him being like okay you could
do it a hundred percent but at the same

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:50.389
do it a hundred percent but at the same
 

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:54.009
do it a hundred percent but at the same
time don't let it rule you but does he

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:54.019
time don't let it rule you but does he
 

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:57.519
