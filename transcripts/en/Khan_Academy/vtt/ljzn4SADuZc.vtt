00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's try to come up with
a mathematically rigorous

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.790
definition for what
this statement means.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.590
The statement that
the limit of f

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.990
of x as x approaches c
is equal to L. So let's

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:24.490
say that this means that
you can get f of x as close

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.734
to L as you want.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.400
I'll put that in
quotes right over here,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.899
because it's kind
of a little loosey

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.120
goosey as how close is that.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.930
But as close as
you want by getting

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.770
x sufficiently close to c.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310
So another way of saying
this is, if you tell me, hey,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.740
I want to get my f of x to
be within 0.5 of this limit.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.160
Then you're telling me if
this limit is actually true,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.030
you should be able to
hand me a value around c.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.050
That if x is within
that range, then f of x

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.840
is definitely going to be
as close to L as I desire.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.489
So let me draw that out to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:14.530
And I'm going to zoom in.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.490
I'm going to draw
another diagram.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.770
So let's say that this right
over here is my y-axis.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.980
And I'm going to zoom in.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.570
I'm going to draw a slightly
different function, just so we

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.570
can really focus on what's
going on around here.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.660
The range is around c, and the
range is around L. So that's x.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.190
This right over here is y.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.566
Let's say that this is c.

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.190
And let's just zoom
in on our function.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.780
So let's say our function
looks, is doing something like,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.015
let's say it does something
like, let's see, I

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:50.390
don't want it to
be defined at c.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.477
At least just for
the-- it could be.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.560
You can always find a limit
even where is defined.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.269
But let's say our function
looks something like that.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.560
And it can have a little kink
in it, the way I drew it.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.080
So it looks something like this.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.027
It's undefined.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:03.610
Let me draw it a
little bit different.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.710
So it is undefined
when x is equal to c.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.910
So this is the point
where there's a hole.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.776
It is undefined when
x is equal to c.

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:19.420
So it even has a little
kink in it, just like that.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.040
And what we want to do
is prove that the limit,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.020
as x, the limit of f of x--
and let me make it clear,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.160
this is the graph
of y is equal to f

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.420
of x-- we want to get an idea
for what this definition is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.270
saying.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.870
If we're claiming that the limit
of f of x, as x approaches c,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.640
is L.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.820
So conceptually, we
get the gist already.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.430
We already get the gist that
this right over here is L.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.650
But what is this
definition saying?

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.520
Well, it's saying that you
can get f of x as close

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.150
to L as you want.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.390
So if you tell
someone, I want to get

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.723
f of x within a
certain range of L,

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:05.300
then if this limit
is actually true,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.920
if the limit of f of
x as x approaches c

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.870
really is equal to
L, then they should

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.010
be able to find
a range around c.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.250
That as long as x is
around that range,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.197
your f of x is going to be
in the range that you want.

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.030
So let me actually go
through that exercise.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720
It really is a little
bit like a game.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.690
So someone comes up to
you and says, well, OK.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.930
I don't necessarily
believe that you're

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.125
claiming the limit of f of x as
x approaches c is equal to L.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.350
I'm not really sure
if that's the case.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.350
But I agree with
this definition.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.790
So I want to get within 0.5.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.540
I want to get f of x within 0.5
of L. So this right over here

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.180
would be L plus 0.5.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.110
And this right over
here is L minus 0.5.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.350
And then you say, fine.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.350
I'm going to give
you a range around c,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.290
that if you take any x within
that range, your f of x

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.780
is always going to fall in
this range that you care about.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.330
And so you look at this-- and
obviously we haven't explicitly

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.277
defined this function.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.860
But you can even eyeball it, the
way this function is defined.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.089
It won't be that easy
for all functions.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.890
But you look at it like this.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.206
And you say that this
value, just the way

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:26.580
it's drawn right
over here, let's

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.770
say that this is c minus 0.25.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.710
And let's say that this value
right over here is c plus 0.25.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.450
And so you tell
them, look, as long

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.200
as you get x within
0.25 of c, so as long

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.110
as your x's are sitting
someplace over here,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.240
the corresponding f of x is
going to sit in the range

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.170
that you care about.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.470
And you say, OK, fine.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.214
You won that round.

00:04:59.214 --> 00:05:00.380
Let me make it even tighter.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.130
Maybe instead of saying within
the 0.5, I want to get within

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.361
is 0.05.

00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:09.610
And then you'd have to do
this exercise again and find

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.850
another range.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.600
And in order for
this to be true,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.739
you would have to be able
to do this for any range

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:19.530
that they give you.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.015
For any range around
L that they give you,

00:05:22.015 --> 00:05:24.950
you have to be able to get
f of x within that range

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.410
by finding a range around c.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.480
That as long as x is
that range around c,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.434
f of x is going to
sit within that range.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:34.350
So I'll let you think
about that a little bit.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.558
There's a lot to think about.

00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:37.202
But hopefully this made sense.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.160
We did it for the particular
example of someone

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.830
hands you the 0.5, I want
f of x within the 0.5 of L,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.279
and you say, well, as long
as x is within 0.25 of c,

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.320
you're going to match it.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.153
You need to be able to
do that for any range

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:54.190
they give you around
L. And then this limit

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.960
will definitely be true.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.010
So in the next video, we
will now generalize that.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.950
And that will really bring us
to the famous epsilon delta

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.470
definition of limits.
