00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.910
We're told that
in 40 years, Imran

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.170
will be 11 times as
old as he is right now.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.650
And then we're asked,
how old is he right now?

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.420
And so I encourage you
to try this on your own.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.210
Well, let's see if we can
set this up as an equation.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.120
So let's figure out what
our unknown is first.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.590
Well, our unknown is
how old he is right now.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.970
I'm just arbitrarily using x.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.515
We always like to use x.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:33.380
But I could've really
set it to be anything.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.460
But let's say x is equal
to how old he is right now.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.410
How old-- not how hold.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.800
How old he is now.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.560
Now, what do we know about how
old he will be in 40 years?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.970
Well, he's going to be
how old he is now plus 40.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.230
So let me write that down.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:05.570
So in 40 years Imran is
going to be x plus 40,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.534
plus this 40 right over here.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.450
But they give us another
piece of information.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.158
This by itself isn't
enough to figure out

00:01:12.158 --> 00:01:13.280
how old he is right now.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.120
But they tell us
in 40 years, Imran

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.660
will be 11 times as
old as he is right now.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.100
So that's saying that this
quantity right over here,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.770
x plus 40, is going
to be 11 times x.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.470
In 40 years, he's
going to be 11 times as

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.980
old as he is right now.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.990
So this is going to be times 11.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.440
You take x, multiply
it times 11,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.770
you're going to get how old
he's going to be in 40 years.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.100
So let's write that
down as an equation.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.640
You take x, multiply
it by 11, so 11 times

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.920
as old as he is
right now is how old

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.460
he is going to be in 40 years.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.057
And we have set up a nice
little, tidy linear equation

00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:10.650
now.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.462
So we just have to solve for x.

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:16.420
So let's get all the x's
on the left-hand side.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.560
We have more x's here than
on the right-hand side.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.335
So we avoid negative numbers,
let's stick all the x's here.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:23.710
So if I want to get rid of
this x on the right hand side,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.852
I'd want to subtract an x.

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:26.810
But obviously, I can't
just do it to the right.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.790
Otherwise, the equality
won't be true anymore.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.860
I need to do it on
the left as well.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.580
And so I am left with--
if I have 11 of something

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.190
and I take away 1 of them, I'm
left with 10 of that something.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.950
So I'm left with 10 times x is
equal to-- well, these x's, x

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.090
minus x is just 0.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.360
That was the whole point.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.099
It's going to be equal to 40.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.140
And you could do this in
your head at this point,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.880
but let's just
solve it formally.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.350
So if we want a 1
coefficient here,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.850
we'd want to divide
by 10, but we've

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.060
got to do that to both sides.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.080
And so we are left with-- and
we could have our drum roll now.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.290
We are left with x is
equal to 4 years old.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.840
x is equal to 4.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.850
So our answer to the question,
how old is Imran right now?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.980
He is 4 years old.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.640
And let's verify this.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.250
If he's 4 years old
right now, in 40 years

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.030
he's going to be 44 years old.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.590
And 44 years old is indeed 11
times older than 4 years old.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.270
This is a factor of 11
years, so it all worked out.
