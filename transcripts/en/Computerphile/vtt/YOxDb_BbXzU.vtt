00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
So today we're going to talk about, what if the universe is just a computer simulation

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:16.660
How would we know? What sort of things wont we expect to see? Could we ever tell; Could we ever be able to work out that we're you know, living part of a simulation. Of we're just bits of information

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.279
courses The Hitchhiker's Guide to the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.320
galaxy where for example the earth was

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.779
just massive computer program and all

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.609
the people on it form part of how did

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.220
they put it the organic matrix does the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.290
matrix of course itself which is a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.239
really really intriguing idea really

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.629
intelligent concept let down by some the

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.220
earth or acting it's a fascinating

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.149
concept for anybody are we living in a

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.800
simulation and it stretches all the way

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.750
back it's a philosophical a thorny

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.820
philosophical issue so there's a whole

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.070
sort of subfield of physics now called

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.379
digital physics where physicists and

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.699
computer scientists are getting together

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.939
and the idea is that the fundamental

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.729
basis of reality the fundamental basis

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.159
of physics is not energy it's not matter

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.770
its information and there's a guy called

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.450
John Wheeler back in the 70s that is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.770
wonderful phrase called it from bit the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.869
most fundamental aspect of our reality

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.670
is information this is physics world

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.100
back in just last year modeling our

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.890
universe is a giant computer and the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.719
idea here is that instead of having

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.939
what's called continuous functions

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.950
instead of being able to basically pick

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.049
any particular point in space no matter

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.079
how small the smallest infinitesimal

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.560
there's a quantization space is divided

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.499
up into chunks or space is divided into

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.869
a grid and that's really reminiscent of

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.819
things that were happening again back in

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.600
the 70s but have been you know obviously

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.280
developments in the decades since then

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.649
where the something called Conway's Game

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.020
of Life which is a really really neat

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.950
example of how simple rules very simple

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.350
rules can give rise to complexity and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.750
what you do is you set up a grid it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.920
could be in three dimensions but

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.020
generally in Conway's Game of Life we

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.790
consider two dimensions and what you do

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.349
is something really really simple really

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.459
simple rules right what we're going to

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.720
do is we're going to populate this grid

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.720
so we have squares which are like little

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.069
animals and one and those really simple

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.410
rules what you basically see so you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.080
start off your system and what you're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.690
going to do is each time round we get a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.230
computer

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.239
but there's no reason if you were

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.909
suitably inclined and had nothing better

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.500
to do with your life that you couldn't

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.810
do with just pen and paper you look at

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.090
this one you look at each animal or each

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.459
cell let's call them cells in the grid

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.739
and you say look at the many neighbors

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.989
it's got and then you have very simple

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.870
rules if it's got zero or one neighbors

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.170
it dies out of loneliness if it's got

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.579
more than four neighbors it dies out of

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.709
overpopulation overcrowding and if it's

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.079
got two or three then it's happy so

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.450
that's those those one set of rules if

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.060
it's occupied if it's not occupied if it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.859
doesn't have a cell in it then what

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.260
happens is that if it's got three

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.930
neighbors so here for example then what

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.609
will happen is this one will become live

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.099
if you do this I'll show you the screen

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.260
this ISM obviously it's going to take a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.000
long time if we were to do that with pen

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.540
and paper

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.129
Giancarlo's game of life by a guy called

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.329
where is it Martin Edwin Martin so what

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.579
you do is let's take a really simple one

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.500
like that and what we're going to do is

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.700
we're going to play those rules and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.530
watch what happens you might think oh

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.880
this is going to be fairly boring book

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.200
so you get something which is called a

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.599
glider just due to the way those those

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.180
rules work okay so in this case once it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.620
reaches the edge of the grip the edge of

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.480
the grid things effectively stop so

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.069
let's do this one and let's see what

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.750
happens now Wow remember how basic yours

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.549
rules are my daughterÃ­s of seven and

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.109
nine my sons actually fought I could

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.120
explain those rules to him and see what

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.220
you got there this case it reaches a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.930
steady stay at a boring steady state but

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.510
before let's run that again it's all

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.819
that complexity just from very basic

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.750
rules stop it again and then or we can

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.760
do something completely random let's

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.880
clear it Edwin's provided the facility

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.590
to do need things like this that's a

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.900
very wonky face and then we run this

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.949
same rules and what you see is the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.539
population so this is I hope you can see

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.190
how its way it's called game of life now

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.560
and in the 70s you know this was

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.360
paradise for geeks you know this was

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.580
steer to the art computer graphics in

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.789
the 70s in fact I my computing started

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:44.719
in the eighties with something called

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.729
the zx81 this isn't color

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.650
this is far beyond what I was capable of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.779
back in 1981 so on this would have been

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.330
heaven for me but notice so in this case

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.740
this once keeps flicking around and it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.809
will do that for infinity but what's

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.089
remarkable here is unbelievably simple

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:01.729
rules on a grid on this type of grid

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.009
give rise to this type of complexity and

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.020
what's the important thing here well

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.150
it's the information it's the the fact

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.430
that this this animal or this whatever

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.839
you want to call it sell at this

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.169
position is affected by its influence by

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.479
its neighbors and it's the it's those

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.699
interactions and how that information is

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.349
exchanged that gives rise to this level

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.960
of complexity and physicists in all

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.539
seriousness not all of not all

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.370
physicists are allowed to certainly

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.830
admit that there's a large number who

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.389
would seriously doubt this and would

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.559
argue that actually at the most

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.080
fundamental level space-time reality

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.719
amongst us around us is not a grid like

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.360
this it is not quantized but computer

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.149
scientists physicists a large number of

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:46.370
those are arguing well actually no it

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.099
may well be like this and then it

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.649
becomes very very interesting indeed as

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:55.399
to how these basically these rules play

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.930
out so what this has got to do with you

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.669
and me and atoms and galaxies is that

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.759
the important thing here is if the

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.959
system depends just solely on well

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.599
weather is this unit is this grid

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.999
occupied or not is that a 1 or a 0 is

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.680
that a bit or is it not a bit then do we

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.199
treat particle interactions like that

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.529
digital physics is reasonably well

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.699
developed there are it has its

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.949
proponents it has its opponents but the

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:26.870
idea that spaced I might be quantized

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.479
what are the zeros and ones what's the

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.669
equivalent like are you talking about

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.370
like atoms of the bits or is it more

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.779
fundament it's not as the fundamental

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.719
particles it's the idea that right at

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.009
the very limit of a very smallest thing

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.629
you can imagine like the Planck length

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.389
at that level we're talking we're seeing

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.819
that that space is quantized you know

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.909
these are ones and zeroes if it's

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.769
occupied it's a 1 if it's not occupied

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:56.779
it's a zero and what's the equivalent of

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:58.900
occupied and unoccupied at the quantum

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.300
in the presence for example the presence

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.130
of a particle the absence of a particle

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.290
what slightly more left to field and

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.639
slightly more off-the-wall but

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.580
nonetheless interesting is could we be

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.009
actually the result of a computer

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.900
simulation by some super hyper

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.449
dimensional or whatever set of aliens or

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.300
indeed future generations could we be

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.289
living in future and there's a guy

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:22.380
called Nick Bostrom at Oxford at the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.970
future of humanity Institute in Oxford

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.210
who's proposed something called a

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.190
simulation argument who argues this

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.100
you've got three options first of all

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.620
one is that we'd go extinct we don't

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.240
reach we saw at some point we blow

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.580
ourselves of global warming comes along

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.800
and we wipe ourselves out relatively

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.979
boring steady-state second one is that

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:46.180
what okay we get lots and lots of

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.030
technology but we just sort of lose

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.280
interest in for example trying to run

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.080
simulations at larger and larger and

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.090
larger simulations but the third one and

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.139
the third one is the most interesting

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:00.280
one is well we develop better and better

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.380
technology and what that technology

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.030
allows us to do is you run better and

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.610
better simulations up to the point where

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.250
we can simulate an entire universe if

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.020
you can simulate an entire universe and

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.030
if really what matters right at the

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.610
bottom end of this is whether you fill a

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.080
grid with ones and zeros that's

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.050
computing then and if our consciousness

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.260
and our sentience stems from that then

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.360
what you'll do is you create sentient

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.680
beings in a supercomputer or so and the

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.260
argument is that if you do have that

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.060
type of technological capability of

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.070
Bostrom's argument is that it's

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.560
exceedingly likely if we do progress to

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.200
that point that we are in a simulation

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.930
this is not reality this is a simulated

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.250
real life and you can think of layers

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.380
upon layers upon layers of simulations

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.100
and how would we ever know we'd like to

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.290
thank audible.com for its support of

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.480
this computer file video audible has a

massive range of audio books and if

a lot of long drives or walk the dog

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.279
every day it's great being able to catch

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.620
up with books on a portable device like

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.079
your iPhone - recommendations after a

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:09.940
video like this Hitchhiker's Guide to

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.670
the galaxy and also fineman's

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.440
physics lectures and the good thing

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.120
about these two is you can actually

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.280
listen to the guys who wrote the books

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.860
Fineman himself and douglas adams which

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.630
is always a nice trait hearing their

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.090
voices you can download a free audio

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.390
book at audible comm slash computer file

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.700
so go and check it out and thanks to

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.350
audible for supporting channels like

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.880
this it's great for us to be able to

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.800
team up with a company that's selling

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.590
books and information and also a company

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.570
that kind of uses technology and things

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.400
like that things we love here at

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.970
computerphile

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.830
so while you go and get free audiobook

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:52.300
I'm going to get this thing rolling well

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.930
that's a nice one
