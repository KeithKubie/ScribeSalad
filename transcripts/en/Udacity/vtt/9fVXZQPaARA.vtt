00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.370
Now, we want to revisit that
question of information flow.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.220
And remember, recall that
information flow is a problem

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.490
that cannot be addressed by
discretionary access control, okay.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.730
So we want to see how mandatory
access control, or MAC, or

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.010
multi level security, in particular
the BLP model that we are focusing on.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.946
And so how does the BLP model help us
solve that information flow problem

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:25.860
that we had?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.285
So we say we have an object,
this is a top secret object.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:35.275
So we have a top secret object 2 is TS.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:37.585
This is more sensitive information.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.265
We never want this information to go and

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:45.775
end up in an object that
has level is only secret.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:48.115
So this is more sensitive object.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:52.560
2 is more sensitive than object 1
because we said TS is greater than S.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.120
So this is highly top
secret information.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.960
We never want it to end up in
an object that is only classified

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.160
at the secret level.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.750
Okay, so how can this information
flow from here to there?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.060
There are two paths.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.450
Path one is that a top
secret user reads it.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.910
We know that the read
down rule means what?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.030
For this to read, for
someone to be able to read this,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.900
the user has to be TS,
otherwise they can't read it.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
A secret user can only read secret or
below.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.220
So, a top secret user
can read this object.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.740
So, this read will be allowed.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.330
And then they, can this
information that they have pulled,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.090
remember the Alice, Bob, Charlie example
in discretionary access control we had?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.950
Where Alice gave read access to Bob,
who copied the data

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.250
into a file that he created and
then passed it on to Charlie?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.650
Well, can User 1 do something like that?

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.790
Can it create Object 2,
in which it may be able to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.070
write this information that
it just read from Object 1.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.180
For someone who is not top-secret to
be able to read this information,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.480
the object we create has to be secret or
lower.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.120
TS then is just like here.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.975
They won't be able to read Object 2,
they won't be able to read Object 1.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:08.050
This object is at the lower level,
then the write rule says what?

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.220
You can only write up.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.620
You can't write down.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.740
So all the top secret user can
take this information, read it.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.590
But they're not able to write
it in an object that can be read

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.010
by somebody who's not
cleared at top secret.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.670
So this path doesn't allow informational
flow to get to a lower level.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.140
What about a secret user?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.280
We know the secret user can,
once it's here, can read that.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.370
I guess we know that
a secret user can't read.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.340
So, this path we said is not possible.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.190
This path actually ends right here
because the secret user is not able to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.460
read a top secret document.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.050
This label would not dominate
the label of the object.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.510
So this path is broken here,
this path is broken right here,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.000
so this information actually
never flows in here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.175
And information from Object
1 flowing to Object 2.

00:02:57.175 --> 00:03:00.565
Secret can read this object and
can write up, yes.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:03.665
But that doesn't violate any
confidentiality requirements.

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:07.235
So secret information can now
be read by a top secret person.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.780
This information, made its way from
here, through user 2, into this object.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.890
The top secret could already read this,
read down.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.780
So, in this direction,
information of flow doesn't make

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.760
more sensitive information available to
a user, who is cleared at a lower level.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.350
The system would not allow information
that is read from this object

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.760
to be written into an object
that is at the lower level.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.480
That's a guarantee
that comes with BLP and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.500
the MAC model that we didn't
have with DAC before.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.800
So this is how we're able to control
information flow, and that's how we

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.071
fix one of the shortcomings that we
had with discretionary access control.
