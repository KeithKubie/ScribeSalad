00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.890
We've used the term social
contract several times already,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.660
so let's take a
look at what did we

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.960
mean by this post-World
World War II social contract?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.170
And why did it work
so well for so many?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.630
If you were born
between 1946 and 1964,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.820
you're a member of what we
call the Baby Boom generation.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.820
And chances are you did
quite well, because you were

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.270
able to follow
your parents advice

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.610
of working hard,
staying in school,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.050
and being able to improve on the
standard of living you achieve

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.420
for yourself and for
your family compared

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.260
to what your parents had.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.550
So was this all just
a matter of luck?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.970
Is there some iron law of
economics that achieved it?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.240
Well, neither are true.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.930
It took a lot of hard work
and a lot of invention

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.710
on the part of labor and
management leaders of the time.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.010
America came out of World War
II with an enormous amount

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.250
of pent-up demand
for consumer goods,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.310
because we were
focused on building

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.780
the economy for the war.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.860
So we had to convert
from factories

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.370
that made tanks and
military airplanes

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.310
to factories that made cars
and other kinds of goods

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.280
and services that were in high
demand in the post-World War

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280
II economy.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.100
And that created what we call
the post-war social contract.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, you've seen
this diagram before.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.410
It shows that over the
post-World War II time period,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.590
wages and productivity
moved in tandem.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.040
And so as the
economy got better,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
so too did wages and
living conditions

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.740
for the vast majority of
families of that time.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.470
So how did that work?

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.790
Well, as I said, we've had
an enormous amount of growth

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.610
in construction,
in heavy industry,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.090
in rebuilding the economy
after World War II.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.510
We had the rise of
mass production.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.270
We had automobiles
coming out of our ears.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.250
Here's a picture of
how Ford and General

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.510
Motors and other companies
were able to produce millions

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.850
of vehicles for the mass market,
largely similar kinds of goods

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.170
and services that
people were looking for.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.890
So it was out of
this time period

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.250
that unions began to grow.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.000
In the post-World World
War II time period,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.750
unions grew to about 30% to 35%.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.930
But union growth
didn't come easily.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.210
It took a lot of battles
between labor and management

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.060
in the steel industry,
in the auto industry.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.960
General Motors had to
experience a sit-down strike

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.060
in their plant in 1937
before unionization

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.140
was accepted by General Motors.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.740
This is an example
of what's called

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.800
the Battle of the
Overpass, where

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.730
the auto workers' leaders--

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.920
led by Walter Reuther,
who we're going

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.940
to hear about a little bit
more specifically in a moment--

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.260
had to fight with paid security
guards hired by Ford Motor

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.100
to try to keep the union out.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.240
So this was a
battle that went on

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.640
not only in autos but in steel
and in many other industries.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.560
But once it was successful,
and once unions were organized,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.140
you got something called
the postwar social contract.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.010
This is an example of
Walter Reuther, here,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.500
negotiating and signing an
agreement with General Motors

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.020
which was called the
Treaty of Detroit,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.750
where the parties agreed that
they would increase wages

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.090
by the rate of growth
in the cost of living

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.910
and the overall average rate
of growth in productivity

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.930
in the economy.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.500
And it was that agreement that
allowed wages then to grow,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.970
and why we got this
tandem movement of wages

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.050
and productivity for so many
years in the postwar time

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.960
period.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.870
But that was just
the auto industry.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.740
How do we get this to
spread across the country?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.640
Well, to understand
that, we have

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.660
to introduce another
term, something

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.130
that in labor
relations terminology

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.400
is called pattern bargaining.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.160
What would happen is, you
negotiated a wage agreement

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.670
at, let's say, General
Motors; and then the union

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.610
would carry that same
agreement to Ford and say,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.640
if you don't want
a strike, then you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.310
should agree to the same wage.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.080
And Ford would agree,
and the pattern

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.570
would spread to
Chrysler and others

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.730
in the automobile industry.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.130
While not perfect, it then
also spread to other industries

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.810
across the country
at its own rate.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.350
So you got oil and gas
and household appliances

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.060
and the steel industry
and aerospace,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.710
rubber, electronics, all of
these growing industries,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.950
basically following a
similar wage pattern--

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.540
not exactly copying but fitted
to the economic circumstances

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.780
of their particular setting.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.240
And so this is what created
that tandem movement

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.980
of wages and productivity.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.000
And as the economy
got better, so too

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.840
did the average workforce
member and his or her families.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.560
That's the kind of thing
that we then lost since 1980.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.660
That's the kind of
thing we have to find

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.250
a new solution to create again.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.680
But the key for us
today is not to try

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.410
to go back to the 1940s,
'50s, '60s, or '70s,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.360
but to ask, how can
we create wage norms?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.870
How can we create the
bargaining power for workers

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.960
so that we can once
again start to get

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.410
wages moving with the overall
growth of the economy?

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.410
That's our challenge
moving forward.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.330
We'll talk about how to do
that in future sessions.
