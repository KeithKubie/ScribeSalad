00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
So, I think our four computer scientist can be rather optimistic

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.230
and that is also why they are all smiling a little bit here.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.190
So, now, it's time to say goodbye to Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.310
and wish them all the best for their jobs

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.750
because in the next unit we are going to take a look at problems that are far worse

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.510
that anything you have encountered so far.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.310
In the final unit of this course, we are going to look at problems

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.860
that are worse than NP complete problems, worse than games such as road block,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.300
and worse than exponential time complete.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.560
We are going to explore the very limits of computation

00:00:33.560 --> 99:59:59.000
and look at problems that no computer can solve ever, so see you next time.
