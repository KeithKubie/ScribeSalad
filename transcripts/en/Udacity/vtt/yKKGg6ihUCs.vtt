00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's talk about URLs. undoubtedly, you've seen

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.310
URLs before. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.080
An example of URL would be as follows. This is an example of URL. It's

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.170
got three main parts. It's got the protocol, separated by a column and two

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.590
slashes from the host. Which precedes the path and in this case the path is just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.020
a slash and if we didn't have that slash there the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.010
path would still be a slash because that's the, the minimum path.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.230
Now, the protocol can be a number of things but for

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.780
our purposes it's going to be http almost all the time. We will

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.260
also see https from time to time. And you'll see other

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.200
protocols around the web. You might see ftp or you know, things,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.050
things like that, but http basically means, you know, the web.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.160
That's, that's what we're going to be learning in this class. The host,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.840
this is the host name or domain name of the, of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.860
the server that has the document we want to access. This

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.680
can also be an IP address. This host just of course,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.180
translates into an IP address, and this is the. You know, the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.050
description of the location of the physical machine that has the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.640
document we want to fetch. And the path is the document

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.810
we're going to fetch. Now, the path can be more complicated.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.710
So the path would be this whole thing if we were accessing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.840
the image we were using in the previous part of the lecture.
