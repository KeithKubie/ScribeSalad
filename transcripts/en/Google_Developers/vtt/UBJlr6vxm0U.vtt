FEMALE SPEAKER: Computing
has had an enormous impact

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.930
on all of our lives.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.490
Every day 100 of millions
of users around the world

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150
use mobile and web apps.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.820
And a number of the
groundbreaking, innovative work

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.392
was done by
development agencies.

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:20.850
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
Google recognizes

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.340
the impact these agencies
have an overall [? apica ?]

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.650
system globally.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.640
These agencies employ
tens to hundreds

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.270
of talented developers each.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.494
They design and publish
dozens of the top apps

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:31.660
globally, every single year.

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:37.580
MUSTAFI ALI: Mutual Mobile
is a [? regional ?] agency

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.230
that builds products for
Fortune 500 companies

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.520
using emerging technologies.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.750
We work for large companies.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.919
We also work with
small start-ups.

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.210
PRADEEP NALLURI: We are
headquartered in Austin, Texas.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.380
We are a 200 office in Austin,
and we are 35 in India.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.850
Our plan is to triple our
work force in India by 2017.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.340
RAVI KORUKONDA: We started
Purple Talk in 2008, just when

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.730
mobile industry is born.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.610
So we did more than
600 applications

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.476
in the last seven years.

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:08.330
We're the only company in India
who work with Hollywood IT.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.400
We did it again for
"Madagascar" movie,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.358
and also we did it again
for "Star Trek" movie.

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.515
AMIT SANJEEV: In
recognition of the impact,

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:16.973
the [? Developers ?]
relations team

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:19.650
has created a specific program
to cater for their needs.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.270
Here, we try to help them
create work products that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.935
are high quality,
and also help them

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:25.060
improve their productivity.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.290
PARUL SOI: In the first event,
[INAUDIBLE] conducted in India,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.650
we worked with
over 350 developers

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.740
across six different cities.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.240
UMA SHANKAR
MALLAPRAGADA: I'm really

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.948
impressed with the
initiative that Google

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:41.010
has taken towards building
their relationship

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.450
with various partners
who are really engaged

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.280
in the mobile app development,
specifically on Android

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.040
and help us really
build any work-arounds

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.270
around technological
complexities

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.997
and probably how they integrate
the ads, how they have

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:54.830
the tools in the app
to basically scale when

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.835
their customer base grows up.

00:01:57.835 --> 00:01:59.210
AMIT SANJEEV: In
these events, we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.480
touch upon different aspects,
including technology, design,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.560
and process engineering.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.510
Using these events, we
hope that developers

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.780
can create better products
and also create experiences

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.910
that can delight users.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.410
BALASUBRAMANIAN KJ: Decisions
that they're taking out today,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.409
it's going to help us in
the overall development

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.320
for Android.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.304
We got a lot of insights about
Android M then Android L,

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:22.220
and the kind of [? bridges ?]
that we're going

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.072
to use for our development.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:26.280
AMIT RANA: It's a good start,
so that every developer

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.405
is at a common
level, so that we can

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:30.830
get into more advanced
sessions in the future.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.860
So what I'm expecting to get
that information from Google.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.670
What are the specific trainings?

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.760
Whether we should be
doing hybrid or native?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.060
What are big players doing?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.610
Also, input which
would help our UNIX

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.670
team to give a better
experience to what customers

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.454
want to build.

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:45.870
UTTAM TRIPATHI:
We started working

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.850
with agencies in
the UK and India,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.140
and now expanding to
additional regions.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.470
By using our understanding
of various markets,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.770
we localize our
content and offerings,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.920
hence ensuring it's still
made for each of our partner

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.360
agencies.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.510
NARENDRA: I am happy that Google
came up with Google Developer

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.790
agency program by
coming to our company

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.610
and talking to the
Android developers,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.210
and also taking
feedback from us.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.960
PRADEEP NALLURI: I
think this will greatly

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.620
help us to build
great applications

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.830
and make the ultimate user
experience good for the end

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.560
customers.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.707
I think it's a good thing
to do at the end of the day.

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:21.290
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
The more streamlined

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.970
we can make their work,
the more high-quality apps

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.860
are available on
handsets for everyone.
