00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:09.754
"All men are created equal

00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:11.708
and they are endowed with the rights to

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:16.110
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.404
Not so fast, Mr. Jefferson!

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:21.454
These words from the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:24.002
and the facts behind them, are well known.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.323
In June of 1776,

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:29.890
a little more than a year after the war against England began

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.986
with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord,

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:36.825
the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.048
to discuss American independence.

00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:43.499
After long debates, a resolution of independence

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.946
was approved on July 2, 1776.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.843
America was free!

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:54.599
And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever.

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:57.675
But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress

00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:01.280
voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.858
largely written by Thomas Jefferson,

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:08.504
offering all the reasons why the country should be free.

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:11.235
More than 235 years later,

00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:15.538
we celebrate that day as America's birthday.

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:19.004
But there are some pieces of the story you may not know.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.567
First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.358
for writing the Declaration,

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:25.489
but five men had been given the job

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:28.811
to come up with a document explaining why

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.066
America should be independent:

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.352
Robert Livingston,

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.737
Roger Sherman,

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:35.190
Benjamin Franklin and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.768
John Adams were all named first.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:40.594
And it was Adams who suggested that the young,

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:43.738
and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:48.147
because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation,

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:53.245
and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:56.470
Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.614
or credited his sources,

00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:02.025
some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:05.044
from other writers and slightly tweaked.

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.922
Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions.

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:13.725
But the most important change came after the Declaration

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.259
was turned over to the full Congress.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.835
For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:24.183
sat and fumed while his words were picked over.

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:28.930
In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.624
and one big deletion.

00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:34.346
In the long list of charges that Jefferson made

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:36.042
against the King of England,

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.965
the author of the Declaration had included the idea

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:43.205
that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade,

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:47.500
and was preventing America from ending slavery.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.611
That was not only untrue,

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.602
but Congress wanted no mention of slavery

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:55.871
in the nation's founding document.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:57.194
The reference was cut out

00:02:57.194 --> 00:03:01.382
before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer.

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:03.708
But it leaves open the hard question:

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:05.188
How could the men,

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.294
who were about to sign a document,

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:10.195
celebrating liberty and equality,

00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:14.374
accept a system in which some people owned others?

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:16.393
It is a question that

00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:19.292
would eventually bring the nation to civil war

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:22.322
and one we can still ask today.
