00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.300
OK.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.300
DOWN THE HATCH.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.620
Gross.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.380
I hope this works.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.690
Hey there health nuts and internet crazers,
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.770
There are broad claims regarding the efficacy
of apple cider vinegar's power to curb appetite,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.730
burn fat, cure rashes, stop heartburn, bring
down fever, and cure asthma, treat wounds,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.310
reduce the effects of aging, and even cure
diseases like cancer!

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.730
Is this a miracle drug?!

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.730
No.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.730
It's not.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.730
But… that doesn't mean it’s bunk.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.460
what is it/how it's made
Vinegar is a derivative of alcoholic beverages.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
To make their bottled delights, winemakers
ferment grapes with yeast.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.079
The yeast eat sugar from the grapes and poop
out alcohol!

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.079
Yum!

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.530
To make vinegar is the same, but acetobacter
bacteria is added to wine!

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.870
The bacteria eats the alcohol and poops out
acetic acid.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.059
Acetic acid is what make vinegar, vinegar!

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.770
The word vinegar comes from French for sour
wine, although it can be made from wine, beer,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.120
rice, or other fermentables like wood.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.580
Apple cider vinegar is made with -- you guessed
it, double fermented apple cider.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.250
Apples to hard cider to apple cider vinegar.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.360
Personal note: why did y'all mess up a good
thing?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
what's special about it?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.180
According to the USDA apple cider vinegar
contains none of the vitamins A, B6, C, E,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.040
or K, and no niacin, riboflavin, thiamin,
pantothenic acid or folate.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.240
What it DOES contain, according to the FDA,
is a minimum of 4% acetic acid, and a lot

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
of water.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920
This means vinegar (or acetic acid) likely
won't make you thinner, and there's no scientific

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.890
support of it as a skin toner.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.090
And when Medscape General Medicine conducted
a review of the research on vinegar, they

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.850
found it was not recommended as an anti-infectious
medicine orally or topically, and probably

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.900
doesn't fight hypertension.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.490
And in terms of its cancer-fighting claims,
while it did shrink leukemia cells and tumors

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.520
in lab experiments, but that affect hasn't
been shown in humans at all.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
does acetic acid have any special properties
(yes)

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.110
Now a 2015 study in PlosONE did find small
concentrations of acetic acid can help reduce

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.361
bacterial growth on surfaces and PubChem lists
acetic acid as having mild antibacterial and

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:12.410
antifungal properties, which is why vinegar
can be used as a mild household cleanser…

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.060
But putting vinegar on your face is probably
not the best idea.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.620
Pimples are bacterial infections of the sebaceous
glands, so it might decrease bacterial load

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
there.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.530
However, it's not recommended by any real
scientific research.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.130
Though, I did find a 1916 book for nurses
that recommended vinegar as a treatment for

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.020
acne, but it also advised putting mercury
on your face.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.020
so what about ingesting vinegar?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.120
Drinking vinegar was studied far more often.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.010
Acids are known boosters of mineral absorption,
so a tiny bit of vinegar on a green leafy

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.069
salad can help our digestive systems absorb
more calcium from the leaves than we would

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.069
naturally!

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.930
And, a 2004 study of 11 people with Type 2
diabetes found when participants consumed

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.470
a tiny bit of vinegar they had higher sensitivity
to insulin -- that's a good thing.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.191
And though this study was too small to generalize
to all humans, research is ongoing and is

00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:05.600
really positive!

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.680
The thing is, don't drink too much.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.620
Vinegar is an acid and will damage the throat
and stomach lining and erode teeth.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.520
There's a reason it's diluted.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.740
And speaking of deluded… if you leave vinegar
alone, the same bacteria that fermented the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.420
alcohol to turn it to vinegar will eventually
grow a massive colony -- which some call a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.420
mother.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.000
Yep, acetobacter bacteria grows into kombucha,
eventually.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.270
There you go crunchy greeny birkenstock-wearers…
go be friends.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.810
wrap
Look, swapping vinegar into salads and foods

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.840
instead of using creams or salts will not
only help you suck in more minerals but keeps

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.390
you from eating unhealthy stuff!

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.390
Win-win!

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.360
but if you're interesting in drinking the
pre-made ACV derivative, kombucha, maybe you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.560
should learn about that first in this video
WTF is Kombucha?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.250
Have you tried this?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.640
Are you against it?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.890
YT tell us in the comments…
