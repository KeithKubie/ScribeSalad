me in my own car, takes off,

- I'm gonna tell a story about
the time I walked off

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.573
a three-story building,
fell onto concrete,

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.844
broke my back in three places,
and shattered my heel,

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.413
and I think if you're gonna have
an injury that bad

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.580
where you almost die,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.149
doctors think you might even
be paralyzed,

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.250
it should be for something

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.618
you're willing to die for,
right?

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.820
Should be for something
important.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.156
Mine was I was trying
to sneak into

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.824
a Huey Lewis concert.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.761
[laughter]

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:42.668
Huey Lewis and the News are
my favorite band of all time.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.838
I love Huey Lewis and the News,

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:48.541
and they were enormous
in the '80s, and, you know,

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.010
I grew up in the '80s,
and then they sort of, you know,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.013
weren't as big in the '90s,
and it turns out they were doing

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.617
pharmacy conventions
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.851
[low laughter]

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.354
And my friend was training to be
a pharmacist.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.856
He was very talented,
and he turns to me one day,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:05.524
and he goes, "Hey, man.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:08.661
"I'm going to this convention
tonight for pharmacists,

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.030
"open bar, pretty cool.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.035
Also, Huey Lewis and the News
are playing it."

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.236
I'm like, "Oh, you've got to get
me in.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.038
Like, that's my favorite band of
all time."

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.739
And he goes, "I'm sorry.
Security's very tight.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.076
I don't think I can get you in."

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.911
And I go, "Well, find some old
guy that doesn't want to party

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.581
late, and I'll use his
credentials."

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:33.720
And he did, and I went in as Bob
Dopple in Creative Health Care

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.222
Solutions from New Jersey.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.025
And I'm partying all night,
and I end up at, like, this

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.895
rich CEO pharmacy guy's
apartment in Cleveland,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.531
and it's, like, amazing, and
nobody else is drinking that

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.999
hard at this point,
but I am still, like,

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.702
really hitting it hard,
and I yell,

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.105
"Let's go to the roof,
everyone."

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.873
And they're like, "No, you know,
it's really not

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:54.940
"that kind of roof.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.909
Uh, I wouldn't do that."

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.178
But I go up there anyways.

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.048
And I'm so lost in, like, how
beautiful this is, and, like,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.750
how great of an evening it is
that I just kind of, like,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.420
walk clean off the roof
and fall three stories.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.022
Literally, I just thought I had
a little bit more roof,

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.958
you know, like...

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.960
[laughter]

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.963
I don't know if you've ever
walked down steps, and you think

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.098
you've got another step, and you
don't, and you're like, "Whoa."

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.467
Like, I thought I had another
solid step of roof,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:25.137
and it was not there.

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.538
I fall down.

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.541
I don't know how long
I'm unconscious for.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.944
I--I later learned that inside
this room in the party, like,

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.245
I go up to them.
"Let's go to the roof."

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:34.613
They're like,
"That's not a good idea."

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.949
They later turned to my friend
and they go,

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.052
"Is he gonna be okay?"

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:43.756
And he goes,
"Bob Dopple...

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:47.626
is the most mistake-proof
pharmacist I know."

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:52.598
They then see me fall
through the window.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.833
I hit the ground.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.134
I don't know how long I'm
unconscious for.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.103
I come to, and I'm, like,
triple-y confused,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.673
because I have all these
strangers above me,

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.142
and they're going, "Bob?"

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.079
[laughter]

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.617
"Bob? Bob?"

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.853
And that's when it hits me.
I go, "Oh, shit.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:20.659
They think I'm Bob Dopple in
Creative Health Care Solutions."

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.930
And I panic, because I was
relatively certain I was gonna

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.999
die from my injuries,
so I think to myself,

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.668
"Oh, my God.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:33.606
I'm about to die, and they're
gonna call Bob Dopple's wife."

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.509
[laughter]

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.013
Like, she's gonna get this phone
call, like, "Bob's dead."

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:43.182
Like, "What happened?
Heart attack? Stroke?"

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:47.052
Like, "No, he walked off
a three-story building."

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:51.657
So I sit up, and I go,
"I don't care what happens next.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.726
Nobody talks to my wife."

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.729
[laughter]

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.699
[appaluse]

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.303
And I just fall down to die.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:08.207
My buddy picks me up, throws me
in my own car, takes off,

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:12.044
hits another car,
and just floors it.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:14.213
And I always wondered what that
exit looked like

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.349
to those other pharmacists.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.886
[laughter]

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.654
They had to be like, "Wow.

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.725
That New Jersey office parties."

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.695
[laughter]

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:36.868
"Bob Dopple just walked off
a building,

00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:42.875
"told us not to tell his wife,

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.078
and I think his friend just
stole a goddamn vehicle."

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:49.048
[laughter]

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:55.087
And we're driving now in this
vehicle--my car--

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:56.422
and my buddy turns,
and he's like,

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:57.890
"Oh, my God, Flannery.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.958
"I saw you fall
through that window.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.693
I thought you were dead."

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:01.927
I'm like, "Me too, brother.

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:03.863
I didn't think I'd ever
see you again, man."

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.231
And he's like,
"Geez, I panicked.

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.232
I didn't know--like,
what am I gonna do if you die?"

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:08.767
"I know, I know."

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.805
I go, "You want to know what's
weird is as I was falling,

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:13.905
"I thought I was gonna die,

00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:16.141
"but I was totally comfortable

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.812
because I was singing
'The Power of Love' in my head."

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:22.915
[laughter]

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:25.751
"And I was a total peace."

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.886
He starts laughing so hard

00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:31.757
he loses control of my car
and hits a tree.

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.726
[laughter]

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:39.231
So I've now been in two major
accidents in about 45 sec--like,

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.134
I don't even know if they get
to the chorus of "Power of Love"

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.768
in 45 seconds.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:46.172
I've been in two major
collisions.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.274
We get out of the car.
We back to his apartment.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:51.511
I go to bed.
I think I'm fine.

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.813
I wake up the next day,
and I feel a little sore.

00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:58.483
I go into the E.R., and that's
when I realize that I was so

00:06:58.483 --> 00:07:01.753
drunk, I literally
walked off a roof,

00:07:01.753 --> 00:07:04.790
and I didn't know I was falling.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.661
So I didn't bend my legs,

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.163
so the force of the fall
compressed

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:12.598
my first three vertebrae.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.301
I got a compression fracture in
my--the surgeon that was looking

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.205
at the X-rays was--is it,
"What? Uhh, uhh, no.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.041
"Uh...

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:26.045
this would mean you made
no effort to adjust..."

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.180
[laughter]

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.182
"Like, at all.

00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:33.952
No, uh..."

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:36.822
I mean, like a 7-Eleven clerk
looking at, like, a $20 bill

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.023
where he's like, "Nuh-uh."

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:39.458
Said he'd never seen
the injury in anyone

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:43.662
under the age of 92.

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:46.465
He brought in another surgeon
to look at it,

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.367
like, just to show him, and I
will never forget what that

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.903
other surgeon said to his
residents as long as I live.

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:53.005
He held up the X-ray, and he
goes, "This young man right

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.973
"here, he walked off a roof.

00:07:54.973 --> 00:07:57.977
I am talking Daffy Duck-style."

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.880
[laughter]

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.918
That was his medical--

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:10.523
his medical terminology

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:12.525
for how I injured myself.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.994
[laughter]

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.398
But what was amazing is they
both agreed that being drunk

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:23.368
saved my life, 'cause they said
that if I was sober,

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.871
I would have realized
I was falling,

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:27.907
I would have braced for impact,

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.908
it would have changed
my center of gravity,

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:31.510
and I might have hit my head.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.247
I learned that evening that
every fall over ten feet

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.583
is lethal if you hit your head,
so they said,

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.019
"Being drunk
actually saved your life."

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.887
Now, the nurse overhead this,
and she goes,

00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:45.524
"Of course, a sober person
may not have been on that roof."

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:49.295
[laughter]

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.197
I'm like,
"You know, ma'am,

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:56.368
we don't need to cherry-pick
science here, okay?"

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.237
[laughter]

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.604
So, ladies and gentlemen,
I don't know if there's

00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:02.474
necessarily a moral to this
story, but if you find yourself,

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:06.078
like, on an unfamiliar roof
just exploring at night,

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.481
please, dear God,
in the interest of safety

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.949
be drunk out of your mind.

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:11.116
Thank you very much.

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:14.119
[cheers and applause]
