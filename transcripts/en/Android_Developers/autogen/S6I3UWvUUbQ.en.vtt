for a car racing game this could be

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:19.950
for a car racing game this could be
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.620
for a car racing game this could be
drift versus drag racing versus and a

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:24.630
drift versus drag racing versus and a
 

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.690

carjacking if you're in GTA or something
 

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.170
carjacking if you're in GTA or something
but this is this is the ability for

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180
but this is this is the ability for
 

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.810
but this is this is the ability for
people to compete in multiple different

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820
people to compete in multiple different
 

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.390
people to compete in multiple different
ways how they want to compete ok so here

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:38.400
ways how they want to compete ok so here
 

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.070
ways how they want to compete ok so here
within here you can see people within

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.080
within here you can see people within
 

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320
within here you can see people within
your the sorry the play can see within

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.330
your the sorry the play can see within
 

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.180
your the sorry the play can see within
people within their circles that have

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.190
people within their circles that have
 

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.160
people within their circles that have
been competing and also the entire

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.170
been competing and also the entire
 

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.830
been competing and also the entire
public leaderboard so this gives me a

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:48.840
public leaderboard so this gives me a
 

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.570
public leaderboard so this gives me a
chance to compete in multiple different

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:50.580
chance to compete in multiple different
 

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.220
chance to compete in multiple different
ways within your game so integrate

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.230
ways within your game so integrate
 

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.710
ways within your game so integrate
leaderboards all right that sound sounds

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720
leaderboards all right that sound sounds
 

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.110
leaderboards all right that sound sounds
good and so I was going to say I mean we

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120
good and so I was going to say I mean we
 

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.120
good and so I was going to say I mean we
provide the ability for developers to

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.130
provide the ability for developers to
 

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.710
provide the ability for developers to
show leaderboards in their games already

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720
show leaderboards in their games already
 

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.110
show leaderboards in their games already
but I suppose the advantage here is I

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120
but I suppose the advantage here is I
 

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.090
but I suppose the advantage here is I
don't need to go and install the game

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100
