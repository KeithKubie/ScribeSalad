00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.860
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Welcome to our first program

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.140
of the NASA Series in 2018.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.850
We are in our 12th season.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.980
So were pretty excited about
that, and we're just going

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.330
to keep on going as long as
NASA has things to tell us,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.410
and they never run out.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.470
So we have seven lectures
planned this year,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.440
and you can always check our
website for the upcoming ones.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.290
We'll have one in
April, late April.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.600
I have no idea what it is, but
anyway, I'm Stephanie Marcus

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.480
from the Science, Technology,
and Business Division,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.890
and with Shawn, who
is out at the table,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.480
we coordinate this series.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.180
Our first speaker,
Jonathan Gardner,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.630
from NASA Goddard is the
perfect person to talk to us

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.670
about space telescopes.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.960
He's been involved with them
since his undergraduate days.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.020
When he was at Harvard, he spent
a couple of summers working

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.050
on a camera for the
Spitzer space telescope,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.930
and then he went on
to do graduate studies

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.480
at the University of Hawaii,
which ain't all that bad.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.380
We wish we were there today,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830
and then he had a
fellowship in England.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.970
So after that, he came back
to NASA and did some work

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
on the camera for the Hubble,
which was placed on the Hubble,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.440
and he has been involved
with the James Webb telescope

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.830
since its early days, and now,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.980
he is the Deputy Senior Project
Scientist for the James Webb.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.950
So without further ado, let's
welcome him, and we'll go

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.140
through a lot of history and the
future of the space telescopes.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.940
Thank you.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.680
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.070
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: Thank you.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.820
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.630
It's one of the biggest
stories there is.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.070
It started 13.8 billion
years ago with the Big Bang.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.880
The initial formation of
all of the matter, energy,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.490
and structure that
makes up the universe.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.850
The Big Bang started out
very hot and very dense,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.690
but it was not perfectly
uniform.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.090
There were some places
in the universe

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.280
that were slightly hotter and
slightly denser than others,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.100
and those places started to
build up over time, get larger

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.500
and larger through the forces of
gravity, to form the first stars

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.560
and galaxies in the
early universe.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.390
Those galaxies merged together
to become the largest spiral

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.710
and elliptical galaxies
that we see today,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.640
and one of those galaxies
is our own Milky Way.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.110
Within the galaxies and within
our Milky Way, stars continue

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.740
to form with their planets,
their planetary systems,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.970
and in some of those
planetary systems,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.070
there are small,
the rocky planets.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.470
At least one that we know of
has liquid water on the surface.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.560
That planet has life
and intelligence.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.700
So how do we know all this?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.390
Well, starting just
over 400 years ago,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.340
Galileo first took a telescope
and pointed it at the sky,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.020
and he discovered that the
moon has mountains on it.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.760
He found that Venus has phases
like our moon, and he found

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.980
that Jupiter has
moons of its own.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.970
All of this lent support
to the theory of Copernicus

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.060
that we are not actually at
the center of our universe

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.390
but are in a typical place.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.750
His -- Galileo's telescope
gave him a factor of about 60

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.930
in ability to observe the
sky over the human eye.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.370
William Herschel,
about 150 years later,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.220
used a 49-inch-diameter
telescope,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.930
much more sophisticated than
Galileo's hand-held telescope,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.260
and he discovered
the planet Uranus.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.300
He discovered moons in the outer
solar system, and he mapped the,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.310
what he called, the
spiral nebulae.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.230
His telescope, 49 inches in
diameter, gave him a factor

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.280
of 500 in observing power
over Galileo's telescope.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.060
Edwin Hubble, the
astronomer, not the telescope,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.890
was working in the early
part of the 20th century,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.150
and he had a 100-inch telescope
on Mount Wilson in California,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.050
and Hubble's telescope had
an additional advantage

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.250
over Herschel and Galileo.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.050
The new science of photography
allowed him to store up light

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.050
over time and take longer
exposures than simply looking

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.410
through the eyepiece
of the telescope.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.440
That also allowed him to show
the results that he was getting

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.440
to other scientists, who
were not at the telescope,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.160
and using this telescope,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.890
Hubble further studied the
spiral nebulae and was able

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.490
to measure distances to
these nebulae and determined

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.780
that they were galaxies
like our Milky Way

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.950
but outside of our Milky Way.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.030
In this way, Hubble essentially
discovered the universe

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.670
as we know it today.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.470
He also was able to measure both
the distances and the velocities

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.070
of these galaxies and
found that everything

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.200
in the universe is moving
away from everything else.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.940
In this way, he found that the
universe is expanding over time,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.950
and if you kind of roll the
camera backwards in time,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.590
you see that that leads you to
a beginning to the universe,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.960
which we now call the Big Bang.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.380
Hubble's telescope

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.310
and photography gave him
an additional factor of 30

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.230
over Herschel's telescope.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.310
In 1990, we launched the Hubble
space telescope into space,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.440
and over the last 25 years,
we have sent astronauts

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.760
up five times to
upgrade the cameras

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.610
and to fix anything
that went wrong.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.440
By putting the telescope into
space above the atmosphere,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.520
we were able to get
a factor of 10,000,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.610
and that factor also includes
advanced electronic detectors,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.450
just like you have in
your phone right now.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.240
These advanced detectors
give much more sensitivity

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.500
over the techniques
of photography.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.150
So if you asked the question
how you win at astronomy, well,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.780
this is a logarithmic plot
of these factors over time,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.880
starting with Galileo's factor
of 60 over the human eye,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.220
going up to William
Herschel's 49-inch telescope,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.070
and here we start to
bring in photography

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.730
and then charge-coupled
devices, electronic detectors,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.760
and then the launch of
the Hubble space telescope

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.500
into orbit at the end
of the 20th century.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.430
So the Hubble space telescope
with its factor of 10,000

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:50.170
over Hubble's telescope,
combined with 8

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.760
to 10 meter diameter telescopes
on the ground and the power

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.260
of supercomputers

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.800
to do theoretical modeling
have all led to a revolution

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.230
in astronomy over the
last 25 years or so.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.580
So when you talk to astronomers,
they use three words.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.950
We now know.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:17.560
And the reason that astronomers
now will say we now know,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.480
instead of just we know, it's
because most of us working

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.530
in the field can remember when
we didn't know these things.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.750
When I was in graduate school,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.830
we didn't have proof
of the Big Bang.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.240
We didn't know the
age of the universe.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.340
We didn't know about dark
matter and dark energy.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.770
We had not detected
gravitational waves,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.480
although they were predicted.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.970
We didn't know of any planets
around other stars, even though,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.410
again, we were expecting them.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.230
The outer solar system
had not been mapped,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.720
and there was no evidence
for water on Mars,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.290
or at least not liquid
water on Mars.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.400
So these are all things that
have been discovered since I was

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.370
in graduate school in the
1980s, and I'm going to take you

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.070
through a few of
these discoveries,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.700
sort of a greatest hits
of space telescopes

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.740
over the last 20-25 years.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.970
So one of the important
discoveries

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:26.100
about the universe is that
95% of the mass and energy

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.560
in the universe is not
on the periodic table,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.440
and this was discovered 20 years
ago in 1998 using supernovae,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.680
a kind of exploding star,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.630
as a way of getting
distances to faraway galaxies.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.640
There are several
kinds of supernovae,

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.810
but one in particular happens
when a white dwarf star,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.850
a star about the size of
the earth, a collapsed star,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.560
is accreting material
from a companion star.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.120
So gas from a companion star
in a binary system is falling

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.300
onto the white dwarf, and it
keeps accreting more material

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.840
until it reaches
a critical mass.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.990
That is the mass at which
it can no longer hold itself

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.450
up against gravity.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.010
White dwarf stars are held
up by electrons and protons,

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.160
and if you squish the electrons
and protons together enough,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.420
they turn into neutrons.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.300
A neutron star is the size
of the District of Columbia,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.520
about 10 miles in diameter.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.850
So this star goes from the size
of the earth down to the size

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.810
of DC and releases a
huge amount of energy

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.320
as a big explosion,
a big flash of light.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.690
But the interesting thing
about this type of supernova is

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.770
that it always happens
at the same mass.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.330
It keeps accreting material

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.550
until it reaches this
critical mass at which,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.110
and then it explodes, and then

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.660
because it's always the
same size when it explodes,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.950
it always ends up to be
about the same brightness

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.520
with the explosion,
and by looking

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.990
at how bright the
explosion appears to us,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.710
and we know how bright
it actually is,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.880
that gives us the distance
to these supernovae.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.240
And they're bright enough, they
outshine, for a few days anyway,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.370
they outshine every other
star in their galaxy,

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.900
and we can see these
to great distances.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.280
So 20 years ago, in 1998,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.080
astronomers mapping
the expansion history

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.850
of the universe found that
the expansion was accelerating

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.440
and not as expected
decelerating,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.740
slowing down, due to gravity.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:51.490
That led astronomers to propose
that there was a dark energy

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.000
that filled the spaces
between galaxies that's pushing

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.020
on the expansion and
causing the expansion

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.400
of the universe to accelerate.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.060
Along with dark matter, which is
material that is not electrons,

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.440
protons, and neutrons, but is
some sort of exotic material,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.660
that means that 95% of
the mass and the energy

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.940
in the universe is not actually
normal matter that makes up gas,

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.590
stars, galaxies,
planets, people,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:36.410
etc. Gravitational waves,
ripples in the space-time

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.620
that make up the universe, were
predicted by Einstein's theory,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.970
but they are, although they
carry a large amount of energy,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.660
they are so tenuous that they're
very, very difficult to detect,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.720
but just about almost
2 years ago,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.530
the LIGO experiment first
detected the gravitational waves

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.970
from a pair of merging
black holes.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.340
So into black holes
collide, they merge together,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.310
and there's so much energy that
it puts out gravitational waves.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:16.070
A bit less than a year ago,
the LIGO experiment combined

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:21.140
with a similar gravitational
wave telescope in Europe,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.970
detected the merging
of two neutron stars,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.560
and these two neutron stars,
when they merge together,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.000
they put out a lot of light,
which was then detected

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.800
by our space telescopes, by
the Hubble space telescope,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.930
the Fermi gamma ray
telescope, and so forth.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.730
This was the dawn of what we
call multi-messenger astronomy.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.160
Previously, astronomers
only used light,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.740
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:55.240
Light waves are waves seen in
electric and magnetic fields.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.730
We now have an additional
technique that we can use,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:07.520
gravitational waves in the
very structure of space time.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.530
Extrasolar planets were
first discovered --

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.740
normal extrasolar planets
were first discovered in 1995,

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:21.550
and over the past 20 years, we
have found several thousand,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.690
including with space telescopes,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.750
and one of the very powerful
techniques that we could use

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.230
to study these planets is
with the planet transits

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.560
across the face of its
host star, and basically,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.360
that just means when
they line up.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.720
So the planet goes between
the star and our telescope.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.410
And so, light from the star
will go through the atmosphere

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.550
of the planet, be
changed a little bit,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.600
and our telescopes can
detect those changes

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.040
and measure the constituents
of the atmospheres

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.180
of these extrasolar planets.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.910
A very exciting technique
that will get

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:09.650
to be more exciting
in the time to come.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.890
So about two years ago, there
was a discovery of a system

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:20.750
of seven rocky planets, all
transiting their host star,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.860
and this system is
one of the best cases

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.910
that we have right now for
studying the atmospheres

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.660
of these planets and looking
for things like do any

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.920
of them actually have liquid
water on their surface?

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.690
Do they have things like
oxygen in the atmosphere?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:47.680
Our outer solar system, when
I was in graduate school,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.690
consisted of Pluto, which we
called planet at that time.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.190
Since then, we discovered
what's called the Kuiper Belt,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.870
which is a large number
of small, rocky bodies,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.080
rocky or ice planets, that
we now call dwarf planets,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.180
of which Pluto is
just one example.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.720
That decision to call these
dwarf planets was made

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.720
with the discovery of Eris,
which is actually larger

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.600
than Pluto, and that triggered
the political discussion

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.900
of what we call them.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.320
Didn't change what Pluto is.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.060
It's just what we call it.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.680
And the outer solar
system is the repository

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.820
of the pristine material
that formed our solar system.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.950
So by studying these bodies
out there, these dwarf planets

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.570
out there, we can
determine how our --

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.780
how the planets in our
solar system formed.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.190
And the ongoing exploration
of Mars has shown

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.330
that while it's been
known for a long time

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.880
that Mars has frozen
water on its surface,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.850
we now have evidence that there
was liquid water is recently

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.230
as 50,000 years ago, which isn't

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.720
that long ago in
geological time.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.730
So the surface of Mars,
at times in the past,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.310
could well have had oceans and
lakes, and we have some tenuous,

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.340
ambiguous evidence that
possibly there are things

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.870
like mudslides currently
happening on Mars.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:31.840
So one of the very interesting
questions that we would

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.160
like to study is how
did galaxies form

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.730
in the early universe,
the first stars

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:45.940
and galaxies formed
after the Big Bang?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.140
And the technique that
we've used with Hubble

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:54.750
to study early galaxies and the
early history of the universe is

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.520
to take a picture, and this
is the faintest picture

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.210
that humankind has ever made.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.960
We took Hubble, and
we pointed it

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:12.010
at what is essentially a blank
part of the sky and just stored

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:17.600
up the light over hundreds of
hours, a bit more than a month,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.260
and then, follow up have brought
the total investment of time

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.770
into this image is
now approaching a year

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.530
of Hubble time.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:37.990
In this image, almost everything
you see is a galaxy outside

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.290
of our own.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.330
There are only about
a little bit less

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.140
than half a dozen stars.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.910
So everything else you see in
the image is a distant galaxy.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.560
And some of those galaxies
are relatively nearby,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.660
with light that are -- the light

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.780
from those galaxies have been
traveling through over time

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.100
to get to us, and so, as we look
at galaxies that are further

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.050
and further away, we're seeing
light that was emitted a longer

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:17.040
and longer a time ago, and some
of them, the fairly bigger ones,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:24.180
are about a billion light-years
away, but some of the galaxies

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.510
in the picture, the very
faintest ones, can be as much

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:36.190
as -- will have emitted
their light at less

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.470
than a billion years
after the Big Bang.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.530
So we're looking back almost
13 billion years in time

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.800
over the history of the
universe when we look

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.230
at these very faint,
distant galaxies.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.460
And this is -- the
biggest investment of time

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.920
with the Hubble space telescope
was in this experiment,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.240
looking for the very early
history of the universe.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.230
And one of the interesting
things that we found was

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.790
that when we study these very
distant galaxies in detail,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.600
some of them are actually
several hundred million

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.900
years old.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.880
So this is several
hundred million years old

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.760
at just 1 billion years
after the Big Bang.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.150
And this is the faintest
that Hubble can go.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.180
So if we want to go
further back in time,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.920
we need to find galaxies
that are even more distant,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.250
and catch them at the point
where they are first starting

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.000
to form, first starting
to form their stars.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.200
This has led us to decide

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.720
that we need a --
oops, just a minute.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.080
That we need a telescope
that is bigger than Hubble

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.440
that can collect more light
and see more fainter galaxies,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.330
more distant galaxies.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.630
But there's another aspect of
these very distant galaxies,

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.410
and that is, as the light is
traveling from the galaxy to us,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:17.060
through the expanding
universe, the light is stretched

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.510
out by the expansion of
the universe over time,

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.110
so that light that is
emitted as visible light

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.830
or ultraviolet light has been
stretched out so that it appears

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.780
to us in the infrared.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.730
Infrared light was discovered
by William Herschel, as well,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.640
when he took sunlight,
broke it up with a prism,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.760
and showed that a thermometer
here beyond the red would start

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.230
to heat up.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.100
Infrared light is just
like visible light,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.530
but with longer wavelengths,
but it's also what happens

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:02.350
when you've got -- when
something is at a temperature,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.430
it's got a temperature
associated with it.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.600
Now most of the sun's energy
that reaches the surface

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.690
of the earth as visible light.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.330
That's not a coincidence.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.290
We evolved to be able to see
the light from our primary star.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:24.490
But infrared is heat, and here
are a few infrared pictures.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:29.340
First of all, there's a picture
of a man holding a lit match.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.330
So the brightest part of this
infrared picture is the flame

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.770
of the match.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.800
The coolest part is the tie,
which is away from his body he,

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.120
and his glasses, which again,
are cooler than his face.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.690
This is an infrared picture of a
cat, and again, the coolest part

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.560
of the picture is the cats fur.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.870
It's a good insulator, but the
eyes and the mouth are close

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.220
to the inside of the cat's body.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:03.140
So they're the warmest parts,
brightest in the infrared.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.380
You might be wondering what
the third picture is down here.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.050
Well, this is actually visible
light picture of a floor

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.030
where somebody used to be
standing, but they walked away,

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.900
but when we look
in infrared light,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.450
we see that the person's
feet has heated up the floor,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.370
left infrared picture behind.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.810
So, in order to see these
very distant galaxies

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.470
that the first galaxies to
form in the early universe,

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.810
we not only need a telescope
that is bigger than Hubble,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.220
but we also need a telescope
that can work in the infrared.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.620
So going back to how we
win at astronomy, well,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.820
the answer is big telescopes
with sensitive detectors

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.190
in space, and that has led us

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.920
to build the James
Webb space telescope,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.280
providing an additional factor
of 100 over the capabilities

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.690
of the Hubble space telescope.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.800
Webb is the successor to Hubble.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.220
Successor is not
the replacement.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.190
We'd love to have them
both working together,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.850
and it looks like
we can do that.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.060
But the James Webb space
telescope will be a large,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:27.290
cold telescope in space, and
I'll be telling you about that

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.960
in the rest of this talk.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:35.640
So the first science
idea we had for this,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.620
for what should be the
successor to Hubble,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.760
was to find the first
galaxies that formed

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.530
in the early universe.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.170
That's what we call
the study of origins,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.810
because beginnings
are very important

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.130
when you have the
way something starts

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:03.690
out can tell you the initial
conditions for changes

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.870
over time, but in things
that are complex, like babies

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.900
and galaxies, studying
those actual changes

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.610
over time are also
very important,

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.060
and that's what we
call evolution.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.220
So the science of web is the
beginnings, or the origins,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.080
in evolution of galaxies.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.860
So pictures like the
Hubble ultradeep field,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.900
we will do with the James Webb
space telescope going fainter

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.880
and into the infrared, to find
the first galaxies that formed

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.360
in the early universe.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.320
We will then trace
those galaxies over time

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.300
to see the formation of the
spiral and elliptical galaxies

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.470
that we see today, spiral
galaxies like our own Milky Way.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.380
It turns out that a large
infrared telescope is also very

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.250
good at studying the formation
of stars within our own galaxy.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.640
So that's what we have here.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.840
Stars form in clouds of gas
and dust, and when stars form,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.090
they also form planets,
and the study of planets,

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:22.340
both around other stars and
planets in our own solar system,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:28.080
can tell us about the conditions
that might make it possible

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.450
for life to develop
on those planets.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.810
So going through
these one by one,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.280
looking at supercomputer
simulations,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.130
this is a simulation of the
formation of the first galaxies.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.990
The universe started
very dense and very hot,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.900
but in some places, it
was slightly more dense,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:57.470
and in those over-dense places,
the material started to fall in,

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.100
both dark matter and then,
eventually, the ordinary gas

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.760
of the hydrogen and
helium that was formed

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.580
in the Big Bang started
to fall in.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:13.220
Eventually, those clouds of
gas formed the first stars,

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.560
and that's what we call
the first galaxies.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.560
They started out, actually,
fairly small, and then built

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:25.030
up over time as galaxies
merged together.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.970
Many galaxies today
live in groups.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.590
This group of four galaxies,
and you can see the difference

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:36.300
between the spiral galaxies and
elliptical galaxy down here.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.270
In these groups of galaxies, or
in bigger clusters of galaxies,

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.990
galaxies do collide
with each other,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.420
and when two large galaxies
collide, they don't collide

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.190
in the way that cars collide.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.540
They don't go bang.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.790
They kind of go slosh,
because most of the space

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.670
in a galaxy is empty space.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.700
The stars that make up
the galaxy are very small

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.790
in comparison to the distances
between the stars, and so,

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.840
two colliding spiral galaxies,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.530
as you see in this
supercomputer simulations,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.070
will slosh together,
interacting through gravity.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.070
The gas will interact a
little bit through pressure,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.460
but mostly, it's all gravity,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:34.230
and as the spiral galaxies
collide, they get mixed up.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.760
They lose their spiral
structure,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.850
and the end result is
something that looks a lot

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.210
like an elliptical galaxy.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:50.260
Again, within galaxies,
the stars will form, and,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.970
particularly after the
first generation of stars,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.830
the primordial gas
of mostly hydrogen

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.390
and helium has been
processed through starts

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.810
and through supernova exploding
stars, return to the gases

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.750
between the stars, and
the heavier elements have

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.050
been formed.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.940
And those elements become dust.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.990
When a star forms in the
center of a rotating cloud,

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.530
the material out in the outside

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:31.080
of the clouds will
gather together and,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.760
through gravity, and
form the planets.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.020
The small, rocky planets
we think are formed closer

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:45.140
to the stars, and the gas
giants are formed further out,

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.460
along with the ices.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:54.230
After the planets first form,
sometimes there are planets

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:59.230
that are in very similar
orbits near to each other,

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.940
and we see evidence
for giant collisions

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.590
in some solar systems.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.770
This is also the leading theory

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.330
for the formation
of our own moon.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.350
The early Earth, shortly
after it formed, was impacted

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:25.650
by another planet about the
size of Mars that kicked

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.390
up a huge cloud of dust that
filled the whole solar system,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.100
and we see other solar systems

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.860
that have these giant
dust clouds.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:41.280
The material was knocked away
from the earth, and reformed

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.480
to be the moon, and
the Earth formed again

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.190
from what was left over.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:53.160
So all of these are --
so that's another one

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.590
of these we now know,
and some of the evidence

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.020
for that actually came from
the Apollo moon landings

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.650
and the rocks they brought back.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.290
Okay, so in comparison,
a comparison

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.110
between the Hubble
space telescope

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.810
and the James Webb space
telescope, it's successor,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.910
Hubble is a telescope that
kept at room temperature.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:20.350
We have sent astronauts up
there five times, and so,

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.640
we maintain the telescope
at room temperature,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.230
so that the astronauts
can interact with it.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.740
The James Webb space
telescope is designed

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.460
to detect infrared
light, and the problem

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.850
with a telescope designed
to detect infrared light is

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.010
that the telescope itself
will be glowing if it's

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.320
at room temperature,
and that applies both

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.660
to the Hubble space
telescope and also

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.810
to the all the telescopes
on the ground.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.890
They are all glowing
in infrared light.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:57.690
So in order to make the James
Webb space telescope cold enough

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.180
to detect infrared light,
we are going to cool it

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.460
down to 225 degrees
below zero Celsius.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.320
That's minus 370 Fahrenheit,
or about 50 degrees

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.120
above absolute zero temperature.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.080
And we do this by putting the
telescope behind a tennis court

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.390
-sized five layers sun shield.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:29.370
This is one of the layers of
the sun shield being built up.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.300
Hubble is in what we
call low Earth orbit.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.200
It's 375 miles above the
surface of the earth.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.040
It goes around the earth
once every 90 minutes,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.090
but the James Webb space
telescope is going a million

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.570
miles away.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.950
It will be launched
on an Ariane-5 rocket.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.080
This is a European-launched
vehicle and is provided as part

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.390
of the European contribution

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.940
to the James Webb
telescope mission.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:08.430
Webb is a joint project of
NASA, the European Space Agency,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.700
and the Canadian Space Agency.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.760
So Europe is providing
the launch,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.350
and it will be going
a million miles away

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:20.760
to a special orbit called
the second Lagrange point.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.390
The second Lagrange
point, as the Earth goes

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.550
around the sun once per year,
the second Lagrange point goes

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.940
around the earth once per year,
keeping the sun and the Earth

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.640
and the telescope all in a line.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.670
So that we can have both the sun
and the earth on the warm side

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:47.760
of the sun shield, while the
telescope is on the cold side,

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.010
cooling down to 225
degrees below zero.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.550
As I said, we want to have
a telescope that's bigger

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.950
than Hubble, so that it
can collect more light,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.700
see more distant galaxies,

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.510
and looked further
backwards in time.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:10.340
So Hubble's primary
mirror is 2.4 meters.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.880
That's just about like that big.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.260
Webb is 6.5 meters, which is
about the size of this room.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.450
Now as I said, Webb will be
launched on an Ariane-5 rocket,

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:29.040
and the diameter of the Ariane-5
is 5 meters, which brings

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.170
up the question, how do
you fit a 6.5-meter mere

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.010
into a 5-meter rocket.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:39.160
Well, the answer
is a fold it up.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:44.620
So here's a picture, animation,
of what Webb will look

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.360
like after it launches.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.580
It's launched all folded
up, and we will unfold it

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.950
in about the first two
weeks after launch.

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:59.900
So the first thing that
comes out is the solar panels

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.430
to provide power and the
communication antenna,

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.460
and then we'll start to unfold
this tennis-court-sized,

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.310
five-layer plastic sun shield.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.910
The sun shield is launched
within these covers.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:20.650
We fold those back, and we start
to pull out the sun shield.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:25.130
The sun shield is made of
plastic material called Kapton,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.900
and each side of it
is actually different,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.670
but the side facing the sun
is very highly reflective

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.870
to reflect the sunlight away.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.330
The five layers are each about
a foot, a little bit more

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.480
than a foot apart, and of
course, this is in vacuum.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.700
So this works like a
giant vacuum flask,

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.520
where the heat can escape

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.010
between the layers
of the sun shield.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.500
Each layer is colder as
you get to the telescope.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.490
The last two deployments
are the secondary mirror

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.500
on its support structure,
and then the two side wings

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.220
of the primary mirror
are folded out.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.670
The mirror itself,
the primary mirror,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.120
is made up of 18
mirror segments.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.670
They're each made of beryllium,
which is a very light weight,

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.330
stiff material, metal,
and you're coated in gold,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.690
which is highly reflective
of infrared light.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.540
You can see each of these
mirror segments is a hexagon,

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.500
so that we can tile
them together,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.850
and it's 1.3 meters
across each segment.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.930
We installed 18 mirror segments

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.400
onto this backplane
support structure,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.620
and I'll show you
how we did that.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.420
This was done at the
Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.950
a little bit less
than two years ago.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:01.970
We used a robotic arm to place
each of the mirror segments

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:08.830
onto the backplane, and then
the technicians attached it.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.700
While we were doing
this, for protection,

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:18.480
we had these black protective
covers on the mirror segments.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.010
And...

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:31.160
This process has been completed,
and then when it was all done,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.340
we took the protective
covers off,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.900
revealing the gold
mirror surfaces.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.080
Here's a picture of the
telescope itself, again.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:49.350
In the Goddard Clean Room,
we have a viewing window,

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:55.190
and that need a good
opportunity for selfies.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.460
Here is the Senior
Project Scientist for Webb,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.760
Dr. John Mather, Nobel Laureate.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.640
He won the Nobel
Prize, essentially,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.730
for proving the Big Bang.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.950
I'm his deputy on this project.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.660
I wasn't actually there
when they did this,

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.190
when they scanned the mirror
across, but I was able

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:21.280
to have a picture of myself
taken with the mirror,

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.000
and this is probably the
coolest selfie I will ever take,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.970
of myself reflected

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:33.600
in a multibillion-dollar
gold-coated space

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.030
telescope mirror.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.560
This is a very cool
picture, as well.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.950
This is done within the clean
room, the technicians who worked

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:47.420
on the mirror, and reflected
in the mirror is the NASA logo

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.460
from the back wall, and one
of the interesting things

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.850
that you can see is that
this is not a flat mirror

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.960
like you have in your bathroom.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.440
It is actually a lens
to focus the light.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.300
And so, they were able
to line up the NASA logo

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.870
to fill the whole mirror.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:13.410
On back of the telescope,
we have four cameras.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:18.020
Each has a different capability,
including taking pictures

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:23.140
in visible light
and infrared light.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.660
Webb is capable of detecting the
redder colors of visible light.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.590
It stops at gold color,
because the gold itself absorbs

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.370
everything bluer than that.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:41.070
And it works out into
the mid-infrared.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.210
These cameras were
installed together

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.520
into a structure
seen right here,

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.490
and this shows the installation
of the camera package

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:56.570
into the back of the
mirror, which is upside down.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:01.470
So the mirror is pointed
down in that structure.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.570
Again, this was done
in the clean room

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.590
at the Goddard Space Flight
Center up in Greenbelt.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.560
And you can see, again,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.070
the viewing window had
lots of people in it.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:19.790
I actually arrived to watch
this just right at the very end.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.410
You can't see me in the video,
because the camera moves right

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.410
at about the time
that I arrived.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:35.550
You can see that there's
a lot of people involved.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.870
There's both the people who are
doing the work and the people

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.700
who are watching to make
sure everything is done,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.460
the quality assurance
and safety people.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.090
So right at about this
point is when I arrived,

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.790
and I was able to
watch it go in.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.250
Okay, and the sun
shield is fully assembled

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.290
and installed onto
the spacecraft.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:07.400
We now have the Webb
telescope is,

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.160
or the observatory,
is now in two pieces.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.760
We have the spacecraft and
the sun shield fully done

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.180
and current undergoing testing.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.780
We have the telescope and the
instrument package were tested

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:28.960
at the Johnson Space
Flight Center last fall.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.660
They were there during
the hurricane.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:37.600
Both the equipment and
the people were okay.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.430
It was kind of exciting
time for them.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:45.480
So this is the vacuum chamber

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.950
where we tested the
telescope and instruments.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.720
It was actually built
for the Apollo program

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.770
and is human rated.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.490
So the astronauts
practiced walking on the moon

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:01.510
in their spacesuits inside
this chamber back in the 60s.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.990
The Webb project took out the
simulated lunar surface and put

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:11.890
in a inner what's called
a shroud that is cooled

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:16.190
with liquid helium to get
down to the cold temperatures

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:20.660
to test Webb, and here's
a picture of the telescope

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.810
after that test, which
lasted three months

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.640
when it was complete.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.300
Moving this large
telescope around,

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.950
we have a special
shipping container.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:38.100
We actually, to go from Goddard
to the Johnson Space Center,

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.720
we actually took the
telescope on the Beltway.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.080
It goes at a maximum speed of
about seven miles per hour,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.620
which made it very popular
with the people who were

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.300
on the Beltway at that
time, but we do this

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.760
in the middle of the night.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.580
So it went from Goddard
to Andrews Air Force Base,

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.240
then flew on this
C5 cargo plane.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.740
We put the whole truck,
including the cab,

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.430
inside the plane and
flew down to Houston.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:18.050
This shows how we drive it
around, going very slowly,

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:23.550
to make sure that it doesn't
bump too much, and you can see,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.570
again, 4 a.m. Then taking it

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:35.510
on the roads is an interesting
thing, because it's so big.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.580
You can see that we have
a crane here that pulled

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.190
up the street lights to
get them out of the way

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.740
as we drove it around.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.780
So the telescope now has been --

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.420
was completed the test
in Houston and was flown

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:55.750
to the Northrop Grumman
facility in Los Angeles,

00:43:55.750 --> 00:44:01.370
where we're building the
spacecraft and sun shield.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:07.040
Oops. And so, now we have all
of the parts of the observatory

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.720
in the same clean room.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.250
Here it is arriving
in Los Angeles.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.620
Again, the telescope with
the side wings folded up.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.990
The instrument package is in the
inside, and you can see the rest

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.260
of the primary mirror here
on the bottom, and then,

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:29.390
this is the sun shield in
its launch configuration.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.120
So it's all folded up with the
protective coating around it.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.650
The spacecraft, which
maintains position in its orbit,

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:43.620
is down here, and this structure
is a simulation, or a mass model

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.410
of this, and we're still going
to be doing some more testing

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.880
of the space craft and
sun shield, and then,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.100
towards the end of
this calendar year,

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.130
we'll put the two together,
do some final testing,

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.530
and then we're ready for launch.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:07.230
Launch, as I said, is from South
America, Carew, French Guiana,

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.540
and after this is
all put together,

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.440
it becomes too big
to fly in that C5.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.040
So we're going to go by boat
through the Panama Canal.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.690
So, if you would
like to learn more

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.220
about the James Webb space
telescope, we have a website,

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.790
of course, JWST.NASA.gov.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.170
A constant stream of news.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:36.190
You can see down here the latest
news is this talk, but we also,

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:41.240
whenever we make any progress,
we put it out on the website.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.400
We have Facebook
accounts, Twitter feeds,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.800
and other social media.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:53.320
So stop in and keep
tabs on how we're doing.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.680
Here's a picture of
a couple of our fans.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.600
You can see, on the set of the
Big Bang theory, we got a model

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.130
of JWST back here and
some of our pictures.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:10.950
Webb was designed to study some
age-old questions that date back

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.600
to the beginning of humanity.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.030
Where did it all come from?

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.960
What are the origins?

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.040
What are the changes over time?

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.750
What is the process that went

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:25.200
from the Big Bang 13.8 billion
years ago to the formation

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.130
of galaxies, stars, planets,
and life and intelligence,

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.820
where did it all come from?

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.020
So I'd like to thank
you for your attention.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:40.040
I'm going to leave you with
one quote from somebody

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.780
who inspired me when I was
the age of the children

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.060
in high school, Carl Sagan.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.050
He said, "Somewhere something
incredible is waiting

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.530
to be known."

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.830
So thank you for your attention.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.510
I'd be happy to take questions.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:47:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.060
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Thank you so much.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.380
We now know a little bit
more, and it's kind of fun

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.880
to go behind the scenes to
see this all put together.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.200
So please ask your questions,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.360
and he will repeat them
so everyone can hear.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.660
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: Okay.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.960
&gt;&gt; So why is it being
launched in the South America?

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.260
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner:

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.060
The question is why is it being
launched in South America?

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:23.240
So the decision to use the
European launch was part

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.760
of the early negotiations
for what --

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.120
in putting together
the partnership.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.420
It's not that the US
doesn't have launch vehicles,

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.940
but that was what was worked
out that they would contribute.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.410
So where do you want to
put your launch site?

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.850
It's good to be on a coast,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:46.270
so that you can launch
it over the ocean.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.470
It's good to be on the East
Coast, so that as you launch it

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.840
over the ocean, you
get an additional boost

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.100
from the spinning of the earth.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.630
You launch it over
the ocean just

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:00.930
in case something goes wrong.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.000
You know, if pieces fall down.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.300
They go in the ocean.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.770
But you want to launch East,
heading east, so launch is

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.970
on the East Coast, and
additionally, particularly

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:16.620
if you're going into deep space,
you want to launch as close

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.090
to the equator as you can.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.590
So the US primary launch
site is in Florida.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.580
Again, it's south, so
it's close to the equator.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.190
It's on the East Coast,
and the launches go

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.720
out over the Atlantic Ocean.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.900
The European launch site
is in French Guiana.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.040
French Guiana is
a part of France.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.090
It is as much a part of France

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.890
as Hawaii is a part
of the United States.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:49.810
So they have the infrastructure
of being part of France

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.720
in a place that is
on the East Coast

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.080
of the continent and
near the equator.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.990
Question?

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:00.550
&gt;&gt; How many extra panel segments
to have to make as backup?

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.470
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: How many
extra panel segments did we make

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:04.770
as a backup?

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:10.390
So there are 18 and
the telescope,

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.920
and because a hexagon
has six-fold symmetry,

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.510
that means there are
three different kinds

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:22.900
of those -- in those
18 segments.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.570
Essentially, we call
it prescriptions.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.730
So three different
optical prescriptions,

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:32.890
and those are then
repeated six times to make

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.270
up the primary mirror.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:38.300
So we have three spares, one
of each optical prescription.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.000
&gt;&gt; What is the anticipated
life of the Webb telescope?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.540
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: What is
the life of the Webb telescope?

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.890
So the lifetime is
limited by one thing

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.300
that we use up, and
that is fuel.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.360
We need to use fuel to
maintain its position in --

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.590
it's actually in orbit
around the L2 point,

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.050
not right at the L2 point.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.030
So to maintain that
position in orbit,

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:10.750
we need to fire the rockets
about every two weeks or so.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:15.540
In addition, the sun
shield acts as a solar sail,

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.710
and the telescope can build up
angular momentum, which we store

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.550
in reaction wheels, and we also
need to use the fuel to get rid

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.900
of that angular momentum.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.270
A telescope like Hubble
is in low-Earth orbit.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:35.250
It uses the Earth's
magnetic field to get rid

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:40.080
of angular momentum, but with
Webb, we don't have that.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.380
So we need fuel.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.130
So we to have fuel.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.940
Fuel is the ultimate
limiter of the lifetime,

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.210
and we have 10 years
of fuel on board.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.700
There's some margin in that.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.900
So we have a bit extra, and we
actually use a lot of our fuel,

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:05.080
of our on-board fuel, to do
the final orbit insertion

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.440
after launch.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.300
So if launch goes well,
we have extra fuel

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.800
that we could use for lifetime.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.150
But there's a 10-year
requirement for lifetime.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.460
We also, the other thing

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.010
that limits lifetime
can limit lifetime is

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.660
if something goes
wrong, and we mitigate

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.400
that by doing lifetime testing.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:34.780
So we will take an exact copy
of our mechanisms and run them

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.280
through however long,
however many times we expect

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.270
to use during the mission.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.620
And we're actually doing
lifetime testing for five years,

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.300
because that's a very
expensive thing to do,

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:53.380
to ensure that parts will last
and keep working for 10 years.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:57.020
We tend to only do that if we're
sending something out to Saturn,

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.350
where it's going to take
10 years to get there.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.450
So lifetime testing
is five years,

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.780
but that's always done it
a factor of two anyway.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.270
So we expect 10 years

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:12.360
&gt;&gt; If it were to live beyond
its plan, is there a plan

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.660
for [inaudible] fuel,

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:18.070
if you found it's doing
really well after 10 years?

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.890
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: So the
question is if it's doing well

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:24.920
after 10 years and we're running
out of fuel, can we refuel it?

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.400
There's always a plan.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.260
What there isn't is funding.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:35.630
So there are people that are
looking at this, in general,

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:44.110
the servicing of space -- of
satellites, including refueling.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:49.600
Webb is not designed to be
serviced or refueled in the way

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.680
that Hubble was designed
to be serviced,

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.520
and we don't have the
capability to do that,

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.300
but 10 years is a long time.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.100
Yeah?

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:08.530
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: So the
question is what is the fuel?

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.310
It's something called hydrazine,

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.980
and I'm not a propulsion
engineer.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.560
So I'm not really
sure what that is,

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.470
but it's certainly
not nuclear, no.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:26.520
It's not a very powerful rocket.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:34.360
The fuel that we have is,
I think, 300 kilograms,

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.900
and that will last 10 years.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:42.670
So it's mostly just
doing small nudges,

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:45.470
especially once it's all
deployed, we don't want

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.500
to do very much acceleration.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.320
So it's very gentle.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.860
&gt;&gt; Is it solid?

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.530
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: It's
not a solid fuel, no.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:57.120
No, it's either liquid or gas,
and I don't know which one.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.360
Probably liquid, yeah.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.660
Yes?

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.150
&gt;&gt; Is the Hubble the
biggest and the best

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.990
in the world, the telescope?

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.290
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner:
Is Hubble the biggest

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.170
and best telescope in the world?

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.550
Well, first of all,
it's not in the world.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.640
It's above the world.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.330
It's in space.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:21.420
So Hubble, it's not the
biggest telescope we have.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.690
The biggest telescope we have is
a ground-based telescope called

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.920
the Keck telescope that's
10 meters in diameter,

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.350
and therefore, even bigger
than Webb, but by being

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:36.080
above the atmosphere, that
makes Hubble much more powerful

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.360
than telescopes that
are on the ground.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.810
There's always a
bit of a trade-off.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:46.370
To build a telescope that's in
space, going to go to space,

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:52.100
you have to make sure
that it can work remotely,

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.460
in most cases, without ever
having the chance to fix it,

00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.600
and even with Hubble, it's very,
very expensive to go and fix it.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.490
Whereas telescopes on the
ground, you put it together,

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.210
and you start it working,
and if something is wrong,

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:11.910
you just fix it, and if you have
new technology for your cameras,

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:16.690
you can just build a new camera
and put it on, and so forth.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.590
So essentially, what we do is
that we don't ever do anything

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:24.850
in space that can be
done from the ground.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:30.420
If we can do something with
a ground-based telescope,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.120
then that's going to be cheaper

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.200
than doing the same
thing in space.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.940
So space telescopes are
designed, all of them designed

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.940
to do things that we cannot
do from the ground at all.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.920
So yes, in a sense,
Hubble is the --

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.850
by a lot of ways
of measuring it,

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.170
Hubble is the most productive
telescope in history.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:56:00.300
It's the most powerful telescope
in history and has contributed

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.640
to the most discoveries,
but that's partly

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.590
because it's unique,
and likewise,

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:10.260
Webb will also be unique.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.410
It will do things that we just
cannot do from the ground.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:17.990
There are also even bigger
telescopes being built

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:24.550
on the ground, going up to 25
to 30-meter-diameter telescopes.

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.510
Those will also be
incredibly powerful,

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:31.110
particularly working
together with each

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.150
of them using their
unique capabilities.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.980
&gt;&gt; What are the plans
for a space telescope

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.880
or other telescopes
after the Webb telescope,

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.450
beyond the Webb telescope?

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:43.750
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner:
So one of the plans

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:47.230
for space telescopes after Webb?

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:52.260
Well, so getting a little
bit into scientific politics

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:56.330
for a minute, the
National Academy

00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:02.810
of Sciences holds what they call
a decadal survey every 10 years

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.960
to recommend to NASA.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.890
They make recommendations
to NASA,

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.240
the National Science Foundation,
for what to do in astronomy

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.780
and astrophysics
over the next decade,

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:21.070
and Webb was the number
one recommendation for NASA

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.430
in astronomy in the year 2000,

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.260
and that started the
project building Webb that's

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.560
now culminating.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.350
In 2010, there was
another decadal survey,

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:40.270
and the academy panel
recommended a project called the

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:44.830
wide-field infrared space
telescope, or W First.

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:49.300
This is a telescope that is the
size of Hubble but has a much,

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.800
much larger field of view, a
factor of 100 times bigger part

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:59.790
of the sky, and it will do big
surveys across the sky, aiming,

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:06.140
in particular, at three
scientific questions.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:09.330
One is what is the dark energy?

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:12.720
How can we characterize the
effects of the dark energy

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.670
on the history of the universe?

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:18.040
So in comparison to
the original discovery

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.970
of dark energy was made with
study of about 40 supernovae,

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:27.910
these particular
type of supernova.

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:34.780
Further study with W First
will have hundreds to thousands

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:38.970
of those type of supernovae,
get a much better measurement

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:43.230
and learn more about the
properties of the dark energy.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:49.080
That telescope also will
be looking at exoplanets,

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:54.940
both through a statistical
study, looking at all

00:58:54.940 --> 00:59:02.740
of the exoplanets in a region,
looking towards the center

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.230
of our galaxy, and then, also,

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.060
using a technique
called choronography,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:11.290
where it puts the spot in
front of the star and tries

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:16.810
to detect the light
from the planet itself.

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:20.390
And then, finally, because
it's a big survey telescope,

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:24.020
it's going to discover
lots of new types of things

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:32.720
that can be used for lots of
other astronomy questions.

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.090
So that was a recommendation
from the 2010 decadal survey,

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:43.370
and we're in the design
phase of that telescope.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:47.780
And then, what comes
after that will be

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.690
up to what we call the
2020 decadal survey,

00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:54.390
which is just being formed.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.410
The national Academy
is just starting

00:59:56.410 --> 01:00:00.860
to choose the members
of that committee.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.410
These decade-old surveys
are a big process.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:06.870
They asked for submissions
of white papers

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.980
from astronomers
across the country.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:17.010
They usually get about 200
suggestions of what to build.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:21.880
In the running for the next
big space telescope include a

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.890
telescope that would be
even bigger than Webb

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:28.910
and would be optimized to
study extrasolar planets,

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.320
in particular, looking at
rocky planets and trying

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.590
to find what we call biomarkers.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:45.000
So things like, for example, in
the earth's atmosphere, oh zone

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.300
and methane are in
dispute equilibrium

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.260
because of the presence
of life on earth.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:56.540
We're affecting life in general,
going from bacteria to people,

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.870
affects the atmosphere of
the earth in a way that,

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.320
if there were no life
would not be sustainable.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.360
So looking for that
kinds of things is one

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.180
of the big questions that we
need an even bigger telescope

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.460
than Webb and something
that's optimized to do that.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.460
So that's one possibility.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.250
Other possibilities

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:24.590
in the running include
a big x-ray telescope

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:32.220
to study black holes and a
gravitational wave observatory.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.770
And anyway, there's a number
of different possibilities

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:41.020
for what comes after W First.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:47.290
So we have Webb, then W First,
and then the next big thing.

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.590
Yeah?

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.420
&gt;&gt; Hubble was afflicted with
some initial aberrations

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.450
that were fixed by astronauts,
I think, in the spacewalk.

01:01:55.450 --> 01:02:01.410
Can you characterize that
force and what you do

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:04.640
to make sure there's
nothing wrong with it?

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.940
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: Right,

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.860
so the question is Hubble was
launched with some aberrations

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:13.790
on its mirror that were
fixed by the astronauts,

01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:16.210
and what are we doing with Webb?

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.740
So first of all, the
problem with Hubble was

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:24.400
that the mirror was ground,
it was shaped precisely

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.900
to the wrong prescription.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:32.030
There was a problem with the
test equipment that was --

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.580
making a highly precise
mirror is somewhat

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.080
of an iterative process.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.790
You polish it into a shape.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.380
You measure the shape.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:46.180
You polish again and go back
and forth, and with Hubble,

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.110
there was a problem
with the test equipment,

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:53.270
and so they ground it
perfectly to the wrong shape,

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.270
which meant that when the
astronauts could go up there,

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.350
they can install
a corrector lens

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:07.690
that exactly fixed the problem,
because it wasn't a, you know,

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:11.120
an error or a roughness problem.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.040
It was just the wrong shape.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.250
So one of the things
that was done with Hubble

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:20.290
to save money during
its construction was

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:24.110
that they did not do a full
end-to-end optical test

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.650
where they shine light
on the primary mirror,

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.860
all the way through
to the instruments

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.910
to measure that light.

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:34.750
That's a very expensive test.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.920
With Webb, since we
don't have a plan

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.500
for servicing, we did that test.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.330
That's what we did in Houston.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:48.760
Took three months, almost,
yeah, just a 100-day-long test.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.560
We did shine light onto
the primary mirror.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.790
It bounced into the
secondary, into the instruments,

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.410
and measured that
everything was okay.

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:03.800
During that test, the vacuum
chamber took seven tanker trucks

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.410
of liquid nitrogen per day.

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:09.890
That just kind of shows
the scale of that test.

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:13.620
There were about
50 people working.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.980
Fifty people on each shift,
and it went round-the-clock.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.410
During the hurricane, we almost
ran out of liquid nitrogen,

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:26.510
and so, the president of
the company was called,

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:30.830
and he ordered that
extra trucks would come

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:33.070
in during the hurricane.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:37.040
So this was kind of an all
hands on deck type of thing,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.560
and that testing is what will
ensure that Webb will work.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.250
Know the specific problem with
the mirror that Hubble had,

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.820
Hubble has a solid-glass mirror.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.750
Whereas Webb has the
18-mirror segments.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:57.070
Each mirror segment is
adjustable on orbit,

01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:00.230
and we plan to adjust
them about every 2

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.640
to 3 weeks during the
lifetime of the mission.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.430
We'll tweak up the positions
of those 18 mirror segments.

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:12.700
Each one of them can be
moved six different ways.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:19.220
So that's back and forth, up
and down, tipping, tilting,

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.080
and rotation that six
different degrees of freedom.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.610
We also have a thing
that can poke the back

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:28.970
and change the radius
of curvature of each

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:30.490
of the mirror segments.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.210
All of that together means
we can take out a lot

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:40.310
of the exact type of problems
that the Hubble mirror had.

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:46.170
So, but basically, Hubble
is actually an exception.

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:51.410
It was the only major NASA
space telescope, or mission,

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:56.380
that was designed to be serviced
in the way by the astronauts,

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.280
and it was designed
from the very beginning

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.230
with servicing as
part of the plan.

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:07.150
Webb, because it's going
a million miles away,

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:10.880
because it's a big,
very sloppy structure,

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.850
and because it's cryogenic.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.810
It's these ultra-cold
temperatures, all that led

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:22.740
to the decision that we would
not plan to do the servicing.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.690
That's something that kind
of goes back and forth

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:29.530
on the question of do
we plan for servicing,

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.070
and some of the future
missions they're looking

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:37.070
at servicing again,
as a possibility.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.450
Yeah?

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:44.040
&gt;&gt; It seems like a huge risk
that it's not serviceable,

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.020
and it's obviously very complex.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.820
So if there's -- it seems

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.530
like if there's the
slightest problem here,

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.950
you put all your
eggs in one basket.

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:55.360
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner:
Yeah, so the question is

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.100
that seems like a big risk.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:03.000
If there's a problem, then we
don't have a way of fixing it.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.690
So in addition to a
complex testing program

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.330
where we test everything,

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.520
we test everything
at multiple levels.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.800
So we'll get a detector,
and we test it.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.160
We put it into the camera.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.510
We test the camera.

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:25.230
We put the camera
into the structure.

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:26.530
We test that.

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:28.420
We put that together
with the telescope.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.030
We test that.

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:32.500
There's this hierarchical way

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.200
in which we are testing
everything multiple times

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.730
as we put it together.

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:41.380
So in addition to that,
we also have backups

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.920
for every credible
single-point failure.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.120
So for example, electronics.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.710
We have dual electronics,

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:54.090
and we can switch back
and forth between.

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:58.990
So if an electrical component
goes bad, we can bypass that

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:03.590
and bring the signal
around on the other side.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:08.990
All the motors, all the
mechanisms, have dual windings.

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:13.490
So we can -- we have a
backup for that, as well.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:17.660
The deployments themselves can
be done in both directions.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.960
So we do it.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.840
If it doesn't latch, we can
try again, and so forth.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.580
Essentially, yes, you're right.

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:30.510
It's risky business, but this
is what NASA normally does.

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:33.780
Hubble is the only big project

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:39.230
that was designed to
be fixed in orbit.

01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:40.530
Yeah?

01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:44.400
&gt;&gt; How soon after launch will it
be positioned and will it start

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.350
to actually provide data?

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:48.070
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Gardner: So
the question is how soon

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:53.790
after launch will it be in
position and doing science?

01:08:53.790 --> 01:09:00.660
So it will finally be ready
six months after launch.

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.170
That six months, it takes about
a month to get into position

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.640
and to do all the deployments.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.650
It then, once the sun shield
is out, it starts to cool.

01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:17.300
When it's cold enough that
we can turn on the cameras,

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.940
which don't work at
room temperature,

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.510
we will point the
telescope at a bright star,

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.690
and we'll see 18 different
out-of-focus images

01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:27.990
of that star.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:32.730
So then we have to move
the 18 mirror segments

01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:38.870
so that they all line up to a
perfect uniform optical surface.

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.300
That's a process that we call
commissioning the telescope.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.430
That will take another
three months or so.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:51.370
And then we have two months for
turning on all of the cameras

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:55.610
and checking out all of
the different filters

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:57.170
and modes and so forth.

01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:01.830
So the plan is to start routine
science observation six months

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.640
after launch.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.070

I guess we better end.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.370
