00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:02.869
Voiceover: Let's say that
you're a single person

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:06.530
who is making $50,000 a year.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.937
Let's figure out what
your actual take-home pay

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:11.754
would be after paying
federal income taxes,

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:12.690
and then in a future video,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.807
we can also think about

00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:16.008
what your state income taxes might be

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.422
if you're in a state
that has income taxes.

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:20.103
So the first thing we need to think about

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.389
is what is our taxable income?

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.708
This $50,000, which is what you kind of

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:25.673
think your salary is,

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:27.083
this is your gross income,

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.538
and to get your taxable income,

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:29.539
we have to think about things

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.356
like exemptions and deductions.

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.874
I'm not going to go into a bunch of depth

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:34.838
right over here,

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:36.763
but if we just assume that you are a very

00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:38.677
plain vanilla tax filer,

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:40.067
you're just going to take
the standard deduction,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.860
and you don't have a bunch of, you know,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.752
donations to charity or whatever else,

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.088
or a mortgage, interest,

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:46.716
or whatever else you might want to deduct.

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:48.541
You would take the standard deduction,

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.071
and then if you're just an individual,

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.008
you're only taking ownership for yourself,

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:53.418
only responsibility for yourself,

00:00:53.418 --> 00:00:55.069
you get to have the personal exemption.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.769
If you have a spouse, if you have kids,

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.469
you might have larger
exemption right over here.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.506
The key about the
deduction and the exemption

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.771
is these aren't deducted from your taxes.

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:06.940
These reduce your taxable income,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.448
so you started at a
gross income of $50,000.

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:16.475
Let's subtract out 6,100
for the standard deduction

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:20.399
and then 3,900 for the personal exemption,

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.800
and so your taxable income,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.252
at the federal level,

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:25.536
is going to be 50,000 minus this stuff,

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:28.090
so this stuff adds up
to $10,000 of deductions

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.009
and exemptions,

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.940
so your taxable income is $40,000.

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.149
Now, from this $40,000,

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.761
we can figure out how much you pay

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.056
in federal income taxes.

00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:42.554
Right over here, I've done part of

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:44.433
the current federal tax brackets.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:45.703
These change over time,

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:47.538
so the real basic idea for this video

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:50.004
is to get the idea of
how these brackets work.

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.509
These brackets might
change from year to year,

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.804
and many people say, "Okay, $40,000.

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:57.157
"It falls into this
bracket right over here,

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.102
"and this bracket's at 25%,

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.683
"so the federal income tax must be 25%

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:03.423
"of the $40,000."

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:07.173
That is not how a tax bracket works.

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:11.259
The way it works is you
pay 10% on the first 8,925,

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.271
then 15% on the increment up to 36,250,

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:20.536
and then 25% on the amount
that is above 36,250.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.557
So let's calculate what that is.

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.600
Get the calculator out.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.145
We're going to pay 10% of the first 8,925,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.777
8,925.

00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:34.175
I have trouble pressing
buttons on this calculator.

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:37.572
And then to that, we're going to pay 15%

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:46.355
on the next increment up to 36,250,

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:52.428
so that increment is 36,250 minus 8,925.

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:54.873
Once again, I have trouble
typing in a 5 there.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:03:01.503
And then, I'm going to
pay 25% on the increment,

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:05.604
on the increment above 36,250,

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.602
so our taxable income is 40,000,

00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:17.537
so it's 40,000 minus 36,250.

00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:18.556
And, let's see.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:19.535
Did I type that in right?

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.003
Yup, that looks pretty right,

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:25.206
and I get 5,92-,

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:28.622
I'll just round, $5,929.

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:35.605
So this gets us to $5,929
of just straight up,

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:38.807
what I'll just call straight up federal,

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.262
federal income tax.

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:44.273
Let me put that here. This
is federal income tax.

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:47.270
Now, we aren't done at the federal level.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.420
You also have what's
often called the FICA tax,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.535
or your share of the FICA tax.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.269
This stands for the federal insurance,

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.318
Federal Insurance Contributions Act, FICA,

00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:02.358
and this is essentially what you pay in

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:04.811
into social security and Medicare.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.218
Right over here, although "emp" could be

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:07.450
an employer or employee,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.038
so let me make this clear,

00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.872
this is the employee's share of FICA,

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:13.759
which you pay 6.2% for social security,

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:19.176
1.45%, and you don't take
into account deductions

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.270
or exemptions,

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.423
so you're going to pay it
on the original $50,000,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:26.554
so let's calculate what
that's going to be.

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:30.207
So it's 50,000 times,

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:33.998
and you're going to pay 0.062,

00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:36.270
6.2% for social security,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.101
and then you're going
to pay another 1.45%,

00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:43.810
1.45% for Medicare,

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.602
and then that gives you your FICA tax.

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:50.090
It's $3,825,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.058
so $,3825 in your share of FICA taxes,

00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:59.183
and I keep talking about
your share of FICA taxes.

00:04:59.183 --> 00:05:01.898
Your employer will also separately,

00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.147
this is the part that
gets taken out of your,

00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:05.867
out of your salary.

00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:09.602
Your employer will also pay another 3,825

00:05:09.602 --> 00:05:11.064
that you will never see.

00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:13.185
So this is essentially
half of the FICA taxes

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:14.428
that will go to the government

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:15.246
due to the fact that

00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:17.157
you are working for your employer.

00:05:17.157 --> 00:05:19.100
But now we have all of the taxes

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.202
that you are going to pay,

00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:20.864
or all of the things

00:05:20.864 --> 00:05:22.555
that are going to come out of your,

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.009
out of your payroll,

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.256
and so we can add those two things up.

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:34.178
We have the 3,825 plus the $5,929

00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:36.961
gets us to 9,754.

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:42.543
9,754 in total federal things

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:44.707
that are taken out of your paycheck,

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:45.958
and so your take-home pay is going to be

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.540
$50,000 minus this right over here,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.469
so that's going to be 50,000 minus 9,754,

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.167
54,

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:01.941
it gets us to 40,246,

00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:07.206
so 40,246 is what you are left with

00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:09.762
if we just take into
account the federal things,

00:06:09.762 --> 00:06:11.142
the taxes and the FICA tax

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:12.281
that are taken out of your pay,

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:14.466
out of your paystub, essentially.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:17.051
Now, if you are in a state

00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.138
that does not have state income taxes,

00:06:19.138 --> 00:06:21.506
and a city that does not
have local income taxes,

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.137
you're done.

00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:24.201
This would be your take-home pay.

00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.448
In the next video,

00:06:25.448 --> 00:06:27.087
we'll think about how much more

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.421
will be taken out of your,

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.738
out of your pay if you are in a state

00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:34.410
that has state income taxes.
