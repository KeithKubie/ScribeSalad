Now let's focus on signifiers, for feedback and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.310
discoverability as they relate to our timebank user interface.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.480
&gt;&gt; The actions that we need to do, initiating a transaction initiating

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.460
an exchange with someone so how do you tell, so you gotta

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.200
be in range. With somebody else, for example doing an exchange. What

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.346
are some elements of feedback that would say, when somebody is in range?

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:25.321
&gt;&gt; The

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:29.540
noise, yeah, ping.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.300
&gt;&gt; So, you got sound channels?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.810
&gt;&gt; Or just visual feedback, if you see a map and see other people on it.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.280
&gt;&gt; Alright, let's draw out. Each of you draw like five,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.410
five examples of how you know when somebody else is in range.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.810
&gt;&gt; Like geographical range you mean?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt; Let's, let's say it's, in it for those of you technical. It's like

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.970
Blue Tooth, and needs to be within ten meters but we'll say ten feet.
