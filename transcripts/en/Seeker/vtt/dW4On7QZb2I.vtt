00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.819
Most of us know smoking tobacco can cause
cancer, but what if you chew it instead?

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.540
Spoiler alert: still terrible, don’t do
it, unless you just love infections.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.560
Hey smokin’ hotties, Jules here for Dnews.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.640
It used to be the case that if you were trying
to quit smoking cigarettes, some health advocates

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.830
would recommend that you replace the habit
with smokeless tobacco, since it removes the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.679
whole cancer-y combustion part of the equation,
and supposedly causes less cancer.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.000
But there’s tons of evidence that it does,
in fact, cause cancer, and hey, a study came

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.239
out this year that not only points to a cancer
risk from smokeless tobacco, but also the

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.600
very real risk of a horrible bacterial infection.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.390
So those health advocates might want to rethink
their chosen careers.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.929
See, the big problem with smokeless tobacco
is how it is consumed.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.399
You’ve probably seen people using it; they’ll
often look like they have a big old lump in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.399
their cheek.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.649
That lump is tobacco, and users generally
hold it against their gum line for long periods

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.360
of time, as the nicotine is absorbed.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.190
But you’re not really supposed to hold anything
in your mouth for that long and the tissues

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.070
inside of your mouth, called mucous membranes,
aren’t as strong as they are on the outside

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.100
of your body.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.320
The mucous membranes *figuratively* open the
door for all sorts of nasty cancerous chemicals

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.100
and bacterial infections.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.799
But first it makes sense to understand the
problem with tobacco in general.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.580
Most of us know that smoking tobacco is one
of the biggest causes of lung cancer by far,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.540
and does so by altering your body’s DNA.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.420
A number of chemicals found in cigarettes
are specifically labelled as culprits in DNA

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.210
damage, including benzene, polonium-210, benzo(a)pyrene,
and nitrosamines.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.049
And most of those show up before anything
is even burned, aka combusted.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.420
Combustion is a chemical reaction, and leaves
lots of little byproducts, a number of which

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.799
are known carcinogens.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.079
Whether it’s burning meat on a grill, which
we recently did a video about, or lighting

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.399
up a cigarette, combustion is generally known
to produce these carcinogens.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.659
But removing the smoke part only really addresses
a small part of the cancer-causing problem

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.979
with tobacco.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.049
Smokeless tobacco, which can take on the form
of snuff, snus, dissolvable or chewable tobacco

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.000
still contains stuff like nitrosamine, which
is considered one of the most reliable cancer

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.140
causing agents in tobacco, and comes from
a chemical reaction nicotine undergoes when

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.729
it oxidizes during drying, also called “curing”.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.180
In fact, smokeless tobacco is well known to
cause cancers of the mouth and throat.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.290
Even Babe Ruth died from cancer of the upper
throat, very likely due to chewing tobacco.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.590
No one is immune.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.090
And speaking of immune, smokeless tobacco
isn’t just a cancer risk.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.900
A paper published in the journal Applied and
Environmental Microbiology in August of 2016

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.000
showed a link between opportunistic infections
and smokeless tobacco.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.930
It says that there’s a type of bacteria
group called “Bacillus” that can live

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.330
in smokeless tobacco and infect your mouth.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.860
A different study in Clinical and Diagnostic
Laboratory Immunology found five species of

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.390
bacillus in chewing tobacco sold in the US
-- so the bacteria is already there when you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.390
buy it.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
Some of these species are known to cause vomiting,
diarrhea, and even emit a toxin that can make

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.290
you very sick.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.900
And even worse, other forms of this bacteria
can produce the exact kinds of nitrosamines

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.519
we mentioned earlier that are known to cause
cancer.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.120
The problem is that smokeless tobacco is a
prime transporter for opportunistic infections,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.490
which describes an infection that generally
only happens when there is a prolonged opportunity.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.819
As we mentioned earlier, in order to get nicotine
into your body from your mouth without swallowing

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.880
it, the piece of tobacco is held against your
mucous membranes in order to flow right through

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
them.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.250
This creates the perfect opportunity for bacteria
to jump into your bloodstream right alongside

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.799
the nicotine, and next thing you know, you’ve
got toxin-producing Bacillius running rampant.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.620
Look, it’s 2016 and the evidence is clear
as day: tobacco is generally bad news, and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.629
the more we learn about it, the worse it is.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.220
So do yourself a favor.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.260
Spit it out.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.780
So smoking can obviously give you cancer and
chew can give you cancer and infections, but

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.439
those aren’t the only things to worry about.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.269
What about how smokers always look older than
their nonsmoking counterparts?

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.269
Why is that?

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.330
Find out in this video.
