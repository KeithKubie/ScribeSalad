Yes I really believe that role models are
very important for the future of the Middle

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:18.439
East. I believe what we need in the business
community, the economic community[inaudible]

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.599
community and the agricultural community,
and women scientists, I think we need leaders

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.330
that can demonstrate accountability and transparency
[inaudible] who can commitment themselves

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.810
to the public, who can commit themselves to
the future of their nations by investing so

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.390
much in education and creating opportunities.
As for us, we’re different because we still

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.629
have that profession; we’re different because[inaudible]
and we’re focusing all of our attention

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.850
on peace. Our piece is a piece on placing
a two step solution instead Palestine and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.660
Israel [inaudible] to live side by side with
peace and security with the state of Israel

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.989
[inaudible]. Our role models, our young leaders
that are emerging in Palestine are missing

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.920
the product of election in every speed of
life and our Palestinian society we have elections,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.630
democracy was not [inaudible] certain lines
have been failed but democracy works and I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.020
believe that the opportunity is there for
this region to go ahead and stay the course

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.409
in the direction of accountability and transparency
of education. We can not talk about economic

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.040
development, prosperity, creating an environment
for and a better future for our young men

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.610
and women without education. Education is
the key. Today we stand tall as Palestinians

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.810
because we can say we have reached the level
of 99% literacy rate. Delivering that level

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.040
of literacy is really alarming and something
must be done by all leaders. To see to it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.439
that our investment in education proceeds
any other field without differentiating between

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.250
