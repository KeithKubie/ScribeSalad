00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:02.369
Take a look at THESE SAGGY BANANAS,
BITCH!

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:03.204
(screaming)

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.982
(laughter)

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:10.678
Sank you to Audible.com for
sponsoring today's episode!

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:12.396
Really Anna? An Ad?

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.678
Unsellable..

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:17.014
Way to sell out.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.600
I hate you, sell out!

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.918
She sold out.

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:20.952
What a sell out.

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:24.464
Sell out.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:25.588
Sell out!

00:00:26.478 --> 00:00:28.509
What a fucking sell out.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.633
Did you know that the word "sell out"

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:34.102
is used exclusively for people
in the entertainment industry?

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:35.540
Isn't that weird, considering that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.058
it's also the hardest industry
to make a living in?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800
And normally, when people get promoted,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.693
we celebrate.

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:42.979
We like, throw them parties.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:43.987
Surprise!

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:48.448
We're all so excited because it's a sign
that they're doing well.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.360
My boss offered me a big promotion at work today.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.978
Oh babe, that's great!

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:54.844
Maybe we can look into buying a house next year.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:56.316
I didn't take it, Brad.

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.861
What do you think I am?

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:00.392
A fucking sell out?

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.631
I'm an insurance...ARTIST.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.009
Even when athletes get sponsored by a brand,

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.570
or sign contracts for millions of dollars,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.010
no one goes up to them and says,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.861
"You're only in it for the money!"

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:13.937
That's not true!

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.910
Although, thank you Ghost and Stars for sponsoring
today's episode. Ghostandstars.com.

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:21.362
I've been thinking about this a lot lately,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.515
and, ultimately I've come to the conclusion that

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.678
"Sell out" is all perception.

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.709
So, the only important thing is...

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.526
Do I feel like a sell out?

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:31.787
Sure.

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:35.270
If a sell out is someone that
puts high value on their work,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.392
then sure.

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:39.878
If a sell out is someone who
recognizes that money frees up your time

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.331
to work on non-paying passion projects,

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:43.449
awesome.

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:46.238
If a sell out is someone who loves what they do,

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:48.678
but also wants to make a living at it,

00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:49.845
then yeah.

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.449
Honestly, I'm so sick of the whole

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:53.360
"Starving artist" idea.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.010
And I know it's so cliche to say,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.331
so I'll say it with a beard.

00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:58.331
It's called "show business."

00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:00.570
Don't just work hard. Work smart.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.661
You didn't sell out.

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:02.949
You bought in.

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:04.832
To being a wizard.

00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:06.284
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:07.570
You stay awesome.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.799
