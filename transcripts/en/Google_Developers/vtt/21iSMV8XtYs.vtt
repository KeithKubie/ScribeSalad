00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.467
Now, another request we've heard
from a lot of you guys

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:05.868
is that right now it's
a little bit challenging

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.634
to move data
in and out of App Engine.

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:09.734
If you've got a lot of data,

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.367
such as something
in an existing database

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:13.801
that you have on site,

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.234
it can be hard to get that
into App Engine's datastore

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:19.033
to start playing with
and testing apps.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:22.234
So in response to that, tonight
we're excited to announce

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:25.400
our large-scale
data import tool.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.334
This tool makes it really easy
to move gigabytes of data

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:29.968
into the datastore
in App Engine.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.767
You can start, stop,
or resume your upload,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.734
and it handles errors
that you might encounter

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.200
as you're sending a lot of data,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.968
possibly over the course
of a few days.

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, we're also
working on an export tool.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.968
So it'll be just as
easy for you to move

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:47.033
the gigabytes of data
you have in App Engine

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.100
off and have
a local backup copy.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.234
After all, it's your data.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.234
You should be able to do
anything you want with it,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:58.267
to move it on or off
as easily as we can make it.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:00.467
Now, the next feature
I'd like to talk about briefly

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:04.434
is particularly exciting
to our enterprise developers.

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:06.634
One thing we've heard from
a lot of enterprise developers

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.400
is they'd like a way
to connect to the data

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.601
that they have
behind the firewall.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.234
The stuff they haven't
put in the cloud yet.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.334
In fact we've heard from
a lot of enterprise developers

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:18.000
that they feel like
they're being forced to choose--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.267
to choose between
having applications

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.767
that are easy to access
in the cloud,

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.267
or applications that have

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:26.801
the security of data
behind the firewall.

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.767
Well, we don't think
you should have to choose.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.701
So tonight,
I'm excited to announce

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.200
the Secure Data Connector,
or SDC.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.634
SDC makes it easy to have
policy-controlled access

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:40.501
in your applications
to your on-premise data

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.567
that's behind the firewall.

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.701
Now, before I get
into a more complicated, uh,

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.334
description of how SDC works,

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:50.234
I wanna show you
an example of SDC in action.

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.367
Now, uh, I'm also
a manager here at Google,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:55.501
so I sometimes
have to manage my reports,

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.467
and I might need to see
a report of my employees.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.300
So here we have
a sample spreadsheet

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.501
where we've imported
some employee data

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:05.033
that lives behind the firewall.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.267
Now, this data here is not--
has been changed,

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.634
so this is not
real employees' data,

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:10.634
to protect peoples' privacy.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:11.634
[laughter]

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:12.868
So you can
get off the phones now.

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:15.400
Um, but it is actually
coming behind our--

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.868
from behind our firewall.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.033
You can see from the url

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.667
this is actually
coming from within Google.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.133
Now, we've set up a policy
on this spreadsheet

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:27.334
that says that I, Kevin Gibbs,
can access this spreadsheet

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:29.934
and through this spreadsheet
can access that url.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.167
The policy is very specific.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.434
And due to that policy,
and the fact that I'm logged in,

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:35.868
which you can see
in the right-hand--

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:37.267
the upper right-hand side,

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:39.767
I can actually do a query
in this spreadsheet

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.067
and the spreadsheet will be--

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:43.200
and the query will be
sent through Google

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.534
down to inside the firewall.

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:47.334
So lemme try a query, here.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.868
And you can see it'll
actually send out that url

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.934
and return some new data.

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.434
Now, that's really--
once the page loads--

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:57.167
that's really
all there is to it.

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.334
As you can see, the import data
commands got a url in there,

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:02.534
that u--and the
Secure Data Connector tells it

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:06.033
how to find the right url
and return that data.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.334
That's it.
That's all you have to do.

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.133
And really that's
part of the beauty of SDC.

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:12.968
It's really easy
for you to set this up

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:15.400
and gain access
to your firewall data.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.167
You don't have to
set up a proxy,

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:18.901
you don't have to
change your VPN,

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:20.400
or do anything like that.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400
In fact, sort of
the magic of SDC

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.634
is that you can use this app
in the airport

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:28.367
and gain access
to that firewall data.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.534
Now, I'd like to now tell you
a little bit more

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:32.501
about how SDC actually works.

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.834
'Cause it's pretty important

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:36.200
given the security involved
in what it's doing.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.601
SDC is built around
having an agent

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:40.601
that runs inside the firewall,

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.634
and a set of servers
that run at Google.

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:46.200
The SDC agent then connects--

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.534
You run the SDC agent,
and it makes a connection

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:50.400
to our servers in the cloud.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.100
And that gives the servers
at Google access--

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.567
policy-controlled access
to the data

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.033
that you've chosen to expose.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:59.901
That means that
Google App Engine applications,

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:03.133
gadgets, and spreadsheets
can all have access

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:06.534
to the data that you specify
in your policy.

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:09.334
We wanted SDC to be
straightforward to use

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.734
while still giving you
the security that you needed

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:13.901
to run your application.

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.467
And so that lead
to a few design goals

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:17.601
that we have for SDC.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.868
One, we wanted SDC to be simple.

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.734
Want it to be simple
for you to use.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:23.834
And that--for that simplicity
is embodied with two things.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.200
One, we wanted to make it
easy for you to run the agent.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.434
All you need to do
is take our agent software

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:32.801
and install it on any Linux
machine within the firewall.

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.367
Once you do,
it'll connect and authenticate

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.300
with Google Apps
and make the data available

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.634
to anything else at Google

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:39.901
that you've granted
that permission to the data.

00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.300
Within applications,
whether it's a spreadsheet

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.467
or an App Engine app,
or what have you,

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.868
it's very easy
to use SDC as well.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:50.300
All you need to state
is the url that you wanna reach

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.300
and Google will
automatically route it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.868
down through the agent
within your firewall.

00:04:55.868 --> 00:04:58.501
Now, the next goal
with SDC was security.

00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:02.000
Obviously, for a tool like this,
making it as secure as possible

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.400
is one of the most
important considerations.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.601
That's why all the data
that you send with SDC

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.000
is encrypted with SSL.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.567
But it also means that we wanted
to make it secure

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:13.167
for your organization.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.534
That's why when you use SDC,

00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:16.734
you don't have to open
a new port in your firewall

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:19.334
or change anything about
the settings of your network.

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:22.567
It only makes outbound
connections to Google.

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:25.033
And finally, we wanted
the policies that you use in SDC

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.667
to be very specific.

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:27.834
That's why the policies

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:31.334
are at the application,
user, and url level.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.133
That means you have
very fine-grain support

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.200
over exactly who, uh,
can access any of the data

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.701
that you've exposed.

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:40.367
Now, the final consideration
we have for SDC

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.133
is we want it to be open.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.467
So to achieve that,
we've actually open-sourced

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.901
the entire SDC agent.

00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.234
You can go
and check out the code now

00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:51.801
and audit it yourself
if you'd like.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.167
We've also chosen to use
the OAF protocol

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.467
when authenticating
from the server to--

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.801
at Google down
to your agent software.

00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:01.601
The OAF protocol
is an open standard

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:04.033
that has seen a lot
of public scrutiny.

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:05.367
And we think that it represents

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:08.501
the best practices
in authentication.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:12.434
Now, I've shown you
a really simple example of SDC.

00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:14.834
I'd like to now
call up Mark from Oracle,

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:17.067
who's gonna show you
a real-world example

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:20.400
of using SDC to connect
to seeable data.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.868
Mark.

00:06:21.868 --> 00:06:23.234
[applause]
