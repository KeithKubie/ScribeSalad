00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.690
- Some people think it's not
Christmas till this card comes,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.800
so they're going to their
mailbox in rural Vermont

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.763
or Connecticut or Pennsylvania.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.050
And then the holiday starts
once they open our card.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.550
And there are people
that look forward to it.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.330
People that are like little
old ladies who are 90 years old

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.667
will send me notes saying,
"It's my favorite card.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.380
"I saved every one."

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.367
I've been back to Ireland,
and people have said,

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.220
"I have your card on the telly."

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.980
That's a lot of fun; a little
bit of pressure. (laughing)

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.433
I guess we're in it.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.053
And on one hand we're
pretty ordinary, normal...

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.120
conventional family people.
But we have a collection of

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.060
Space Age artifacts.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.900
So, I don't think we'd want to
be portrayed as being too...

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.733
wiggy.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.970
- [Producer] Don't worry.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.793
- [Veronica] It's too
late for that? (laughter)

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.110
- My name's John Kleeman,
and with my son Peter

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.870
and with the support of my wife Veronica

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.050
we collect dreams of the
future in outer space.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.670
We collect space toys.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.670
We collect Space Age
advertising, Space Age costumes,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.670
Space Age lighting fixtures, furniture.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.020
Everything we can think
of that tells the story

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.540
of how people dreamed of the future

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.900
during the 1930s through the 1980s,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.883
we collect it.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130
- It started as a father-son hobby

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.510
in the mid-'80s.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.980
It felt like that scene early on

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.940
in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.810
when he's scratching the
mashed potato mountains

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.150
and he's saying, "This means
something; this is important."

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.650
- These were actually a
little bit harder to find.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.470
Now, that could be a hiker.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.240
One of the things I love
about ... (laughter)

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.310
about license plates is they
have more than one meaning.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.980
It's a person telling the unknown...

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.477
highway drivers, people they never know,

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:17.607
"This is my passion; in
seven letters or less,

00:02:17.607 --> 00:02:19.047
"this is what I care about."

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.800
During the Mercury program
and then later during Gemini

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.310
and Apollo, I think
people really felt proud.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.220
And when the plaque that the
astronauts planted on the moon

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.443
said, "we come in peace for all mankind,"

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.280
or even, "one small step
for man, one giant leap,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.190
for mankind," I think people
really took that to heart.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.040
I think they felt this is something

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.503
that is being done by all of us.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.832
- There was a time when I was
wondering, what are we doing?

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:54.100
(chuckling)

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.156
And then I reflected on it.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.120
And it occurred to me
that some of the pieces

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.523
reminded me of the shards from archeology.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.883
- And there it is.

00:03:05.763 --> 00:03:09.460
The Velveteen Rabbit of spacecraft.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.510
It had a nice, big dorsal fin.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.200
It had a tail fin.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.240
All gone.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
This is what it once looked like.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.453
And somebody...

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.920
riveted it together, on the two...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.860
fins here, here, here and here.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.693
And some father, or brother,
or uncle, or mother, or aunt

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.250
really worked it to serve as
a substitute for the original.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.720
And suddenly that made it special.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.210
And through play there is
this concept of participation

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.210
in which these toys take on
something more significant

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.423
than just entertainment playthings.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.970
It really reflects the
adventure that we're all on,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.030
that we're hurtling through the universe

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.110
and that we're moving towards a future

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.100
and that part of that future may be

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.820
that we leave this planet.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.760
I think Peter and I
hope, and Veronica too,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.110
that someday, somewhere
off on a space station,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.760
there'll be some little offshoot satellite

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.890
of Space Age Museum, and the
people will wander around

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.490
and they'll think, "Gee,
that's where we came from."

00:04:20.355 --> 00:04:25.188
- [Ground Control] Six, five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.113
All engine running.

00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:31.340
Liftoff, we have a liftoff.
(applause)

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.690
32 minutes past the hour.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.163
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:39.998
Tower clear.
