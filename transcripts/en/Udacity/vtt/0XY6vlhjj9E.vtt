00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.014
Here, the graph of y equals x squared is this red curve and the graph of y

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.218
equals x squared minus 3 is the greenish-yellow one. You can see that these

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:12.535
curves are actually identical. The only difference comes from the presence of

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:17.044
this minus 3 in the equation, y equals x squared minus 3. This shifts the graph

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:21.272
down 3 units. If we shifted the green curve up 3, then it would exactly overlap

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:25.121
with the red one. This is pretty interesting. This is exactly what we saw

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:29.215
earlier when we were dealing with Grant's profit equation and graph. When we

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:32.859
changed the constant term on the end, it moved the graph up and down.
