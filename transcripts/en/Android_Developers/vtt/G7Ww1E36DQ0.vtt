00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:04.630
Turning on a roll board 
for the first time after

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.020
6 or 8 months of hard work 
and see it working properly;

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.950
it's the best feeling in the world.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.440
2 years ago with a friend,
we were the first Argentians

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.140
to win an international 
robotics competition.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.870
I felt I needed to spread the word 
and help get more and more people

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.217
into robotics.

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:26.547
I started travelling the country,
teaching robotics,

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.147
so the kids can get
great tools for the future.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:33.767
I see them working with robot, 
and they feel they are just playing,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.147
but they are learning how 
to be incredibly proficient.

00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:40.217
They feel, "I am too young to do 
these kinds of things",

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:43.297
but they are not.
So when you get that idea,

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:46.907
inside their heads, 
they are unstoppable.

00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:50.907
But one of my goals is to create
a generation of great robotics developers,

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:54.017
and great competitors,
that will change the world.

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:56.102
Mateo is also the found of Â¡Hablalo!

00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:00.102
an app to help deaf and mute people communicate more easily.

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.852
Mateo Salvatto.

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.072
Robotics champion.

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:03.786
App maker.

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:04.881
Celebrating app makers worldwide

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:05.851
