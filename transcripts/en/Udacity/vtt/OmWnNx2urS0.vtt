00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.930
The fourth foundational concept is information hiding,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.850
which is also called encapsulation. This is the extent to which

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.340
the implementation details of a system are hidden behind abstract interfaces,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.140
thereby protecting other parts of the program from changes to those details.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.020
Information hiding is one way to reduce the coupling of a system.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.650
On the other hand, the use of inheritance can violate information hiding by

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.790
making parent classes implementation details, details visible to child classes.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.930
This principle was developed by David Parnas.
