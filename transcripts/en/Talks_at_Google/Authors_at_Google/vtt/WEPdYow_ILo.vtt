[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.910
Hi, everybody.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.610
My name is Sue Ganz-Schmitt, and
I'm dressed like an astronaut

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.310
today because I'm
excited to tell you

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.482
about my new book, "Planet
Kindergarten," which

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.190
I see some of you
already have out there.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.620
So every great mission
needs a mission checklist.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.770
So here's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.500
Why I'm dressed
like an astronaut.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.010
We already did that, so check.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.790
What I do when I'm not
pretending to be an astronaut.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.600
How I got the idea for
"Planet Kindergarten."

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.590
Who is Dylan, and
is he an astronaut?

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.160
What does Shane Prigmore know
about astronauts and space?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.252
And finally, I'm going to read
to you "Planet Kindergarten."

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:36.710
And you'll be the first group
of kids that have heard this.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:39.640
OK.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.060
One of the things that I
do when I'm not pretending

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.610
to be an astronaut is I
produce musical theater.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.620
That means I help put on plays,
like the one that you see up

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.460
there.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.870
And that is "Peter Pan."

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.475
I've also produced "Little
Mermaid," and maybe some of you

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:56.380
have seen "Seussical."

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.820
And we have kids
from kindergarten

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.170
to sixth grade in our plays.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.900
I'm also a
philanthropist, and that

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.160
means I like to
help people in need.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.410
And our family started
an orphanage in Haiti

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.690
to help kids, to make sure that
they have a home to live in,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.890
a good education, and
the medicine that they

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.020
need to be happy.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.150
And you can see these
kids are really happy.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.480
And my favorite
job is being a mom.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.985
And these are my daughters,
Jensen and India.

00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:30.950
You could wave to
them over there.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.260
I brought them to my
work with me today.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.050
And we like to have tea parties.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.220
You can see we're having
a tea party right here.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.300
And these are two
other books that I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.310
wrote, called "Even
Superheroes Get Diabetes"

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.890
and "The Princess
and the Peanut."

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.370
So I like writing
books that help kids.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.797
And "The Princess
and the Peanut"

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.130
is for kids with food allergies.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.280
Do any of you have
food allergies here?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.000
You do?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.670
OK.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.130
I wrote this book to help kids
like you so other kids could

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.120
understand your food allergies.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.587
And because I write books,
that means I'm an author.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.920
So I'm going to tell you how
I got the story for "Planet

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.540
Kindergarten."

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.700
And it started a
long, long time ago.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.260
That's me when I
was in kindergarten.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.620
And something that I loved
to do was dictate stories.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.840
That means I used to sit down
at a table with a parent,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.640
and they would type up the
stories I would tell them.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.890
And I would illustrate them.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.970
So these are some of my first
stories that I ever wrote.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.060
And when I was in kindergarten,
something really exciting

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.210
happened.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.530
It was exciting for our family.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.410
It was exciting
for all of America.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.290
And it was that the first
man landed on the moon

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.050
in a spaceship
called the Apollo 11.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.676
And that kind of inspired one
of my first space stories.

00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:55.300
And here it is.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.760
I'll read it to you.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.300
"My father and my brother
are going on a rocket."

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.940
The end.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.490
That was it.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.440
But great stories can just
start with one line like that.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.970
Then a few light years
later, my daughter Jensen

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.440
started kindergarten.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.420
And when I was there, I
was noticing the kids.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.347
That's her on her
first day of school.

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:17.930
And that's her
kindergarten classroom.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.420
But as I looked around, I
noticed that a lot of kids

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.320
were happy and excited
to go to kindergarten.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.820
But there was one
little boy named Dylan,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.660
and he looked pretty nervous.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.600
And there he is.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.940
And I invited him to
tell you in his own words

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.780
what kindergarten
was like for him.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.550
Hi, my name is Dylan Williams,
and I'm not an astronaut,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.540
much as I wish I were.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.490
But I do play one on YouTube.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.080
On my first day
of kindergarten, I

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.570
remember feeling really nervous.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.870
But I took some deep
breaths, looked around

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.350
at my crew, my mom, my dad, and
some friends from preschool,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.889
and I marched right into
that classroom anyway.

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.430
Turns out my teacher
was really nice.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.710
And she knew how to help
when I was homesick,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.160
which happened quite a lot.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.860
It turns out
kindergarten was actually

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.820
a pretty great adventure.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.510
And that day I also met my
very best friend, Augie,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.520
who is still my friend today,
which adds up to eight or nine

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.554
years of an awesome friendship.

00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:19.220
And that friendship
has really taught me

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.810
that when you have a good
friend, no journey is too big.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.900
So a few years later,
before I completely

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.920
had the idea for the
book, we went to NASA.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.600
And that's where they
launch rockets into space.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.370
And we were there with Dylan.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.620
And he dressed up
like an astronaut,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.800
and that gave me a
great idea, I thought,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.430
for a book called
"Planet Kindergarten."

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.320
But a picture book
without pictures

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.360
is sort of like the
Earth without the sun

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.850
or Saturn without any rings or
other planets without Pluto--

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.250
just missing something.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.720
So I needed someone who
was really good at drawing

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.754
pictures, because
as you remember,

00:05:57.754 --> 00:06:00.170
those are the pictures I drew,
and I still draw like that.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.520
So I found this amazing
artist with the help

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.310
of my editor, Melissa
Manlove at Chronicle Books.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.970
And his name is Shane Prigmore.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.540
And you might recognize
some of these images

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.680
that I'm about to show you.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.130
He worked on "The Lego Movie,"
"Coraline," "Megamind,"

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.850
"How to Train Your Dragon."

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.560
And these are some
of his characters

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.800
that he's helped create.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.720
And when he was creating these
images, he researched space.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.330
He looked into what
spaceships were

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.800
like and what types of
spacesuits they wore,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.580
what colors you
would see in space.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.589
And this part's really fun.

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:47.630
These are his characters.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.100
And these characters were
inspired from other great space

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.970
characters, like ET and R2D2.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.410
So that's all about how I
created "Planet Kindergarten."

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.955
And now I'd love
to read it to you.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.520
The countdown started.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.890
Dad and I checked the plans
for my next big mission.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.090
My doctor gave me two thumbs up.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.875
Mom and I got lots of supplies.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.600
Today is liftoff.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.390
I suit up.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.265
Dad helps me with my gear.

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:35.620
What if I'm not ready?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.370
What if we crash into a comet
or get sucked into a black hole

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.980
or even worse, my
lunch floats away?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.500
You are well prepared, said Dad.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.465
I'm ready to explore
Planet Kindergarten.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.930
We arrive at the base camp, then
orbit while we look for a place

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.650
to dock.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.280
I'm assigned to my commander,
my capsule, and my crewmates.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.120
Don't leave, I beg.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.690
Mom slips her photo into my
pocket and squeezes my hand.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.584
I don't want her to
worry, so I stand tall.

00:08:07.584 --> 00:08:09.375
Parents are sent back
to their own planets.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.030
We're aliens from many galaxies
on Planet Kindergarten.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.840
Our commander tells us our
flight plan for the day.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.380
Mission Control calls
in on the intercom.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.320
They welcome us on our journey.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.220
I try to get used to
the new atmosphere,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.900
but it's not like home.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.500
For one thing, gravity
works differently here.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.289
We have to try hard
to stay in our seats,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.780
and our hands go up a lot.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.390
At recess, we test the
conditions outside our capsule.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.300
A crewmate and I
disagree over equipment.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.380
We have to sit in
isolation, and I

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.040
learn that isolation
isn't any fun.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.710
My crewmate agrees, and
I have a new friend.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.420
Back in the capsule, we run some
experiments, write in our logs,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.750
and then capture images
for our families.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.070
I wish they were here.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.410
At lunch, I find out
that I love space food.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.995
My lunch doesn't float away.

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:16.200
But our trash will,
so we contain it.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.080
The commander says that space
exploration makes you tired

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.190
and you have to rest.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.530
I'm too excited to sleep,
so I count the stars.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.420
In the quiet, in the dark,
I get really homesick.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.050
Is the room running
out of oxygen?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.210
Abort mission, I think.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.400
You can't do this.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.550
Get out of here.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.090
I spot the escape hatch.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.590
Then I remember what
they say at NASA.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.745
Failure is not an option.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:48.460
If failure isn't an option,
that leaves only success.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.410
Rest time is over.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.590
I take a deep breath,
and I get back to work.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.390
Before I know it, my
mission is accomplished.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.800
My parents rush to greet me.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.410
Then it's splashdown.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.480
I'm back on my own home planet.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.070
Mom and dad are proud.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.150
Me, too, because they
were brave to let me go.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.950
I love it here, but
I'm already training

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.856
to go back to Planet
Kindergarten tomorrow.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.269
Mission accomplished.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:23.310
I think we went over
everything we set out to do,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.560
and now it's time for book
signing and space painting.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.380
Come get your faces
space-painted outside by stars.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.300
And I'd be happy to
dedicate a new book to you.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.090
Thank you.
