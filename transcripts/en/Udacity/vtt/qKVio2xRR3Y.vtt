00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.610
Are all the goals simeltaneously achieviable in

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.770
a given operating system? At first glance

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.340
it would seem that some of the goals conflict with one another. For example, it

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.620
might seem that to achieve performance, we

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.000
may have to sacrifice protection and/or flexibility. Let's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.860
explore how researchers have used their ingenuity

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.450
to have the cake and eat it too.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.800
&gt;&gt; You're probably wondering how the commercial

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.120
operating systems that you and I use on

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.180
an every day basis Meet many of these goals that I identified. The short answer

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.480
to that question is they don't meet all the goals. We will return to the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.170
influence of research leading up to the current

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.260
state of the art in operating system structure

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.200
towards the end of this course module.
