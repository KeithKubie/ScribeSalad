00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.590
MALE SPEAKER: So here
we are at Idealab.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.620
And this is the central section
of Idealab where we

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.840
have all the shared services, so
each of these groups here.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.230
We have Human Resources and
Engineering and Design and PR

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.120
and Finance.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.230
And each of these are areas that
help the companies get

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.050
started and then also focus
on their customer.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.310
Our whole goal is to provide all
of the services that are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.137
more of the heartache functions
of growing a

00:00:22.137 --> 00:00:25.100
business, so the company can
focus only on what the needs

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.440
are of the customer and build
a product that will satisfy

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.560
them the greatest.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
And we start the companies right
in one of these pods.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.380
And then, once we decide it's
something that we want to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.365
actually build and incorporate,
we'll move them

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:37.360
over to another part
of the building.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.120
We'll capitalize it with the
first, say, $250,000.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.480
We'll have someone come in as
the beginning or founding CEO

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.750
or founding executive.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.290
And then our recruiting
department will help them fill

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.500
out the engineering team.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.950
But at the beginning, it will
be using Idealab resources.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.540
So it will be using the Idealab
engineering staff-- we

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.970
have programmers on staff--

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.000
and borrowing all those
resources to help them get

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.450
started as fast as possible.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.850
And gradually, they'll replace
them with their own people.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.570
Eventually, when they grow to
100 people, they move out of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.160
the building.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.970
But I'll take you in a second
to where the companies start

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.129
out, where we have room for
a five-person company, a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.610
10-person company, a 20-person
company, a 30-person

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.750
company, and so on.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.340
And the facilities department
here moves all the companies

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.720
around, so they're always
in the optimal

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.130
space for their stage.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.800
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.390
MALE SPEAKER: Here, we have
different pods for different

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.230
size companies.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.240
And each of these teams are
independent companies.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.140
Now you can see there's no
tall walls or anything

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.780
separating one company
from another.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.430
They're all in the same
shared space.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.140
In fact, the whole Idealab
building is 45,000 square

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
feet, all on one floor,
all very open space.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.620
The whole goal is that there's
the most information sharing

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.040
and knowledge transfer from
one company to another.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.170
No two companies are competing
with one another, so there's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.940
no chance of any trade secrets
or anything like that being

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.280
misshared between companies.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.903
But this company here, which is
a solar energy company, and

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:48.530
this company here, which is
doing mobile retail loyalty,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.410
they might have nothing in
common, except their VPs of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.660
Marketing might talk together
about strategies for marketing

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.200
their companies more
effectively.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.790
Their CEOs might get together
and talk about fund raising.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.560
We would have a lunch for all
of the CTOs across all the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.700
companies in the building,
so they

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.260
could share best practices.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.190
We're always bringing in
lecturers to talk to the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.270
companies about best
practices.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.640
Well, the main thing
is they're right

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.750
adjacent to one another.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.419
And they're working together
in the same space.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.400
And they're learning about how
to be successful as a company.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.990
Right now, in the building,
we have 12 companies.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.690
When the companies grow
past 100 people, they

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.800
have to move out.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470
And we have 25 companies,
overall, in the whole

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.970
portfolio at Idealab
right now.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.420
MALE SPEAKER: 25 companies.
