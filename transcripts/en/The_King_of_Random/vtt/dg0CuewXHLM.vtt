00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
[Captions by Y Translator]
In the past, we've done
some tests to see what happens

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
if we heat up dry ice
in a furnace, with a blowtorch,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
or even by pouring molten metal onto it.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.100
Today, we're going to see what happens
if we throw it in our mini Arc furnace,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.972
which heats up several thousand
degrees hotter than any of those.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:21.220
[Music]

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.000
YouTuber JuicyFox Hackerzzz
wanted to know what would happen

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
if we put dry ice in our mini Arc furnace.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
Well, JFH, we're not sure
what's going to happen

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.660
because dry ice is exceptionally cold,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.300
but our many arc furnace
is exceptionally hot.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.120
It gets up to several thousand
degrees in Fahrenheit or Celsius,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.120
and it's easily hot enough
to melt glass, rock, or steel.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620
What we're going to try
is fairly straightforward.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.000
We'll see how the arc interacts
with the dry ice.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
We'll see if it makes it melt
or sublimate faster than normal,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400
and we'll see if it's any different
with solid pieces of dry ice,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.720
or powdered dry ice.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.900
To start off,
let's see the result

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.200
with a solid chunk of dry ice.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm also curious to see
how the Arc is going to react

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
with the dry ice directly,
not the heat from the arc,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.652
but just the arc itself on the dry ice.

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:16.140
[Music]

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.212
All right. My first question was to see
how the arc itself interacts with our dry ice.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:25.080
And unfortunately, while this
does create a very powerful arc,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.900
it doesn't really have
the ability to separate very far.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.420
I'm pretty sure there's very
high amperage,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.680
but very low voltage
running through this thing,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.000
and as a result, it does have
a hard time separating out much.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.100
All right.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
I'm going to make the arc,
and I'm going to point it down

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.160
and concentrate it on to that dry ice,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.620
and we're going to see
if it does anything.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.100
It might cause it
to sublimate really fast,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.452
or maybe that much electricity and heat
or cause some other unknown reaction.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:01.840
[Music]

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.280
Cool things happening.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.940
First off, with just the arc
concentrated on the dry ice,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.120
it did not melt,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.940
because dry ice does not like to melt
unless you have it under extreme pressure,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.800
and this is just normal
atmospheric pressure.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
However, the heat
of the arc was causing

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.200
it to sublimate really quickly.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.800
It started dissipating way faster
than putting in the furnace

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.600
or anything like that.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.500
It wasn't that quick.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.100
It was still just sort
of a slow disappearance.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.300
But one thing we have learned
about dry ice in the past is that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.800
what makes it sublimate fastest of all is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.500
if it's in physical contact
with something putting out

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.340
a lot of heat,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.900
and these carbon rods
put out a lot of heat.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.960
As we have the arc running,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.700
it's heating up whatever's in the furnace,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.680
but it's also heating up
the rods themselves a lot.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.000
You can see that they are glowing orange
when I take them apart from each other,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.766
even when there's no
arc traveling between,

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.600
they're still blazing orange hot.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.040
And when I put the hot rods
directly in contact with the dry ice,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.240
that is when we started
seeing it dissipate quickly.

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:04.500
You can see that I've just carved
right down into this piece,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.100
and that was just by touching it
to the rods, which are still hot,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.600
and still causing it
to sublimate quickly on contact.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.200
So by taking the rods,
arcing them together, heating them up,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.000
and then physically touching
them against the dry ice,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.300
that's when we start really seeing
the dry ice get carved away quickly.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.700
That might be the fastest

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.600
I've ever seen anything
carve through dry ice.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.700
We're going to do the same thing again,
but on this slightly larger block,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.200
and I'm just going to start poking holes
right down into the surface of the dry ice

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.422
with our carbon rods.

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:51.460
[Music]

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.200
Those rods turned this dry ice
into just swiss cheese,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.160
like in no time flat.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.080
They just tunnel
right through that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.980
Look at that, full of holes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.400
All right, we've got
a little metal nut here,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.100
and we're just going to melt
that right on the dry ice.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.700
Molten metal does a pretty
good job of carving right

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.340
through this solid carbon dioxide.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.500
Let's give it a chance.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:27.580
[Music]

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.040
Beautiful.

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:33.300
So that was a nut, now
it's just a ball or a blob.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.340
I don't think I can even call
that ball-shaped.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.740
Melted down in just
a couple of seconds,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.500
and then it started carving it's way,
this beautiful little hole right down

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.700
into the dry ice.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.700
One more thing that we want
to test is to see what happens

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.300
if we take a bunch of our dry ice,
crush it up into a powder,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.352
and then put that into the arc furnace.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:05.200
[Music]

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.180
Oh, boy!

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:25.360
[Music]

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.660
That was pretty cool.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.400
It's like arching
down inside it.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.920
[Music]

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.300
Well, JuicyFox Hackerzzz,
no, we can't quite melt dry ice

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.900
in the arc furnace.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.100
We can get it to sublimate
pretty quickly, especially

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.900
if we take those blazing hot carbon rods,
and touch them to the dry ice itself.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.702
I also really liked
the look of them.

00:05:47.732 --> 00:05:50.500
We had the powdered dry ice
with the rods underneath.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.622
That was a really
cool underglow.

00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:54.400
Just all lit up quite a bit.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.300
Looked very neat,
does not melt,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.280
but does do some really cool stuff.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.460
