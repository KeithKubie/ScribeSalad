00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:02.536
- [Instructor] Other
videos we have talked about

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.084
the early history of Islam,

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:09.053
which really revolves
around the life of Mohammed.

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:13.824
Mohammed, as we talked about,
was born roughly in 570

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.157
and dies in 632.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:20.615
On this timeline here, the
white period is before,

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:21.942
according to Muslim traditions,

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:24.612
that he started having
the revelations from God,

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.498
and the brown period is when
he's having these revelations

00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:29.514
and he's starting to be the leader

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:33.015
of this nascent Muslim community.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.625
Now what we see here in this dark brown

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.925
is what was in control
of this Muslim community

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.104
at the time of Mohammed's death.

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:44.450
You see even by that
period they had control

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.603
of a good chunk of the Arabian Peninsula.

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:50.190
What's particularly surprising is how fast

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.070
Islam spread shortly after that.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.551
The next period, after Mohammed dies,

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.508
the leadership of the
community, of the ummah,

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:01.820
goes to the kalifs, and
this actually becomes

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.831
a contentious issue that we'll talk about

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:04.920
in other videos.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.120
It's the seed of the eventual schism

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.293
between the Sunis and the Shias.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:11.357
But this next period, the Rashidun,

00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:13.058
or the Rightly Guided Kalifs,

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:16.336
kalif means successors,
essentially successors to Mohammed,

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:20.757
under these four kalifs,
you see Islam spread

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:24.154
from as far west as Tunesia and Egypt,

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:26.571
all the way through Persia.

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.527
Keep in mind, this is spreading,

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:31.661
overtaking, conquering,
what used to be controlled

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:33.779
by very powerful empires,

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:37.006
the Byzantine Empire,
or Eastern Roman Empire,

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.186
taking territory from them here,

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:43.345
and then Sasanid Persia,
taking territory from them.

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:46.140
This is less than 30 years.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.789
Then it spreads even more.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.610
During the next caliphate,
which is now dynastic,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.777
the Umayyad Caliphate, by
the end of that at 750 CE,

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:58.926
you see Islam has now spread or conquered

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.246
from modern-day Spain and Portugal,

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:04.996
all the way to modern-day
India and Pakistan.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:08.108
We could continue this narrative,

00:02:08.108 --> 00:02:11.111
and we will continue to talk
about it in future videos.

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.305
But what's really
interesting is to think about

00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:18.036
how and why it was able
to spread this rapidly.

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:19.891
There's few instances in history

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.932
where we see this type of
an empire form this quickly.

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:27.963
To get some context on
that, we have this text here

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:31.469
from the American
historian Ira Lapidus' book

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.634
Islamic Societies to
the Nineteenth Century.

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:38.154
Ira Lapidus writes,
"The expansion of Islam

00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.580
"involved different factors
in different regions.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.292
"In North Africa, Anatolia,
the Balkans, and India,"

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:45.459
so these are regions that we
aren't showing on this map,

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.718
those happened later on
outside of the period

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:50.235
depicted in this map,

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:53.588
"it was carried out by nomadic
Arab or Turkish conquerors."

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:56.196
That is a similar form, method
that we're talking about

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:57.480
though in this map.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.278
"In the Indian Ocean and West Africa,

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:02.160
"it spread by peaceful
contacts among merchants

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.206
"or through the preaching of missionaries.

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:06.149
"In some cases, the diffusion of Islam

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.496
"depended on its adoption
by local ruling families.

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:12.474
"In others, it appealed to
urban classes of the population,

00:03:12.474 --> 00:03:14.346
"or tribal communities.

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.261
"The question of why
people convert to Islam

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.145
"has always generated intense feeling.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.851
"Earlier generations of European scholars

00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:25.056
"believed that conversion to Islam

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.763
"were made by the point of the sword,

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:30.255
"and that conquered people's
were given the choice

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:31.794
"of conversion or death."

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.401
So according to Ira Lapidus,
these early European scholars

00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:39.124
viewed it analogous to things
like the Spanish Inquisition,

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:41.858
or some aspects of the Crusades,

00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:44.063
or some of what we saw in the New World

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:48.160
with the conquistadors, where
it really was convert or die.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.560
But according to Lapidus,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.003
"It is now apparent that
conversion by force,

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.058
"while not unknown in Muslim countries,"

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:57.067
so there was some forced conversion,

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.611
but according to Lapidus
was, in fact, rare,

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:02.170
"Muslim conquerors
ordinarily wished to dominate

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.262
"rather than convert, and most conversions

00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:07.495
"to Islam were voluntary.

00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:10.140
"In most cases, worldly
and spiritual motives

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.119
"for conversion blended together."

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.062
Other sources I've looked
at do hint at these

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:19.036
early caliphates weren't that
interested in conversion.

00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:23.223
They were clearly Muslim, and
they were also Arab dominated,

00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:26.983
and they liked having this
elite Arab Muslim ruling class

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:28.199
and they weren't that interested

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.030
in spreading their religion.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.697
Only when we get into
the Abbasid Caliphate,

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:37.863
where it becomes more multicultural

00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.731
and more Muslim and less Arab focused,

00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:43.983
that you start to have
more and more conversions.

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.365
The sources I've seen have, by the end

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:50.229
of the Omayyad dynasty, only about 10%-30%

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.445
of the conquered people convert to Islam,

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.861
but much more convert during what's often

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:57.524
referred to as the Golden Age of Islam,

00:04:57.524 --> 00:04:59.440
when Islam is collecting the works

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.424
of the ancient Greeks, and
the Chinese, and the Hindus,

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:04.982
and getting scholars
from all around the world

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:07.149
under the Abbasid dynasty.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:13.026
Now, when Lapidus talks
about in most cases worldly

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:16.456
and spiritual motives for
conversion blended together,

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:17.816
he's referring to these ideas that maybe

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:20.701
for some people it just appealed to them.

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:22.796
You have to remember,
people weren't going from

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:25.961
being independent to being
subjugated in most cases.

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:28.197
Even before the conquest of Islam,

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:31.032
they were probably subjugated by a king

00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:33.591
or part of an empire
like the Byzantine Empire

00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:34.988
or the Persian Empire.

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:37.784
So they're really switching
from one conqueror to another,

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:39.473
and oftentimes people are hopeful

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:41.906
that the new conqueror might
be better than the last.

00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:43.935
Oftentimes they're proven wrong.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:46.552
Sometimes it might actually be the case.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.363
There might have been some support

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:51.023
that allowed it to spread this quickly.

00:05:51.023 --> 00:05:52.938
There's also worldly motives.

00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:56.027
If there's a Muslim ruling class,

00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:58.459
and if you want to be associated
with that ruling class,

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:00.361
that might be a worldly motivation

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:03.486
in order to actually convert.

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:05.218
Now the other thing that we do know

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:07.754
about these early Muslim empires,

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:09.054
and many of the Muslim empires,

00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:13.225
is they did have this
notion of dhimmi status.

00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:17.688
Dhimmi is referring to the
idea of protected persons.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:20.617
It's often referred to
as people of the book,

00:06:20.617 --> 00:06:24.367
but it included Jews,
Christians, that Islam,

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.112
according to Islamic tradition follows

00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:28.705
in the same tradition of.

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:32.007
But then when you eventually
have Muslim conquest of India

00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:35.090
included Hindus and Buddists as well,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.042
and it also included Zoroastrians,

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:45.056
who the early Muslims
considered to be monotheistic.

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:46.683
The idea of dhimmi status is that

00:06:46.683 --> 00:06:48.141
they would have protected rights,

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.396
they would have the same
property contract rights,

00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:52.741
but different political rights.

00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:54.903
The Muslim ruling class definitely had

00:06:54.903 --> 00:06:56.558
better political rights.

00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:57.996
They would pay a different tax

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:00.982
than what the Muslims actually paid.

00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:04.821
Now in order to get context
from a religious point of view,

00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.133
you can look at some of the
religious texts of Islam,

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:11.523
especially the Koran, and even the Hadith,

00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:13.689
which are the secondhand accounts

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:17.106
of the life and practices of Mohammed.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:20.318
There you get an interesting perspective.

00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:24.047
On the side of religious tolerance,

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:26.380
you have excerpts like this.

00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:28.555
"There shall be no compulsion

00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:30.610
"in acceptance of the religion."

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.283
"Unto you your religion
and unto my religion."

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:34.901
From and ethnic point of view,

00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:39.078
there also seems to be a
sense of nonsuperiority

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.008
of one ethnicity over another.

00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:42.474
"Indeed, there is no superiority

00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:46.304
"of an Arab over a non-Arab,
nor of a non-Arab over an Arab,

00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:49.849
"nor or a white over a black,
nor a black over a white,

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.730
"except by piety towards God."

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.054
This is from Mohammed's farewell sermon.

00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:55.676
This is given by the Hadith,

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:57.859
The Life and Sayings of Mohammed.

00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:00.379
Now on the other hand,
there definitely are

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.261
more militant portions of the Koran.

00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:06.939
One of the most quoted
excerpts is this one.

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:09.800
"And fight in the way of
God those who fight you,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.651
"but transgress not the limits.

00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:14.334
"Truly God likes not the transgressors.

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:16.855
"And kill them wherever you overtake them

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:19.731
"and expel them from wherever
they have expelled you,

00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.249
"and persecution is worse than killing.

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:24.502
"And do not fight them
at the sacred mosque

00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:26.037
"until they fight you there.

00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:28.532
"But if they fight you, then kill them.

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:31.325
"Such is the recompense
of the disbelievers.

00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.244
"And if they cease, then indeed

00:08:33.244 --> 00:08:35.242
"God is forgiving and merciful.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:37.469
"Fight them until there is no persecution

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:40.349
"and until worship is
acknowledged to be for God.

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.913
"But if they cease, then there is to be

00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:47.314
"no aggression except
against the oppressors."

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:49.133
So a critical view of this is saying,

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:53.300
look, this is clearly
advocating to kill other people,

00:08:54.887 --> 00:08:59.673
and fight those who are
considered to be disbelievers.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:02.012
That's clearly a critical view of this.

00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:05.594
You will not see this type
of language, for example,

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:09.427
in more pacifist notions
of, say, the Gospels.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:15.164
It's definitely not the
modern notion that we have

00:09:15.164 --> 00:09:17.718
of passive resistance,
or peaceful resistance,

00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:22.118
and the notion of a Gandhi
or a Martin Luther King.

00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:23.817
Now those who would defend

00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:25.925
or see a little bit more nuance here,

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:27.679
would say, look, you've got to,

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.539
this is not talking about
killing disbelievers arbitrarily.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:35.471
This is talking about killing
those who are persecuting you.

00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:38.909
They would say, look, this
revelation is believed,

00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:40.217
according to Islamic tradition,

00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:43.353
to have come down when the Muslims

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:46.506
were actively being persecuted
by Mohammed's tribe,

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:47.411
the Quraysh.

00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:48.244
They were in Medina.

00:09:48.244 --> 00:09:49.655
They were essentially in exile.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:52.301
They were in fear for their
lives, Mohammed's own life.

00:09:52.301 --> 00:09:54.431
The Quraysh had attempted to kill him.

00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:56.279
They were torturing and killing

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.742
that early Muslim community.

00:09:57.742 --> 00:09:59.698
In that context they're saying,

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:02.542
"And fight the way of
God those who fight you."

00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.054
So it's really out of defense,

00:10:04.054 --> 00:10:05.679
trying not to be persecuted.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:07.104
"But transgress not the limits."

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:09.535
Even there there are rules of law here,

00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:11.448
or rules of engagement.

00:10:11.448 --> 00:10:12.946
"And kill them wherever you overtake them

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.518
"and expel them from wherever
they have expelled you,

00:10:15.518 --> 00:10:19.161
"and persecution is worse than killing."

00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.005
So this is creating a moral hierarchy

00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:25.594
that is very debatable,
especially in modern times.

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:28.520
Is persecution worse than killing?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.206
"And do not fight them
at the sacred mosque."

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:33.001
This really seems to be
referring to the Quraysh,

00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:35.032
because remember they're fighting over

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:38.212
this notion of what even should
happen at the sacred mosque.

00:10:38.212 --> 00:10:39.669
"Until they fight you there.

00:10:39.669 --> 00:10:41.598
"But if they fight you, then kill them.

00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:43.609
"Such is the recompense
for the disbelievers.

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:45.714
"And if they cease, then indeed God

00:10:45.714 --> 00:10:47.434
"is forgiving and merciful."

00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:49.775
So to some degree, those who would see

00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:52.100
the nuance in this passage,
they say, hey look,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.076
this is talking about killing
those who persecute you,

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:58.311
but it actually seems to be a
little bit more conciliatory.

00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:01.770
Remember, the Koran is,
according to Islamic tradition,

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.169
built on the traditions
of the Old Testament

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:05.579
and on Christian traditions.

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.785
Especially relative to the Old Testament,

00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:09.523
which tends to be much more absolute

00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:11.967
when someone is disliked by God,

00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:16.135
whole cities or peoples
are destroyed or killed,

00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:19.651
or God might command his
prophets and the leadership

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.542
to kill other people just because

00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:23.529
they disbelieve God in the Old Testament.

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:27.111
People who would defend this
passage or see nuance here

00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.388
says, look, this is about being persecuted

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:33.513
and fighting persecution,
and if those persecutors stop

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:35.725
then don't seek revenge.

00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:36.908
"And if they cease then indeed God

00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:38.732
"is forgiving and merciful.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.118
"And there is to be no aggression

00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:43.001
"except against the oppressors."

00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:45.388
I'll leave it to you to decide.

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:47.921
I encourage you to look up
your own primary resources.

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:49.585
Look up different translations.

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.776
One of the tricky things
of not just the Koran,

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:54.704
but including the Bible, which is believed

00:11:54.704 --> 00:11:56.604
to first be written in Aramaic,

00:11:56.604 --> 00:11:59.765
or the Old Testament, the
Torah, written in Hebrew,

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:01.869
is that the translation itself can also

00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:03.427
give you various nuance.

00:12:03.427 --> 00:12:05.490
But make your own decisions about

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.481
what you think is, or your own judgments

00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:10.867
of what we've talked about in this video.
