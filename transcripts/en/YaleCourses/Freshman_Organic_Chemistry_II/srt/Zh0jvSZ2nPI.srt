1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,430
So we'll finish up on Nmr spectroscopy,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,090
talking about more dynamic things in
involving decoupling than a little bit

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:15,680
about [inaudible] 13 Nmr and,
and double labeling involving correlation.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,810
And then we'll get onto another reaction.
Electrophilic aromatic substitution.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,250
Um,
let's go at on here.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,870
Okay, so proton decoupling,
remember that the Proton is,

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,040
uh, four times as strong a
magnet as, as the carbon 13,

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,170
so it precess as much faster.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,740
So it's easy to do a pulse that that will
tilt the carbon 13 a net magnetization

10
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,220
down into the plane so that it'll precess
and be an antenna that can tell us

11
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,580
it's local field without doing
the same thing to the Proton.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,070
And if we do that, then we see
the [inaudible] at Mr Spectrum.

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,230
Uh, and there are two peaks because
of the adjacent Proton, right?

14
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:15,090
It can be either up or down 50,
50, and are almost exactly 50,

15
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,640
50. So you see two peaks. Now,

16
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,210
suppose at the same time you're doing
that when you do this pulse and listened

17
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:26,211
to the [inaudible] to see what is local
field is you irradiate at a hundred mega

18
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:30,750
hertz, right? That don't do anything
to the c 13. It's the wrong frequency,

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,050
but it will now make the proton precess.
That is,

20
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,270
if we look in the rotating frame,

21
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:41,271
we can see us a weak field that's
horizontal about which the,

22
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,720
uh, the magnetism will
precess a little go there,

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,540
protons will go down and then up
and then down and then up. Uh,

24
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,160
and what determines how fast it goes
up and down, how strong this field is.

25
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,360
The stronger it is, the faster it
will precess. And if it's fast enough,

26
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,710
then you won't see a doublet for the
[inaudible] anymore because you'll see the

27
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,040
average, right? So
you'll see a single peak,

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:10,041
you'll proton decouple the c 13 spectrum
and see the [inaudible] as if the

29
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:14,490
protons weren't there. Uh, okay.

30
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,950
So it depends on how
much power you put in.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,050
Now here's a c 13 spectrum
of a given compound. Uh,

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,190
where we're putting, we're looking
at the seat listening to the c 13,

33
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,130
and we see all these
different local fields, right?

34
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,720
But we're irradiating the proton at
the same time, but very, very weakly.

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,010
This number up there.

36
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:40,011
40 decibels is an inverse ratio of how
strong that horizontal field is for the

37
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:45,690
protons. So it's 10 to the fourth
weaker than what you'll see later.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,810
10,000 times weaker.
And if we look at the carbon,

39
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,040
we see that there's that some of the
carbons signals are split and some are not

40
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,520
split. The ones that are split are
the ones that have hydrogens on them.

41
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,890
So if we start from the left,
we see there's one with hydrogens,

42
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,350
then one with one hydrogen,
one with one hydrogen.

43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,390
That red one is the solvent CDCL three,
right?

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,850
So we're looking at the carbon of the,
of the CDC,

45
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:15,040
l three but it has a deuterium on it,
not a hydrogen,

46
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,820
so it's not split.
Then there's a carbon with two hydrogens,

47
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,170
a carbon with three hydrogens.

48
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,790
It's a quartet underneath the carbon
with two hydrogens. It's a triplet.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,270
So that's very low power and the Proton,
that's what we see.

50
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,280
Now we're going to reduce the size of
that and see what happens as we start

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,600
increasing the power.
So there's 40 DB, 20 db,

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
and now things are beginning to change.

53
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,920
See how the patterns are changing
their multiplicity and their intensity.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Because it turns out
that when you irradiate,

55
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,510
when you irradiate the protons
by a complicated mechanism,

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,540
it strengthens the signal of the
carbons to which they're coupled.

57
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,620
And that's called nuclear Overhauser
enhancement, as you'll see. Okay?

58
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,720
So now you'll see the
splittings going away.

59
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,020
When we get down to two
decibels or one decibel.

60
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,980
Now we see that each carbon
gives just a single peak.

61
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:16,150
We've decoupled the protons.
So now we have a peak for every carbon.

62
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,160
And notice incidentally,

63
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:23,020
that the CDCL three didn't get
stronger as we did this. Why?

64
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,410
Because what strengthened the signal was
irradiating the protons and CDC l three

65
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,520
doesn't have the hydrogens on it, so
it doesn't get strengthened. Okay?

66
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,430
And no notice also that the carbon
without a hydrogen on it though,

67
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:41,290
the far left here didn't get strengthened
as much as the others did. Okay?

68
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,820
So that's decoupling and it can be useful
and it can be useful in several ways.

69
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,190
There's this thing I called nuclear,
there's the two things.

70
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:52,240
You get rid of the hyperflex, the you
get rid of the spins, spin. Splitting.

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,220
So you see just a peak for each carbon
and also you strengthen the signals when

72
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,070
they have nearby protons,
right?

73
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,930
And that could be bad if you're interested
in measuring the size of the peaks to

74
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,610
get how many carbons there are,

75
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,540
because you can't count properly anymore
because you get different intensities

76
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,400
with different neighbors of protons.

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,600
But it's good if you want to determine
structure and see what hydrogens are how

78
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:21,120
far away. And I'll show you
that shortly. Okay? Now, uh,

79
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,150
Merritt bear in mind that carbon 13 is
only 1% in natural abundance of carbon.

80
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,501
Of course,

81
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,480
you can synthesize a molecule
with expensive carbon 13
containing precursors and

82
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,450
put carbon 13 where you
want it in a molecule.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,660
And then the signal from that carbon
will be ever so much stronger.

84
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,960
If you put in pure carbon c 13,
in some position,

85
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,560
the signal would be a hundred
times stronger. In fact,

86
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:49,210
200 times stronger than without.
Because when the carbon went, uh,

87
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,880
because uh, uh, no part of it, it'd be a,

88
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:56,881
it would be a be a 100 times stronger
because we 100% instead of 1%.

89
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,390
Okay? So here's a, here's
a, a, a compound neo tame.

90
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,630
It's an artificial sweetener and it's the,
uh,

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,530
it's the proton decoupled.
See 13 spectrum.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,420
So you see one peak for each carbon,
there are 20 carbons,

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,500
there are 20 peaks, but you can't
go by their intensities, okay?

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,510
Now let's see what we can make of
this. Uh, it's proton decoupled.

95
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,220
So there's one peak for carbon and being
carbon. It's pretty well spread out.

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,010
Remember the range of hydrogen,
uh,

97
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,890
chemical shifts is only
about 10 parts per million.

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,250
The range for carbon is hundreds
of parts per million. Here,

99
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,240
200 parts per million
are shown. Okay? Now,

100
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:44,240
why is there no see 13
[inaudible] 13 splitting.

101
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,820
There's no proton splitting
cause this decoupled,

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,850
but why no [inaudible] see 13 splitting

103
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,640
Jason at the same molecule.

104
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,410
It's only 1% natural abundance.

105
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:00,910
And you're a c 13 so that you're giving
a signal the chance that your neighbor

106
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:04,810
is, see 13 is only 1% so there would
be tiny, tiny peaks from those.

107
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:09,490
You don't see them. Okay, so
that's what Chris just said.

108
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,200
Okay, now let's see if we can
figure out which proteins,

109
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,660
which a carbons these are
that we're looking at.

110
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,210
And of course this is how it was done.
Empirically.

111
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,600
People put in known compounds and
figured out what the chemical shifts,

112
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,050
what peaks were from one compound
to the next thing they figured out.

113
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:29,230
This comes in this range and this comes
in this range. This comes in this range.

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,340
So let us see knowing what
these peaks are. Okay? First,

115
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:36,820
there are these ones that are
way down close to 200 right?

116
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,020
There are numbers one 13 and four so
what the one 13 and four have in common

117
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:45,460
that turns out to make
them way far down field

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,953
alimony.

119
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,420
What the one 13 and 14 have in common
that makes them different than the other

120
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:56,254
carpets.

121
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,270
Double Bond to an o, right? Carbonyl
carbons are way down field. Okay?

122
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:11,271
Now we've got a seven and eight to 12
so there's seven and there's eight,

123
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,790
nine, 10, 11, 12. Pretty
clear what those are, right?

124
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,020
Those are the ones on a benzene
ring. Aromatic carbons. Okay.

125
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:22,230
Then there are ones that are a little
bit further down than the others.

126
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:26,460
And those are those blue ones.
What do they have in common role?

127
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,810
What do you say they have in common?

128
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,500
They're not all tertiary. No. In
fact, most of the only, only uh,

129
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,480
one of them has only two of them have
three things associated with them.

130
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,323
The others have

131
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,213
one and two.

132
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,220
Lauren, could you see what
the blue ones have in common

133
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,920
in hydrogen? What makes things come
a little bit further down field?

134
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,240
And I knew he would be like
you like from the [inaudible].

135
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,490
I'm like [inaudible].

136
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,710
They all have an electronegative
atom next to them, right?

137
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,680
Nitrogen or oxygen.
Okay.

138
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,610
So those are one's a carbon
that's attached to something
I liked her negative.

139
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,560
And then finally you have the others
which are attached only to carbons. Okay.

140
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,630
So you could begin to figure out these
and you can get the tables of what comes

141
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:26,550
where and then you can start dealing with
unknown compounds and figure out what

142
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,061
it's telling you.

143
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:31,620
But a nice thing about this
proton decoupled spectrum
is that there's just one

144
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,030
peak for each car been in there,

145
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,120
well spread out so that it's
good to do this kind of thing.

146
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,970
So those are the Alkane carbons.
Okay? Now the power of correlation,

147
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,690
often when you could measure two
things about on the same subject,

148
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,650
simultaneously,

149
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:51,390
you get a lot more information than
measuring one or measuring the other or

150
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,950
measuring them independently.

151
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,640
I'll show you that example with
[inaudible] 13 double labeling.

152
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,960
And also in two dimensional is it's
called nuclear magnetic resonance.

153
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,410
So first see 13 double labeling.
So,

154
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:08,910
and we'll talk about [inaudible]
biogenesis. In fact, we
already talked about it.

155
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,910
If you look back at the lecture 52 okay,

156
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,870
so remember we got squalene from Isis
[inaudible] pirate phosphate that it

157
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:19,320
curled around and we had this complicated
thing where it's zipped up going one

158
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,860
way and then it,
then we had all these rearrangements.

159
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,890
Okay? So, as we said at that time,

160
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,480
this is the source of cholesterol
in the steroid hormones.

161
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,550
And it's a very cute story how all
that rearrangement took place. Okay.

162
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,590
But there's a question whether it's true,
and I said at that time,

163
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,060
wait for Nmr. So now we're at
Nmr so you can get the answer.

164
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,500
Okay? So you can use carbon 13
labeling to figure this out.

165
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:57,120
So if you feed the plant
that makes this stuff, uh,

166
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,300
carbon 13 labeled ISO Penn Tino pyro
phosphate in that particular carbon that

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,610
substituted carbon,

168
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,960
then you can see where that
would appear in the [inaudible].

169
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,020
And according to the way we linked
them together before it should be those

170
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:17,400
carbons. Then when you curl it around
and do all this stuff to make an Austral,

171
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,200
those peaks should be labeled with
[inaudible] and therefore a hundred times

172
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,860
stronger than the other peaks in
that spectrum. And indeed they are.

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,690
So that supports it. Okay. Or
you could do it a different way.

174
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,080
You could label the methyl group
and if you label the methyl group,

175
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,590
it turns out that those methyl groups
should be labeled in squad lead.

176
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,300
And then if you curl it around,

177
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:43,470
it should be those methyl groups and
indeed there hundred times stronger than

178
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,400
the other signals.

179
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,470
But much more interesting than
this is to do double labeling.

180
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay? So if you label
both, you get that big,

181
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,680
that's just the same information
we got before, right?

182
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:00,970
Except done in one experiment rather
than two. And of course, in a sense,

183
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:05,200
this is not as valuable as the two
independent label experiments because you

184
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:08,950
don't know. But what two of those carbons
might in principle of changed places,

185
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,773
right?

186
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,170
But the double labeling is much
more important if you do it dilute.

187
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,670
Now what do I mean dilute? I've been
talking as if we put 100% see 13 in here.

188
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,090
But suppose we only,
we don't put nearly a hundred percent.

189
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,850
Suppose we only put 10% in,
right?

190
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,270
But suppose that those 10% that
are labeled r double labelled.

191
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,400
So we prepare a sample that's
100% labeled in two positions,

192
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,950
but then we mix it with 90% of unmetered
unlabeled material and feed it to the

193
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,400
organism and get the stuff out. Okay. So,

194
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,170
so what we're going to do is a dilute
double label. Now why do it dilute?

195
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,850
Because then when,
when label goes in,

196
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,070
two labels go in, but it's
unlikely that any given squad lead,

197
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,800
we'll have two different positions,

198
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,760
double labelled or two sets of positions
double labelled because only 10% of the

199
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:14,500
stuff is double labelled. So when a
squad lead is double labelled, it'll be,

200
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,540
it'll be labeled in just one pair of
positions, a given molecule like there.

201
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Okay. So those two come labeled
together. Their signal is a,

202
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,520
is 10 times stronger cause it was,

203
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:32,260
remember 10% it's 10 times stronger
than it was for the ones that aren't

204
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:35,920
labeled. Okay. But
what's special about it?

205
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,090
Can anybody see what's going to be
special about the signal we get from these

206
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,770
molecules that look like that?

207
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,120
I usually got an idea

208
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,310
they're going to be the same.
What

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,720
you're gonna be. Same purpose because
they are just next extra card.

210
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,890
I didn't quite understand you,
but I didn't pay.

211
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,710
I was listening for special words
that I didn't hear them. Sebastian,

212
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,730
you've got a special word for
us. Ah, they'll split each other.

213
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:13,390
Cause now the [inaudible] are next to
one another because they're not coming in

214
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,270
at random 10% they're coming in as a pair.

215
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,260
So now when we look up the signal
from that, it's going to be,

216
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,570
it's going to be a double doublet,
right?

217
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,870
The blue and the red ones are
going to split each other. Okay.

218
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,550
Now other molecules in the same sample
will turn out to have been labeled

219
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:35,470
elsewhere, for example. So that proves
that those editor does a unit, right?

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,670
Others will have come in there and those
will also be a double doublet show that

221
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,910
they came in as a unit. And if we go
over to the other end of the molecule,

222
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,570
those will be a double doublet. No
signals will be a double doublet. Great.

223
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,320
What's going to be different?
All right.

224
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,710
Suppose we had that molecule right
where we had a meth, I'd shift.

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,470
So the carbon got away
from its original neighbor.

226
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,420
Now it won't be next to US [inaudible]
13 and it'll be just a pair of singlets

227
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:07,190
instead of a double Dublin in a carbon
13 in a proton decoupled spectrum.

228
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,720
Right? And the same thing
will be true there. Okay?

229
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,110
So this double labeling absolutely proves
that these rearrangements took place,

230
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,100
right? So those two incidentally
are labelled in the same molecule,

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,670
right? But they're not adjacent
to one another anymore.

232
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,900
So they don't show splitting.

233
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,200
And those are both labeled the ones
that are adjacent to one another,

234
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:36,410
but not in the same molecule.
So they don't do splitting either.

235
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,010
So this a dilute double label experiment
enhances the same 12 peaks is the

236
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,400
single label experiments did to
two single label experiments,

237
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,050
but only eight of them show spins, been
splitting because their bond stay intact.

238
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,000
So this strongly confirms that story I
told you before about the rearrangement

239
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,440
scheme.
Okay?

240
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:00,860
So this is the power of correlation and
let's look at a different kind of power

241
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:05,270
of correlation in what's called two
dimensional and Mr Spectroscopy. Now,

242
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,340
here's a two dimensional NMR spectrum.

243
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,240
And the way it's collected
is rather technical and we
don't have time to go into

244
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:15,290
it, but it shows that there are
two different frequencies be used.

245
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,270
And, uh, and if you go along
the diagonal of this plot,

246
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,020
those two frequencies are the same.
Okay?

247
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,680
So what you see there when you have
just a certain frequency going in is the

248
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:30,230
normal spectrum you
see along the diagonal.

249
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,810
But this is the spectrum of a protein.

250
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,710
So it's got a whole bunch of amino
acids linked together like that.

251
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,690
And we're in the range of the spectrum
between six and nine where the Nh protons

252
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:46,160
show up, okay? In this particular
kind of molecule. Okay?

253
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,060
So there are a whole bunch of them in
this long chain and they all overlap with

254
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,130
one another.
It's very hard to tell what's going on.

255
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,360
But if you don't have these two
frequencies, you're using the same,

256
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,620
you're looking at one while
you're irradiating another one.

257
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,000
And that affects the intensity
of the one you're looking at.

258
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,900
That's this nuclear Overhauser
enhancement that we talked about where you

259
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:13,640
irradiate one other things that are, it's
coupled to will change their intensity.

260
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,540
So what we're going to do
is plot on the off diagonal,

261
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,020
how one frequency is influenced by
having other frequencies in there and its

262
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,030
intensity.
Okay.

263
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,840
So that's called an OEE or
nuclear Overhauser enhancement.

264
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,080
And it comes incidentally by
through space magnetic interaction,

265
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,930
not the stuff like we talked about,
coupling where it goes through bonds.

266
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,480
This works through space,
right?

267
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,250
So it works if you're less than about
if the two protons you're looking at,

268
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,770
the one you're looking at and the one
you're tickling to see if it this one,

269
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,200
if they're within about six angst
terms of one another. Okay? So, uh,

270
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,650
so as I said,
this is mostly these Nh protons.

271
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,690
And for one thing, one advantage of
having these off diagonal peaks is there,

272
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:08,130
much less congested than what's along
the diagonal than the normal spectrum.

273
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,980
Okay?
So for example,

274
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:15,981
we're looking here at the Nih Proton
that's at 7.25 parts per million,

275
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,520
right? But you can see that it
interacts with several other protons.

276
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,630
It's within six songs,

277
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,631
strums of signals that are at 8.9 8.3
8.25 7.7 right now you don't measure the

278
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:33,060
exact distance. All you know
is that it's close, okay?

279
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,850
But this allows you to make a three
dimensional map of the protein.

280
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,883
All right?

281
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,260
And the way you do it is first you have
to know which Nh goes with which our

282
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:50,340
group, right? So you,
you see that, that Nah,

283
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,870
the one you're looking at, the red
one is close to that blue one, right?

284
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,550
So it,
it'll influence it.

285
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,390
But the blue one is then close
to H's that are in the r group.

286
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,480
So you can tell which our group that
that blue h is the thereby and which one?

287
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:10,860
The Red h is near the witch, the, so the
red is near, the blue is near the are.

288
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,600
So you know which Nh is
near, which are okay. Uh,

289
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,580
and now the way you make a
map then in this way, uh,

290
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,160
professor Lauria who does this
kind of thing uses this analogy.

291
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,020
It's like of making the map of a,
of a town.

292
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,330
If all you have is a telephone
and a telephone book, okay,

293
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,320
sometimes there's a front page that has
a map of the town, then that's easy.

294
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,390
But if you don't have the map of the town,

295
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,590
then what you do is you just call someone
at random, say hi, how are you today?

296
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:44,820
Blah blah, blah, blah. Uh,

297
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,310
could you tell me who the three
of your near neighbors are?

298
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,890
And they tell you three of
their near neighbors. Okay.

299
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,020
Then you call those people and you say hi,

300
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,780
could you tell me who three of your
near neighbors are? And they tell you,

301
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,300
and then you call the next one,
two or three a year near neighbors.

302
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,760
So once you know who is near what,
then you can,

303
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,870
you can see that there will be a map
that will allow you to figure out what's

304
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,250
near what, especially if you
have some help. Because you know,

305
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,630
in the case of the protons, they have
to fit with normal bond distances,

306
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,430
normal bond angles and so on.

307
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,990
So if you do molecular mechanics together
with this, knowing what's near, what,

308
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,500
you can get a very good three
dimensional structure of the protein.

309
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,490
And the nice thing about this from the
point of view of people who are actually

310
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,450
working with proteins is you
don't need, how would you, how,

311
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,000
what's the best way of getting the three
dimensional structure of something like

312
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:36,390
a protein or anything x-ray.

313
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,680
But you need a crystal for this.
You don't need a crystal, okay?

314
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:44,880
So you can find the structure that way.
So with molecular mechanics constraints,

315
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,640
you get the three d structure
without a crystal, okay?

316
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:53,560
Now here's a different kind of two d
correlation with Ed, Mr It's correlation,

317
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:56,440
not in space but in time.

318
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,440
So this is the spectrum of a cad ion,

319
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,960
that cat eye and that's
shown at the right notice.

320
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:06,961
It's benzene with methyl groups all around
it with one extra methyl group and a

321
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,140
positive charge. Okay? Now in fact,

322
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:15,460
you can get this and solution as long
as you don't have anything that reacts

323
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:19,810
with Cad Ions in there that reacts
with low Lumos. So you need very,

324
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,790
very non-basic solvents to
do this. Okay? So again,

325
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,680
the diag and all running a different way.

326
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:31,681
This time that dealt the increase in
parts per million is down to the right

327
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,800
rather than what we usually see
increasing to the left. But anyhow,

328
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:40,710
it's color coded according to these
peaks that show, that show what they are,

329
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,960
the molecule. So, uh,

330
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,930
so this scale is slanted and backwards.
Uh,

331
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,720
uh, so you see that the, the, the, uh,

332
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,890
if you look at the resonance
structures, right? That one, that one,

333
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,753
that one,

334
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,600
you can see that the blue and the green
are near where there's positive charge

335
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:05,800
and the resonance structure. So
they're far down field, very, uh,

336
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,510
very de shielded compared to the others.
Okay.

337
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,030
Now,
uh,

338
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,180
this can rearrange of method can shift.
So I sh there meth,

339
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,290
I had one of the reds, red methyls
on the top shifted to the right.

340
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,790
So now the mall,

341
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,110
now you've changed which methyl
groups are in which locations, right?

342
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,300
So now the, uh, the red
one at the top, uh, this,

343
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,260
this one and this one are now see
and will be shifted way down field.

344
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,350
This one will be shifted down.

345
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:45,310
Fee will be what was blue before
in the deep position. And so on.

346
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,960
And then this blue one,
which was downfield before is now at an a,

347
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,920
it's up here. So we changed the
locations, the local frequencies,

348
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,040
the local fields. Okay. Now,

349
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,120
so that's a meth I'd shift.
But is it a one, two meth?

350
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:06,550
I'd shift because it's possible that
the methyl instead of going just to its

351
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:11,470
neighbor would move to the center of
the ring up above the center of the ring

352
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,270
and that it could come down anywhere,

353
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,880
wouldn't have to come down
adjacent to where it started.

354
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,550
So you could have a one anywhere shift.

355
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Right now you can distinguish that and
measure the rates with this NMR spectrum,

356
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,380
this two dimensional and Mr
Spectrum, right? So again,

357
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,440
we're seeing when when one
frequency influences another.

358
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,190
Now if a given set of protons
moves from one position to another,

359
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,080
then having been a radiating one
influences what happens where it ended up,

360
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,610
right?
Cause those protons are now here.

361
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,980
So here you see off diagonal peaks
where one has become another.

362
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,640
So we can see here for
example that see that,

363
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,700
that the proton that was
in position see becomes a,

364
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,290
and that's what happened in the blue here
when we had that one too rearrangement.

365
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,710
We can also see that d becomes B and that
you can see happened here and you can

366
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:14,351
see that be becomes c but you notice
there's not a becomes B a becomes d or c

367
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:17,660
becomes d.

368
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,320
So you don't have peaks for some of
these patterns that you could have done.

369
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,620
Now if you go, if you go through
this whole sequence of these,

370
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,630
then one can see you can start any
place and any place else, right?

371
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:34,430
But it takes a longer time. So depending
on the time scale of this thing,

372
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,400
you can tell which things happen quickly,
right?

373
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,230
And what happens quickly is a one to
shift, not a one anywhere shift. So again,

374
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,940
that's information on mechanism that comes
from two dimensional NMR spectroscopy

375
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:50,810
and its proton versus
Proton correlation in time.

376
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,280
That's incidentally just
another map of this same,

377
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,230
another visualization that this same map
I showed before that shows the peaks on

378
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:04,430
the diagonals and the off diagonal peaks.
Okay,

379
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:09,230
now we've finished with Nmr. Okay?
Earlier we all refer to it again, but,

380
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,180
but we've finished discussing it.
Uh,

381
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,690
and we'll go onto the
next important reaction,

382
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:17,030
which has electrophilic
aromatic substitution.

383
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,430
We've talked about
electrophilic things before.

384
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,310
Remember electrophilic
addition to an alkene.

385
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,830
Now you might think benzene is an Alkane.

386
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:27,860
So you get electrophilic addition
to the double bonds and benzene,

387
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,760
but you don't get addition,
you get substitution, right?

388
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,810
So here's an example of
substituting deuterium for hydrogen.

389
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,550
You've put benzene and concentrated
sulfuric acid that has deuterium in it,

390
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,000
and you get deuterium first in
one position. Then of course,

391
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:48,620
in other positions in the,
uh, in the, uh, benzene,

392
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,240
uh,
so you can go all the way to c six d six.

393
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,400
That's how you've prepared
deuterated benzene.

394
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,160
If you want to use it for a solvent, for
something, for example, okay, now, uh,

395
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,740
you can use other electro files as well,
not just deep plus.

396
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:08,741
You can use an Otu plus br
plus the sulfur plus r plus,

397
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,950
and our CEO, plus all these things
can substitute for hydrogen.

398
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,920
And we're going to talk about those.
Okay?

399
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,250
Now the mechanism is that the Deuterium
d plus the Deuteron adds to the ring,

400
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,960
but that notice changes the aromatic
ring into just a regular pen to diagonal

401
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,680
system. So you lose a lot of
resonance stabilization. It happens,

402
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,130
but it's not, not very stable.
And it will easily come off again,

403
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,430
if there's anything that can take
a proton. But if you have a very,

404
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:44,820
very non nuclear fillic non-basic solvent,
nothing to take it off,

405
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,260
then it can stay on. And in fact,
you can get, uh, it's observable.

406
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,270
You can get specter of it. And uh, so
in electrophilic addition to Alkenes,

407
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,320
the next thing that happens is
a nucleophile would add, right?

408
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,850
And you'd lose the double bond.

409
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,200
But here it's easier to lose the
Deuteron or more. Interestingly,

410
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,830
the Proton, losing the Deuteron would
take you back to the starting material,

411
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,760
but losing a proton, the h then
takes you to the substituted product.

412
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,810
And that's easier than that.
Adding a nucleophile because,

413
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,820
because you get back to the aromatic
stabilization 30 kilocalories.

414
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,960
And remember we just saw spectrum that
looked like that, right? This is the,

415
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,070
when you added, not age, but
c h three plus to the, uh,

416
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,730
to the benzene, to the, in this
case, the heck's a methyl benzene.

417
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,260
So it's possible to see
these things in Nmr. Okay?

418
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:41,400
So there's the benzene, the d
plus comes on. We get that, uh,

419
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,830
it noticed that it converts the ring,

420
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,660
the aromatic ring into a chain destroying
the hermiticity. Let's look at the,

421
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:52,740
uh, at the orbitals that are involved
just using this simple local program.

422
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,720
So the benzene, we've looked at this, the
orbitals of that on the left and Penta,

423
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:01,110
Diane, or we looked at before too,
and we see it on the right now,

424
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:06,111
the most interesting orbital and Penta
diagonal is that the one that's indicated

425
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:10,780
in yellow over there,
right? The highest, uh, the,

426
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,700
the highest of the three orbital, the
low three orbitals, and it's a zero.

427
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,120
And you know, it's a zero, the
same energy as a p orbital.

428
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,890
How do you know the energy of that
molecular orbital consisting of three p

429
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:26,070
orbitals is the same energy
as a normal p orbital.

430
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,910
No, but remember if you make a double
bond to put the two next to one another,

431
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:35,660
they overlap. You get one goes down,
one goes up. It's not the same energy,

432
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:39,710
but this one has the same energy as an
isolated p orbital. How do you know that?

433
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,530
Notice how many nodes are
there in the lowest one.

434
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:47,120
The one that's about minus two. How many
nodes among the, for the Pi orbitals.

435
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,110
One, two, one, two, three, four,

436
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:53,180
five p orbitals connected in a chain.

437
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,340
What's how many nodes in the
lowest combination? Zero. Zero.

438
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:02,120
Except for the node of the P. Orbitals
of course. So zero. Then the next one,

439
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,040
the one that's at about minus one or
one. How about the RS? Two. Three. Two.

440
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,180
Okay. And so there are two nodes,
red, white, red on the top. Okay.

441
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,460
Now how do we know the energy of that?

442
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,440
How much overlap is there? None.
They're not next to one another.

443
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,710
So it's the same as an
isolated p orbital [inaudible].

444
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,630
At the huckle approximation. Okay. So
that, that one is very interesting.

445
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,610
That's so mo,
it's uh,

446
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:33,300
it's non bonding in the case where
we have a single electron in there,

447
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,790
which is what's shown. Okay. So that's,

448
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,350
that's the locus of that odd
electron in the free radical,

449
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,140
right? If we have five
Pi electrons, the fifth,

450
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:47,440
the one that's not in a pair
is in those three positions.

451
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,450
Now suppose we're interested in the cad
ion with five p orbitals in a row. Okay.

452
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,381
So we're,

453
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:57,090
we're gonna do is take that electron out
and where we take it out is now going

454
00:29:57,091 --> 00:30:00,910
to be a positive charge.
So that's the same as the locus,

455
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,580
or pardon me if we put another
electron in and the anti,

456
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,940
and that would be the locus of the
negative charge and in the cat eye and the

457
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,500
locust of the positive charge.

458
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,010
And that's the same thing we did get by
drawing resonance structures that show

459
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,970
the, those same positions have in
charges or free radicals in them.

460
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,250
Okay. So those are the positions of
positive charge and we get the same thing.

461
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:25,090
Drawing residents pictures right now.

462
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,950
Consider the influence on rate of Eh,
of substituting,

463
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,090
not benzene,

464
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,010
but something that all of benzine that
already has some x group on it. Okay.

465
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,900
Now what a very common thing to have
studied with this was nitration because

466
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,820
it's such an easy reaction to do.

467
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,330
It's very vigorous
reagent and o two plus it,

468
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,960
you make it by just having a
mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid.

469
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,760
Do you see how you get an Otu plus
from that mixture? It's quite simple.

470
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,560
You get a proton from sulfuric acid
and it protests protonate the Ooh,

471
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,130
and then you lose water.
So you've got to know two plus.

472
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,690
So it can be the thing that comes in and
then a proton comes off from the same

473
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:11,110
position and you've got the substitution.
But now when you have x in there,

474
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:15,250
you can get three different isomers,
Ortho, Meta and para, they're called.

475
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,690
Okay.
Notice incidentally that in o two pluses,

476
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:23,080
an interesting molecule because
it's exactly the same as CEO to,

477
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,550
except it has one more proton in
the nucleus of the central atom.

478
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,230
Right? Nitrogen instead
of carbon. Okay? Uh,

479
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,880
so there will be,
so CO2 has,

480
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,370
has a pair of electrons
in that double bond,

481
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:44,350
a pair of electrons on the oxygen that
are in the y or bubbles pointing up and

482
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:45,130
down.

483
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,810
It's also got p orbitals is x
orbitals coming in and out, right?

484
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:52,840
That have the same kind of thing. But
if we consider just the why or bundles,

485
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,190
right? That'll be the Lumo there.
There are two pairs of electrons.

486
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,650
So the one with no
nodes has two electrons.

487
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,520
The one with one node has two electrons.
This is the one with two nodes,

488
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,950
no electrons. Okay, so that's,

489
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,570
that's the vacant oral would allow
Lumo of an Otu plus just like CO2.

490
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,910
Okay, so I o two plus attacks
and you, we can measure the rate.

491
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,190
Now what we're going to
do to measure the rate,

492
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:21,280
we could do careful work
with a stopwatch and so on,

493
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,200
but there's a clever way to do it,

494
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,240
which is to compare to
follicular by doing them both.

495
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,950
Put both in there and do the reaction
for just a little while and then kill it,

496
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,510
right?
If you had base,

497
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:38,950
you won't have the strong acid and the
reactional stop and now see how much of

498
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,870
each one is con is it becomes product,

499
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,060
so we get relative rates that way,

500
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:49,061
so we're going relative rates compared
to hydrogen being one that has benzene

501
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:52,700
when excess hydrogen,
okay. Effects is methyl,

502
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,920
it's 25 times faster.

503
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,250
That is if you have 25 times as much
benzene as tall youin the one with methyl

504
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:00,830
on it,

505
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,880
you'll get equal amounts of the products
at first until you've used up all the

506
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:09,110
tall Youin, so it's 25 times faster,
so methyl helps the reaction, Oh,

507
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,300
h really helps it.
If you use funnel,

508
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:15,920
it's a thousand times faster if getting
the sum of all the products right now,

509
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,420
why are those so fast?

510
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,870
Because electron donation eases the
formation of the carbon cad I and

511
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:26,210
intermediate or looked at a different way.

512
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,400
The carbon cad ions are stable because
there are other electrons that become

513
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,100
stabilized when you get a
cad. I in there, for example,

514
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,720
the unshared pair on oxygen.

515
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,500
Ah, okay. Okay.

516
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,260
Now that's because we
have positive charge.

517
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,440
We have positive charges
to those locations. When x
is there, that helps out.

518
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,160
Okay.

519
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,490
Now if you put an o two as acts,
so it's already there,

520
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:55,990
then it's six times 10 to the minus eight,
it's 10 to the minus seven,

521
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,410
10 million times slower.
Okay,

522
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,960
so you and the same if you have trimethyl
ammonium with its positive charge,

523
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,640
you don't want to make those cat ions if
there's another cat eye in there or if

524
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,920
there's an [inaudible] group there,
right?

525
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,710
So those are electron
withdrawing and they retired.

526
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:16,730
The formation of cad ion intermediate,

527
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,740
the most interesting as many times
is the halogen. The halogen is a,

528
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,230
is is slower than than benzene,
but not much slower.

529
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,900
Only 30 times slower.
Right?

530
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,770
And that's because both things
are happening with halogen.

531
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,130
It's withdrawing electrons
in the sigma bond,

532
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,820
but it has an unshared pair
that donates back so that,

533
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,680
so that it mostly cancels.

534
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,810
Okay. Uh, now

535
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,610
why is n o two electron withdrawing
when Oah is electron donating?

536
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,920
Oh,
is more electronegative than nitrogen.

537
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,150
So you might think that that always
should be more electron withdrawing.

538
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,290
Uh,

539
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,210
unshared pair on nitrogen is higher
energy than the unshared pair on oxygen

540
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,920
should be more electron donating.

541
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,180
So this seems at first glance
to be sort of nuts that that uh,

542
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,240
that o h is a thousand times faster and
then o two is 10 million times slower.

543
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,940
But it's pretty easy to understand
when you look at the orbitals that are

544
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,400
involved.
So in the case of oxygen,

545
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,870
there's this unshared pair on the oxygen,
which can overlap with the,

546
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,560
with the p orbitals on the benzene ring,
right?

547
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,690
It turns out indeed that the,

548
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,830
that the energy of the oxygen unshared
payer is about the same as Pi,

549
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,090
have a carbon carbon
bond, right? So that the,

550
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:42,670
so that the p the,
the,

551
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,950
the unshared pair on Austin has about
that energy about minus one on the scale

552
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,440
we're talking about here. Okay. So that's,

553
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,040
that's unusually high as
Pi are unusually high.

554
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,360
So they mixed with the, uh, so when
you have a vacant orbital next door,

555
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,890
right, those electrons get
stabilized. Okay. So it's a high homo,

556
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:05,430
good overlap with fennel and
therefore, Ooh, can donate.

557
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,860
It's a unshared pair. Okay, that's
good. Now, how about an o two?

558
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,330
Well,
notice that an o two is Al Lilly.

559
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,880
It's got three p orbitals on each
oxygen and on the nitrogen. Uh,

560
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,460
okay.

561
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,350
So it's going to have a low occupied
molecular orbital that gives good overlap

562
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:29,730
with fennel, right? So that
one was able to donate,

563
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,410
uh, electronics because it has good
overlap, but it's not willing to share.

564
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:37,560
It's electrons. It's electrons
are very low in energy, right?

565
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:41,370
They're not going to be much stabilized
by having a vacant orbital next door,

566
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,460
so you're not gonna get anything
out out of that from the low one.

567
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,350
The next orbital of the [inaudible]
system has a node in the middle, right?

568
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,670
That one.
Now that one has the,

569
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:56,820
the energy shown in yellow there,
it's going to be very good, right?

570
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,140
It's got a good high homo, as high
as, as the p orbital on oxygen.

571
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,380
So it should be good at donating electrons
that having its electron stabilized

572
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,310
by the vacant orbital in the
benzene ring. But it's not. Why not?

573
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,144
Can you see,

574
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,960
why doesn't this orbital be stabilized
by mixing with orbitals that are on the

575
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,740
benzene ring?
Because there's no overlap.

576
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,850
It doesn't have any size where
it's adjacent to the benzene ring.

577
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,620
So it has no overlap.
So it's willing to give its electrons,

578
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:33,840
but it's not able because
there's no overlap.

579
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,240
And finally you have the the third of
the aloe leaf orbitals that one though,

580
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,680
which is a low Lumo right?

581
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,400
And it has good overlap with fennel.
So it,

582
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,590
it withdraws electrons.

583
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,090
It's willing to take electrons cause it's
unusually low and it has overlapped so

584
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:55,740
it's able to accept electrons. So that's
why nitro is electron withdrawing.

585
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,930
When Oah is electron donating,

586
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:02,340
it's because of that node in the middle
that makes it unable to give electrons

587
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,420
to the benzene ring.
So in o two is that Pi acceptor,

588
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:10,110
whereas Oah is a Pi donor.
Okay.

589
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:14,250
Now we just looked at the rates of
these reactions are forming all three

590
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:18,780
products together, but we
might be interested in the
individual products, Ortho,

591
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:21,360
Meta, and para. So let's look at that.

592
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,160
In the case of hydrogen will call
each of these one. That's our,

593
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,330
and now we'll do mixtures of hydrogen with
others. But now we'll analyze those x,

594
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,890
the ones that already have an exit them.

595
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,860
We'll analyze whether it's Ortho mare
that metta or para and how much of each

596
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:40,420
one. Now, if its methyl, you see
that two of them are very fast,

597
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:44,560
but one of them is not fast compared to
what it was when all the hydrogen this

598
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:48,580
on the ring, how do you, how do you
understand the two that are fast?

599
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,970
Why are those fast when x is methyl?

600
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,630
Linda,
do you have an idea

601
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,720
when x up here is [inaudible]
this is good and this is good.

602
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:10,500
39 and 46 but this one is not any better.

603
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,210
Okay?

604
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,650
Nothing wants to be where the cat
eye on is. Okay, so it's good.

605
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:20,100
Especially good here and
especially good here, but not here.

606
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:23,520
They're only hydrogens here, here and
here and it has the same rate as hydrogen.

607
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay, that's fine. If you'd
look at at t butyl now again,

608
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,090
it's fast over here,

609
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,183
right?

610
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,300
But it's not fast here.

611
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,190
So why don't you get this product?

612
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,440
When you have the r group here, when
it's t butyl, you get one, your methyl,

613
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:46,350
but not when it's t beautiful.
Nathan, you got an idea?

614
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,170
It's steric hindrance.
It's too big.

615
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:52,410
It's hard to put this extra group here
when you have something big there already.

616
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,430
Okay, so that's good. Uh,

617
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,900
so now there are two things
about a substituent x.

618
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,780
Does it make it go faster or
does it make it go slower?

619
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:08,030
Is it activating or deactivating?
And so it's activated.

620
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,750
These are faster than benzene.
And how is it directing what,

621
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,210
what does it direct? It's
Ortho and para. Right?

622
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,880
For the reason we saw
accepted in the t butyl case,

623
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,260
it's not very much Ortho because of
steric hindrance as Nathan told us.

624
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,360
Okay. So those are elect,
those are electron donating
and liked to be Ortho para.

625
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,160
Other things being equal.

626
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,960
Now here's one that's the
same size as that as that uh,

627
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,170
neopentyl group that are the
t butyl group, the carbon
with three methyls on it.

628
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,570
Right? But notice it's very much
slower. Right? And we saw that before,

629
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,770
but it's selectively slower.
It slowed much more here.

630
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,740
Point six times down to the
minus eight than it is here.

631
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,760
Three times 10 to the minus eight.
So it's slow to get product,

632
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:57,630
but when you get product, this
is the one you get, right? Metta,

633
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,210
you don't get Ortho and para,
especially,

634
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:03,240
you don't get Ortho because
it's sterically hindered. Right?

635
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,730
But you see that's the
same thing if you want to,

636
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,780
if you want to form these things,
when x has a plus charge,

637
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,850
don't put it here and don't put it here.
If you're going to do it, put it there.

638
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:18,600
Make it as far away as
possible. So if that's up, okay.

639
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,670
And the same thing is true of nitro.
It's slowed down everywhere, right?

640
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,900
But it's not nearly as slowed down.
Metta as it is here. It's a slow time.

641
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,310
10 Times more here for,
for Ortho and a whatever.

642
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,870
A 300 times, right? 1,000. Yeah,

643
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,340
300 times slower when it's para.
Okay.

644
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:45,020
And if you have an Ester group, uh,
the same kind of thing is true here.

645
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:49,040
It's 10 times slower here than here.
Twice slower here than there.

646
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,081
Okay.

647
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:55,760
So those are deactivating for the reasons
we talked about before and their Meta

648
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:57,440
directing.
But again,

649
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:02,000
halogen especially
interesting because it's,

650
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,380
notice it's slowed down,
right? It's deactivating,

651
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,950
but it's Ortho para directing.

652
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,570
So it shows both these characters
deactivating and Ortho para. Why?

653
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,650
It's deactivating because of the
electron withdrawal, which is sigma.

654
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,990
But if you're going to make it,

655
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,490
at least make it where the halogens
unshared pair can be stabilized by the V,

656
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,170
the next by the vacant
orbital next door. Uh, okay.

657
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,910
Now how can you make the reaction work
better to electrophilic substitution?

658
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:42,860
You can make the electro file better.
So C plus would be a great, uh,

659
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,170
uh, nucleophile but you don't, but
you don't buy c plus you have cl two.

660
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,010
So what would be the,
what's the low Lumo here of in cl to

661
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,200
pass this maybe 15 times before
and lecture Sigma Star. Okay.

662
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,990
It's,
but it's not nearly as low as cl plus.

663
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,520
One way to make it better is to treat
it with the Lewis acid catalyst,

664
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,260
like ALC l three,
which has a vacant orbital on aluminum,

665
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,430
which can attack and unshared
pair on the chlorine like that.

666
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,260
And now you have a minus formal charge
on the aluminum and plus on the chlorine.

667
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:24,860
It's a better leaving group,
right? So now you can do it better.

668
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,150
So cl two won't be nearly
as reactive as ALC l five.

669
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,650
Okay.

670
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,150
Here we can compare their lumos and see
it's essentially the same Lumo but it's

671
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,490
lower in the case of ALC l five.

672
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,760
So we can do this reaction and
it'll behave as if it were cl. Plus,

673
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
if you look at the surface charge 0.29
positive their point or 29 there and 38,

674
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,750
uh, on the one with ALC l three. So it's
a better, it's a better electro file.

675
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,010
So adding a Lewis acid makes
these things work better.

676
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,790
So the leaving group is then ALC
l four minus rather than cl minus.

677
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,370
And remember before when we said that the
rate of addition to Alkenes of bromine

678
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,100
is in some solvents is second order
and bromine because that second bromine

679
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:20,471
molecule makes the leaving group br three
minus rather than br minus and makes

680
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:23,210
the reaction better.
Exactly the same idea here.

681
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,040
Another way to make the reaction
better is to activate the nucleophile.

682
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,250
So salycilic acid,
which was studied by Colby,

683
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,270
same guy who excoriate advant
off about stereochemistry, uh,

684
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,600
invented the way to make
salycilic acid or uh, yeah.

685
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,420
Uh, so you start with
funnel, you reacted with CO2,

686
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,670
which has that vacant orbital
we talked about, right?

687
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,290
Like the one and I know two plus.

688
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,360
So you could imagine that reaction just
like an o two plus except that co two.

689
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:58,750
Is it nearly as low as an Otu plus
with its extra proton? So you could,

690
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,370
but you can make the nucleophile better.
Right?

691
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,600
In the previous slide we saw making
the electrified better. Okay.

692
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,890
So here we have the unshared para
nitrogen oxygen, which helps this out.

693
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:16,250
But we could make it ever so much better
by putting base in and making it a

694
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:18,940
higher unshared pair.

695
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:22,830
And now you have a big push to
do it and you get salycilic acid,

696
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,710
which is the way it aspirin,
where aspirin comes from,

697
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:27,960
from putting CO2 on funnel.

698
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,540
Now you can imagine the same thing
for Nh two. It's a higher, uh,

699
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,070
unshared pair than the one
on oxygen normally. Okay?

700
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:42,540
So it would do this pushing
too. And you could nitrate, uh,

701
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,460
Anilin Amino benzene is called Anilin.
And in fact,

702
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,490
this was proposed and in fact
used in 1944 as a rocket fuel,

703
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,750
a mixture of nitric acid and analysts.

704
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,950
And there's a little story I'm going to
tell here about a good friend of mine,

705
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:02,670
Dennis Tanner, who was a professor for
many years at the University of Alberta,

706
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:07,671
but when he was a postdoc
who was at Stanford and he's
a very hard worker and he

707
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:10,500
was working in the lab on the 4th of July.

708
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,840
Not many people were
working on the 4th of July,

709
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,170
but several people where they passed
each other in the hall and they decided

710
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,520
they should have some fun too.

711
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,570
So they decided that each person would
put on display out in the parking lot.

712
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,450
So what, uh, uh, uh,

713
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,260
Dennis had heard about this being a self
igniting rocket fuel's so he thought

714
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:31,770
it'd be fun to mix to nitrate analysts
to do the nitration of Andaman.

715
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,680
So he got concentrated
nitric acid and put it in a,

716
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,940
in a beaker and he got anilin and put
it in a separatory funnel and hung it

717
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,590
above the beaker and he crouched down and
grabbed the thing and twisted it and I

718
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:44,490
started to run.

719
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,650
But the instant it hit before he'd
gotten more than two paces is enormous

720
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:54,330
fireball that burned off his
eyebrows. Right? So indeed,

721
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:59,280
this is a very, very active
nitration reaction. Okay.

722
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:02,640
Has Dennis proved okay?
But you can tame it.

723
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,870
If you put an asset deal
group on the Anilin,

724
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,000
then you lower the energy of the unshared,
pair the,

725
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,870
the Pi Star of the carbon eel
mixes with it. It lowers it.

726
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,140
Now you don't have so much
of a push anymore, right?

727
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,270
And now the nitration still takes
place. It's still Ortho, para directing.

728
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,500
Right? But it doesn't burden
your eyebrows off. Okay.

729
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,070
So the Acetylation of Andel and
makes its nitration controllable.

730
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,430
So you can start with Anilin,
uh,

731
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,590
react it with asset deal chloride and
parody in which is often used as a

732
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:40,210
catalyst for putting assets deal groups
on. We'll talk about that later, right?

733
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,830
And now you can do the
nitration, right? And you get,

734
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,010
you see it's Ortho para directing,
not Meta directing.

735
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,350
So the unshared pair is
still doing its work,

736
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,010
but not as dramatically as
in Dennis's case. Right?

737
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,060
But then if you really wanted to do the
titration of animal and now you take the

738
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,330
asset deal group back off again,
right? So you have the product.

739
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,190
So you tame the nitration.

740
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,440
Now I just want to introduce
the biographical part of
this and we'll talk about

741
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:09,490
the rest of it next time.

742
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,140
So the Friedel crafts reaction is one
of the most important electrophilic

743
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,640
substitution reactions.
In fact,

744
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:17,650
it's one of the most important
reactions all together.

745
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,850
And it was named after Charlotte
Free Del and James Mason crafts free.

746
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:26,200
Del was a Frenchman notice he's seven
years older than crafts who was an

747
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:26,980
American.

748
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,980
So this is a great example of where
America stood in international science in

749
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:36,130
the last part of the 19th century.
Okay.

750
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,400
So these are the publications of James
Mason crafts from 1862 when he was a

751
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:46,450
student until 1915 when
he, when he, when he died.

752
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,330
So some of his papers were on organic
chemistry and they didn't have free Dell

753
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:55,570
as a coauthor. And there is
at, at different ages there,

754
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,630
he published a number as a
student there as you'll see,

755
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,100
but then kept publishing.
Uh, now here's his,

756
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,670
here's his trajectory. He was
born in Boston. He studied at

757
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,570
Harvard. Okay. Uh, then,

758
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,440
but then the learn real science,
he went to Europe first.

759
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:18,580
He went to Germany for just
a short period. He worked
with Bunsen exam actually.

760
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,410
Then he went to France and worked with
boards, the successor of Dumas. Okay.

761
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,970
And he stayed there for four years,
right. And then he came back.

762
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,930
He actually inspected mines
in Mexico for a year. Okay.

763
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,020
But then California,
then he went to Cornell,

764
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:38,290
which had just been founded to be the
chemistry professor for a couple of years.

765
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,240
Then he went to MIT,
right. And then he was ill,

766
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,320
but also tired of not doing
research and he went back to Paris.

767
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,660
He went back for just two years,

768
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:54,810
but he stayed for 17 years and now
he was working with his Palfrey Dell,

769
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,670
who we'd met at a student as
a student in [inaudible] lab.

770
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,710
Then he came back to MIT and in fact
he was president of Mit for two years,

771
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,930
around 1900 okay.

772
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,380
Now here are his papers that
are not organic chemistry.

773
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:12,340
There are about thermometry about physical
chemistry and notice he did most of

774
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:15,760
the publication during the second
period in Paris when he was doing only

775
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:19,600
research. But if you look at
his papers with Free Dell,

776
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,710
they're an enormous number of,
during this period when he was in America,

777
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:28,670
he published almost nothing. Right
when he was in, he published a lot,

778
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:33,200
both as a student when he started working
with Friedl and especially after he

779
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:37,790
came back in these 17 years. So he
published 100 papers during these years,

780
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,920
99 papers during those years.

781
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,760
So it wasn't possible to do the kind of
research in this country that you could

782
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:48,050
do over there. Okay. And then in 1877,

783
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,410
they've published a, when you just,
after he had gone back to, uh, to, uh,

784
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,570
recover and, and, uh, work with his
Palfrey Dell at the School of mines,

785
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,920
they published a really important paper
and most of those read publications

786
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,430
after that are about this
free del crafts reaction.

787
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,020
And they got into it because they had
been students together working with boards

788
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,910
and we'll talk about this then next time.
