Well, if you were to think of these items in a spreadsheet that

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.689
table would look like this. The spreadsheet

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.320
itself is the object, the columns are

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.730
fields, and the actual entries are the records. So the items are the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.610
objects, the properties are the fields, and

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.510
the Udacity T-shirt would be one record.
