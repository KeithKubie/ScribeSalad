00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Of course, we learned that the Kalman filter is unimodal, just a single bump,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
whereas histograms and particles can have multiple bumps.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Kalman filter was more efficient than the histogram and the particles

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that both require exponentially many units in the number of dimensions in the worst case.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And yes, my god, they are all extremely useful--super, super useful

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in case you didn't get this from the class.
