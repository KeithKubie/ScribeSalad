00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.710
SPEAKER: How many
steps should be

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.860
between receiving a
notification and acting on it?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.480
When notification actions
were introduced in Jelly Bean,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.030
this number dropped to one.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.510
Just tap an action right there.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.420
Direct Reply seeks to
make it just as easy

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.730
to receive text input from
the user right in line

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.810
in the notification.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.800
This involves superpowering
one or more of the actions

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.290
you add to your notification
with a RemoteInput.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.490
This is how the system knows
to ask for input from the user,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.259
then forward it on to your app.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.440
This is actually
the exact same API

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.320
used to add voice input to your
notifications on Android Wear,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.270
but it's now available
on phones and tablets.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.940
So we'll have a
notification with an action

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.030
with a RemoteInput.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.730
The RemoteInput is what stores
information like the hint

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.810
text-- the text that appears
before the user types anything

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.850
in-- and the key,
a unique string

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.380
used to later retrieve
what the user typed in.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.620
The action here is
pretty standard.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.319
Of course, we'll want to
use addRemoteInput to add

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.690
our RemoteInput object.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.990
There's also a
setAllowGeneratedReplies method

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.000
if you want to enable Smart
Reply on Android Wear 2.0

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.640
watches.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.230
We are trying to make things
easy for users, right?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.920
Totally worth enabling.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.100
There is one other
thing we need to be

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.510
aware of-- the PendingIntent
we're passing in here.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.530
Turns out what kind
of PendingIntent

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.560
you pass in matters a lot.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.560
For Direct Reply, the system
is doing the UI portion for us,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.330
so using a Service
or BroadcastReceiver

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.680
is exactly what we need.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.060
This also allows it to work
even when the device is locked.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.965
Awesome.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.170
But on devices that don't
support Direct Reply,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.000
you need to start your own
UI-- namely, an Activity.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.590
Avoid trying to
start an Activity

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.090
from a Service or
BroadcastReceiver

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.320
PendingIntent.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.795
The notification shade
won't automatically dismiss,

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:01.380
and users will need to manually
unlock a locked device,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.380
leaving users unsure if
anything actually happened.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.850
So we'll want to use an
Activity on Marshmallow

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.720
and lower devices and the
Service or BroadcastReceiver

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.490
for our new Direct
Reply supported devices.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.840
Now, on to the
notification itself.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.280
The best part, Direct
Reply doesn't care

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.080
about your notification at all.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.680
As long as you add the
action, you're good to go.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.440
Of course, we did build
a fancy MessagingStyle.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.590
So if you're a
messaging app, these two

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.640
go perfectly together.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.180
Magical.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.790
So let's say we're ready
to receive our reply

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.125
and chosen a
BroadcastReceiver, appropriate

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.342
if we're OK with only
using the main thread.

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:45.330
We can then use
codes such as this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.910
to extract the text from
the intent passed in.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.440
You'll note we use remoteInput
getResultsFromIntent

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.250
to get a bundle, and
then use that key we

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.790
passed in to the remoteInput
here to retrieve the text.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.700
Of course, if you
stop here, you'll

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.680
notice your remoteInput just
keeps on spinning forever.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.090
So there's one last step--
updating your notification.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.960
Updating the
notification is how you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400
tell the user the
text has been saved

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.940
or the message has been sent.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.420
For example, if you're
using MessagingStyle,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.920
you just append your
message to the style

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.010
and rebuild your notifications.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.750
For other styles,
you can and should

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.120
use setRemoteInputHistory,
which will append the message

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.270
or messages to the bottom
of the notification.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.110
Now, keep in mind, I
said update, not cancel.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.750
You want to tell the
user it succeeded,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.340
rather than leaving
them hanging.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.400
So add a remoteInput to
your notifications actions

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
to enable Direct Reply.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.500

how it all works as you

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.280
continue to build better apps.
