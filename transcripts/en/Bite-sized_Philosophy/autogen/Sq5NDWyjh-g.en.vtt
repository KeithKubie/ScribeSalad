00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 Let us say that you are miserable and miserable 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.920
 Okay... 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.500
 Here's a solution 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.500
 Find out what's worth to you ... 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.360
 And get rid of it ... 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.260
 Well, we can probably say it is a relationship you are in 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.220
 Maybe it is your relationship with your parents 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.820
 That relationship is a satisfactory one 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.500
 But you are doomed to do it 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.560
 No wonder it's a relationship with your parents 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 You are suffering terribly because of it 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.700
 What do you do? 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.500
 Maybe let it go / end it is a sacrifice 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.880
 The idea is that it will explain the future to you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.580
 Very often when people suffer horribly 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.040
 Not always, because you sometimes only suffer 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 Stupidly, blindly and without shelter 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 You get cancer and then you die 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400
 We have no idea how to handle it 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.660
 But sometimes the reason you are suffering 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.760
 It is simply that you do not get rid of the thing that bites you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.700
 "I can not get rid of that," she says. 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.860
 I had reviewers such as "I can not stop communicating with my mom who calls me 3 times a day" 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.040
 "Every day of my life ... does not say anything other than critical and insulting words that are unbelievable" 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.580
 "I can not get rid of that" 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.260
 Okay... 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.510
 This is not a good idea 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.380
 The funny thing is often when people get rid of something like that 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.660
 Go away ... Solves himself and returns to them 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.440
 So they do not end up losing it even 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 But unless they are ready to call him, he goes on to sacrifice himself 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.200
 They will not make any progress at all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.160
 So one of the rules is ... 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.580
 If people are hindering your progress ... 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.080
 You must sacrifice your relationship with them 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.240
 It is a very very harsh base
