00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.140
- Hey, it's me, Destin.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.520
This is my buddy Chad.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.353
- Hey.

00:00:04.353 --> 00:00:06.240
- We are absolutely giddy
because we've been working

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.510
on something for how long?

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.660
- 12 years.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.610
- Well, I'll be like that's us hanging out

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.780
but we're working on this
project for how long?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.700
- I don't know, a good four months.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.533
- Four months.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.700
Chad's really good at
software and we had an idea

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.910
and so there's a patent pending product

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.743
that we're working on.

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:23.980
What it does is it eliminates
kickback from handsaws.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.650
Chad, do you wanna explain
what's going on here.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.930
- Yeah, so you'll be
cutting a piece of big

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.580
a big sheet of plywood and
as you get down towards

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.390
the middle of it the pieces
that you've already cut

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.010
start to bend towards each
other and they'll pinch

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.900
the blade and when the blade
gets pinched it becomes

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.070
kind of a wheel and these
teeth, since they're coming

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.140
back towards you, catch in
the wood and then the whole

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.380
saw comes back at you.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.213
- It's a big deal.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.440
If you've ever had it
happen, maybe a couple drops

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.358
of pee came out.

00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:49.191
- Terrifying.

00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:50.540
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.680
We're gonna show how it works
first with the high speed

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.930
camera and then we'll
show you the fix we have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.840
for kickback.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.917
- [Chad] Turning it on, three, two, one.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.667
(motor rumbling)

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:02.491
It wants to go.

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.324
- [Destin] It wants to go?

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.451
I'm ready.

00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:05.951
- Three, two, one.

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.690
- [Destin] Whoa, it's still on, kill it.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.703
What are we doing?

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:18.470
- [Chad] And it came out
'cause it got to the knot.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.430
- You notice we have
this chain and we've got

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.170
this danger radius there.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740
Will you show and make
sure that the chains

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.053
not gonna hit the, yeah.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.753
(motor revving)

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:33.279
(gentle music)

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:35.712
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.650
- You need something for
these safety glasses.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.720
Because of the rotation
direction of the blade,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.400
the saw is lifted up out
of the workpiece and then

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.430
that rotation, again,
causes it to be propelled

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.030
towards the user.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.100
Now obviously, if this
were to really happen

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.710
you would want to release
the trigger on the saw

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160
and in this test we have it
zip tied so we can actually

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.960
see what's happening
but I found, personally,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.470
that my body tenses up when I get startled

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.870
and I'm not so sure that I
would have enough control

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.200
in the moment to make the
decision to release the trigger.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.660
Let's look at another run
and I'll stand just outside

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.540
the danger zone and I'll
pull focus on the camera lens

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.820
and we'll see if we can measure
the human response times

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.613
required to avoid injury.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:19.761
Whoa.

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.011
- That's scary.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.540
- [Destin] Okay, in this run,
look at the timer in the top

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.590
right of the screen that's
counting from the moment

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.240
the saw starts rising up out of the wood.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.400
You can see that the
blade is fully released

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.570
from the wood within 80 milliseconds

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.260
and it's already headed up
towards your gonadular region.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.550
Assuming that you don't
tense up, you would need

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.980
to respond by releasing
the trigger well within

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.000
a tenth of a second.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.400
Once the blade is freed from
the wood, there's no longer

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.380
any resistance and therefore
the blade increases speed

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.170
because the motor is adding angular

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.720
momentum to the system.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.810
Now that makes it even more
dangerous and you can see

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.050
here when the blade falls
back down and comes back

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.660
in contact with the wood,
just imagine if that was flesh

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.240
and keep in mind here that
this is a slow-mo video.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
All of this that you're
seeing here is happening

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.550
in just a tenth of a
second after the blade

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.140
has lept up out of the wood.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800
Obviously the ideal time
to respond to a kickback

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.440
event is before the saw
even leaves the wood.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.900
The problem with all this
is often times humans

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.673
simply can't react that quickly.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.050
That is no bueno.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.440
It's a bad day, man.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.000
Okay, so that's kickback.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.650
It's very scary.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.520
Now what we're gonna do is
show you what we've made.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.420
What would you call it?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.030
It's a multi-axis detection
system that can figure out

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.340
kickback based on machine learning.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.535
- Keep going.

00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:37.160
- [Destin] And basically
dynamically break the motor.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.220
- Yeah, so I can give you a demo

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.970
on the first one that I built.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.170
So I'm gonna turn it on
and let go with my finger

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.853
and you'll hear it turn off quickly.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
See that?

00:03:45.963 --> 00:03:46.977
- [Destin] Yeah.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.270
- If there was no brake,
it would just keep

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.700
it would keep spinning.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.740
So I put a sensor in
there to sense a kickback

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.840
so that when I do that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.270
it shuts off automatically.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.680
- [Destin] So your finger
was still on the trigger

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.131
but you just accelerated it backwards.

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.370
- Right, this was the
first one that I built

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.040
and since I just used an accelerometer

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.700
there are some false alarms

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.170
like if you bounce it
around or just normal use

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.820
it can trigger and the new one that I did

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.290
I used a nine-axis accelerometer,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.490
gyroscope and magnetometer.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.430
So the really fancy thing
that we're doing here

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.000
is we're doing a machine
learning algorithm.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.960
- [Destin] So you don't care.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.700
- I'm not really programming in exactly

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.570
what the thresholds are
that I need it to sense.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm taking data from dozens
to hundreds of people

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.340
using a saw in normal, everyday ways

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.470
and feeding that information
into a neural network

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.160
and I'm comparing,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.993
stop grinning.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.170
- We're cutting plywood here.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.800
- So machine learning works
by you take a big data set

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.150
of people using it in
normal ways and then another

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.700
big data set of kickback
events and the computer

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.220
automatically takes all
those, all those data sets

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.840
and figures out what the anomalies are.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.500
What's unique to kickback that's
different from normal use.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.240
- [Destin] So you hogged out
the handle it looks like.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.850
- [Chad] I did.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.670
- [Destin] And so there is
a legit computer in there.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.230
It has accelerometers and gyros in it.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.063
- [Chad] Yep.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.393
- Three, two, one, go.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.490
So it stopped itself?

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.323
- Yeah.

00:05:20.323 --> 00:05:21.690
- It stopped itself.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.710
That's what it does?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.543
- That's what it does.

00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:24.530
- That's awesome.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.270
- [Chad] To better understand
how the system works,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.340
we've overlaid the data
on top of the slow motion.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.350
We're measuring nine
different sensors here

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.980
but for simplicity's sake let's just look

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.230
at the overall magnitude
of the acceleration

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.750
which is in yellow and the magnetic field

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.810
which is in red.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.680
You can see that when the saw itself,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.870
not the blade, but the saw
itself starts to accelerate

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.630
the saw's braking system
is applied and the magnetic

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.040
field starts to work against
the rotation of the blade.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.930
The cool thing about using magnetometers

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.060
is that the algorithm
might be able to detect

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.120
the magnetic field from
the motor and then make

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.810
decisions based on that
information as well.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.340
- [Destin] And so you just
combined those different

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.960
things together and
make it make a decision.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.720
- Right, I just let it
capture all that data.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.250
I don't tell it what's important.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.220
After the fact, if it's
been a kickback, I annotate

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.700
the data with this was a kickback event

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.500
and then I have a whole
bunch of other files

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.800
that are regular use
cases and it figures out

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.960
what's important in the kickback event

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.020
to trigger output.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.080
- [Destin] That's awesome dude.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.913
- Yeah.

00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:26.360
- [Destin] Three, two, one.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.590
- Ooohh.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.460
- It did stop, though.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.080
- [Chad] So we performed
all of those tests

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.790
by starting the saw while it was already

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.630
bound up in the wood but what would happen

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.850
if we were to spin the saw up first

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.763
before we induced the kickback event?

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.070
This graph is stinkin' awesome
and it tells the whole story.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.903
Let me walk you through it.

00:06:49.903 --> 00:06:51.190
Okay, if you look back here on the left

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.900
you can see this red spike.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.990
That's when the motor was first spun up.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.680
That's the torque
associated with accelerating

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.900
that blade rotationally,
right, so as we move along

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.930
here and we bump the front
of the saw, that induces

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.710
a kickback event and you
can see that in the data

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.240
by this large yellow
acceleration and at that point

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.220
that tells the algorithm
oh, oh, there's kickback

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.350
and so it applies the
brake and you can see

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.770
this red spike in the magnetic field.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.590
That is the saw's brake
being applied and trying

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.470
to stop that rotation of the saw blade

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.700
so you can actually see
that happening and it tapers

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.850
off as the velocity of
the saw blade decelerates.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.683
This is awesome.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:32.290
I mean like high five.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.070
We just used science to
stop a kickback event.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.400
Well, I mean, it's even
cooler because it's

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.270
high five and not high four
which is what could happen

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.670
if the kickback, I'll shut up now.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.770
- Okay, here's the final test.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.640
I know how to run a
circular saw the correct way

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.700
and I also know how to do it the wrong way

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.110
so I'm gonna try to induce
kickback, with the algorithm

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.779
running, from my hand
and see what happens.

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.029
Okay here we go.

00:07:58.232 --> 00:07:59.065
It stopped.

00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:00.510
This should be on saws.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.510
If you can detect the
profile of a kickback event

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.970
in Newtonian physics
then you can implement

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.050
the brake that's already on the saw.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.894
- Yeah, so the brake's already in there.

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:15.470
All you need is a little
sensor to figure out

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.930
when to hit the brake and
that's all we're doing.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.350
- Yeah so if you think
this needs to be in tools

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.260
please tweet this video
to your favorite tool

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.730
manufacturer and then tool manufacturer,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.563
come talk to us.

00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:28.285
We'll put a link down in
the video description.

00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:29.963
- Wait till you see the
chainsaw experiment.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:32.636
(beep)

00:08:32.636 --> 00:08:33.469
- I'm about to tell you something

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:34.302
that's a pretty big deal in my life.

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:36.890
It's a book called Seven
Eves by Neal Stephenson.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.610
I listen to it on Audible
which sponsored this episode.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.580
You can get Seven Eves by Neal Stephenson

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.610
by going to audible dot com slash smarter

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.850
or texting the word smarter to 500 500.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.760
The moon blew up without warning,
and for no apparent reason

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.180
which is like the best
opening line to any book

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.160
for my brain ever.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.830
The whole premise of the
book is the moon is exploded

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.070
and humanity has to get off the earth.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.340
The technology developed
in order to do that,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.490
we could totally do this.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.510
There's a swarm of spacecraft in orbit

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.660
and if you change your orbit
on one side of the earth

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.310
just a little bit that
affects it on the other side

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.387
as well, right?

00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:12.360
But if you have a swarm you
have to account for all of that.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.607
They developed something
called the perambulator

00:09:14.607 --> 00:09:16.690
and I read this book
like eight months ago.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.810
I still think about the
perambulator because

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.410
the orbital mechanics hold true.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.420
Whip dynamics, there's
artificial intelligence

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.260
used in robots to help mine asteroids.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.010
It's amazing so I know
there's supposed to be a movie

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.110
adaptation of this book so Ron
Howard, if you're listening,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.060
I wanna be in the movie.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.160
Whatever, I'm not faking this.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.070
I really like the book.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.950
I love the fact if I'm
listening while I'm driving

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.720
which is how I listen to audiobooks,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.050
I can swipe my finger and tap a button

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.500
and that's how I can
save an audio bookmark.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.640
I can listen to it later.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.560
It's an amazing book.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.580
Seven Eves by Neal Stephenson.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.260
Get this by going to audible

or text the word smarter to 500 500.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.270
That book will change
your life and it'll change

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.103
the way you think.

00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:55.900
The thing I like about this
is it's gonna make your

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.810
life better and that's why
I love my collaboration

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.600
or partnership, whatever
you wanna call it,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.830
with Audible, they're rad.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.130
If you're the kind of
person that subscribes

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.680
to YouTube channels then
I hope you would please

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.530
consider doing that with Smarter Every Day

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.840
if you feel like this
kind of content earns it.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.410
If I've already earned your subscription

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.110
then I would like to try
to work on convincing

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.010
you to click the bell
because the next few videos

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.520
are redonculous, like, we're
starting with rocket saw

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.820
and it just goes up from there.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.050
It's gonna be amazing.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.650
If you wanna learn more
about the stuff Chad and I

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.870
are doing together, we call
it Lantern Safety Kinetics.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.000
There's a link down in
the video description.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480
The idea is to put brains in your hardware

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.440
and make stuff safer.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.890
Thanks for watching these videos.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.680
I really like making 'em
and I hope you like 'em too.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.810
I'm Destin, you're
getting Smarter Every Day.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.236
Have a good one, bye.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.903
