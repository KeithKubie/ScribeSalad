00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.170
So if the elaboration phase is successful, we then move

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.560
to the construction phase, which is our third phase. And

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.550
the construction phase is basically the phase in which most

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.860
of the actual development occurs. In short, all the features considered

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.360
are developed. So we'll continue with our car metaphor that

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.310
we used for the prototype. And in this case we

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.390
will have our complete car ready. Not only the features

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.940
are developed but they're also thoroughly tested. So we have performed

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.490
quality assurance. We have verified and validated the software,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.580
the system and we know that it works correctly. Or

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.620
at least that it works correctly as far as

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.850
we can tell. So, in general, the construction phase is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.760
the phase in which there is a shift in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.640
emphasis from intellectual property development

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.460
to product development. From ideas

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.650
to products. So, what is the outcome of the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.250
construction phase? Well, basically the construction phrase produces a product

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.520
that is ready to be deployed to the users. Specifically,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.570
the phase generates the following outcomes. First of all, at the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.150
end of this phase, all the use cases have been

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.220
realized with traceability information. What does that mean? It means that

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.640
not only all the functionality expressed by the use cases

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.240
have been implemented, but also that we have traceability information from

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.530
the use cases, to the different artifacts. So for example,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.780
we know which part of the design realizes which use case.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.230
We know which part of the implementation is related to a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.150
given use case. Which use cases were derived from a use

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.390
case, and so on and so forth. And in this way

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.310
we can trace our requirements throughout the system. Throughout the different

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.162
artifacts that were developed during the software process. As we were

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:35.790
saying, we also have complete software product here, which is integrated

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.240
on all the needed platforms. Since the system, the software product,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.200
has to be thoroughly tested, we will also have a complete

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.900
set of results for our tests. As part of this

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.980
phase, we will also finalize the user manual, so you'll have

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.050
a user manual ready to be provided to the users, and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.700
ready to be used. And finally, we will have a complete

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.370
set of artifacts that include design documents, code, test cases, and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.440
so on and so forth, so basically all of the artifacts

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.240
that have been produced during the development process. So roughly speaking,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.280
we can consider the product that is produced at the end

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.570
of this phase as a typical beta release. So in case

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.920
you're not familiar with that, a beta release is an initial

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.050
release normally meant for a selected subset of users. So it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.250
is something that is not quite yet ready for primetime, but

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.540
almost. So let's see also in this case, what are the evaluation

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.740
criteria for the construction phase. So how do we assess, that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.620
this third milestone has been accomplished, successfully? We pretty much have

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.510
a complete product ready to be shipped right? So the first question

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.260
we want to ask is, whether the product is stable and mature

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.910
enough to be deployed to users. At the end of this

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.510
phase it has to be. Are the stakeholders ready for the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.160
transition into the user community? Are we ready to go from development

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.450
to production? Are the actual

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.060
resource expenditures versus the planned expenditures

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.890
still acceptable? So what this means is that at this point we

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.660
can really assess whether our estimates were accurate enough with respect

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.740
to what we actually spent for the project up to this point.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.390
So unless we can answer in a positive way to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.790
all these questions, the transition might be postponed by one release.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.930
Because that means that we're still not ready to go

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.660
to the market. We're still not ready to deploy our product.
