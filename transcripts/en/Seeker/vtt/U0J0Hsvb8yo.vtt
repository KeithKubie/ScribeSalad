00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.420
Your brain and body undergo constant change
and upheaval to keep up with your petty conscious

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.420
wants.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.209
If you start running marathons for some reason,
your brain and body have to change, if you

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.829
go get a masters degree, your brain and body
have to change again, and when you decide

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.890
to backpack the Appalachian Trail, your brain
and body change again.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.029
The thing is: marathons, master’s degrees,
and backpacking are all great -- but what

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.220
about something less... ephemeral… like,
motherhood?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.020
So, your mom prolly carried you inside her
body.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.810
And in doing so, it changed.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.810
So.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.810
Much.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.649
Your introduction to her inner self changed
her body, in some cases: forever.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.110
Temporarily, the hormones released during
pregnancy change how a mom sees, smells, and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.350
how food tastes,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.379
but some of her body structures, hair growth,
and how her body stores fat and processes

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.920
food might change permanently.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.469
On top of that, you change your mom’s brain!

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.129
(Maybe for the better?)

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.040
For example, multiple studies have shown mom
brains got larger after they gave birth.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.140
They grew new grey matter -- which normally
doesn’t happen (according to one study)

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.590
without [quote] “significant learning, brain
injury or illness, or major environmental

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.590
change.”

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.810
Meanwhile, another found parts of the brain
associated with emotion, reasoning, rewards,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.810
and sensations all changed to, but with decreases
in grey matter!

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
Grey matter btw is where all the synapses
(or brain connections) are.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.509
Some studies even connect the amount of grey
matter with overall intelligence.

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.479
But it’s not a fast rule.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.420
Regardless, this is new research, so it’s
hard to say exactly what’s going on, just

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.580
that the brain is changing pretty significantly.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.799
Good or bad, one study found the grey matter
change only lasted 2 years (bc remember the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.409
body is constantly changing), but that’s
still pretty cool.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.310
And it’s not just physical, there are emotional
tweaks that come along with all these changes

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.310
too!

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.579
Think about dopamine.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.090
Dopamine is a reward chemical.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.490
Something that makes you feel good.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.090
It’s released anytime evolution wants to
encourage a behavior -- which means when a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.619
mom looks at her newborn BAM.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.619
Dopamine.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.530
Your mom answers the phone when you call,
BAM, dopamine!

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.300
In a 2017 study, the researchers believe dopamine
is where the bond between mother and infant

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300
comes from.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.300
For example, as a mom and baby got more in
sync -- like if they make similar sounds -- the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.320
more dopamine gets released!

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.390
Or, if the mom is attentive to the newborn
she gets more connections in brain areas associated

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.450
with bonding.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.480
Plus, dopamine.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.680
Always dopamine.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
The chemicals that support love are a big
deal in the brain.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.470
Namely dopamine (reward chemical), oxytocin
(if you call this the love hormone i am turning

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.510
this video off right now) and vasopressin
(connected to long-term bonding, and the feeling

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.510
of closeness).

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.030
A 2005 study looked at fMRI scans of 2,500
brains in the “throes of love” and found

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.731
ldopamine rich regions had lots of activity;
specifically in the ventral tegmental, part

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:56.230
of the brain’s “reward circuit.”

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.980
Evolutionarily speaking, the “reward circuit”
is extraordinarily old.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.500
It’s the reason our instinctually driven
predecessors did things that kept them alive.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.230
Think: eating food, parenting, and bonding
with others.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.090
Evolution has wired us to love each other
and to bond.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.020
All these things activate the reward circuit
-- and make your mom love you more.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.400
In the end, love in the mom brain seems to
make it bigger, and more connected, and maybe

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.410
more intelligent.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.500
Plus, it’s got all that dopamine, vasopressin
and oxytocin floating around to keep moms

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.820
rewarded, and bonded with their tiny humans.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.660
But really, it’s just evolution saying,
look at this little thing.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.660
Love it.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.660
Feed it.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.790
Clean up its poop.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.080
Pay to fix the car after he crashes into a
sign at the high school.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
Ahem.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.490
Yeah, we don’t need to get into that.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.490
Love you, Mom!

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.490
Happy Mother’s Day.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.340
This episode was brought to you by Kay Jewelers
– Every kiss begins with Kay.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.540
Maybe you want all these changes, you’re
ready!

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.540
You’re rarin!

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.520
Okay, so how hard is it to get pregnant…

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.720
We’ve got a video on that here.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.930
Mom’s and Dad’s out there, did you change
after your kid?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.930
How?
