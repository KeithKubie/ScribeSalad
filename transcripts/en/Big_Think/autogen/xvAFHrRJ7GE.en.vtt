00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:21.650
legal playing field and we can talk
 

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.980

about some of the specifics but the more
 

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.090
about some of the specifics but the more

have to take that into account so it's

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:33.830
have to take that into account so it's
 

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.830
have to take that into account so it's
very hard to are actually enter into any

I would say that you've got to look at

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440
I would say that you've got to look at

so know this point 12 weeks 18 weeks but

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260
so know this point 12 weeks 18 weeks but
 

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.960
so know this point 12 weeks 18 weeks but
that is where it becomes a irresolvable
