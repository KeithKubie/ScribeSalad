00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.310
The James Webb Space Telescope being developed
by NASA is set to be one the most exciting

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.309
space observatories ever developed!, with
totally novel technologies and instruments

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.200
that will give us new insights into our universe.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.250
But unfortunately, its completion and launch
has been delayed.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.250
Again.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.789
What’s goin’ on?

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.210
The initial completion window for the James
Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, was supposed

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.010
to be between 2007 and 2011.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.802
There were some pretty severe budget and schedule
issues, resulting in a 2011 overhaul of the

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.960
project that set a new completion date for
October of 2018.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
That turned out to be a little too optimistic,
so they pushed it back to May of 2020, and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.030
now here we are with another new hopeful finish
line of March, 2021.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.890
This telescope is the successor to the Hubble
Space Telescope, so this is the kind of telescope

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.010
we send out into space.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.140
All by itself!

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.470
This is where some of the complexities start.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.469
Once launched, the JWST will be out of reach
of the NASA team completely, unreachable even

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.140
by robotic missions.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
This makes it significantly more complicated
than the Hubble which we can service.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.850
After JWST heads out into the great unknown,
that’s it, so we’ve kinda gotta get all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.640
its features right before we say goodbye.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
And this is kinda hard, because James Webb
is most complicated space observatory we’ve

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
ever built.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.000
It’s huge, it has be super sensitive, and
most of its diagnostics are brand new.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.010
For example, its sunshield, which keeps the
telescope at the ideal temperature (below

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.500
50 Kelvin) is the size of a tennis court and
consists of five individual layers.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
It was actually a small tear in this key piece
that was part of the most recent delay.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.420
And then there’s the telescope’s primary
mirror, called the Optical Telescope Element,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.540
or OTE.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.630
This gathers the light coming into the telescope
from space so the other scientific instruments

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.850
on board can measure it.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.950
The OTE is exciting--and difficult--because
a mirror that detects these kinds of signals

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.950
needs to be large, but a mirror this large
has never been launched into space before.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.250
In fact, it’s almost 7 times larger than
Hubble’s mirror, but NASA has engineered

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.280
it to still be lighter than the Hubble mirror
per unit area, so that’s a big innovation.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.010
AND it’s super strong.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.860
AND..it folds!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.080
This gold-plated mirror actually folds up
so it can fit into the launch rocket, and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.940
then it will unfurl once in space.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.140
It also just looks REALLY cool too, like a
giant, shiny golden honeycomb.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.700
To round it all off, most of the scientific
instruments on board are totally new.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.780
Some will observe light on the visible and
infrared spectra, trying to capture objects

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.170
and events that are too distant or too old
to be observed by other instruments.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.560
One of the machines needs a cryocooler to
keep it at a frosty 7 Kelvin so it works properly.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.450
And keep in mind, we have to make sure all
of these new and exciting scientific tools

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.700
will function and transmit data properly for
5-10 years after JWST launches, because once

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300
it’s out there...we can never touch it again.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.890
But if we can accomplish all of this, we hope
it will offer us back here on earth never-before-seen

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.560
resolution of space and will help us see traces
of some of the most distant events and objects

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.570
in our universe--like the very creation of
galaxies, stars, and planets.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.500
It’ll basically be like looking back in
time.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.260
Its launch could mark a new era in astrophysics.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.160
That is, when it ever gets off the ground.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.480
Hey, maybe the JWST is delayed NOW, but if
you're watching from the future we hope you’re

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.590
still subscribed to Seeker to be keeping up
with all the things we’re learning from

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.590
it.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.960
Like this video over here about about how
NASA uses origami for it’s engineering.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.560
Also FYI, the JWST isn’t just a NASA job--the
Canadian and European Space agencies are also

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.120
in on the project, because let’s be real,
space brings us all together.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.930
Thanks for watching Seeker, I’m Maren.
