1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
I mean,

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,920
it'll be a while before anybody's
excited about anybody fighting Jon Jones.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,270
Cause it's like, what do you got?
You know, you got a dude who's just,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,270
there's certain guys like remember when
Anderson was in his prime and you're

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,150
like, what are you going to, who
are you going to throw at him?

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,510
There was nobody there to, Weidman came
along. Everybody that they threw at him,

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,930
you're like, hm, what's Anderson
going to do to this dude?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,690
When's Annison got a knockout?
You should know Cami.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,550
When's he going to connect on this guy?

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,030
And I think that we're in that
situation now with John. You know,

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,470
we've got a Tiago Santos fight that's
coming up. It should be interesting. Yeah.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,540
But it's just the interesting thing
is that Santos is a murderous Stryker.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,070
Is he going to be able to connect? That's
the, that's what makes an interesting.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,700
I think Jones has some of the
best defense, the best wrestling,

15
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,250
grappling and striking
just doesn't get hit.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,020
Distance side kick to your fucking
knee cap is no longer there.

17
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,990
And then when you fucking
thinking about that psychic boom,

18
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:59,550
left elbow to the eye. Orbital. Yup.
It's a tough puzzle. He's like, and he's,

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,700
he doesn't use, he's not light in his
fees, just right there in front of you,

20
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,410
like an unmovable force.
You know,

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,970
it's just going to stand
right there in front of you.

22
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,140
You're not going to go back or nothing.

23
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,260
It's just every catches you catching
a break. He tried to take a breath,

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,220
breath of air. What happened?
Wow. Wow. Wow. Pouring it on Ya.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,690
So it's kicking your legs front,

26
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:18,720
kicking you in the body over and
over and he sees you slowing down.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,530
He's a Predator, man. I wish. Like
they can make a science experiment.

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,030
Make mighty mouse tool five. I meant
that fight happen or shrink Jon Jones.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,830
I make that fight happen. Yeah, no shit.
Right. No Shit. That would be crazy.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,610
That would be crazy.
Yeah.

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,000
See the thing is no tool five or
can move like mighty mouse moves.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,270
You would have to see how can mighty
mouse move it to a five? Yeah,

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,620
because the thing about gravity, there's
no gravity fucking with them. Yeah.

34
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,490
When he's won 25 he's fucking cutting
angles and he's woo woo. Where is he now?

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,890
He's on your legs is he
could do everything. But it's
technique though, is also,

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:59,060
that's when I see him doing
the things like kicks,

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,390
like a fucking tie dude shoots a double
leg, like a fucking good wrestling dude.

38
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,610
It's not like just an
athletic guy that's explosive.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,270
Everything is done just right. You
know, same thing with John. You know,

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
he's got great technique everywhere.
Yeah.

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,550
I mean Matt Hume has produced some great
fighters, but then there's mighty mouse.

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,070
Like he's produced some great town,
but then this mighty mouse,

43
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:21,360
he's like Stan's way out. And you
gotta wonder like, is it mighty mouse?

44
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,830
Is it Matt Hume putting more emphasis
on him? Is it a combination of things?

45
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,960
Cause you usually,
when you get a guy that's that good,

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,960
you get a gym that starts producing
multiple champions like that.
