1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,430
[inaudible] the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,380
That's funny. Yeah, we love, we like I, I,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,800
I don't hold grudges like Bobby Lee and
I were talking about Bobby holds the

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,540
biggest grudge was on earth. He
has some of the worst. I mean,

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,180
he has like 20 year old grudges.
Really? Oh my God. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,870
Bobby Lee asked him about it.
He genuinely,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,020
when someone does the wrong thing to him,

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,270
like I'm not talking
like makes a bad mistake.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,850
When someone does something where
you're like, that's fucked up,

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,080
that can fuck up a friendship.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,160
He will hold that against you for the
rest of time. That's it. That's it.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,360
Where some people would go, whatever, man,
I forgive you. Shit happens now. He's,

13
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,700
he holds a fucking grudge, dude. Bad.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,440
That little tiny ball rice ball has a
lot of fucking vengeance inside of him.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,120
He's my little dumpster. How dare
you? No, I'm allowed to say that, man.

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,620
I'm allowed to say that
because I, uh, because I used
to own Bobbie. I used to buy,

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,550
bought him for a month.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,580
How much did it cost? 65 grand.
That's a lot. Did you do anything?

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,900
Did you have to feed him?

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,800
He doesn't really require that much
food and when does he get to own you?

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,110
That's part of the deal, right? He
owns you for a month. 10 years later,

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,890
10 years later. He owns you for a
whole market with me for a month. Yeah.

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,700
Then he's going to be stewing on it for
10 years. Didn't even really did do that.

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,100
They just decided, okay, I'll, you
can own me for one month. Yeah,

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,240
and I'll do whatever the fuck you want,
but then I own you for one month,

26
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:23,110
10 years from now. That's a great
movie. By the way. This is a crazy deal.

27
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:23,630
It's great.

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,270
The dog stays alive be well like nine
years later that dude's just drink in and

29
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:32,710
chain smoke could try to kill trying to
kill us because he is a of fingers slave

30
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:36,910
for a month. That'd be like
indentured servitude. Right?

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,290
Mostly was people that were too poor
to make journeys are too poor to do

32
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,900
something.
So they would give up a certain amount of,

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,060
like they would make a contract,

34
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,160
like they would work for someone
for a certain amount of time. Right.

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,640
That's essentially how we set up. Yeah. I
mean that's basically what it is, right?

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,750
Basically saying like, but it's,
yeah. Is, it's like a slight, I mean,

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,300
I guess the condition is probably varied.
You know,

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,860
one of the grossest ones I ever saw was,
um,

39
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,940
vice did a piece about a Dubai,
I believe it was, and about,

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,570
um, some people who are unscrupulous, uh,

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,690
construction people would take these
folks in from Third World countries and

42
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:20,020
promised them all this money to work
there and then they'd take their passports

43
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:23,500
away from them and then
pay them a fraction of what
they're supposed to pay for

44
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,980
them so that they're trapped and
they were living in squalor, trapped.

45
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,950
They don't have their passport anymore.
They're in the wrong cumin. Trafficking

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,740
is what it is. I mean, that's the same
as when they do to these young girls.

47
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,920
They have these girls come over
the United States, you know, uh,

48
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,370
I think it was a documentary on Netflix
about these like young Russian models,

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,880
right? And they give these goals modeling
contracts. They live in, uh, you know,

50
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:47,830
like a four bedroom apartment, two girls
to a room, right? And they essentially,

51
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,940
you know,

52
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,180
fuck them around for a little while with
small little weird maybe random gigs.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,160
And then they're like, hey, if
you want to make more money,

54
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,330
you could always sell your
body or sell pictures of you.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,770
Nude makes way more money.

56
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,680
And they think it's kind of
part of this modeling thing.

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,290
And this is like a content, I think it
was a dot. I think it was on Netflix,

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,600
but it was all about these girls
getting trapped and they can't go back.

59
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,050
They don't have enough money.
And this, this modeling agent,

60
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:14,030
these modeling agencies, these with these
managed manager agencies there, well,

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,830
we have to keep your money and we'll
give you like a, a salary, so to speak.

62
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,890
We pay your rent will give you food.
It's horrible.

63
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,600
But if it was dudes, I
wouldn't care at all. Yeah,

64
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,323
of course

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,531
it was true.

66
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:30,950
It was these five handsome guys came over
from Russia looking to get some pussy

67
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,660
and drive Ferrari's,
but it wasn't really working out for them.

68
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,170
But like get a job, get a job.
It's what you use there. Yeah.

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
The fuck did you think
was going to happen?

70
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,550
You're just going to get pussy
and Ferrari's. Get outta here bro.

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,970
I'm good looking.
I thought this would make me make me,

72
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm sorry I can't get you any modeling
gays, but if you want to make some money,

73
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,690
fuck this old lady. Sup. So how much,

74
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,890
how much for two grand for me
to fuck that old lady on. Okay.

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,430
That's all you gotta do. Do I have to
come or just hang with her for awhile?

76
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,240
She's got go. She has to, she asked. I
have to work with hotel. She come. Yeah.

77
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,050
So you got to work with her. Okay. You
yeah, to be a good act. No eating pussy.

78
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,410
I can't do that. Oh, you have to eat
a pussy. I have two, three grand.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,950
They don't even shave old
ladies. They gave up. Okay.

80
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:17,440
So eat Harry Bush for two grand,
three grand, three grand. The lesson.

81
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,490
Right.

82
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,010
How much sympathy would you have for
that or wants to show Gigolos that was on

83
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,780
showtime. I didn't, but I
know Shab watched it. I know
time and Christina loved it.

84
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,070
They talked about a lot.

85
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,580
Why is it that shop there on the right
and so I don't they stick it ran its

86
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:36,410
course. It was on flight 17. Oh
No, it was not on for 60 g's. Yeah,

87
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,510
I'll toss interviewed one
of the guys I believe.

88
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,760
What kind of way,
by the way,

89
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,280
every TV show I've done is only gone for
like two years, but Gigolos gets six.

90
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,900
That's the state of television. Jesus
Christ. That is crazy. That's a very,

91
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,470
that's a very good tell by the way.
There's like not a lot of these, these uh,

92
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,610
this whole like the culture of male
Gigolos I think they said percentage wise

93
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,380
it's like unbelievably smaller.

94
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:03,130
These guys that get into the Gigolo world
and stay, they all get, they get in,

95
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,730
they get out.

96
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,020
Most women that get into sex work last
significantly longer than these dudes.

97
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,600
Way, way long for very,
you know, varied reasons,

98
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,500
but I think the Gigolo thing is kind of
like a moment in a man's life where he's

99
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:19,080
like, I want to fucking try it some
young like fun, loving free for all.

100
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,910
It's like open mind. I'll just give
it a whirl. Then he gets right out.

101
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,210
I don't think that happens for girls
at all. I think women stay in second.

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Would you feel bad for some dude who
was working as a Gigolo in his pimp was

103
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:34,520
shook night and pimp was
making them go out there.

104
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,450
Eat that pussy now to make that money.
It's the website for it.

105
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:42,410
I just got a website for it. Yeah, that's
that guy writes really good poetry.

106
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,200
This guy,
what's going on in our money?

107
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,750
What's going on with him at the coffee
shop around the corner from my house.

108
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,270
Why is he wearing at Charlotte? Thought
that's just how it says. Look Dude,

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,390
Bradley, Lord Nick. Hey Man,
I ain't Hayden. If you could
slink Dick and get paid,

110
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:59,240
good luck to you. Look, some people do it.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,500
Some people out there working as a misuse
that do not like touching people. Okay.

112
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,930
Tell me how much different that is.
That's a bummer though.

113
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,810
How much different is that then?
Being able to be a guy on wear.

114
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,790
Nice shirts like that and
occasionally got a bank broads.

115
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,210
You don't want to wear a nice shirt. It's
so horrible. Look, you get some natural,

116
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,080
no, fuck. The world could be worse.
Do you remember Richard Gere?

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,330
Wasn't he a Gigolo in one of his movies?
Who isn't it?

118
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,500
Didn't you have a movie called Gigolo?
We'd like bang old ladies.

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,450
I don't know if it was called Gigolo,
but yeah,

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,750
I think it was called Gigolo Americans.
American Gigolo. That's right.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,420
I'll let you, boy, you
must've loved this shit. Yeah.

122
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:36,320
You know she gives out there banging
ladies. Here's what they don't tell you.

123
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,100
Most of that money and that Gigolo
world is sucking Dick. Okay?

124
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,280
If you want to go out there and suck
that Dick, you can make that money,

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,070
but if you just want to bang old ladies,
ah, whoa. Look at the difference.

126
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,580
That's when he was young.
That's when he was held up.

127
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,120
We gotta be like 2123 he was
pretty young and handsome,

128
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,320
and then father time done. Fucking
Molly whopped him all the time. Got Him.

129
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,910
Marvin Hagler on Thomas Hearns
third round.
