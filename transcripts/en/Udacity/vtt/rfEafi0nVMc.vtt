00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
Okay, so in our browser I've reloaded the page and let's test

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.260
out all that new code we just wrote. Okay, so I added

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.850
steak and you can see it reloaded the page food equals steak

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.510
in the URL and it added our shopping list. So now you can

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.610
see what we've been working towards this whole time. Let's take a

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.220
quick view of the source code of this file. So you can

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.630
see our form here and you can see we stuck in the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
input hidden value equals steak. And then our shopping list that we appended

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.680
to the end of that output HTML you see a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.310
list item for steak. Now let's go ahead and try

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.180
adding another food, eggs. You can see what's on my

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.100
mind this morning. Okay, so you can see we have both

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.090
our elements in the URL, that's because, when this page

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.430
loaded last time, it had steak as a hidden input, remember,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.730
and when we submit the form, the hidden input stays

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.670
preserved. Let's look at the source for this version of the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.970
page now, and you can see we have two inputs

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.630
two hidden inputs, one for eggs, and one for steak. And

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.530
then we can see, we have the list items, we have

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.870
been adding. Notice that the whitespace here, is kind of messed

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.340
up. HTML always puts list items unless you install it

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.430
otherwise, on their on line. So, independent of whatever white space

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.160
is in our source, HTML will display it. let's, let's try,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.870
just for fun, adding something to URL here. How about food

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.460
equals pizza and when I hit enter we get pizza

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.820
added to our list. let's go through this code one last

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.480
time so you can understand fully what just happened. We

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.880
got our form HTML's from just a basic form and inside

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.280
that form that's where we're adding in the hidden inputs.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.830
If I were to view the source of a version of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.740
this page you would see that we have three hidden inputs

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.290
when we have three items, food items in the URL. The

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.070
HTML that describes those hidden inputs is here. Now,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.450
in our code, we said that if there were

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.500
any items in the URL, any items that come

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.430
from the food parameter, that we would do all of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.310
this string formatting here where we basically build up

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.290
a list of the hidden items, and then build up

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.470
a list of the list items. These bits of

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.320
HTML here. And then concatenate everything together, putting the items

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.449
into the list and then putting that whole shopping list at the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.650
end of our output, and then, finally, we substitute our hidden html

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.390
that we've been building up into our output string and we write

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.550
the whole thing back to the user. So, the functionality we get

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.320
here is a kind of neat side effect of how storing data in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.690
the url allows us to build this fake shopping list functionality. But,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.090
it was a little bit of a pain to write. Okay, and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.570
now it's time for one of those quizzes where you probably already

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.380
know all of the answers. So what is wrong

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.900
with that previous solution that we just went through? Check

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.310
all that apply. one, it's a pain to change.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.140
Next, we don't get any syntax highlighting in our HTML.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.810
Our code is ugly, and it's very error prone.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.160
And I, I'm, I left out of the video the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800
part where I was swearing trying to get all

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.080
of this working for you. Okay. Check all that apply.
