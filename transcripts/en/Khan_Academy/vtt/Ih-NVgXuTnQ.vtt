00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.039
- [Instructor] Alexey received
the following problem:

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.028
A particle moves in a straight line

00:00:05.028 --> 00:00:08.038
with velocity v of t is
equal to negative t squared

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:10.336
plus eight meters per second,

00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:12.915
where t is time in seconds.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.354
At t is equal to two,
the particle's distance

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.118
from the starting point was five meters.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:21.670
What is the total distance
the particle has traveled

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.467
between t equals two and
t equals six seconds?

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.987
Which expression should Alexey
use to solve the problem?

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.697
So we don't actually have to
figure the actual answer out,

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:32.530
we just have to figure out

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.615
what is the appropriate expression.

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:36.119
So like always, pause this video

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.232
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:40.019
So now let's tackle this together.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.438
So the key question is
what is the total distance

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.153
the particle has traveled
between t equals two

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:46.971
and t equals six?

00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:49.697
So we just care what happens
between those points,

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:51.432
we don't care that the particle's distance

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:54.825
from the starting point was
five meters at t equals two.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:58.625
So this right over here is
actually unnecessary information.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.648
So the first thing that
you might wanna think about

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:02.741
is well maybe distance
is just the integral

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:03.907
of the velocity function;

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:05.167
We've seen that multiple times.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.454
If you want to find the
change in a quantity,

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:11.254
you just say the starting
time and the ending time

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:14.411
and then you integrate the rate function.

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.577
So wouldn't it just be that?

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.759
Now we have to be very very careful.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.144
If the question was
what is the displacement

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.302
for the particle between time equals two

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:26.500
and time equals six,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.395
this would have been the correct answer.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:31.606
So this would be displacement.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:34.106
Displacement from t equals two

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:38.783
to t is equal to six.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:40.937
But they're not saying displacement.

00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:45.028
They're saying total distance
the particle has traveled.

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:49.326
So this is the total path
length for the particle.

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:51.619
So one way to think about it,

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.323
you would integrate not
the velocity function,

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.430
if you integrate velocity,
you get displacement,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.392
instead, you would integrate
the speed function.

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:01.376
Now what is speed?

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.236
It is the magnitude of velocity

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:04.740
and in one dimension, it would just be

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.256
the absolute value of
your velocity function.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:10.110
And so the absolute value
of the velocity function,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.234
this would give you,
integrating the speed,

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.887
this would give you the distance.

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:17.054
Distance from t equals two

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.477
to t is equal to six,

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:24.577
and let's see, we have that
choice right over here.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.602
The displacement one here,

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:27.390
this is an interesting distracter

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.101
but that is not going to be the choice.

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.546
This one right over here, v prime of six,

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:36.213
that gives you the acceleration.

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:39.574
If you're taking the derivative
of the velocity function,

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:41.640
the acceleration at six seconds,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.266
that's not what we're interested in.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:47.939
And this gives you the absolute
difference in velocity,

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.490
when in between time six and time two,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.845
that's not what we're
trying to figure out either.
