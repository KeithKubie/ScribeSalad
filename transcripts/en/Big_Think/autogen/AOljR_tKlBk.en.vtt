when we're thinking about how economies
work the tricky thing is that their

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
work the tricky thing is that their
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.460
work the tricky thing is that their
systems and you look at any particular

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
systems and you look at any particular
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.680
systems and you look at any particular
corner of the system and you're gonna

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690
corner of the system and you're gonna
 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.140
corner of the system and you're gonna
miss the big picture but the big

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
miss the big picture but the big
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.660

so what I wanted to try to do was to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
so what I wanted to try to do was to
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.380
so what I wanted to try to do was to
find examples of simple economic systems

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
find examples of simple economic systems
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450
find examples of simple economic systems
the systems that were simple enough you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
the systems that were simple enough you
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640
the systems that were simple enough you
could see all the moving parts working

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
could see all the moving parts working
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950
could see all the moving parts working
and you can understand how recessions

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
and you can understand how recessions
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900
and you can understand how recessions
worked and there were a couple of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
worked and there were a couple of
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.770
worked and there were a couple of
examples that I found one is not so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
examples that I found one is not so
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959
examples that I found one is not so

you don't have Microsoft Excel so they
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.960
you don't have Microsoft Excel so they
had these little tokens and they'd pass

there are a number of possible solutions
 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.230
there are a number of possible solutions
to this one is that people would just

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
to this one is that people would just
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.300

could potentially solve the problem but

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090
could potentially solve the problem but
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.610
could potentially solve the problem but
that's not what people did people die

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
that's not what people did people die

think felt uncomfortable renegotiating
the contract so a second thing you could

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
the contract so a second thing you could
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.810
the contract so a second thing you could
do and they tried this was to legislate

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820
do and they tried this was to legislate

how often people had to go out so they
came up with this rule that people had

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
came up with this rule that people had
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.680
came up with this rule that people had
to go out at least twice a year now I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
to go out at least twice a year now I
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390

economist you know I don't go out that
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.930
economist you know I don't go out that
much but you know even I think that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
much but you know even I think that
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880
much but you know even I think that
going out twice a year is not that much

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
going out twice a year is not that much
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.430
going out twice a year is not that much
and if that's your baseline that's going

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
and if that's your baseline that's going
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.190
and if that's your baseline that's going
to kick start the babysitting economy

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
to kick start the babysitting economy

you have a problem in the end the
babysitting recession committee or the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
babysitting recession committee or the
 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.590
babysitting recession committee or the
babysitting committee solved the problem

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600
babysitting committee solved the problem
 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.100
babysitting committee solved the problem
by simply issuing more of this currency

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
by simply issuing more of this currency
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.600
by simply issuing more of this currency
they they printed more of these little

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
they they printed more of these little
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.729
they they printed more of these little
tokens they handed more out they handed

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
tokens they handed more out they handed
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.960
tokens they handed more out they handed
more out to people when they arrived

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
more out to people when they arrived
 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300
more out to people when they arrived
they took fewer away from people when

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
they took fewer away from people when
 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.280
they took fewer away from people when
they left the babysitting co-op and that

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
they left the babysitting co-op and that
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.140
they left the babysitting co-op and that
worked beautifully that kick-started the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
worked beautifully that kick-started the
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.240
worked beautifully that kick-started the
whole thing and this massive long

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
whole thing and this massive long
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.420

an external shock and it's not hard to

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409
an external shock and it's not hard to
 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.559
