Heidegger thought that Western

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560
Heidegger thought that Western
 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.110
Heidegger thought that Western
philosophy have gone wrong basically

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120
philosophy have gone wrong basically
 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.030
philosophy have gone wrong basically
since the time of Socrates which is you

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
since the time of Socrates which is you
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.820
since the time of Socrates which is you
know quite a long time and he said that

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
know quite a long time and he said that
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.160
know quite a long time and he said that
we were became interested in what the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
we were became interested in what the
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.259
we were became interested in what the
world was made of and how we knew things

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
world was made of and how we knew things
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970
world was made of and how we knew things
and what we should have been interested

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
and what we should have been interested
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670
and what we should have been interested
instead was the nature and quality of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
instead was the nature and quality of
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.880
instead was the nature and quality of
being and what he meant by being isn't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
being and what he meant by being isn't
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.630
being and what he meant by being isn't
the objective world what he meant by

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
the objective world what he meant by
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390
the objective world what he meant by
being was the manner in which you have

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
being was the manner in which you have
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.359
being was the manner in which you have
experience and so there are elements of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
experience and so there are elements of
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.630
experience and so there are elements of
being that aren't objective elements and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
being that aren't objective elements and
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920
being that aren't objective elements and
so I would say pain is a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
so I would say pain is a
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.220
so I would say pain is a
phenomenological reality right it's it's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
phenomenological reality right it's it's
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.459
phenomenological reality right it's it's
not something you can you can index it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
not something you can you can index it
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.760
not something you can you can index it
objectively but the index is not the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
objectively but the index is not the
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400
objectively but the index is not the
phenomenon and you know is your pain

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
phenomenon and you know is your pain
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.819
phenomenon and you know is your pain
real see this is this is a question for

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
real see this is this is a question for
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.260
real see this is this is a question for
people who think there's no such thing

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
people who think there's no such thing
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.930
people who think there's no such thing
as meaning like you try to argue

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
as meaning like you try to argue
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880
as meaning like you try to argue
yourself out of pain and see how far you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
yourself out of pain and see how far you
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889
yourself out of pain and see how far you
get you might think well that's not the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
get you might think well that's not the
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540
get you might think well that's not the
sort of meaning I meant it's like you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
sort of meaning I meant it's like you
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.950
sort of meaning I meant it's like you
know a negative meaning is a place to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
know a negative meaning is a place to
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840
know a negative meaning is a place to
start right because if something's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
start right because if something's
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.729
start right because if something's
negative and it's real it does imply

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
negative and it's real it does imply
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.289
negative and it's real it does imply
that there's something positive that's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
that there's something positive that's
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450
that there's something positive that's
real it might be harder to get a hold of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
real it might be harder to get a hold of
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.770
real it might be harder to get a hold of
at least it's not pain you know so but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
at least it's not pain you know so but
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.370
at least it's not pain you know so but
pain Descartes then they'll close with

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
pain Descartes then they'll close with
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.600
pain Descartes then they'll close with
this you guys can have a break Descartes

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610
this you guys can have a break Descartes
 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.770
this you guys can have a break Descartes
implemented a method he called radical

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
implemented a method he called radical
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539
implemented a method he called radical
doubt when he went on his philosophical

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
doubt when he went on his philosophical
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460
doubt when he went on his philosophical
journey and what Descartes looked for

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
journey and what Descartes looked for
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219
journey and what Descartes looked for
was one thing he couldn't doubt because

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
was one thing he couldn't doubt because
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499
was one thing he couldn't doubt because
he was probably clinically depressed and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
he was probably clinically depressed and
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030
he was probably clinically depressed and
he was just doubting everything it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
he was just doubting everything it's
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770
he was just doubting everything it's
like well why how do I know the world

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
like well why how do I know the world
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170
like well why how do I know the world
isn't just a mirage made by an evil

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
isn't just a mirage made by an evil
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.800
isn't just a mirage made by an evil
demon to you know to to obfuscate

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
demon to you know to to obfuscate
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.460
demon to you know to to obfuscate
reality from me

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
reality from me
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.039
reality from me
well his conclusion was the one thing

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
well his conclusion was the one thing
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.830
well his conclusion was the one thing
that he could not dispute was that he

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
that he could not dispute was that he
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.490
that he could not dispute was that he
was and could think now I don't think

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
was and could think now I don't think
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.139
was and could think now I don't think
Descartes Reid meant what we meant by

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
Descartes Reid meant what we meant by
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.010
Descartes Reid meant what we meant by
think I think he meant more what we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
think I think he meant more what we
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.950
think I think he meant more what we
would mean by experience because thought

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
would mean by experience because thought
 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840
would mean by experience because thought
has become a much more narrowly defined

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
has become a much more narrowly defined
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.990
has become a much more narrowly defined
I you know term since the time of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
I you know term since the time of
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240
I you know term since the time of
Descartes so I don't think he meant I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
Descartes so I don't think he meant I
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219
Descartes so I don't think he meant I
think therefore I am I think he meant

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
think therefore I am I think he meant
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109
think therefore I am I think he meant
something like I experience I have

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
something like I experience I have
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609
something like I experience I have
experienced therefore yeah but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
experienced therefore yeah but
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.330
experienced therefore yeah but
regardless of that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
regardless of that
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.680
regardless of that
people think about it as thought

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
people think about it as thought
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.509
people think about it as thought
Heidegger was different Heidegger

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519
Heidegger was different Heidegger
 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.240
Heidegger was different Heidegger
basically said the one thing you can't

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
basically said the one thing you can't
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.110
basically said the one thing you can't
dispute is that that experience is your

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
dispute is that that experience is your
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.949
dispute is that that experience is your
experience it exists you can't it's it's

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959
experience it exists you can't it's it's
 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.290
experience it exists you can't it's it's
almost by definition right it's like the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300
almost by definition right it's like the
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.539
almost by definition right it's like the
definition of exists and then he was

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549
definition of exists and then he was
 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.800
definition of exists and then he was
interested in what the fundamental

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
interested in what the fundamental
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.890
interested in what the fundamental
elements of existence of existence were

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
elements of existence of existence were
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.130
elements of existence of existence were
and they're not atoms like you know like

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
and they're not atoms like you know like
 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.570
and they're not atoms like you know like
the fundamental elements of the object

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
the fundamental elements of the object
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.839
the fundamental elements of the object
of world there are more things like pain

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
of world there are more things like pain
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.130
of world there are more things like pain
and for me that was the thing that

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
and for me that was the thing that
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.259
and for me that was the thing that
stopped me from doubting it's like I

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269
stopped me from doubting it's like I
 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.080
stopped me from doubting it's like I
cannot doubt the existence of pain it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
cannot doubt the existence of pain it
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.110
cannot doubt the existence of pain it
seems real and I might say it seems more

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120
seems real and I might say it seems more
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.839
seems real and I might say it seems more
real than anything else now you might

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849
real than anything else now you might
 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.220
real than anything else now you might
say you don't believe that but I would

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
say you don't believe that but I would
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.020
say you don't believe that but I would
say I don't care what you think you

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030
say I don't care what you think you
 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.360
say I don't care what you think you
believe I'll watch you when you're in

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
believe I'll watch you when you're in
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.759
believe I'll watch you when you're in
pain and every single one of your

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769
pain and every single one of your
 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.890
pain and every single one of your
actions will indicate that you believe

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
actions will indicate that you believe
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.960
actions will indicate that you believe
in it and not only that that you can't

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970
in it and not only that that you can't
 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.600
in it and not only that that you can't
not believe in it right it's there and

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610
not believe in it right it's there and
 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.350
not believe in it right it's there and
it's there so much that well that's a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360
it's there so much that well that's a
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.720
it's there so much that well that's a
meaning and so that it's in that way

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
meaning and so that it's in that way
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.460
meaning and so that it's in that way
that Heidegger at least in part thought

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
that Heidegger at least in part thought
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.009
that Heidegger at least in part thought
of existence as or experience as

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019
of existence as or experience as
 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.530
of existence as or experience as
composed of meanings and so part of the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
composed of meanings and so part of the
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.150
composed of meanings and so part of the
reason that this course is called nobs

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160
reason that this course is called nobs
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.860
reason that this course is called nobs
of meaning is because one of the things

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
of meaning is because one of the things
 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.259
of meaning is because one of the things
we're going to look at is the structure

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269
we're going to look at is the structure
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.059
we're going to look at is the structure
of meaning and we're gonna start with

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069
of meaning and we're gonna start with
 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.069
of meaning and we're gonna start with
negative meaning because from my

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079
negative meaning because from my
 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.289
negative meaning because from my
perspective it's look you can doubt

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299
perspective it's look you can doubt
 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.800
perspective it's look you can doubt
whether or not good exists but once I'm

whether or not good exists but once I'm
done telling you about the things I know

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370
done telling you about the things I know
 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.860
done telling you about the things I know
about human history there won't be a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870
about human history there won't be a
 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.479
about human history there won't be a
single person in this room who thinks

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489
single person in this room who thinks
 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.729
single person in this room who thinks
that evil doesn't exist and you might

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739
that evil doesn't exist and you might
 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.199
that evil doesn't exist and you might
think that's a bloody horrible thing to

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209
think that's a bloody horrible thing to
 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.349
think that's a bloody horrible thing to
learn but it's not it's unbelievably

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359
learn but it's not it's unbelievably
 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.750
learn but it's not it's unbelievably
useful because once you can establish

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
useful because once you can establish
 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.659
useful because once you can establish
something that you cannot deny then you

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669
something that you cannot deny then you
 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.270
something that you cannot deny then you
can move from that and I think you can

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
can move from that and I think you can
 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.559
can move from that and I think you can
hypothesize that if you're capable of

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569
hypothesize that if you're capable of
 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.680
hypothesize that if you're capable of
detecting radical evil I'll tell you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690
detecting radical evil I'll tell you
 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.080
detecting radical evil I'll tell you
about unit 731 at some point or you can

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
about unit 731 at some point or you can
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.430
about unit 731 at some point or you can
look them up yourself I wouldn't

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
look them up yourself I wouldn't
 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.300
look them up yourself I wouldn't
recommend it by the way once you can

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310
recommend it by the way once you can
 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.699
recommend it by the way once you can
identify radical evil and you think well

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709
identify radical evil and you think well
 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.379
identify radical evil and you think well
that's that's just rep beyond a doubt

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389
that's that's just rep beyond a doubt
 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.789
that's that's just rep beyond a doubt
that's reprehensible there's no

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
that's reprehensible there's no
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.800
that's reprehensible there's no
justification for that whatsoever no

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810
justification for that whatsoever no

matter what whenever well then you've

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840
matter what whenever well then you've
 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.870
matter what whenever well then you've
got something to stand

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
got something to stand
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.640
got something to stand
and you can start thinking well what's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650
and you can start thinking well what's
 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.890
and you can start thinking well what's
the absolute opposite of that then you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900
the absolute opposite of that then you
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.930
the absolute opposite of that then you
know it might be how is it that you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
know it might be how is it that you
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.880
know it might be how is it that you
could conduct yourself so that in your

could conduct yourself so that in your
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.190
could conduct yourself so that in your
sphere of influence the probability like

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200
sphere of influence the probability like
 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.720
sphere of influence the probability like
that anything like that would ever

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730
that anything like that would ever
 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.580
that anything like that would ever
happen is reduced to the absolute

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
happen is reduced to the absolute
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.580
happen is reduced to the absolute
maximum well that's a reasonable moral

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590
maximum well that's a reasonable moral
 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.300
maximum well that's a reasonable moral

and I and I don't think it's something

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
and I and I don't think it's something

that you can dispense with with like a

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540
that you can dispense with with like a
 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.920
that you can dispense with with like a
casual nihilism I don't think a nihilist

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930
casual nihilism I don't think a nihilist
 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.140
casual nihilism I don't think a nihilist
can dispense with it because he even

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150
can dispense with it because he even
 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.410
can dispense with it because he even
nihilists suffer thank God for that you

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420
nihilists suffer thank God for that you
 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.540
nihilists suffer thank God for that you
know it's their only uh it's their only

know it's their only uh it's their only

source of potential salvation sometimes
they notice it oh I'm suffering about

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960
they notice it oh I'm suffering about
 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.850
they notice it oh I'm suffering about
all this nihilism

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860
all this nihilism
 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.500
all this nihilism
maybe that indicates that there's

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510
maybe that indicates that there's
 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.600
maybe that indicates that there's
something flawed in it it's always

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
something flawed in it it's always
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.180
something flawed in it it's always
possible
