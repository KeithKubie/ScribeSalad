00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.070
If Coca-Cola’s own marketing is to be believed,
few things are more satisfying than a cold

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.579
drink on a hot day.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.870
Tacking on to a string of hilarious missteps
in the late 20th century (see: That Time Coca-Cola

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.461
Spent $100 Million Intentionally Filling Coke
Cans With Water That Smelled Like Farts, That

00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:54.140
Time Coca-Cola Tried to Sell Bottled Tap Water
in the U.K. and the Hilarity That Ensued,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.500
and That Time Coca-Cola Decided to Stop Making
Their Best Selling Product, Coca-Cola), the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
company reportedly decided to try and take
full advantage of sweltering days making their

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.890
product more desirable by attempting to introduce
vending machines that would charge more the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.810
hotter it was outside…

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.409
The genesis of this story can be traced back
to an otherwise mundane interview given by

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.450
the short-lived and wildly unsuccessful Coca-Cola
CEO Doug Ivester in 1999 to the Brazilian

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.869
magazine, Veja.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.280
During the interview, Ivester opined that
“Coca Cola is a product whose utility varies

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.439
from moment to moment” sagely explaining
that demand for ice-cold Coca-Cola spiked

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.950
during especially hot weather and during certain
events.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.659
Ivester then reasoned that in such a situation,
“it is fair [Coca-Cola] should be more expensive”

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.040
while no doubt simultaneously devouring his
own foot and grabbing a shovel and digging

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.240
himself into a giant hole.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.080
When asked how Coca-Cola as a company planned
to take advantage of the amazing revelation

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.049
that hot weather inexplicably also coincided
with an increased demand for cold drinks,

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.320
Ivester stated that they’d been developing
a new line of vending machines that exploited

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.560
this fact.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.929
Specifically, Ivester explained that Coca-Cola
had been experimenting with vending machines

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.140
that contained a thermostat and simple software
that would raise the price of the products

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.920
within the machine once a certain temperature
threshold had been reached.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.670
As Ivester himself would correctly point out
during the interview, neither the technology

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.890
nor the idea of raising the price of a product
in times of great demand was a new concept,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.590
noting in regards to the latter that “the
machine will simply make this process automatic”.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.680
Early media reactions to Ivester’s comments
were relatively muted.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.959
The New York Times, for example, mused that
the idea was merely a natural extension of

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.720
the concept of supply and demand and that
the advent of affordable computer chips could

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040
make the endeavour impossibly lucrative if
handled correctly.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.459
The paper also pointed out that while, yes
“the concept might seem unfair to a thirsty

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.290
person”, variable pricing had already been
the norm for other industries, most notably

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.290
airlines, for many years at this point.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.109
Indeed, such variable pricing can be seen
when we buy from restaurants, car dealerships,

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.519
power companies, hotels, grocery and clothing
stores, online retailers such as amazon, etc.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.889
Of course, the variable pricing is generally
presented in such a way as to potentially

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.230
save customers money, even though in many
cases that really just implies that the original

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.709
price was more than needed to make a reasonable
profit, or with prices on other items set

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.129
high enough to make up for the lower price
of a loss-leader product, etc.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.129
(More on this here: Why Coupons Sometimes
Say They’re Worth a Fraction of a Penny)

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.150
On top of media reports mostly being indifferent
to the potential change, Coca-Cola stockholders

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.879
were reportedly initially very happy to hear
the company had developed technology that

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.260
would squeeze as much profit out of customers
as possible.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.809
As stock analyst Bill Pecoriello noted, vending
machines are “already the most profitable

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:57.760
channel for the beverage companies, so any
effort to get higher profits when demand is

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.339
higher obviously can enhance the profitability
of the system further”.

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:06.340
A company spokesman called Rob Baskin later
quizzed on the matter seemed excited about

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.049
the potential the idea had.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.519
In fact, Baskins revealed that at the time
the story broke variable pricing in vending

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.139
machines was “something the Coca-Cola Company
has been looking at for more than a year”.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.190
Additionally, although Baskins also claimed
that Coca-Cola hadn’t yet trialled the technology

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.650
in the real world, it would appear that preliminary
tests of vending machines that adjusted the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.430
price of their contents in relation to the
overall temperature had been conducted in

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.860
Japan by the company.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.770
It’s unclear what the results of these tests
were, but given that Coca-Cola seemed happy

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.120
to charge ahead with the plan, it’s safe
to say the results must have been promising.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.169
The problem was that while customers are generally
happy to accept variable pricing with little

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.800
complaint in many instances, even often with
drinks at bars and the like, most companies

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.541
who do this don’t blatantly broadcast to
the customers that the main purpose of the

00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:00.639
variable pricing is to squeeze every dime
possible out of said customers.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.020
Instead, these sorts of variable pricing schemes
are generally presented as a benefit to customers,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.680
even though the underlying goal is always
to maximize profits.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.400
For example, hotels don’t advertise that
they raise prices during peak times, they

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.020
instead pitch it as lowering them in the off-season.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.990
Or, as David Leonhardt of the New York Times
notes of supermarket variable pricing,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.569
The supermarkets… used sales on those goods
to bring customers in their doors.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.270
They made the bulk of their profit from other
items that people bought while in the store.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.990
So even if the final bill was the same as
it would have been if the beer had been marked

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.000
up, shoppers could walk out with both the
items they wanted and the sense that they

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.020
were treated fairly.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.050
But with Coca-Cola’s CEO being so unabashedly
blatant that the purpose of the variable pricing

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.180
was to maximize profits by milking the customers
for all they were worth and not spinning it

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.479
as a benefit to anyone but Coca-Cola stockholders,
unsurprisingly public outrage over the plan

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.569
didn’t take long to manifest.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.270
Furious Coke drinkers complained to Coca-Cola
in droves and the media, always keen on a

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.580
bit of outrage for its ability to get eyeballs
watching and reading the news, decided to

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.460
stoke the flames of the controversy by reaching
out to Pepsi for a comment.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.419
Naturally, while no doubt privately kicking
themselves that they hadn’t thought of it

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.569
first, Pepsi publicly released many-a-scathing
statement condemning Coca-Cola’s avaricious

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.419
attempts to nickel and dime customers.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.659
For example, Pepsi spokesman, Jeff Brown,
stated,

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.340
We believe that machines that raise prices
in hot weather exploit consumers who live

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.340
in warm climates.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.379
At Pepsi, we are focused on innovations that
make it easier for consumers to buy a soft

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:40.660
drink, not harder.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.229
Pepsi’s sentiments were echoed by other
competitors in the beverage industry, with

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.710
one unnamed executive being quoted as scoffing:
“What’s next?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.250
A machine that X-rays people’s pockets to
find out how much change they have and raises

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.250
the price accordingly?”

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.320
(In truth, in many industries, how wealthy
a person appears or what the wealth demographics

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.100
of an area are often makes a difference on
what price products or services are listed

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.100
at.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.919
In the early 2000s, there were even rumors,
though they denied it, that amazon was using

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.860
such demographic data to dynamically adjust
prices for a given customer.)

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.530
The real damage to Coca-Cola, though, came
from the bottlers the company so depends on

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.699
(and who were already upset with Iverster
over things like his raising the price on

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.960
the concentrate used for making the drinks,
with one unnamed bottling executive graphically

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.980
stating Coca-Cola was “raping the bottlers”).

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.719
As to why they’d be unhappy about this particular
snafu, you need look no further than one of

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:42.650
the largest, CCE; after the media backlash
from this and other foibles under Iverster,

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:49.169
they watched in horror as their stock price
nosedived from $37 to $18 per share in only

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.520
about five months.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.190
Unsurprisingly, Coca-Cola would soon disavow
their CEO’s comments on these variably priced

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.469
vending machines.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:02.590
The aforementioned Coca-Cola spokesman, Rob
Baskin, with his PR cap no doubt spinning

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.770
fast enough to create a tornado during the
interview, now denied that the company had

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.400
ever seriously planned to utilise the technology…
you know, even though he’d previously said

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.680
Coca-Cola had been exploring how to best use
it for an entire year and that the company

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.150
had already trialled them in Japan and was
very excited about the prospects here.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.360
Baskin then decided to intelligently explain
the variable pricing, now doing it the way

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.740
pretty much every other industry who uses
variable pricing pitches it to customers-

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.430
he noted that if Coca-Cola ever did decide
to introduce variable pricing vending machines,

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.380
the company would almost certainly use them
to lower the price of its soda at off-peak

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380
times.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.990
(No doubt quietly raising the “normal”
price until the lowered price matched the

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.120
old original price, assuming the potential
increase in sales wasn’t enough to at minimum

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.060
cover the loss from lowering the price.)

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.490
In the end, the public were woefully unimpressed
with Coca-Cola’s sputtering explanation

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.000
and the company’s stock price took a notable
hit following the sustained negative coverage

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.790
of their little scheme.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.940
Incidentally, Ivester only lasted about two
years as CEO before he decided to retire after

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.490
a private meeting with Warren Buffett and
Herbert Allen (two of the largest stock holders

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.700
in the company); the rumor was that they politely
told him to either step down as CEO voluntarily

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.000
or they’d see to it his removal happened
anyway.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.300
Whatever was actually said, almost immediately
after the meeting, he very suddenly announced

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:35.230
his retirement.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:45.339
For 

00:09:45.339 --> 00:10:29.019
his “great” work during his tumultuous
and very brief time as Coca-Cola CEO, he was

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:53.810
awarded a retirement package worth about $166
million (about $240 million in today’s dollars)…
