00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.210
Mike built a rectangular
dog pen that is 21 feet long

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.850
and has a perimeter of 78 feet.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.050
What is the width
of Mike's dog pen?

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.670
So let's draw what
it might look like.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.930
So it might look
something like this.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.160
I'll do my best to draw it, a
rectangle or potential dog pen.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.330
So let's say that this is
the dog pen right over here.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.900
And they give us its length.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.540
Its length is 21 feet.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.720
So this distance right
over here is 21 feet.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.010
And of course, if that
distance is 21 feet,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.080
this distance is also
going to be 21 feet.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.210
Now, they also tell us that
the perimeter is 78 feet.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.230
So the perimeter is 78 feet.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.120
So we need to figure
out the width.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.240
And the width would be this
length-- or this width,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.570
I should say-- this
width, which is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.390
going to be the same thing as
that width right over here.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.480
So let's think about.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.379
And we know how we
figure out the perimeter.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.870
If we added this
distance, 21 feet,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.070
to this distance, the width,
plus 21 feet to the width

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.050
again, we're going
to get to 78 feet.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.426
So one way to back into
what the width is is to say,

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.300
well, look if we sum up
all of these lengths,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.424
we're going to get 28 feet.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:25.490
So let's at least subtract these
two orange lengths, the two 21

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.630
feet, from the 78 feet.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.250
And then we figure out how
much length essentially

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.020
these two widths
have to make up.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.730
So let's subtract.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.890
Let's do 78 minus 21 minus 21.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.580
And what's that
going to be equal to?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.540
So that's 78 minus 42.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.500
And 78 minus 42-- I don't want
to make a careless mistake-- 78

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.440
minus 42 is going
to get me to 36.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.460
So this is equal to 36.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.300
And let's remind
ourselves what 36 feet is.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.540
That's the total length-- or
I should say the total width--

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.140
if we were to take the
width down here and add it

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.604
to the width up here.

00:02:07.604 --> 00:02:08.770
Now, we know something else.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.990
These are the exact same
width, that this distance

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.850
is the same as this distance.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.990
And if we add them
together, we get to 36.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.750
So what are two
distances, or what

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.480
are two numbers that I can
add together to get to 36?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.680
Well, we know that 18
plus 18 is equal to 36.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.230
So this one down
here must be 18.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.790
And this one up here
must also be 18.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.070
And we can verify that.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.290
Try adding all of
these up together.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.890
You add the two widths.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.070
You get 18 plus 18.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.240
And you add the two
lengths, plus 21 plus 21.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.290
And you are left with 36, which
is exactly what we got here.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.715
This is what we needed the two
widths to add up to-- plus 42.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.580
Which is, of course,
equal to-- 36

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.874
plus 42 is equal to 78,
which is the perimeter.
