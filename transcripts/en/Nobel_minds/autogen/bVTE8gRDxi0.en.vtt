00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.529
again I'm I could work and write some
papers on this and think about it but my

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539
papers on this and think about it but my
 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.169

five years okay two years ago I I can

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
five years okay two years ago I I can

think of better investments it's so you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
think of better investments it's so you
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.350
think of better investments it's so you
know real estate is generally

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
know real estate is generally
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.840
know real estate is generally
historically not a good investment even

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
historically not a good investment even
 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.660
historically not a good investment even
if it weren't highly priced so the price

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
if it weren't highly priced so the price
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.370
if it weren't highly priced so the price
of Swedish real estate is more than

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
of Swedish real estate is more than
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.949
of Swedish real estate is more than
doubled in real terms since the mid-90s

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
doubled in real terms since the mid-90s
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.840
doubled in real terms since the mid-90s
so it's gone up a lot and will not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
so it's gone up a lot and will not
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.270
so it's gone up a lot and will not
continue forever

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
continue forever
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.820
continue forever
well probably now it's probably being

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
well probably now it's probably being
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.580
well probably now it's probably being
driven by the expert above all is but

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
driven by the expert above all is but
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.480
driven by the expert above all is but
