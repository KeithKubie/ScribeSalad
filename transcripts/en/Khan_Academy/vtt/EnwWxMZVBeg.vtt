00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.420
You are by now probably
used to the idea

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.240
of measuring angles in degrees.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.060
We use it in everyday language.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.504
We've done some examples
on this playlist where

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:14.920
if you had an angle
like that, you

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.010
might call that a
30-degree angle.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.970
If you have an
angle like this, you

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.490
could call that a
90-degree angle.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.910
And we'd often use this
symbol, just like that.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.450
If you were to go
180 degrees, you'd

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.680
essentially form
a straight line.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.520
Let me make these proper angles.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.260
If you go 360 degrees,
you have essentially

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.600
done one full rotation.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.690
And if you watch figure
skating on the Olympics,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.190
and someone does a
rotation, they'll

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.330
say, oh, they did a 360.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.370
Or especially in some
skateboarding competitions,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.604
and things like that.

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:53.020
But the one thing to realize--
and it might not be obvious

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.680
right from the get-go-- but
this whole notion of degrees,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640
this is a
human-constructed system.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.066
This is not the only way
that you can measure angles.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.440
And if you think
about it, you'll

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.762
say, well, why do we call a
full rotation 360 degrees?

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:07.220
And there's some
possible theories.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.886
And I encourage you
to think about them.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:14.580
Why does 360 degrees show up in
our culture as a full rotation?

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.610
Well, there's a couple
of theories there.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.766
One is ancient calendars.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.390
And even our calendar
is close to this,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.850
but ancient calendars were
based on 360 days in a year.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.160
Some ancient
astronomers observed

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.010
that things seemed to move
1/360 of the sky per day.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.350
Another theory is the
ancient Babylonians

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.450
liked equilateral
triangles a lot.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.290
And they had a base
60 number system.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.310
So they had 60 symbols.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.710
We only have 10.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.530
We have a base 10.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.570
They had 60.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.930
So in our system, we like
to divide things into 10.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.890
They probably liked to
divide things into 60.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.110
So if you had a circle,
and you divided it

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.420
into 6 equilateral
triangles, and each

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.450
of those equilateral triangles
you divided into 60 sections,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.560
because you have a
base 60 number system,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.774
then you might end
up with 360 degrees.

00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:07.440
What I want to think
about in this video

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.069
is an alternate way
of measuring angles.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.110
And that alternate way--
even though it might not

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.420
seem as intuitive to you from
the get-go-- in some ways

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.620
is much more mathematically
pure than degrees.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.580
It's not based on these cultural
artifacts of base 60 number

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.000
systems or
astronomical patterns.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.760
To some degree, an
alien on another planet

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.530
would not use degrees,
especially if the degrees are

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.190
motivated by these
astronomical phenomena.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.780
But they might use what we're
going to define as a radian.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.800
There's a certain degree
of purity here-- radians.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.980
So let's just cut to the chase
and define what a radian is.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.810
So let me draw a
circle here, my best

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.380
attempt at drawing a circle.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.210
Not bad.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.150
And let me draw the
center of the circle.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.800
And now let me draw this radius.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.050
And let's say that this
radius-- and you might already

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.030
notice the word radius is very
close to the word radians.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.810
And that's not a coincidence.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.650
So let's say that this circle
has a radius of length r.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.600
Now let's construct an angle.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.370
I'll call that angle theta.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.300
So let's construct
an angle theta.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.760
So let's call this angle
right over here theta.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.730
And let's just say, for
the sake of argument,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.160
that this angle is just
the exact right measure

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.200
so that if you look at the
arc that subtends this angle--

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.790
and that seems like
a very fancy word.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.600
But let me draw the angle.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.090
So if you were to draw
the angle-- so if you

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.350
look at the arc that subtends
the angle, that's a fancy word.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.730
That's really just
talking about the arc

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.370
along the circle that intersects
the two sides of the angles.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.610
So this arc right over here
subtends the angle theta.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.930
So let me write that down.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.310
Subtends this arc,
subtends angle theta.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.680
Let's say theta is the exact
right size so that this arc is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.810
also the same length as
the radius of the circle.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.450
So this arc is also of length r.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.200
So given that, if you were
defining a new type of angle

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.980
measurement, and you
wanted to call it

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.110
a radian, which is very close
to a radius, how many radians

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.662
would you define
this angle to be?

00:04:28.662 --> 00:04:30.620
Well, the most obvious
one, if you kind of view

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.730
a radian as another
way of saying

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.750
radiuses, or I guess radii.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.470
Well, you say, look,
this is subtended

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.510
by an arc of one radius.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.060
So why don't we call this right
over here one radian, which

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.400
is exactly how a
radian is defined.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.910
When you have a circle, and you
have an angle of one radian,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.307
the arc that subtends it
is exactly one radius long.

00:04:58.307 --> 00:05:00.390
Which you can imagine might
be a little bit useful

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.920
as we start to interpret more
and more types of circles.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.390
When you give a
degrees, you really

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.880
have to do a little
bit of math and think

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.505
about the circumference
and all of that

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:11.400
to think about how many radiuses
are subtending that angle.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.420
Here, the angle in radians
tells you exactly the arc length

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.210
that is subtending the angles.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.750
So let's do a couple of
thought experiments here.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.790
So given that, what would
be the angle in radians

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.370
if we were to go-- so let
me draw another circle here.

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:41.660
So that's the center, and
we'll start right over there.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.510
So what would happen if I
had an angle-- if I wanted

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.000
to measure in radians, what
angle would this be in radians?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.764
And you could almost
think of it as radiuses.

00:05:51.764 --> 00:05:52.930
So what would that angle be?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.600
Going one full
revolution in degrees,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.610
that would be 360 degrees.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.320
Based on this definition,
what would this be in radians?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.300
Well, let's think about the
arc that subtends this angle.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.290
The arc that subtends this angle
is the entire circumference

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.130
of this circle.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.260
Well, what's the
circumference of a circle

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.380
in terms of radiuses?

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.100
So if this has length r,
if the radius is length r,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.170
what's the circumference of
the circle in terms of r?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.980
Well, we know that.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.470
That's going to be 2 pi r.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.220
So going back to this
angle, the length

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.870
of the arc that subtends this
angle is how many radiuses?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.760
Well, it's 2 pi radiuses.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.040
It's 2 pi times r.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.220
So this angle right
over here, I'll

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.492
call this a different-- well,
let's call this angle x.

00:06:57.492 --> 00:07:03.200
x in this case is going
to be 2 pi radians.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.080
And it is subtended by an
arc length of 2 pi radiuses.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.830
If the radius was
one unit, then this

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.460
would be 2 pi times
1, 2 pi radiuses.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.970
So given that,
let's start to think

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.610
about how we can convert
between radians and degrees,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.520
and vice versa.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.330
If I were to have-- and we
can just follow up over here.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.650
If we do one full
revolution-- that is,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:37.986
2 pi radians-- how many degrees
is this going to be equal to?

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.110
Well, we already know this.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.020
A full revolution in
degrees is 360 degrees.

00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.340
Well, I could either write
out the word degrees,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.580
or I can use this little
degree notation there.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.784
Actually, let me write
out the word degrees.

00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:53.950
It might make things a
little bit clearer that we're

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.300
kind of using units
in both cases.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.300
Now, if we wanted to
simplify this a little bit,

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.010
we could divide both sides by 2.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.680
In which case, on
the left-hand side,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.760
we would get pi radians would
be equal to how many degrees?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.810
Well, it would be
equal to 180 degrees.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:19.950
And I could write it that way,
or I could write it that way.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.530
And you see over here,
this is 180 degrees.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.790
And you also see if you were
to draw a circle around here,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.340
we've gone halfway
around the circle.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.020
So the arc length, or the
arc that subtends the angle,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.220
is half the circumference.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.850
Half the circumference
is pi radiuses.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.830
So we call this pi radians.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.750
Pi radians is 180 degrees.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.750
And from this, we can
come up with conversions.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.470
So one radian would
be how many degrees?

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.250
Well, to do that,
we would just have

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.412
to divide both sides by pi.

00:08:54.412 --> 00:08:55.870
And on the left-hand
side, you'd be

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.120
left with 1-- I'll just
write it singular now.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.534
1 radian is equal to-- I'm
just dividing both sides.

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:02.950
Let me make it clear what I'm
doing here, just to show you

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.610
this isn't some voodoo.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.380
So I'm just dividing
both sides by pi here.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.574
On the left-hand side,
you're left with 1.

00:09:10.574 --> 00:09:11.990
And on the right-hand
side, you're

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.580
left with 180/pi degrees.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:23.732
So 1 radian is equal to
180/pi degrees, which

00:09:23.732 --> 00:09:25.440
is starting to make
it an interesting way

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.910
to convert them.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.920
Let's think about
it the other way.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.710
If I were to have 1 degree,
how many radians is that?

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.690
Well, let's start
off with-- let me

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.240
rewrite this thing over here.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:46.595
We said pi radians is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:51.230
So now we want to
think about 1 degree.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.580
So let's solve for 1 degree.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.540
1 degree, we can divide
both sides by 180.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.790
We are left with pi/180
radians is equal to 1 degree.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:10.450
So pi/180 radians is
equal to 1 degree.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.154
This might seem
confusing and daunting.

00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:13.570
And it was for me
the first time I

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.690
was exposed to this,
especially because we're not

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.640
exposed to this in
our everyday life.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.890
But what we're going to see
over the next few examples

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.560
is that as long as we keep
in mind this whole idea

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.160
that 2 pi radians is
equal to 360 degrees,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.250
or that pi radians is equal to
180 degrees, which is the two

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.160
things that I do
keep in my mind.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.299
We can always re-derive
these two things.

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:32.840
You might say, hey,
how do I remember

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.150
if it's pi/180 or 180/pi
to convert the two things?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.150
Well, just remember, which
is hopefully intuitive,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.550
that 2 pi radians is
equal to 360 degrees.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.180
And we'll work through a bunch
of examples in the next video,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.580
to just make sure
that we're used

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.130
to converting one
way or the other.
