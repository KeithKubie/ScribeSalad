00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.530
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Welcome everybody, my name is Thomas
Sharon and I'm a User Experience Researcher

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.580
here in Google
New

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.760
York and a proud Israeli.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.060
I'd like to briefly share two very quick stories
with you so first story's about Albert

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.710
Einstein back in the '40's.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.370
When he was a professor in Princeton, there
came the time to the final exam of the year,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.880
four hundred students in the room.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.320
His assistants pass the tests and then one
of his assistants tells him that-- he

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.150
notices that the questions are the same as
last year's questions.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.720
So he comes to Einstein, tells him that, he
looks

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.570
at the form and says, "Hmm.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.280
That's okay."

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.030
And the assistant says, "How come it's okay?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.510
It's physics and we have--
you know it's the same questions--they'll

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.530
know the answers."

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.329
He says, "Physics has changed so much in the
past year

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.540
the answers are now completely different so
it's okay."

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.920
[laughter]

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.610
The second story is--two weeks ago I was on
vacation in the West coast with my family,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.729
and at one point we came into
a local supermarket to buy some sandwiches

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.289
and a woman was standing behind us in line
and she listened to us speak in

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.299
Hebrew and then she approached us and of course
asked a question, "What language are you speaking?"

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.079
and I said, the
typical Israeli answer, "Uh, what do you think?"

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.810
And she said--she--after a few guesses--wrong
guesses-- she said--

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.950
I told her that this was Hebrew.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.009
Her eyes lit.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.479
She said, "I'm from, I'm originally from Morocco
and I'd love--I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.979
want to visit Israel."

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.689
And I asked her, "What stops you?" and she
said, "Well, the situation and that it's not

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.789
safe."

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:19.849
And then I asked myself really still we need
to answer those questions and I'm asking you

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.330
and I’m asking myself
almost every day, " How can we as in the '40's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.409
, as in the '40's physics can change the perception
about Israel and

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.610
change the answer, so it is my pleasure to
introduce to you Ambassador Ido Aharoni, Consul

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.879
General of the Israeli
Consulate in New York and a twenty year veteran

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.349
of Israel’s foreign service whose work on
improving Israel's

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.830
positioning in the U.S. is known and appreciated
by many.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.909
Ambassador Aharoni will share his thoughts
and experiences

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.569
about country brand management.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.579
And before you start, I really recommend start
going to work with a t-shirt, so

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.540
here's one for you.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.920
Welcome.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.300
[applause]

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.209
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Thank you so much.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.500
It's a wonderful gift and thank you for doing
this for us.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.660
Before I begin
I'd like to--oh, the t-shirt yes--as you can

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.420
imagine, my kids will take it right away--I
won't get a chance to--

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.420
thank you.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.569
Thank you so much and before I begin I'd like
to acknowledge the presence of some of my

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.442
esteemed
colleagues here, Gil Lainer the person who’s

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:50.519
in charge of public diplomacy--we'll talk
about public diplomacy in a

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.110
second-- and I also have here with us today,
Shani Rozanes, who's producing two big events,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.719
one in Washington D.C.
coming up this Sunday titled, "Broadening

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.480
the Conversation about Israel" and the second
here in New York City in

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.170
mid-June, again titled, "Israel: Broadening
the Conversation."

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.159
We'll talk about why we think it's critically
important for Israel to broaden the conversation

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.709
about the country.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.070
And lastly but not least, we have here with
us,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.950
[Hela Aroi], who is my own advisor.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.639
She's a Ph.D. candidate whose specialty is
the history of the Zionist Movement

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.650
and those of you interested in the history
of the Zionist movement are more than welcome

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.580
to ask her questions about
that because this is not what I am going to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.330
talk about today.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.750
I was asked to talk about--less about the
case of

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.450
Israel but more about what countries do in
order to improve their overall positioning.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.480
And the first thing I wanted to do was to
ask you, how many of you have heard of the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.940
guy named Erving Goffman?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.940
How
many?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.170
Okay, let me say a few words about Erving
Goffman because I think Erving Goffman's work

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.040
is extremely important
in the context of countries and places trying

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.220
to change or improve their overall positioning.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.290
Erving Goffman was a
sociologist from Canada who wrote a book--published

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.010
a book in the '50's titled The Presentation
of Self in Everyday

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.980
Life that really changed the way we understand
social interaction.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.040
What Erving Goffman claimed is that human
beings

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:25.700
will always strive to achieve control over
the other's perception of the social situation.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.610
So if you're in an
interaction with another human being, the

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.980
other will always try to control the way you
perceive them, and how do we

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.950
achieve this control?

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:43.120
By using symbols, by using things that symbolize
other things, for example--and by the way

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.740
that's the reason why his theory was called
Symbolic Interaction Theory--According to

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:57.240
Erving Goffman, all human
beings always try to maintain their back stage,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.550
their behind-the-curtain information inaccessible
to the other while

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.450
presenting using symbols, the kind of information
that they'd like to--so for example, the way

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.630
we dress; the symbols
that we chose to--for example you gave me

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.060
a wonderful example now-- this t-shirt symbolizes
something.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.870
If I go to
work and I walk into my office wearing this

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.840
t-shirt, I'm sending a very powerful message
to my employees and to my

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.740
staff members, of the kind of manager I am,
the kind of stuff that is important to me

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.810
and so on and so forth.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.390
This
is a perfect example of Erving Goffman.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:39.130
In our day to day life, marketers are using
Erving Goffman's theory on a daily basis.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.070
If you remember the famous
Bush-Kerry Campaign 2004, after Bush won the

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.000
elections, his campaign manager gave a speech,
I believe it was in the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.340
following January, January 2005 in which he
said, "We were in a position to tell the way--if

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.520
you're driving a BMW
you're more likely to vote for George W. Bush,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.080
if you're driving a Volvo you're more likely
to vote for John Kerry."

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.930
And what they actually did, they decoded the
symbols people use and understood the social,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.990
political, and economic
meaning of those symbols and as a result were

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.550
able to predict behavior.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.090
And it's all about, I’m sure you all know
that, it's all about the ability of the marketer

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.800
to predict the behavior of the consumer.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.940
So Erving Goffman's
contribution, and his book that was published

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.810
in the late '50's really changed a lot and
I think gave rise to this

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:43.340
whole notion of let's try to predict the behavior
of the consumer based on the symbols the consumer

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.430
chose to use in
the process.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.740
Just a piece of trivia: I am sure you'll recognize
this lady, the late actress Francis Bay, the

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.860
marble rye lady from

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.930
Seinfeld.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.460
That's Erving Goffman's sister.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.170
[laughter]

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:04.650
The power of brand management: here you're
looking at two products that essentially produce

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.530
the same result.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.530
One is a

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.970
Mont Blanc that goes for three hundred bucks
I think, two hundred fifty, and the other,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.840
if you're staying at the
Crowne Plaza you can take for free.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.410
And the question that marketers and brand
managers ask themselves is "what makes a human

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.070
being spend so much money on

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.690
a product when he or she can essentially get
the very same result for nothing?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.459
And the answer of course is the
people who designed the product on the right

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:38.220
created such an attractive persona for this
product that the consumer is

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:44.000
willing to pay that much money only to be
associated with that personality.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.430
That's the power of brand management.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.110
And in country positioning, we say the same
way human beings have personalities, the same

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.190
way that human beings have
DNA, the same way products have attractive

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:02.640
personas, also places can be considered to
be attractive or we can decode

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.200
and understand their DNA or we can understand
their personalities.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.140
We always use the word personification basically
looking at places the same way you look at

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.770
human beings is always
useful in the field of country positioning.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:26.280
Now you're--Google is a big part of this revolution
but we identified in the field of country

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.420
positioning several
changes that occurred as a result of the every

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.170
changing technological environment.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.590
The first-- and each of every one

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.930
of them is of really critical importance to
every country, every city, every place that

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.900
is trying to improve its
over all positioning , that is trying to improve

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.270
its performance.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.020
The most important thing that we now know
for

00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:00.950
governments to do is to emphasize the need
to engage in a meaningful interaction with

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.190
the consumer.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.400
So it's not just
about unilaterally transmitting a message--used

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.250
to be in the old days we call it the move
from a system of

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.870
broadcasting to a system of narrowcasting,
but it's also the understanding that it's

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.450
about quality not about
quantity; that it's about content rather than

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.100
about creating an attractive platform and
that people are more mentally

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:31.610
attuned to listen to narrative rather than
cold, clinical, historical, legal arguments.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.500
And governments have got to
look at this revolution and understand that

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.730
this is what is required today of them to
do.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:44.400
Dialogue over monologue;
quality over quantity; content over platform;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.010
and being attractive is more important than
being right.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.940
And the person
who really made a great contribution to this

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.380
conversation is an American academic from
Harvard University and is also

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.360
an American diplomat whose name is Joseph
Nye who came up--coined the term 'the power

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.490
of attraction.'

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.270
And places today have to be attractive if
they want to be compete out there.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:15.029
And the competition between places is
very tough, it's actually vicious and this

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:19.830
the arena we entered shortly after 9/11 here
in New York.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.550
And we decided
to look at Israel the same way you look at

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.120
any other brand.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.780
and this is the definition that we adopted:
a brand is a

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.790
promise, a strong brand is a promise delivered.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.300
Now in the field of branding, especially--for
many many years there

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.090
was a misconception that branding is in the
first place about the ability to create an

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.590
attractive visual language.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.200
And we say branding is way more than just
visual language, in fact, branding is--the

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.820
real branding has to adopt the

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.020
tools used in place positioning.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.400
I always like to tell this story of Israel's
number one bus company called Egged,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.589
that several years ago decided to send a very
strong message to the Israeli consumer, "we

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:03.589
care about the
environment,"

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.900
so they hired a branding expert.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.360
He said, "No problem.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.490
You care about the environment, you want to
send this message

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.100
to the Israeli consumer, so let's paint the
buses green."

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.100
So they did.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.570
They painted the fifty thousand buses in
green.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.320
They forgot to do one little thing and that
is to change the technology.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.310
There's another example in Israel which is
a--the story of my own hometown.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:33.180
I grew up place called Holon, which is
a, if you may, suburb of Tel Aviv, some one

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.880
hundred eighty thousand people and Holon for
many years suffered from a

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.270
very bad image.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:46.270
It was plagued with crime, it was -- had this
boring grey image of an industrial suburb

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.589
of Tel Aviv,
south of Tel Aviv.

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:52.940
But about some fifteen-sixteen years ago,
a new mayor was elected.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.070
His name was Moti Sasson.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.580
And
Moti Sasson to do, instinctively, something

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.580
very very smart.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.839
He said, "I'm not going to spend money on
advertising

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:02.690
telling people that Holon is a great place.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.529
What I'm going to do is actually turn Holon
into a great place."

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:11.430
He identified that there's a niche in the
Israeli market, there's no places that's catering

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.860
especially for children,
and he said "I'm going to turn Holon into

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.339
the center for children."

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:24.580
And he invested, for the next five years,
every penny that the city had in infrastructure

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.040
that supported his claim to be Israel's "city
of children."

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.330
So for
example, he built the children's museum, and

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.089
a media center for children.

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:39.420
He came up with this ground breaking
concept of theme playgrounds for toddlers,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.120
in Hebrew called "Gan Sipur".

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.310
He bought over twenty of them, and he
built--imagine a toddler is walking to a playground

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.650
that is entirely designed based on a classic
children's book,

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:56.970
like "The Giving Tree" or in our case [Chenan
a'chahama] for example it's a great children's

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.970
book.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.970
So five years into

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.740
the process, Moti Sasson had to spend very
little money on advertising because it became

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.940
well known that Holon is
indeed Israel’s city of children because

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.350
he was smart enough to create infrastructure,
facts on the ground that

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:19.460
supported the overall strategy that he chose
as a mayor.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:25.570
Now there are many many aspects to what countries
and places need to do in order to improve

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.790
their overall
positioning.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:34.730
But I would like to mention one of the key
factors is the ability to build partnerships.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.050
It's never
about governments or managements dictating

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.210
to the public what needs to be done.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:45.710
This requires a long, sometimes very

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.920
tiring process--never ending process of partnership
building.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.550
And I'll show you in a minute the elements,
the

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.600
components of this partnership building process.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.900
Now, country positioning, there are two approaches
to country positioning.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:08.580
The country positioning that many of you
are exposed to on television and even online

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.130
is usually meant to promote tourism.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.140
We call it destination branding.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.970
More and more countries today move to the
other approach, which we call holistic country

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.220
positioning model, which
means places, it can be a city or it can be

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.500
a country that are interested in improving
their overall

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.470
performance across the board.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:36.410
So it's about attracting tourists; it's about
attracting investors.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.240
It's about
improving the level of exposure of your country's

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.700
culture to the world.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:50.750
It's about the ability to celebrate your
leading export brands so for example if you're

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:57.020
Finland, you have Nokia in the '70s; Sweden
had ABBA, and Volvo; and

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:03.730
countries that actually are identified by
their leading celebrated sub-brands and of

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.010
course it's about the people.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.200
The culture and the heritage, I've noticed
that there are several Israelis here in this

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
room.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.150
So the people, the
Israelis that work and spend time abroad,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:20.091
they also serve as a channel for Israel to
communicate its identity, its

00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:21.529
brand to the world.

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:28.820
So today countries see themselves as brands
too and they are--and they can be managed

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.710
the same
way you manage a brand.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.870
Now we started by saying that places have
DNA's, that places have personality.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.560
Let's take the case of Brazil.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.560
What's

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.520
the first thing that comes to mind when we
think of Brazil?

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.600
I'm asking you?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.320
[several voices, intelligible words]
Soccer, beaches, bikini, Carnival.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.310
If we--when we think of Brazil, we think of
Brazil in the context of only one

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.320
thing: fun.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.970
That is the DNA of Brazil.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.290
Now those of you who've been to Brazil know
that indeed there's a lot of fun

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.520
in Brazil, but Brazil is not entirely about
fun, right?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.309
If you live in a favela outside of San Paolo--life
is not so

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:12.149
much fun, yet this is the context we all perceive
Brazil.

00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:16.579
In place positioning terminology, Brazil is
in a wonderful

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.029
position.

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:21.549
Brand Brazil is way up here.

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:25.909
Brazil the product is a little inferior to
the brand, and the gap between the

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:29.179
two is worth billions to Brazil's economy.

00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:33.250
As you will see in a few minutes, in Israel's
case, it is exactly the

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.730
opposite.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.519
Israel the place, is extremely attractive,
powerful.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:44.169
Israel's image is so bad that it becomes a
liability and the gap

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:48.460
between the two represents a huge economic
deficit.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.789
Paris.

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:55.720
Paris was branded actually by you, the American
people.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.460
By Hollywood as the world capital of romance.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.720
You
guys are good, either that or you've seen

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.710
this presentation before.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:10.659
[laughter] Paris is about romance and Hollywood
did more to brand Paris than any other branding

00:18:10.659 --> 00:18:11.789
agent in the world.

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:16.029
By the way, Hollywood is so powerful that
Hollywood is branding other nations.

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:20.120
We will talk about the most interesting case
study of them all in a few

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.120
minutes.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.120
New York.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:28.809
I want you to know that New York served, and
still serves as our inspiration in Israel

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:31.059
in terms of place
positioning.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:36.879
What was done here in New York, beginning
in the early '70's, is amazing.

00:18:36.879 --> 00:18:40.249
And of course it started in
the early '70's culminated with the great

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:44.100
work that was done during the Giuliani and
Bloomberg administrations.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.460
But
what New York was able to do in less than

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.039
thirty years is remarkable.

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.720
I want you to think about it.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.480
In the early
'70's, there was a mysterious campaign in

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.090
American media.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.419
Someone started to publish ads in American
newspapers

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:09.740
that on a certain day in November of 1972,
New York is going to disappear.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.380
And you know, no one knew who was behind
this bizarre and twisted sense of humor.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.519
And then the next ad, they said that the Statue
of Liberty was going to

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:26.629
go under into the water of the Hudson and
you could see the ad with the sinking Statue

00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:28.490
of Liberty.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:33.149
And the mystery
was resolved when finally the company behind

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:34.889
this bizarre campaign came out.

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:36.350
It was Alitalia.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.129
It was their twisted
way of announcing to the world that they were

00:19:40.129 --> 00:19:46.270
launching a direct line that would take you
from Rome to Boston and

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.899
from Rome to Washington, D.C. so you don't
have to go through New York.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:55.980
The mayor of New York at that time, Mayor
Lindsey was alarmed by it.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.080
He said, "Wait a second.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.620
This is the perception of New York?

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.789
This is our image?

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:04.660
This is terrible, we have to do
something about it."

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:11.581
In addition to an official complaint that
was sent to Alitalia, a bunch of New York

00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:16.649
business people, most notably
the Rudin family, the Tisch family and others

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:20.359
got together with some PR experts and formed
what is still active

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:24.919
until this very day, an organization called
The Association for A Better New York.

00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:28.220
What the Association for A Better
New York tried to do is something very simple.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.200
They said "We cannot be defined only by our
deficiencies."

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.239
And you
have to remember, in the early '70s, again

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:40.379
Hollywood played a major role here, New York
was defined by its

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:41.379
deficiencies.

00:20:41.379 --> 00:20:47.559
New York was branded by Hollywood as the world's
capitol of crime and the world's capitol of

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.820
police
corruption.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.019
And they did it through series of movies that
started with Serpico, which is all about police

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:58.869
corruption,
continued with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets,

00:20:58.869 --> 00:21:04.010
and movies that celebrated New York as a relentless
producer of crime and

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.330
violence.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.290
And as a result people were afraid to come
to New York, add to that the fact that New

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.989
York was on the verge

00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:12.519
of economic bankruptcy.

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:17.220
Everybody remembers when the City of New York
turned to the federal government asking for

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.330
financial aid and President Ford at the time,
1975, said, "I'm not going to give it to you."

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:28.389
The next day New York
Post headline was "Ford to New York: Drop

00:21:28.389 --> 00:21:29.389
Dead."

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:35.919
That was really the lowest point in that process
and since then,

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:43.919
since "Ford to New York: Drop Dead"--New York
is slowly and gradually improving its overall

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:48.619
positioning by doing
exactly what needs to be done.

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:56.440
New York identified its own competitive edge
which has two elements, the first is the

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.909
size.

00:21:57.909 --> 00:22:03.109
Everything in New York is big: the number
of people is huge, the buildings are huge

00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:05.619
and also the temptation is

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.210
huge to come to New York.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.320
New York is about the totality of your experience
as a consumer.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.820
It is the plus and the
minus, it's the good and the bad.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.880
That is why they wisely chose the apple.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.840
The apple is a religious symbol.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840
It says

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.070
something about temptation.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:32.350
It comes from the Bible, it's talking to Americans
who care about the Bible.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.600
The Big
Apple communicates very effectively with people

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.919
of faith, telling them New York is about the
good and the bad.

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:43.950
It's
about the totality of the New York experience.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.009
And then after the Big Apple came a brilliant
campaign that says "I

00:22:47.009 --> 00:22:49.940
love New York" because that's the next level.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.169
After you spark the interest and the curiosity
of the consumer, then

00:22:53.169 --> 00:22:54.450
comes the love affair.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:59.960
And I can tell you at least we're concerned,
Israelis, the New York strategy is working

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.139
in a
very big way.

00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:03.919
Israelis truly love New York.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.049
When you talk to Israelis about New York,
that's their favorite subject.

00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:10.419
Israelis will tell you, "Oh, I love New York.

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:11.899
There's a one restaurant..."

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:13.460
They have their favorite restaurant, of
course, in New York.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.230
They have their favorite stores in New York.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.389
They have everything you need to know about
New

00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:19.399
York, you have to ask the Israelis.

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:21.879
They know more about New York than New Yorkers
themselves.

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.590
I'm serious.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.840
I'm not
kidding.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.389
And the reason is because New York was successful
establishing real, genuine relationship between

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:34.260
Israel
and the city of New York.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.789
And I can tell you that New York is being
celebrated by Israelis on a daily basis.

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:42.730
You can
find evidence to that in the Israeli media

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.730
every day.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.919
The most amazing story is the story of Las
Vegas.

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:47.919
Why?

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:51.159
Because the strategy is so bold, it's so gutsy,
it's so

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:52.239
unbelievable.

00:23:52.239 --> 00:24:00.580
What Las Vegas did, they said "Okay let's
look at all of our qualities, advantages and

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.580
deficiencies?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.559
And let's choose the biggest problem that
we have."

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.549
What's the biggest problem they have?

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:08.230
Las Vegas is about what?

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.460
It's about gambling, right?

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.460
There's an industry.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.889
There's a consensus in Western civilization,
especially among

00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:17.320
people of faith, that gambling is immoral,
it's problematic.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.629
So they said, "Okay, let's take that one deficiency
that

00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:26.820
we have--that one problem that is really the
biggest problem that we have--and let's instead

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.909
of hiding it, instead of

00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:35.749
shying away from it, let's" --do what?--"celebrate
it."

00:24:35.749 --> 00:24:39.039
Las Vegas is about sin.

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:42.259
What happens in Vegas, stays in
Vegas.

00:24:42.259 --> 00:24:43.259
Hmm.

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:44.259
Interesting.

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:47.979
I'm asking you, what is it that happened in
Vegas that has to stay in Vegas?

00:24:47.979 --> 00:24:51.369
[laughter]
What, did we go there to celebrate my son's

00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:52.369
Bar Mitzvah?

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:53.399
[laughter]
No.

00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:56.769
It was something probably more serious than
that.

00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:00.519
I probably lost my house, maybe lost my wife,
who knows what

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:01.629
happened to me in Vegas?

00:25:01.629 --> 00:25:03.899
But it's okay, it will stay in Vegas.

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:07.669
Again, Hollywood is branding Vegas as the
ultimate

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:09.259
Sin City.

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:14.269
It's a very bold move on the part of the strategists
of the branding of Las Vegas.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:17.200
The equivalent would be,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.320
imagining Israel appealing to you, the American
consumer, "Come to Israel for an Explosive

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.320
vacation."

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.440
[laughter]
Can you imagine that?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.289
That's what Las Vegas did.

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:30.460
[laughter] Pretty amazing.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.899
So we said, "Okay, if Brazil is about fun,
and Paris is about romance, then Israel is

00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:37.710
about what?"

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.620
Well, we'll talk
about that.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.809
But the guy who is teaching us the most important
lesson is Sacha Baron Cohen.

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.080
[laughter]

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.629
Sacha Baron Cohen is teaching us country positioning
today is a necessity.

00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:54.499
It is not a luxury for countries.

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:57.479
Sacha
Baron Cohen woke up one day, I think it was

00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:00.929
maybe eight-nine years ago when he had still
The Ali G Show--this was

00:26:00.929 --> 00:26:07.940
before the movie and he said to himself, “I’m
going to take one nation-- a serious nation

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.340
with a history of thousands

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.850
of years, with rich culture, with lots of
natural resources, with great potential, with

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:19.169
real heritage, with real
political leadership, with real history and

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:24.779
I'm going to singlehandedly redefine their
entire identity and I'm going

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:29.429
to do something to them that they're not expecting.

00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:31.869
I'm going to turn them into a joke."

00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:34.389
That's what he did,
singlehandedly.

00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:36.289
This is before Hollywood.

00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:39.840
This is when he had a T.V. show and he created
that character called

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840
Borat.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.869
It's an amazing thing, if you think about
it, an amazing thing.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:50.350
When the real president of Kazakhstan was
here, I believe in 2005, he held a press conference

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.610
at the White House with President Bush.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.779
Sacha Baron Cohen held
his own press conference if you remember.

00:26:56.779 --> 00:27:01.409
He had more cameras in his room than the real
one.

00:27:01.409 --> 00:27:02.409
Think about it.

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:07.190
Sacha
Baron Cohen is the world's famous Kazakhi.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:12.019
[Laughter] Yet he never set foot in his life
in Kazakhstan.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:13.019
And I'm asking

00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:16.529
you why was he able to do that?

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:24.320
Why was he able to singlehandedly the identity
of an entire nation?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.580
And the answer
is because, at that point, up until that point

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.749
they did very little to define their own identity
to us, the

00:27:33.749 --> 00:27:36.629
consumers, in a proactive fashion.

00:27:36.629 --> 00:27:41.830
In other words they allowed someone else,
and this is why Sacha Baron Cohen is

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.210
teaching us a very very important lesson.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.259
If you will not take the proactive approach
of defining your own identity, be

00:27:49.259 --> 00:27:53.799
assured your competition will do it for you.

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:58.570
And that's exactly what Kazakhstan learned
from the experience of Sacha

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.570
Baron Cohen.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:06.179
He taught them that brand capital today is
an integral part of countries’ national

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:07.179
security.

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:09.179
It's not
just about military strength, it's not just

00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:14.009
about your ability to execute military operations,
it is also about the

00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:19.480
strength of your economy and about your ability
to highlight and communicate your attractive

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480
facets.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.049
We talked about the dramatic change, Google
is part of that dramatic change obviously.

00:28:25.049 --> 00:28:29.359
The two things that we need
to do in place positioning, the first thing

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:33.359
is we need to identify our own relative advantages
of place.

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:38.229
So I said
New York identified their size, and the diversity

00:28:38.229 --> 00:28:42.149
of the temptation, the city of New York as
their main competitive

00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:43.149
edge.

00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:45.450
In the case of Paris and Venice, it's all
about romance.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.019
In the case of Brazil, it's all about the
fun and so

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:49.299
on and so forth.

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:51.809
We'll get to Israel's competitive edge in
a second.

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:53.729
But once you've identified your competitive
edge

00:28:53.729 --> 00:29:00.299
as a place, the second thing that you need
to do is to find a way to effectively communicate

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:04.549
that relative advantage
To relevant audiences because what you don't

00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:09.179
want to do is communicate your competitive
edge to audiences that are

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:14.039
not interested in what you're selling and
not interested in what you have to say.

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:19.349
And I think this is where Google
can be extremely effective and influential.

00:29:19.349 --> 00:29:24.929
Here's an example of a work plan that we developed
to celebrate several

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.369
niche markets in Israel.

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:30.899
I don't know how many people in the room have
been to Israel and what is the image Israel--

00:29:30.899 --> 00:29:36.389
that you have of Israel, but if you will look
at the niche markets on the screen, each and

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:41.669
every one of them can be
celebrated in a big way by the international

00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:46.159
community and this is exactly what we're trying
to do as part of the

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:51.049
program that I created called Brand Israel.

00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:56.039
This is what countries need and I think that
many of the people in the room have the answers

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:58.830
to the questions that
are posed by nations.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:03.129
The first thing that we need is someone who
will tell us, and I'm speaking on behalf of

00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:06.399
all the nations, and I think
of all the cities in the world interested

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:08.419
in improving their position.

00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:16.200
The first thing that we need is to identify
relevant hubs, those relevant Internet intersections

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.000
that we need to go through if we want to influence
a

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.409
conversation about something.

00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:22.419
Let me give you an example.

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:26.780
We have in Israel three marathons-- very distinguished
marathons.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:33.190
We have the Tel Aviv Marathon, we have the
Tiberias Marathon, and we have the Jerusalem

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.200
Marathon, in
addition to the Iron Man and all the triathlons,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.789
but we have three very distinguished marathons.

00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:43.230
We'd like to promote
those marathons all over the world.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:48.570
We know that there are tens of millions of
people around the world that care

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.490
passionately about long distance running.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.669
Many of them run the marathons in New York,
in Paris, elsewhere.

00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:59.159
We'd like
them to consider Israel as a destination for

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:02.919
long distance running and if they can't afford
to coming to Israel, we'd

00:31:02.919 --> 00:31:08.239
like them to be interested, develop curiosity
about the three marathons we have in Israel.

00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:11.549
So for example, what we
would do with a company like Google is ask

00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:15.669
you can you identify, if I would like to be
part of that conversation

00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:21.229
about marathons, can you identify for me the
most important Internet hubs all over the

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:24.739
world that I need to go
through if I were to want to be part of those

00:31:24.739 --> 00:31:25.739
conversations.

00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:26.739
That's the first step.

00:31:26.739 --> 00:31:30.009
A city or country like Israel
would do.

00:31:30.009 --> 00:31:36.289
The second thing is once we've identified
those Internet hubs, what we need to do is

00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:43.109
find a way that is not self-
congratulatory, that is not Israel approaching

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.360
the consumer while saying, "Look at me.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.789
I have such a great marathon."

00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:48.509
This is not how it works.

00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:54.529
But we need to find a way to engage in a meaningful
conversation with those hubs, that is

00:31:54.529 --> 00:32:04.340
being conducted by surrogates, by people that
don't even know that they are my ambassadors.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.349
I have millions of people
out there that are big friends of the state

00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:15.809
of Israel and they are passionate about running
long distance marathons

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:19.649
and they're willing to speak on my behalf,
they are willing to celebrate the three marathons

00:32:19.649 --> 00:32:23.879
we have in Israel and
they don't even know us.

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:27.429
I'd like to find them, I'd like to know where
they are.

00:32:27.429 --> 00:32:31.409
I'd like them to initiate that
conversation.

00:32:31.409 --> 00:32:37.700
And then step three of course, it's the one
million dollar question, how do we measure

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.700
results?

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.759
Can we measure them
effectively?

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:45.659
Can we provide the city or the country with
information that sheds some more light about

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:47.869
the
effectiveness of what we did?

00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:51.249
So, here we have a platform.

00:32:51.249 --> 00:32:55.049
If we can come up with a solution that is
not just

00:32:55.049 --> 00:33:00.019
technological, a solution to all three steps,
we really did something we really did something

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:04.360
major to advance the
conversation about country positioning.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:10.070
Another way to do it we're talking about online
conversations, but I can tell you again, based

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.909
on my own
experience--and I've been doing it for ten

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:16.779
years on and off --targeted exposure events
is the most effective way to

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:17.889
get the word out.

00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:23.340
What is a targeted exposure event, you take
a small group of members of the elite, it

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.139
can be here
in New York, it can be in Israel.

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:32.019
This event--I consider this event to be a
targeted exposure event.

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:33.919
You bring
people that are clearly part of the creative

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:39.759
class and you share with them your work in
order, again, to engage

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:44.409
ourselves in a meaningful two-way conversation
about the subject matter.

00:33:44.409 --> 00:33:48.230
There's nothing more important that that
because then you can actually hear some ideas

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.700
from professionals and practitioners and improve
your strategy and your

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.700
performance.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.820
The most important thing that places have
to know about country positioning, it's not

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.879
about what we say,
it's about what they hear.

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:08.399
You know I always tell this point--there's
a reason for the slide with the penguin--

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:12.710
there's a guy walking down the street who
runs into an old friend.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.740
He sees the old friend, much to his surprise,
has

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.330
a penguin marching behind him.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.200
He says to him, "Hey have you noticed there's
a penguin behind you?"

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.829
And the friend says, "Of course I know there's
a penguin behind me."

00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:24.490
"So, well, what you going to do about the
penguin?

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.639
I suggest you take this penguin right away
to the nearest zoo.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.909
"
The friend says, "That's a great idea."

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:33.529
The next day he sees the same friend again,
marching with the same penguin.

00:34:33.529 --> 00:34:35.960
He says, "Hey didn't I tell you to take
him to the zoo?"

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.730
"Yeah, yesterday we went to the zoo.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.780
Today we're going to the movies."

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.190
[laughter]

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.179
It's not about what we hear, it's about what
they say.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.529
And in order for us to know what they say,
we need to conduct

00:34:47.529 --> 00:34:51.970
research and we'll talk about that in a second.

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:57.930
Countries and organizations sometimes are
convinced that the task at hand is to win

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.539
a debate.

00:34:59.539 --> 00:35:01.950
It's not about winning
a debate.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:07.930
As I said before it's about engaging in a
real meaningful conversation.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:13.910
Research is a key for places, they
have a tendency to rely heavily on quantitative

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.910
research.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.829
I think that the biggest mistake that places
do is that

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:20.230
they're not investing enough in qualitative
research.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.660
They're not investing enough in actually talking
to people, .

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.250
interviewing them, trying to understand what's
going on when it comes to the quality of the

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.789
emotional tie that is
created between a place and a consumer.

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:34.760
We talked about the need to form partnerships.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.849
This is the model that was developed by Placebrands.

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:41.390
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:46.630
This is the model that shows you--these are
the elements that have to form the partnership.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.631
So obviously you have to
have the government represented; you have

00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:53.099
to have the business sector; you have to have
the third sector-- we

00:35:53.099 --> 00:36:00.280
described the non-profit sector; the masses--the
people--the public; you have to have the cultural

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.760
establishment; and
of course in our case, in the case of Israel,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.339
you have to have world Jewry that we call
the Diaspora.

00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:11.140
This is really
the model for Israel's partnership in order

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.339
to change the way Israel is communicating
itself to the world.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.809
This is
the personality that we came up with and these

00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:21.940
are the relative advantages that Israel possesses
that we would like

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:29.770
to communicate using narrow marketing--narrowcasting
and micro-marketing systems.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.099
We talked about "what is Israel's relative
advantage?"

00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:38.309
We, again through massive research, we came
to the conclusion

00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:45.599
that Israel's unique advantage is the amazing
creative spirit that exists in Israel.

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:50.161
That is manifested in almost
every realm of life, it's manifested in all

00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:54.470
six areas here from Lifestyle and Leisure
to the Environment to Hi-tech

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.309
and Science to the Diversity of the people
of Israel to the Culture, the Art, and of

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:05.210
course Israel's unbelievable
comprehensive and vast International aid program

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.480
that most Israeli's never heard of, let alone
Americans.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.740
This is
something that we need to change and every

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:18.220
pillar, every lens you see here Israel possesses
a clear relative

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:23.640
advantage and our job is to make sure that
you--the American people-- are aware of that.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.619
And that's we are titling
this effort "Broadening the conversation"

00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:32.359
but Israel, because the current conversation
is all about Israel's problems

00:37:32.359 --> 00:37:37.070
with its neighbors and we believe that there's
very little benefit for us in the sense of

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:41.109
promoting tourism,
promoting investment, promoting culture, continuing

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:44.480
with this celebration.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.140
When you ask Israelis--and I will end with
that--when you ask Israelis, "What is your

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.450
own self impression?

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.170
What is
your own self-perception?"

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.230
This is what you're getting usually.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.609
And these are actually---these are results
from a

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.970
qualitative study conducted in Israel in 2007-2008.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:06.089
So you can see Israelis see themselves first
of all as Western,

00:38:06.089 --> 00:38:08.190
modern, creative.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.020
They see themselves as a world hi-tech leader.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.079
They are--you know, they mention the Palestine--the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict--they mention

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:19.359
anti-Semitism and other problems that they
are aware of, but by--by and

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:21.859
large Israelis think they're very cool.

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:25.520
[laughter] Bottom line, Israelis think they're
very cool.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.200
But what is it that
the world sees?

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.440
What is it that Israel as a collective communicates
to the world?

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.390
This is what the world sees, this is what
you see on the news.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:37.349
You see Israel with the military might and
you see the

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:41.280
Palestinians depicted by the media clearly
as the underdog.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.890
And we believe it is possible for us to create
attraction using this conversation.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.049
And our research shows that no matter where
you're coming from, no matter

00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:56.690
whether you support the tank or you support
the boy, the entire context is not attractive

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:57.920
to most people.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.140
In
America, in Asia, in Europe.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.819
So what is it that we can do because this
conversation is very powerful.

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:08.790
I'm not interested in trying to hide it by
the way.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.661
I'm not interested in trying to minimize it.

00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:15.289
I certainly would like you to believe that
the tank is right

00:39:15.289 --> 00:39:18.849
and that the tank is actually being victimized
by our neighbors and so on.

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:22.880
But I realize that most of you are not interested
in that conversation.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.640
So our job, in the case of Israel's country
positioning, is to make sure that we open

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.339
other
channels of communications through which Israel

00:39:31.339 --> 00:39:34.590
can be communicated to you that are relevant
to you.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.690
And those
channels of communication, without hiding

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:41.630
the conflict, those channels are extremely
attractive.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.510
And Israel is
possessing a clear relative advantage in each

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.040
and every one of them.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.470
So it can be music and the arts, it can be
fashion, it can be energy and the environment,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.599
it can be lifestyle, wine and food, and it
can be international aid

00:39:56.599 --> 00:40:03.300
programs and great sightseeing, and great
advancements in the field of technology and

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.109
hi-tech--you see here the
Pill cam and so on and architecture and the

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:08.539
conflict too.

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:12.290
The conflict is even at the very center of
this mosaic of

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:19.790
pictures but the conflict cannot be the only
thing defining Israel to the world.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.470
Because Israel is way more than it's
troubles.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:27.490
Israel is way more that it's issues with its
neighbors.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:33.559
And I always give the example of the context
of two people arguing constantly no matter

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:37.150
who's right and who's wrong,
at one point the consumer is tired of the

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.150
discussion.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:42.920
The consumer becomes fatigued by the debate,
and both sides

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.980
stand to lose from it, so we say our job is
to take back the conflict and put it in the

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.700
right proportion.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.710
There's a
whole world out there that we can approach,

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:57.579
that we can be appealing to and we're not
because we're stuck on the

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:01.599
question of who's right and who's wrong, and
this is what we would like to change.

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:07.440
Let me just end with an amusing story and
open the floor for your questions.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.510
They tell the story about Golda Meir,
our Prime Minister in the years between 1969

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:17.430
and 1974, then in 1972 was asked to host the
German Chancellor at the

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.500
time, his name was Willy Brandt, in Tel Aviv.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.690
And someone wisely advised Golda,"If you want
to impress Willy Brandt,

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.069
take him on a tour of German architecture
in Tel Aviv.

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.850
He will like it."--we have thousands of Bauhaus
buildings in

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:32.839
Tel Aviv-- so she did and they concluded the
tour at the HaBima Square--those of you who've

00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:35.430
been to Tel Aviv know
it's our national theater--and she told him,

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:36.470
"This is our National Theater.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.180
Right next to it," she said, " is the
Mann Auditorium, our Performing Arts Center."

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.450
And Willy Brandt said, "Oh my God, I can't
believe you the Israelis made the decision

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.109
to name your own performing
arts center after the famous German author

00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:50.630
Thomas Mann!"

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.200
And Golda looked at him and said, "No, no,
no.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.049
We named it after Freddie Mann from Philadelphia."

00:41:54.049 --> 00:41:57.030
He said, "Freddie Mann from Philadelphia,
what did he write?"

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.400
She said, "He wrote a check."

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.289
[laughter]

00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:11.410
There's a tough competition out there, between
cities and countries, if Israel, or any other

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.140
country, will not be
able to communicate effectively its attractive

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.089
dimensions to the world, it will impair its
own ability to be

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:21.420
competitive.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.740
It becomes an impediment.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.030
And the realization that we realized shortly
after 9/11, that we have a lot

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.250
to offer you, the American people.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.450
And I think that the success of the book,
Start Up Nation, proves that point.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:37.460
There's a book, it's not about the conflict,
that became a best seller.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.220
And the reason why the book became a best
seller--and if you haven't read the book,

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.910
I urge all of you to read that book-- the
reason why Start Up Nation became

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.150
such a best seller is because it's relevant.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:50.000
It's relevant to the American people struggling
with economic crises.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.740
Here's a story of a tiny nation, surrounded
by enemies, that did it the other way.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.359
Let's try to learn from them.

00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:02.190
Israel can be a source of inspiration for
many Americans, and our job is to make sure

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.740
that you are aware of it.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.579
Your questions please.

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.750
[Applause]

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:13.760
One at a time please.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.760
Yeah?

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.160
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hey there.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.170
One question is have you heard of the U.S.
Brand U.S.A. program, are you familiar with

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.170
it at all?

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.980
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: I was just--it was just
brought to my attention and I know that some

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.490
of them are online right
now listening to this presentation so I would

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:29.380
love to meet with them and have a conversation
with them with pleasure.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.790
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay, if you want to talk afterwards.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.240
We're people who work that team here--

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Oh wonderful!

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.069
&gt;&gt;Male #2: They'd love to hear something like
this.

00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:39.539
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: By the way, I think
that Brand U.S.A., not your program, but U.S.A.

00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:43.280
as a brand is the strongest
brand in the world.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.029
And we can have a whole conversation about
why the United States is such a strong brand,

00:43:48.029 --> 00:43:50.089
but I
can tell you in country positioning you have

00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:52.119
the United States, and then the rest of the
world.

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:59.329
&gt;&gt;Male speaker#2: Sort of on that note, so
you mention using the Israeli Diaspora to

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:00.599
recruit people for various--

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:01.599
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Jewish Diaspora also.

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:03.440
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Jewish Diaspora--okay.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.410
So I feel like the Jewish Diaspora, at least
in America, is a little more

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.670
strongly affiliated with Israel because of
the stigma of leaving for example.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.790
The American Diaspora, I think, has
less of that element I feel like there are

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:19.329
Americans who live abroad who sort of want
nothing to do with America,

00:44:19.329 --> 00:44:23.130
and I'm kind of curious what your views are
about recruiting that diaspora to actually

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.890
enlist their support.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.700
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Two advices.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:31.599
The first is, leave politics out of the game,
out of the conversation.

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:34.099
And the
second thing is, try to identify what is it

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:37.059
that makes America such a great brand.

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:38.059
Think about it.

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:39.950
We said, "Brand
is a promise.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.380
A strong brand is a promise delivered."

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.079
What is the DNA of the United States?

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.630
America is about what?

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.319
What's the one word that defines--

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.319
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Freedom.

00:44:50.319 --> 00:44:51.410
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Freedom, exactly.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:55.710
The United States is about freedom and the
fact that freedom is being

00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.210
supported in almost every of dimension of
life in America, whether you look at the political

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.210
system, even the
physic-- the, you know, physical experience

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.059
of traveling in America is about freedom.

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:10.069
The outdoors, the highways.

00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:14.370
You go to California, you go to Texas, you
take the--you know-- you go on the road on

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.549
a road trip, you see all--you
can smell the freedom in America.

00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:20.920
It's so powerful, it's so sensual.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.750
And so this is your main asset.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.240
To what extent,
does an American who made a decision to live

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:32.069
in Paris for political, ideological reasons,
or for business reasons

00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:37.250
cares about the fact that America celebrates
freedom?

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.980
That's the question that you have to ask.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:43.309
To what extent these
people, that American diaspora overseas, deeply

00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:46.020
cares about the DNA of the United States?

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.240
And I think once you'll be
able to answer that question, it will be easier

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.800
to come up with a program that is relevant
to them.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.099
My feeling, and again, my gut feeling--I'm
married to an American who moved to Israel--in

00:45:57.099 --> 00:45:59.260
fact, I'm the only non-
American in my family.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.059
I'm the only person in my immediate family
that doesn't have an American passport.

00:46:03.059 --> 00:46:05.700
And I can
tell you that in the case of Americans who

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.140
move out of America, you know, something else
motivates them.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.760
It's not the
celebration of American freedom.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.460
Something else, they found purpose elsewhere,
and you need to understand what's that

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.530
thing that they discovered.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.930
&gt;&gt;Male speaker#2: Thank you.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:27.420
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi, you talked a little bit about
how Hollywood had promoted the image that

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:32.890
New York City was a
dangerous place full of crime up through the

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.890
'70s.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.839
Hollywood is still making those films it seems,
so what actually

00:46:37.839 --> 00:46:38.839
changed?

00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:44.720
It seems almost like the films we watch are
a romantic version of that but it doesn't

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.760
seem like that's
actually what changed and got people to see

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760
New York differently.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.140
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Well, many--you know
in the case of New York, what changed is an

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.859
effort that was made mostly by
the private sector at first, and then was

00:46:56.859 --> 00:47:01.309
embraced by official agencies in the city
of New York to highlight the

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:06.450
other facets of New York, yeah, without ignoring,
yes, there's still pockets of violence and

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.750
there's still dangerous
places in New York, and obviously the ultimate

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.200
thing that happened was in the end, when the
city cleaned the streets

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.859
and doubled the number of police officers.

00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:19.340
That was a huge decision that really was of
strategic importance.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.769
It's
never just about Hollywood, but Hollywood

00:47:21.769 --> 00:47:23.650
is a big part of it.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:28.750
And again, if you will not take the proactive
approach, Hollywood will redefine you.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.420
And that's exactly what happened in the '70's,
New York didn't do enough

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:38.309
creating attractions, and you know it's a--if
you're really interested in the case of New

00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:42.089
York, I urge all of you to
read the book, Branding of New York, it was

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:45.580
published in 2008 by a sociologist from Columbia
University whose name is

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.140
Miriam Greenberg.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.440
It's a fascinating book, it's a history book
actually about the process.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.789
It talks about how they
made a decision, for example, those families

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:56.119
to invest in NYU in the '70s.

00:47:56.119 --> 00:48:03.770
To turn NYU--to create NYU as a
counterbalance to the economic and academic

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:05.339
strength of Columbia.

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:10.089
So there was a need to create another academic
magnet in Manhattan, and they made a decision

00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:11.089
it's going to be NYU.

00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:16.349
And it was such an elaborate program, brilliant
program, I urge all of you to read that book.

00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:17.349
Read that book.

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:21.180
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Would you say that New York is
a promise delivered in this case?

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.500
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Absolutely!

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.500
Absolutely!

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.940
New York, to my mind, is the most amazing
case study in place

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.940
positioning.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:35.970
Amazing, in thirty years, they totally overhauled
the positioning of New York.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:40.780
I think that second would
probably be the case of Spain, post-Franco.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.819
And a remarkable effort on the part of the
Spanish government.

00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:48.279
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Thanks.

00:48:48.279 --> 00:48:57.250
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I'd say in most cases where a city
or a country is trying to brand itself it

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:01.839
doesn't face an
organized opposition where the opposition

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:06.770
is resisting that branding, you know, so if
France wants to be the city of

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.819
romance, no one's going to say "NO. no, France--
not romantic."

00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:12.420
But in the case of Israel, obviously there
is an

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.789
organized opposition, you know, you can imagine
in the old days, if South Africa had tried

00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:20.589
to brand itself as the
place to come for business and safaris, there

00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:24.089
would have been significant push back, saying,
"You know what South

00:49:24.089 --> 00:49:26.060
Africa is."

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:32.609
So how do you deal with the fact that you
can't just brand yourself and send the message

00:49:32.609 --> 00:49:33.609
out unopposed?

00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:35.359
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: Right.

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:36.960
First, that's an excellence question.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.789
It means only one thing for us.

00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:41.410
We have to work
harder.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.410
We have to work harder.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:46.289
It's true that no one will tell France, "No,
you're not romance."

00:49:46.289 --> 00:49:50.069
But don't forget
that Paris is facing some tough competition

00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:51.609
in Europe itself.

00:49:51.609 --> 00:49:54.330
In the case of romance, the competition comes
from

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:57.009
Venice.

00:49:57.009 --> 00:50:00.140
But it's true, it's not a negative branding.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.990
But the good news is that people really don't
care.

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:07.089
Here--I put
a slide here of a study that we conducted

00:50:07.089 --> 00:50:10.759
as Israel was going into Gaza, so you can't
say this study was not

00:50:10.759 --> 00:50:12.640
conducted when Israel was not in the news.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.320
Israel was in the news, and in a very negative
context.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.640
Okay, Israel was
going into Gaza in early 2009.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.190
We went to fourteen countries to look at their
perception of Israel's personality.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:28.349
This was not about Israeli policies, it was
about Israel's personality, but we did start

00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:32.520
the study with the baseline
question, "On the conflict between Israelis

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.200
and Palestinians, where do you stand?"

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:41.299
In blue or purple, whatever the
color is, is the level of support for Israel.

00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:44.509
In pink or red, is the level of support for
Palestinians.

00:50:44.509 --> 00:50:48.839
I want you to
pay attention to the results in France.

00:50:48.839 --> 00:50:49.839
This is France.

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:54.269
You see, in France, and by the way, we asked
only the elite

00:50:54.269 --> 00:50:56.140
in those societies.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:01.520
The elite--the people who earn above average
and at least have one college degree, okay?

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.839
So you
look at the case of France, sixteen percent

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:10.420
of the French elite to your point sir, support
the Palestinians.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.369
Only
nine percent of the French elite support the

00:51:14.369 --> 00:51:15.560
Israelis, right?

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.660
So traditionally what we try to do was to
change the

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:23.960
inner balance between the two groups and move
people from the group of sixteen to the group

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.289
of nine.

00:51:25.289 --> 00:51:29.619
And we tried to
do that using historical and legal arguments.

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:33.980
Like, you know, "we are right and they are
wrong" and all that.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.619
Marketing experts looked at this and said,
"Wait a second, put sixteen and nine together,

00:51:38.619 --> 00:51:39.770
what do you get?

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:41.020
Twenty-
five percent.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.430
Seventy-five percent of the French elite couldn't
care less about the conflict what is it that

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:47.430
you
bring to them?"

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:52.039
And we checked ourselves, and we looked at
what we actually brought to them over the

00:51:52.039 --> 00:51:55.160
years, and we
discovered that what we brought to them was

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.519
exactly the same argumentation that produced
the nine percent.

00:51:59.519 --> 00:52:02.160
In other
words, we were turning them off.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.470
On a daily basis.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:07.730
And when we changed the message, when we changed
the content of

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:13.839
the communication, when we started communicating
to them things that they care about, for example,

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:16.150
lifestyle and
leisure.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:18.589
Israel is a great culinary experience.

00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:23.500
Israel is a great--we have great wine, we
have an emerging olive oil

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.500
industry.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.079
The best olive oil in the whole world comes
from Israel.

00:52:27.079 --> 00:52:29.750
We have great fashion designers in Israel.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.950
Great
filmmakers in Israel.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:36.460
So it's true, when you have to deal with a
political crises like the flotilla, you don't

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.670
talk
about fashion.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.220
It's not a crises management tool.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.930
But when you need to build an overarching
persona, overarching

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:50.130
strategy you have to talk about those things
because that's exactly the kind of human experience

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.310
that creates the
emotional tie.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:57.359
And I can tell you, for example the gay community
in Europe, Israel's been extremely successful

00:52:57.359 --> 00:53:00.750
in
engaging them in a conversation that is meaningful.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:01.750
Why?

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:04.549
Because in the case of the gay community,
Israel delivers on

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:06.660
the promise in a big way.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:11.319
There is no country in our hemisphere, in
our region, that is more gay friendly than

00:53:11.319 --> 00:53:13.579
Israel, and that's a fact.

00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:20.790
And this fact is being celebrated by gay people
all over the world.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.809
No more questions, I'm sorry, the big brother
said no more questions.

00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:24.809
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: No more time.

00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:25.809
&gt;&gt;Ambassador Aharoni: No more time.

00:53:25.809 --> 00:53:27.200
Thank you so much, I'll be accessible here
if you have questions.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:27.400
[applause]
