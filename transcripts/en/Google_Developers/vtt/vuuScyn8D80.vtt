TED HAMILTON: Welcome to Find
The Next Big Thing with the

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.980
YouTube Analytics API.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.890
I'm Ted Hamilton.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm the product manager for
YouTube Analytics out of our

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.270
Zurich office.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.250
I'm here with Jeremy Walker, one
of our developer advocate.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.630
And then Chris Schroeder, from
The Next Big Sound, who was an

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.310
early guinea pig-- an early
adopter for the YouTube

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.860
Analytics API.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.180
So very quickly, I'll go
through, give you an

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.330
introduction of YouTube
analytics and what the API is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.830
capable of doing.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.350
Jeremy'll walk through
and actually show you

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.650
how to use the thing.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.890
And then Chris is going to show
you the cool things that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.500
they've actually done
with the API.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830
And then at the end, I'll come
back and talk a little bit

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.220
about what's ahead
for the API.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.500
And then we'll

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
going into Q&amp;A. So.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.910
YouTube analytics.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.840
Why does YouTube analytics
matter?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.840
Historically, video has had very
little data around it.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.080
You think, back in the day,
people would do screenings,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.120
have surveys, have panels.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.490
They'd put together a pilot
show and see how people

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.350
reacted to that.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.340
And then make huge decisions
based on just this little

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.170
amount of information.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.440
But right now, we're being
bringing absolute truckloads

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.930
of data to video.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.820
We're bringing transparency
to the black box.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.010
So, have most of you used
YouTube analytics?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.790
Does this look familiar
to you?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.990
Actually let's get
a show of hands.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.120
How many people are actually
using are our API today?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.980
How many are considering it?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.906
And how many are just looking
for a good Wi-Fi signal?

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:42.370
All right.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.230
That guy.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.100
So yeah.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.730
This is our overview page
in YouTube analytics.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.620
Other things that we have,
we have maps of

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.810
average view duration.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.720
We have break down of playback
locations and traffic sources.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.010
We have the drop-off curves.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.630
Where do people actually start
falling off of your videos?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.800
Which parts do they
fast forward to?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.560
Lots of really good stuff.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.940
But what happens when you want
to do more than our UI offers?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.760
What happens when--

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.030
your YouTube data's important,
but what about

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.890
your Facebook data?

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.010
Or your Twitter data?

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.240
What happens when you have
success metrics that are

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.420
different from the ones
that we offer?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.290
Maybe you have some sort
of derived metric, like

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.120
subscribers per view.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.220
Something like that.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.580
Well, when you want to do more
than what our UI offers, you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.840
do analytics API.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770
That's what you're
all here for.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.150
Our API is broken down into
three main components.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.910
They're the metrics.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.930
Our big ones are views, minutes
watched, money, of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.610
course, subscribers, and
then there's a whole

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.240
host of other things.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.990
You could break these
down by date.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.210
You get a time series
of these.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.700
You can see how it's broken down
by geography, by content

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.220
entity, by channel or by video,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.980
traffic source, et cetera.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.660
And then, of course, you can
filter things down to only see

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.540
a specific date, date range,
specific geography, or one

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.770
particular video or channel.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.310
And Jeremy, you want to
show us how to use it?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.870
JEREMY WALKER: Sure.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.070
Sure.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.240
So, hi.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.430
My name's Jeremy Walker.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.330
I'm a YouTube Developer
Advocate.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.990
And I'm going to jump into more
of the technical details

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.850
about how and why you want
to use the analytics API.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.780
So how am I going to
show you guys this?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.180
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to show you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.330
something interesting I learned
from using the API.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.850
And then I'm going to
show you an example.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.360
So it's going to be a cycle.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.010
Interesting insight,
how did I do it?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.610
Interesting insight,
how did I do it?

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.500
Interesting insight,
how did I do it?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.120
So I'm going to do
three use cases.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.250
The first one will be popularity
by country.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.640
So I'm going to show you some
videos I picked out on that.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.680
Annotations, so how does
it overlays impact

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.350
your minutes watched?

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.680
And just so you guys know, I'm
pulling this information from

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.100
the Google Developers channel,
which is a channel we use to

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.510
teach about our APIs.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.820
And I'm specifically focusing
on YouTube API videos.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.280
And then, finally, what's the
best length for your video?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.250
The age-old question, long
form versus short form.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.130
So any of you that don't know,
short form is shorter videos.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.390
And then long forms are much
longer videos, like half an

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.280
hour or whatever.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.750
So I thought it'd be appropriate
to grab one of the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.820
2012 talks that we
did on YouTube.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.000
So what I did is, I set up a
script that ran through and

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.430
grabbed all the YouTube-related
I/O videos

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.100
last year, and displayed then
based on country and views.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.590
And I actually grabbed
this one.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.510
This is about the embeddable
YouTube upload widget, which

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.750
Jeff and Eric talked
about last year.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.890
It just simplifies uploading
videos, among other things.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.390
And what was actually kind of
interesting about it was how

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.640
the views broke down.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.430
So I just took the top four.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.950
And Russia and India were
about on par for views.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.090
The US was actually about 48%
higher in views than Russia.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.400
And Brazil was actually
about 14% higher in

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.140
views than the USA.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.170
So why is it interesting?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.100
Well, if you're making
this video, then

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.010
it's kind of important.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.850
Because now you have this large
audience in Brazil and

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.480
Russia that maybe you didn't
even know about.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.690
So then you start thinking of
ways, how can I incorporate

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.220
them into my videos so that
I can continue that growth

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.810
that's happening, maybe without
much work that I'm

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.030
doing on my side?

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.490
Now what's really interesting
about this is actually, the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.120
video had little annotations
on it so you could click

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.760
through to the documentation.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.850
So the next thing I did is I
grabbed the order of that.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.010
And so third and fourth, the
lowest clickthrough rates were

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.950
the USA and India.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.640
And then Russia was second.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.050
And Brazil was first.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.770
But what's really interesting is
the percentage differences.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.470
So Russia, actually, they were
27% more likely to click

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.730
through than the USA.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.410
So that's kind of interesting.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.300
And then Brazil was
actually 55% more

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.860
likely to click through.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.740
So again, what does
this all mean?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.050
What does it mean to you?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.520
So if you're the owner
of the video, then

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.700
you're thinking, OK.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.350
Top three countries, I've got
Brazil, USA, and Russia.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.960
And then the clickthrough rates
are Brazil and Russia.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.270
And they're way higher
than the USA.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.730
So what's that mean?

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.600
Well, in Brazil they speak
Portuguese, and not a lot of

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.920
people necessarily know
English there.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.800
So maybe they're very interested
in the subject

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.920
matter, but they don't
understand it.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.210
So they have to click through to
read or have it translated

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.840
through there.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.540
So same with Russia.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.360
So what could you do?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.800
You could put some budget aside
and have some captions

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.080
added for Portuguese
and Russian.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.810
And then you could take it a
step further and start pulling

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.890
minutes watched to see
if that's increasing

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.850
your minutes watched.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.310
Because that's what a lot
of people measure

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.160
their success on.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.380
So that's just one
of the use cases.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.320
So you can see there, that's
pretty interesting.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.070
And that would be
very powerful to

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.290
know for a video creator.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.070
So how did I pull this
information?

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.190
Well first, I'm going to
do a high-level view of

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.320
how to get a report.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.940
So first off, you need to
authorize and authenticate.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.070
So you can't just get a
channel's information.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.930
You have to sign in
and do that stuff.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.560
But we have a way to authorize
that through OAuth 2.0.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.470
And then you can authenticate
through an access token.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.450
Next you'll want to get
your channel ID.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.590
So the channel ID is this long
string of characters, that--

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.490
it's like, nobody has
it memorized.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.950
I don't.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.980
So you hit up the YouTube data
API, which is another API

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.710
which you use for general stuff
that you do on YouTube.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.790
Specifically we just need
the channel ID.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.770
And then use the analytics
API to get your report.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.289
So first, I'm going to show
you guys the API explorer.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.789
Not a lot of people use this.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.549
Well, not enough people
use this yet.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.730
It's a great tool.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.010
As a best practice, you should
always use this before you

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.930
write any code.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.640
Because you'll find that you
resolve most of your code

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.260
problems here first, before
you move it over.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.850
I work on the analytics API with
people that work on it.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.010
And a lot of people have trouble
saying, oh, this

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.430
library has a bug in it.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.160
But they're trying to run a
report that doesn't exist, or

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.330
it doesn't work together.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.480
So it's always a good idea
to do this first.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.460
You don't have to
write any code.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.350
And it lets you do everything
to start with.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.290
And then you can import that
right over to your code.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.700
So I'm actually going
to show you that.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.100
Let me pull up an
example here.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:26.840
OK.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.530
So I've been talking
about my channel--

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.780
or the YouTube channel-- but I
wanted to show you guys some

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.620
extra information as well.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.940
I have my own channel,
which has some

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.440
mildly popular videos.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.660
Well, that's probably blowing
it up a little bit.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.170
But anyway, I did run some of
my own reports to see how it

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.650
was doing, to see if there's
any countries that were

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.470
interested in my content.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.550
So by the way, to find this API
explorer, just do a search

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.720
for Google API explorer.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.930
You choose YouTube
Analytics API.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.180
Or you can search YouTube
Analytics API, and we've got

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.220
it right there on one
of the pages.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.230
So anyway, you authenticate
here--

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.410
or, sorry, authorize.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.840
And this should go up.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.460
And then you can see here,
this is a channel report.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.740
So this is what I would
get from the data API.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.200
And then I would just put in
dates, views, and then I do

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.880
the dimension country.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.410
And then in this case, I'm
guarding this video ID, which

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.910
is the video I'm trying to do.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.790
So let's see here.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.110
OK.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.710
So what am I getting
back here?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.240
I'm getting a JSON back.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.360
You can get a CSV back.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.180
But the values, country
and then views.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.250
And so in January of 2012, you
can see in Bulgaria this video

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.120
got 4,500 views.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.400
And in the USA it got 100.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.650
Which is probably more
than my normal.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.370
So why did it blow
up in Bulgaria?

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.375
Well, I don't know, but if I was
tracking this enough with

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:03.680
the APIs, I could get a aping
saying, hey, you're blowing up

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.900
in Bulgaria.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.120
Go check it out.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.930
And then you can say, whoa,
what's going on,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.710
and then help that.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.690
Maybe you could promote it even
more because you figured

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.890
out what's going on there.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.850
Anyway.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.600
So if you guys remember, when I
set these values here, just

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.050
look at these.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.200
So, channel ID, date,
views, and country.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.490
Now I'll flip back over
to my presentation.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:32.070
And you'll see that when I
move to the code, wow, it

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.820
looks exactly the same, right?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.780
I didn't show an annotation
clickthrough rate because I

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.860
didn't have one on that video.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.510
But you get the idea.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.640
You port these values almost
over exactly, and you're done.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.940
So then you get your--

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.960
this is Java, but it could
be JavaScript or

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.090
whatever you want.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.470
All right.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.220
So let's go to another
example.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.630
So we're at number two.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.170
So, annotations, user
clickthrough--

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.930
this is the wrong
way to do it.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.720
People will leave So
I did decide to

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.580
push it a little bit.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:06.010
And what I did is, I took one
of our more popular YouTube

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.180
API videos, and I added an ugly
click through that was

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.800
pretty big.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.440
So if you don't know, we have
a YouTube Android Player API

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.510
that lets you play videos in
your Android app so you don't

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.390
leave the experience.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.100
Like Flipboard lets
you do that.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.000
It's a really nice experience.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.960
But I put this on there
to see what it would

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.035
do to minutes watched.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.120
So I did it for seven days.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.370
So seven days before,
it dropped almost

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.710
10% the minutes watched.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.800
And then when I lifted
it, it went up 14%.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.870
So I have no idea why it
went up 4 more percent.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.506
Maybe you should put
an overlay and pull

00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:47.670
it, and then your--

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.270
I don't know.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.600
Anyway, this is pretty
interesting to me.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.350
Because it shows,
well, does this

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.160
negatively impact your videos?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.910
And some people would
say, well, yes.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.330
For us, not really, because
what's our message?

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.620
We just want to educate
people on our APIs.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.560
And maybe this drives them,
and they start reading the

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.930
documentation and start
coding in it.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:13.260
But if you're doing this for
maybe entertainment or

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.750
something, maybe this wouldn't
be a good metric.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.980
Which is what I'm going
to show you on

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.130
another one of my videos.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.380
So I actually ran two.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.270
I'm going to show you
a before and after.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.610
I put a really ugly one
on one of my videos.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.630
Just to see what
would happen--

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.740
again, I want to authorize--

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.540
to see what would happen
if I did this on mine.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.990
So I added an ugly one
that had nothing

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.110
to do with the video.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.300
And this video is not for
educational purposes.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.010
It's more for entertainment.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.250
You can see, really,
everything's the same, minus

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.800
the metrics.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.980
I just change to estimated
minutes watched.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.000
I just execute it.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.650
You can see here's the request,
the response.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.930
OK.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.250
I have about 165 minutes
watched.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.990
So again, that's for
the week before.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.760
And then the week after--

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.370
again, don't forget
to authorize--

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.620
let's see what happens.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.530
OK.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.790
Wow.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.080
I lost a half an hour just
by adding an overlay.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.150
So people didn't like
the overlay on mine.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.140
And so that's bad.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.330
So overlays are bad for me.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.560
Or annotations.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.050
So anyway, if you look
at the code--

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.450
again, have a look.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.620
Just remember this, dates,
estimated minutes

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.500
watched, the video ID.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:39.280
And then if you look
at the code here,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.670
it's the same thing.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.980
So it's just quick port.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.920
Really easy.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.250
OK.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.370
I've got one more example,
and then we'll be done.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.970
So part of the Google Developers
channel, one of the

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.620
main things we do, is Google
Developers Live, which is a

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.280
live show we do once a week.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.390
And what's interesting is, it
started like a year ago.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.220
And we were doing an
hour-long show.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.240
The first half was usually an
interview, and then we'd do

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.340
best practice.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.360
And as time passed, we
were like, this is

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.140
probably too long.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.040
Let's cut in half.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.630
Let's split it out.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.330
So then we started
doing either an

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.160
interview or best practices.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.300
And then over time, we've kind
of narrowed it down and down.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.860
So I thought, well, I'll grab
some numbers from some of

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.220
those videos, and see how the
minutes watched went.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.710
Kind of the same metric I
grabbed in the last example,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.120
but for a different use case.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.090
So this video is 50 minutes.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.360
And what happened was, when I
cut it in half, the minutes

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.720
watched went up 110%.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.790
So people like shorter videos.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.130
And then it actually went up
another 25% when we cut more

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.380
time off of it.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.320
So shorter is better.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.690
So we're still trying
to figure out the

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.780
optimum time for us.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.430
We want to get the
message across.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.910
So maybe we go down
a little bit more.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.340
But this is interesting,
right?

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.670
If you're making video or doing
video production, less

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.970
work means more time people
watch, right?

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.260
So if we do less work,
we get more--

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.000
you see what I'm saying?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.800
So this is pretty interesting.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.790
Now, how did I get this?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.800
It's the same report.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.840
It's estimated minutes
watched.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.280
And that's the same report,
so I probably won't

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.310
show that to you guys.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.560
But you can pull it as
a content owner as

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.490
well, if you want.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:27.440
If you have multiple channels,
we have another report type

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.150
where you can pull-- you may
own one or two or three

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.910
channels, and this allows you to
pull one of those or all of

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.740
them, separately or
all together.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.730
And instead of channel ID you
just put content owner and

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.500
drop in your username there.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.355
But you can see the report's
pretty much the same.

00:16:44.355 --> 00:16:46.380
And if you want to find out a
little bit more on how to do

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.360
this, I did a pre-I/O
session--

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.770
it's about 10 minutes-- where I
walk through this made much

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.840
more detail.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.500
Check that out.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.230
It's on the Google Developer
channel.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.840
All right, so those are
my three examples.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.900
Hopefully you got something
out of it.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.240
And now I'm going to turn it
over to Chris, who's going to

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.960
talk about pulling our data and
combining it with other

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.839
data to find even more
interesting insights.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.660
CHRIS SCHROEDER: Awesome.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.440
Thanks, Jeremy.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.040
Hi, everyone.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.329
My name is Chris Schroeder.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.175
I'm an engineer at
Next Big Sound.

00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:17.250
And right now, I'm going to talk
about the ways that our

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.530
company and our customers use
the YouTube Analytics API and

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.780
the data from the API.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.870
So Next Big Sound tracks the
online activity for almost

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.360
every band in the world.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.750
And we organize that data into
a centralized dashboard which

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.100
we provide back to the
music industry.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.480
And our customers include both
individual bands and band

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.970
managers, who are trying
to grow their fan base,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.930
understand their fan base,
and promote themselves.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.830
As well as the record labels,
who invest heavily in

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.090
developing artists and
marketing artists.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.520
And they want to back the
decisions they make up with--

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.340
they want to back up their
decisions with data and make

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.440
intelligent decisions.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.600
So let's jump into our
first example.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.780
We're going to look at data
for a well-established and

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.530
award-winning indie rock band.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.220
And earlier this year, they
did a live television

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.710
appearance at an awards show
where they performed.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.300
And now, if you're a label,
or you're the band, what's

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.650
important is understanding
the impact that you made.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.640
You're not, probably,
getting paid to do

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.990
the performance itself.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.760
What you're really interested
is in how it drives the

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.680
awareness around the band, and
how it drives people online to

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.060
take action and learn
about your band.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.250
So this is a screen shot
from our product.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.550
And what we're looking at here
is a graph over 90 days of

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.750
YouTube Analytic metrics.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:54.040
90-day period around the key
event-- the awards show.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.160
In this case, we've
selected three

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.850
YouTube Analytics metrics--

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.810
views, comments, and likes.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.570
So over here on the right hand
side, you can see that what

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.430
we've done is overlay an event
stream for the artist.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:15.090
So for each artist we're
tracking album releases, chart

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.040
appearances, as well as concert
performances and

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.150
activity on social
media platforms.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.140
So in this case, you can see
that on Twitter and Facebook,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.580
it's indicating to us that they
did, in fact, perform at

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.170
this awards show.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.500
You can see from the dramatic
spike in the data in the

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.130
middle here that the appearance
was a success.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.090
So in the days before the awards
show, the numbers were

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.990
around 150,000 views per day.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.990
And then it jumped about 450%
percent the day after the show

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.950
to over a half a million
views in a single day.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.570
So that's a lot of great
information.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.450
You can also see here, earlier,
you can sort of tell

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.730
that there was buzz increasing
before the show and leading up

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.330
to show, and the band, and about
the two weeks prior.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.730
So now, if you're the label,
as the next steps, what you

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.710
might want to do is compare
other artists that also

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.600
performed on this show.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.510
Or other times your band, here,
performed on other TV

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.360
shows, and get a comparison.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.780
So this is the sort of
data-driven approach that Next

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.640
Big Sound makes possible.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.500
In the words of Forbes,
"Moneyball for music." And I

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.450
think that's a really
great analogy.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.340
Because the same way that data
and analytics revolutionized

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.080
baseball, the same
thing's happening

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.500
in the music industry.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.960
If you think about how much
the industry is changing--

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.940
the different ways people can
go online and consume music,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.240
learn about bands, share
music, discover music--

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.020
as well as the different ways
artists can now connect

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.590
directly with fans, it's
really critical have a

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.710
platform like Next Big Sound
that gives you the data to

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.250
make sense of all
those signals.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.230
And YouTube Analytics in
particular is very interesting

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.610
for our customers.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.060
Not only on YouTube is there a
great way for fans to connect

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.290
with artists, but also it's
opening up new ways for

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.110
artists to become successful
and break.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.320
Think about--

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.900
just recent examples--

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.880
the Harlem Shake, that meme, as
well as the viral video for

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.280
"Gangnam Style."

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.950
Also, a lot of artists, and
some labels, revenue from

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.790
YouTube is very significant
for them.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.510
It's part of their
business model.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.880
And then for record labels, also
being able to find and

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.360
develop talent in a new
way using YouTube.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.290
YouTube analytics, in
particular, adds a new level

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.080
of granularity and detail to
the data that's available.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.940
So the geographic and
demographic insights that

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.330
Jeremy was alluding to.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.540
As well as new types of metrics
that are really

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.210
interesting--

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.820
unique views, comments,
shares, and

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.390
also watch time metrics.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.510
And by bringing all that data
into the Next Big Sound

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.070
platform, as an artist, you're
able to compare yourself to

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.580
similar artists or competitive
artists, as well as, maybe,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.980
artists that you're aspiring
towards, that are kind of like

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.810
a role model for your band.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.590
Then also do cross-network
comparisons, and be able to

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.590
look at YouTube Analytics data
alongside metrics and events

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.660
from other social networks.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.990
And so, in addition to YouTube,
we're collecting from

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.500
a wide variety of sources.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.460
Just real quick.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.540
Social media sources.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.430
Internet radio.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.040
Terrestrial radio.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.400
Sales data from our customer,
including iTunes and digital

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.950
downloads from Amazon as well.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.210
So it's a wide variety
of data.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.790
Very unique data set that we
have, and very valuable.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.920
So let's look at another
example,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.220
this time for geography.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.170
We're looking at the
geographic data.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.040
Three different YouTube
Analytics metrics

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.580
for the same artist.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.400
And this artist is an

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.410
up-and-coming British pop singer.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:05.030
And she's popular in the UK,
and their team is trying to

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.365
break her into the US market.

00:23:07.365 --> 00:23:09.390
And so that's the story
that's happening here.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.120
Interestingly, on the left
hand side, if we look at

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.790
views, the highest percentage
of views for her is still

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.440
coming from the United
Kingdom.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.180
But if we look at new fans, or
the subscribers metric, you

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.940
can see that the highest
percentage is coming from the

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.660
United States.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.700
Also, likes, which is a form of
engagement, is also coming

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.260
in the highest percentage
in the United States.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.260
So the story that's being told
here matches up with the

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.080
efforts that her team
are working on.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.670
So it's good signals for them.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.800
Here's an example using
the same demographic--

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.550
excuse me, demographics for the
same artist, but on two

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.070
different social networks.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:58.810
So this artist is a well-known,
established jazz

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.620
and pop singer who has several
number one albums.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.930
He's got mass appeal across a
wide variety of audiences.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.860
But interestingly, in this case,
in the social network on

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.002
the left, his fan base skews
heavily female in

00:24:14.002 --> 00:24:16.210
the 18 to 24 range.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:22.690
Whereas on YouTube, on the left,
his fan base is much

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.130
more evenly distributed.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.310
So this is really useful
information in terms of what

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.320
type of content the singer and
his team is going to post to

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.590
these different networks.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:35.330
And so it's really good
information to have.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.310
YouTube data is also allowing us
to give key insights to the

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.750
music industry.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.751
So our data analytics
team-- excuse me.

00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:48.490
The question in this case that
we're trying to address is the

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.150
relationship between social
media and sales.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.470
Is there a relationship,
and what's that like?

00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:01.210
So our data science team did
an analysis on iTunes sales

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.660
and radio spins compared to key
social media metrics from

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.910
a variety of the
major networks.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.220
And so, a couple of findings.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.930
One of the key ones is
very interesting.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.450
It's that when you look that
values for the same day, the

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.240
highest correlation of any
social media metric to sales,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.600
or to track sales specifically,
was YouTube.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.520
Number one on this list
is radio spins.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.780
That's sort of been the de facto
standard in the industry

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.570
for forecasting sales.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.360
So to see YouTube plays right
up there with it is

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.930
a really good sign.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:46.330
And so the suggestion here
is that consumers

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.650
are going on YouTube.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.270
And they're learning about the
tracks from YouTube that they

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.260
plan on possibly buying next.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.900
And so the message is that it's
very important to have

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.990
high-quality YouTube content
with your artist.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.390
So just to share a little bit
about our own experiences

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.050
working with the API.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.290
The API is extremely flexible.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.960
It felt like everything that was
available on the YouTube--

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.490
excuse me, on the users'
analytics dashboard was also

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.460
available through the API.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.770
And working with it was
very straightforward.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.390
Are off to integration in the
standard our data collector is

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.790
simply a Java app with a
standard HTTP client.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.160
And everything's formatted
in JSON.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.330
So there's no surprises there.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.120
Basically, everything worked
as advertised.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.930
For us, one thing to note,
your auth tokens.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.300
They can expire pretty
frequently.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.440
So it's important to refresh
them and handle those types of

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.820
connection errors that you get
that are going to be common.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.410
Just kind of nature of
working with an API.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.250
Probably our biggest challenge
working with the API was just

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.100
how we constructed
our queries, and

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.290
being mindful of that.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:09.620
Basically, we're collecting
a wide variety of data.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.690
Daily values for many metrics
for each video associated with

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.200
the channel for each artist.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.500
Also, with geo-granularity.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.140
So for us, we learned that
breaking down the data by

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.740
geography as well as by day
in the same query, you

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.430
can't really do.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.100
And certain metrics also don't
get combined well in the API.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.090
So you just have to be mindful
of that, and be careful about

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.480
the number of queries
you end up making.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.430
And being careful not to
use too much quota.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.590
So for us, we're
really excited

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.470
About the scheduled reports'
bulk data feature that the

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.240
YouTube team has been
telling us about.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.350
And lastly, just a
couple of tips.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.670
I'd say, reiterating what Jeremy
mentioned, that YouTube

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.080
API explorer is awesome.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.790
It's really cleared
up any mystery

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.930
around how the API works.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.520
It really should be your best
friend when you're working

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.600
with the API.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.800
And also, post questions
to Stack Overflow.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.230
Because the team gets back
to you pretty quickly.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.754
And it's really been
a help for us, too.

00:28:14.754 --> 00:28:15.660
Great.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.296
Let me pass it back to Ted.

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:18.670
Thank you.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:19.935
TED HAMILTON: Thanks.

00:28:19.935 --> 00:28:21.650
That was awesome.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.500
All right, so what's
next for us?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.640
Devices.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.330
Yes.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.440
Very shortly, you'll
see a device report

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.280
appear in our UI.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.410
And then shortly thereafter,
it'll be available in the API.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.890
So you can finally see the
trends of how quickly people

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.710
are moving to mobile, and what
different viewing behaviors

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.940
people have on different
devices.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.800
We'll also break it down
by operating system.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.740
So you can see if there's a
material difference based on

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.730
what app people are
using, et cetera.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.590
Audience retention.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.510
So our audience retention curves
are very useful, but

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.730
have not been available
for the API ever.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.370
We will make sure to
add that soon.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.760
And then lastly, bulk data.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.100
So our API right now is designed
around point queries.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.330
You ask a very specific question
and we give you a

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.090
specific answer.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.670
This is great for dashboards,
great for apps, et cetera.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.430
But when you have the data
warehousing use case, where

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.140
you actually just want to
transfer all of that data over

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.890
into your database,
you have to ask a

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.420
lot of queries, right?

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.910
And this uses a lot of quota.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.840
So we wanted to build a way that
you can actually schedule

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.910
a query, we process it offline,
and then you can just

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.970
download all of it.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.810
This has been a big, long ask.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.060
But in general, we want the API
to have every bit of the

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.850
capability that the UI has,
and even go beyond that.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.940
In an ideal world, we would be
exposing data through our API

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.735
before even makes
it into our UI.

00:29:58.735 --> 00:30:01.122
So, thank you very much.

00:30:01.122 --> 00:30:02.690
We now have some time
for questions.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.830
If you have a question, please
use a microphone so we can

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.695
catch it on our recording.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:11.980
MARK: Thanks, guys.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.890
Great presentation.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.510
My name is Mark.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.090
I come from Pixability
in Boston.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.280
Do you have a time frame
on the bulk data thing?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.450
Because multi-dimensional
queries would be brilliant.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.540
TED HAMILTON: Yeah, so
it's always tough.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.870
Things that you think would be
very quick can tend to have

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:33.510
problems, et cetera.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.830
So I can't get anything
very specific.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.300
But it is very high on
the priority list.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.550
So I would hope sometime later
in the summer or in the fall,

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.680
we would have that available.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.980
MARK: And if you need anyone to
try it out first, I'm quite

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.230
happy to do that.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.390
TED HAMILTON: Great.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.430
Yeah.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.100
Talk to me afterwards.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.350
We can take your name down.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.970
Anybody else?

00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:03.740
AUDIENCE: Bulk data,
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.990
TED HAMILTON: Can you please
use the microphone?

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.740
AUDIENCE: So bulk data, can
you give a little bit more

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:18.015
perspective on quotas, method
of access, et cetera?

00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:18.490
TED HAMILTON: No.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.190
Not really too much.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.730
We haven't gotten to that
stage of planning.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.840
But it should be--

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.000
if we can process this offline,
and then you can just

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.120
download it.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.530
You're not hitting our servers
to do any processing.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:35.376
So it should alleviate a lot
of the quota pains that you

00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:36.626
guys are having.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.190
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.700
How are you doing?

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.580
Any of the new data points going
to require additional

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.700
scope requests?

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.540
TED HAMILTON: Sorry, can you
repeat the question?

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.360
AUDIENCE: Are any of the new
data points that you're going

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:53.470
to release going to require
additional scope requests from

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.890
the content owner?

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.500
I don't know.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.140
Christophe, actually.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.590
Do you have an answer
to that question?

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.620
Christophe, in the crowd
here, is our lead

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.915
developer on the API.

00:32:00.915 --> 00:32:03.060
JEREMY WALKER: Have him
use the microphone?

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.660
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.680
And then, related to that, do
you guys have any plans to

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.470
allow us to do analytics for
channels for which we don't

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:17.010
have credentials, but
who are giving away

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.460
the analytics anyway?

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.180
TED HAMILTON: So actually,
could I ask you to first

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.640
repeat the answer for the people
on the recording of

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.200
what Christophe told you?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.430
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.770
He said everything would
be available

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.040
under the current scopes.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.930
TED HAMILTON: OK, great.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:33.840
And so the answer of the
question of, will we be giving

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.340
out more public data?

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.040
Philosophically, yes.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.630
This is something that
would be marvelous.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.850
If people are willing to
contribute their data so other

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.200
people can learn, that's
something that we

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.930
would want to enable.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.010
That's probably not on the
priority list for this year.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.060
But definitely, that's
a direction that we

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.310
would like to head.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.570
All right.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.540
If there are no more questions,
we actually will be

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.380
in the sandbox just down
the hall here.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.720
Go down and to the right
is the YouTube sandbox.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.000
We'll be there right after
this presentation.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.200
And actually, I have been
hanging out there

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.920
for most the time.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.760
So if you have any questions
you didn't want to ask in

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.030
front of everyone or didn't
think of it right away, just

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.650
come by and visit us,
and we'd be happy

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.910
to answer your questions.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.530
All right.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.780
Thank you very much.
