00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:02.023
- [Voiceover] What I hope
to do in this video is get

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.868
familiar with the notion of an interval,

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:07.329
and also think about ways
that we can show an interval,

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.349
or interval notation.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.321
Right over here I have a number line.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:15.142
Let's say I wanted to talk
about the interval on the

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:20.142
number line that goes from
negative three to two.

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:24.331
So I care about this-- Let
me use a different color.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.925
Let's say I care about this
interval right over here.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.824
I care about all the numbers
from negative three to two.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.039
So in order to be more
precise, I have to be clear.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.907
Am I including negative three and two,

00:00:37.907 --> 00:00:40.287
or am I not including
negative three and two,

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:42.562
or maybe I'm just including one of them.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:45.696
So if I'm including
negative three and two,

00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:47.519
then I would fill them in.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.037
So this right over here, I'm
filling negative three and

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:53.625
two in, which means that
negative three and two

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.378
are part of this interval.

00:00:55.378 --> 00:00:57.514
And when you include the endpoints,

00:00:57.514 --> 00:00:59.910
this is called a closed interval.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.156
Closed interval.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.594
And I just showed you how I can depict it

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:09.896
on a number line, by actually
filling in the endpoints

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:12.066
and there's multiple ways to talk about

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.074
this interval mathematically.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.709
I could say that this is all of the...

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.292
Let's say this number line

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.213
is showing different values for x.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:24.418
I could say these are all of the x's

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:29.418
that are between negative three and two.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:35.620
And notice, I have negative
three is less than or equal to x

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.080
so that's telling us
that x could be equal to,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.924
that x could be equal to negative three.

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:45.616
And then we have x is less
than or equal to positive two,

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.984
so that means that x could
be equal to positive two,

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:49.952
so it is a closed interval.

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.836
Another way that we could
depict this closed interval

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:56.296
is we could say, okay, we're
talking about the interval

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.502
between, and we can use brackets

00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:00.405
because it's a closed interval,

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:03.505
negative three and two, and once again

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:06.500
I'm using brackets here,
these brackets tell us

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.821
that we include, this
bracket on the left says that

00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.875
we include negative three,
and this bracket on the right

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:16.078
says that we include
positive two in our interval.

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:17.691
Sometimes you might see things

00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:19.105
written a little bit more math-y.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:24.105
You might see x is a member of
the real numbers such that...

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:28.381
And I could put these curly
brackets around like this.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.356
These curly brackets say that

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:31.817
we're talking about a set of values,

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.698
and we're saying that the set of all x's

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.973
that are a member of the real number,

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:37.593
so this is just fancy math notation,

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:39.694
it's a member of the real numbers.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:42.747
I'm using the Greek letter
epsilon right over here.

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:45.069
It's a member of the
real numbers such that.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.812
This vertical line here means "such that,"

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.870
negative three is less x is less than--

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.409
negative three is less than or equal to x,

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.464
is less than or equal to two.

00:02:55.464 --> 00:02:56.590
I could also write it this way.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.444
I could write x is a
member of the real numbers

00:03:00.444 --> 00:03:05.444
such that x is a member,
such that x is a member

00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:10.471
of this closed set, I'm
including the endpoints here.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.409
So these are all
different ways of denoting

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.091
or depicting the same interval.

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:18.844
Let's do some more examples here.

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:22.147
So let's-- Let me draw
a number line again.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:24.444
So, a number line.

00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:27.690
And now let me do-- Let me
just do an open interval.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.317
An open interval just so that

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:32.367
we clearly can see the difference.

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:34.692
Let's say that I want to talk about

00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:37.774
the values between negative one and four.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.293
Let me use a different color.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:44.711
So the values between
negative one and four,

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:48.252
but I don't want to include
negative one and four.

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:49.552
So this is going to be an open interval.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:51.351
So I'm not going to include four,

00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:55.426
and I'm not going to include negative one.

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:57.748
Notice I have open circles here.

00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:00.177
Over here had closed circles,
the closed circles told me

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.448
that I included negative three and two.

00:04:02.448 --> 00:04:05.401
Now I have open circles here,
so that says that I'm not,

00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:07.873
it's all the values in
between negative one and four.

00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:11.856
Negative .999999 is going to be included,

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:14.364
but negative one is not
going to be included.

00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:17.278
And 3.9999999 is going to be included,

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:20.062
but four is not going to be included.

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.217
So how would we--

00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:23.590
What would be the notation for this?

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.165
Well, here we could say
x is going to be a member

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:31.542
of the real numbers
such that negative one--

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:32.889
I'm not going to say less than or equal to

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.907
because x can't be equal to negative one,

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:39.066
so negative one is strictly less than x,

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:41.272
is strictly less than four.

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:43.070
Notice not less than or
equal, because I can't

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.852
be equal to four, four is not included.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.725
So that's one way to say it.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:49.989
Another way I could write it like this.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.355
x is a member of the
real numbers such that

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.885
x is a member of...

00:04:56.885 --> 00:05:00.705
Now the interval is from
negative one to four

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:02.307
but I'm not gonna use these brackets.

00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:04.767
These brackets say, "Hey,
let me include the endpoint,"

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:05.906
but I'm not going to include them,

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.251
so I'm going to put the
parentheses right over here.

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:09.412
Parentheses.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:12.454
So this tells us that we're
dealing with an open interval.

00:05:12.454 --> 00:05:14.206
This right over here,
let me make it clear,

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:18.415
this is an open interval.

00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:20.870
Now you're probably
wondering, okay, in this case

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.250
both endpoints were included,
it's a closed interval.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.465
In this case both endpoints were excluded,

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:27.545
it's an open interval.

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:29.449
Can you have things that
have one endpoint included

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.465
and one point excluded, and
the answer is absolutely.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.392
Let's see an example of that.

00:05:35.392 --> 00:05:37.698
I'll get another number line here.

00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:40.744
Another number line.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:43.171
And let's say that we want to--

00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:44.170
Actually, let me do it
the other way around.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.164
Let me write it first,
and then I'll graph it.

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:49.463
So let's say we're thinking
about all of the x's

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:53.560
that are a member of the
real numbers such that

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.806
let's say negative four is
not included, is less than x,

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:02.534
is less than or equal to negative one.

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.146
So now negative one is included.

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:06.888
So we're not going to
include negative four.

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:08.189
Negative four is strictly less than,

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.791
not less than or equal to,

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:13.087
so x can't be equal to negative
four, open circle there.

00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:14.805
But x could be equal to negative one.

00:06:14.805 --> 00:06:17.452
It has to be less than
or equal to negative one.

00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:19.011
It could be equal to negative one

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.437
so I'm going to fill
that in right over there.

00:06:21.437 --> 00:06:23.835
And it's everything in between.

00:06:23.944 --> 00:06:27.926
If I want to write it with
this notation I could write

00:06:27.926 --> 00:06:32.048
x is a member of the
real numbers such that

00:06:32.048 --> 00:06:36.250
x is a member of the interval,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.487
so it's going to go between
negative four and negative one,

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:42.414
but we're not including negative four.

00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:43.401
We have an open circle here

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.595
so I'm gonna put a
parentheses on that side,

00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:50.053
but we are including negative one.

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:52.433
We are including negative one.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.504
So we put a bracket on that side.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:07:00.095
That right over there
would be the notation.

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:01.581
Now there's other things that you could do

00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.496
with interval notation.

00:07:03.496 --> 00:07:06.480
You could say, well hey,
everything except for some values.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.435
Let me give another example.

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:10.555
Let's get another example here.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:14.873
Let's say that we wanna talk
about all the real numbers

00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:17.201
except for one.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.230
We want to include all
of the real numbers.

00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:27.953
All of the real numbers except for one.

00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:31.892
Except for one, so we're gonna
exclude one right over here,

00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:36.628
open circle, but it can
be any other real number.

00:07:36.628 --> 00:07:40.953
So how would we denote this?

00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:47.242
Well, we could write x is a
member of the real numbers

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:53.295
such that x does not equal one.

00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:57.060
So here I'm saying x can be
a member of the real numbers

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.662
but x cannot be equal to one.

00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:02.226
It can be anything else, but
it cannot be equal to one.

00:08:02.226 --> 00:08:04.757
And there's other ways of
denoting this exact same interval.

00:08:04.757 --> 00:08:09.757
You could say x is a
member of the real numbers

00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:15.503
such that x is less than one,

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:20.993
or x is greater than one.

00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:24.040
So you could write it just like that.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.642
Or you could do something interesting.

00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:28.045
This is the one that I would
use, this is the shortest

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.020
and it makes it very clear.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.587
You say hey, everything except for one.

00:08:30.587 --> 00:08:32.781
But you could even do something
fancy, like you could say

00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.123
x is a member of the real
numbers such that x is a member

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:41.767
of the set going from
negative infinity to one,

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:46.767
not including one, or x is a
member of the set going from--

00:08:48.198 --> 00:08:50.717
or a member of the
interval going from one,

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:54.026
not including one, all
the way to positive,

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:56.440
all the way to positive infinity.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.820
And when we're talking
about negative infinity

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.338
or positive infinity, you
always put a parentheses.

00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:05.519
And the view there is you
could never include everything

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.935
all the way up to infinity.

00:09:06.935 --> 00:09:09.477
It needs to be at least
open at that endpoint

00:09:09.477 --> 00:09:11.544
because infinity just
keeps going on and on.

00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:13.517
So you always want to put
a parentheses if you're

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:15.537
talking about infinity
or negative infinity.

00:09:15.537 --> 00:09:16.477
It's not really an endpoint,

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:18.138
it keeps going on and on forever.

00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:19.821
So you use the notation for open interval,

00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:23.176
at least at that end, and
notice we're not including,

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:25.532
we're not including one
either, so if x is a member

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:27.622
of this interval or that interval,

00:09:27.622 --> 00:09:30.339
it essentially could be
anything other than one.

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:32.359
But this would have been
the simplest notation

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:34.431
to describe that.
