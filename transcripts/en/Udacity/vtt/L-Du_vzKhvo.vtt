00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, let's look at the answer. What happens if we set stepping to false.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's take a look again at our code if we set stepping to false in here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
As for this continue command, what's going to happen downstream.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So we return true. So receiving will be true. So we're going to exit this loop immediately.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Meaning that the next line will be executed, and now we have over here the stepping variable

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
being set to false--this means we're going to resume execution line by line unless this condition

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
becomes true--that is unless we actually reached a breakpoint.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The correct answer is the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached.
