the course of the interviews and I
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.839
the course of the interviews and I
started hearing a lot of great insights

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849

about culture and I heard this one
expression from one of the CEOs where he

said we want to be the largest small
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260
said we want to be the largest small
company in our space and I was really

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
company in our space and I was really
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939
company in our space and I was really
intrigued by that what does that mean

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
intrigued by that what does that mean
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830
intrigued by that what does that mean
how do you do that obviously largest in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
how do you do that obviously largest in
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.439
how do you do that obviously largest in
terms of size smallest in terms of just

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
terms of size smallest in terms of just
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.650
terms of size smallest in terms of just
that startup culture feel and that just

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
that startup culture feel and that just
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630
that startup culture feel and that just
got me thinking about culture and and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
got me thinking about culture and and
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250
got me thinking about culture and and
what it means and the thing about

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
what it means and the thing about
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.780
what it means and the thing about
culture is that it's such an amorphous

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
culture is that it's such an amorphous
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.619
culture is that it's such an amorphous
word I mean if you know got ten people

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
word I mean if you know got ten people
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119
word I mean if you know got ten people
in front of a whiteboard and said what

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
in front of a whiteboard and said what
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860
in front of a whiteboard and said what
is culture you could put a hundred

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
is culture you could put a hundred
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.549
is culture you could put a hundred
things on it and they would all be true

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559
things on it and they would all be true
 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.279
things on it and they would all be true
because it is such a fuzzy concept so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
because it is such a fuzzy concept so
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.420
because it is such a fuzzy concept so
the more I thought about the more I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
the more I thought about the more I
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069
the more I thought about the more I
tried to frame the question in the right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
tried to frame the question in the right
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529
tried to frame the question in the right
way about culture and I really framed it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
way about culture and I really framed it
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.420
way about culture and I really framed it
this way which is what are the biggest

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
this way which is what are the biggest
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.670
this way which is what are the biggest
drivers of culture the things that if

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
drivers of culture the things that if
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400
drivers of culture the things that if
done well have an outsize positive

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
done well have an outsize positive
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979
done well have an outsize positive
impact and if done badly or not at all

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
impact and if done badly or not at all
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.670
impact and if done badly or not at all
have an outsize negative impact and that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
have an outsize negative impact and that
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440
have an outsize negative impact and that
was really the question that framed the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
was really the question that framed the
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480
was really the question that framed the
book and I just went through you know

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
book and I just went through you know
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520
book and I just went through you know
millions of words of transcripts looking

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
millions of words of transcripts looking
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530
millions of words of transcripts looking
for the insights that helped answer that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
for the insights that helped answer that
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560
for the insights that helped answer that
question in terms of why now for this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
question in terms of why now for this
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200
question in terms of why now for this
book I really think that culture is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
book I really think that culture is
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300
book I really think that culture is
increasingly the X Factor that's going

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
increasingly the X Factor that's going
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850
increasingly the X Factor that's going
to separate companies because business

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
to separate companies because business
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710
to separate companies because business
is just moving so fast there's so much

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
is just moving so fast there's so much
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670
is just moving so fast there's so much
disruption in so many industries and you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
disruption in so many industries and you
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380
disruption in so many industries and you
can have two companies with a similar

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
can have two companies with a similar
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.840
can have two companies with a similar
strategy similar backing and the one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
strategy similar backing and the one
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490
strategy similar backing and the one
that's gonna win is the one with the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
that's gonna win is the one with the
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380
that's gonna win is the one with the
better culture a lot of people don't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
better culture a lot of people don't
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480
better culture a lot of people don't
focus on culture though because it is so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
focus on culture though because it is so
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.120
focus on culture though because it is so
amorphous people tend to focus on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
amorphous people tend to focus on
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670
amorphous people tend to focus on
strategy they tend to focus on results

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
strategy they tend to focus on results
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.410
strategy they tend to focus on results
because you can put the results in a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
because you can put the results in a
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.530
because you can put the results in a
spreadsheet but culture is really the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
spreadsheet but culture is really the
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810
spreadsheet but culture is really the
the X Factor that's going to drive the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
the X Factor that's going to drive the
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.670
the X Factor that's going to drive the
results and I've heard that from a lot

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
results and I've heard that from a lot
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580
results and I've heard that from a lot
of really smart CEOs I wrote the book as

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
of really smart CEOs I wrote the book as
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.550
of really smart CEOs I wrote the book as
a as really a playbook

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
a as really a playbook
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249
a as really a playbook
because CEOs just have so many things on

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
because CEOs just have so many things on
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.100
because CEOs just have so many things on
their plates they could do literally a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
their plates they could do literally a
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.359
their plates they could do literally a
hundred different things on any

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
hundred different things on any
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249
hundred different things on any
different day they're responsible for

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
different day they're responsible for
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660
different day they're responsible for
everything and kind of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
everything and kind of
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.390
everything and kind of
nothing at the same time and because

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400
nothing at the same time and because
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610
nothing at the same time and because
culture is so amorphous it can be hard

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
culture is so amorphous it can be hard
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.949
culture is so amorphous it can be hard
for them to figure out well is this a

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
for them to figure out well is this a
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.350
for them to figure out well is this a
good use of my time so that's why I

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
good use of my time so that's why I
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
good use of my time so that's why I
really tried to frame it around the the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
really tried to frame it around the the
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.309
really tried to frame it around the the
question what are the biggest drivers so

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319
question what are the biggest drivers so
 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.350
question what are the biggest drivers so
that if they're really focused on these

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
that if they're really focused on these
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.380
that if they're really focused on these
things that they would see an impact

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
things that they would see an impact
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960
things that they would see an impact
even if it's not super tangible but just

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
even if it's not super tangible but just
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270
even if it's not super tangible but just

hundreds of other CEOs that this had an

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100
hundreds of other CEOs that this had an
 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.130
hundreds of other CEOs that this had an
impact on their company if you're a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
impact on their company if you're a
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.380
impact on their company if you're a
start-up CEO you really have to be

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
start-up CEO you really have to be
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.960
start-up CEO you really have to be
thoughtful about culture because you're

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
thoughtful about culture because you're
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.580
thoughtful about culture because you're
gonna have culture one way or another

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
gonna have culture one way or another
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.430
gonna have culture one way or another
it's gonna happen on its own and every

company's culture is different it's
really the sum total of kind of the DNA

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519
really the sum total of kind of the DNA
 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.570
really the sum total of kind of the DNA
of the people in your company and the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
of the people in your company and the
 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.190
of the people in your company and the
metaphor that I like to use about

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
metaphor that I like to use about
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.539
metaphor that I like to use about
culture is that it's sort of like

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549
culture is that it's sort of like
 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.600
culture is that it's sort of like

cholesterol in any organization you're
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.229
cholesterol in any organization you're
gonna have good and bad culture and just

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
gonna have good and bad culture and just
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.460
gonna have good and bad culture and just
like with cholesterol you're gonna have

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
like with cholesterol you're gonna have
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620
like with cholesterol you're gonna have
good and bad cholesterol the trick is to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
good and bad cholesterol the trick is to
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.970
good and bad cholesterol the trick is to
focus on the things that are really

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
focus on the things that are really
 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.710
