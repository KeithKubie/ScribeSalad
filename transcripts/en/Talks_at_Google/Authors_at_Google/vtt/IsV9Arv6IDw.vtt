[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.230
SANDY: So we're going
to start by having

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.379
Brady Robinson from Access Fund
give a few words introduce him.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.920
And then, hopefully,
in the meantime,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.560
we'll get both screens
up and running.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.720
So thanks, Brady.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.300
BRADY ROBINSON:
I'm Brady Robinson,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.790
I'm the executive director
of the Access Fund.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.290
We're the national
organization that

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.490
keeps climbing areas open and
conserved in the United States.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
Tommy's a former board
member, and lucky enough

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.500
to get to introduce him today.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.136
I just wanted to tell you a
little bit about what we do.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.760
We've got staff all
around the country.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.165
We've got someone in
Sonora, California.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:42.290
Anybody know where that is?

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.511
Reasonably?

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.010
Yeah.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.420
Near Jailhouse-- Gold
Wall-- anybody climb there?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.840
Is everybody here a climber?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.860
Most-- more-- more--

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.590
pretty much?

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.090
OK.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.620
I've just got to gauge
the audience, here.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.120
All right.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.650
All right.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.467
Good.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:55.800
Yeah, so we're based in Boulder.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.258
We've got staff
around the country.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.670
And the only way we can
have a national reach

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.237
and be relevant nationally,
is with our affiliate

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:02.820
organizations.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.069
We have over 100
affiliate organizations.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.830
One of, frankly, our most well
organized and most effective

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.570
is the Bay Area
Climbers Coalition.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.340
Ally, great job setting
everything up here.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.460
So we work in partnership
with local groups.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.320
We're the national,
they're the local.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.278
And a few of the things
that we've been able to

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.510
do here, recently--

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.340
we've-- so Castle Rock
State Park, for a long time,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.090
had a bolting ban.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.234
Basically, you couldn't
even replace bolts.

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:31.650
We worked in partnership with
Bay Area Climber's Coalition

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.530
to try to reverse that, so that
when we are clipping things

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.300
in the outdoors,
they're hopefully safe,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.040
and we can depend
our lives on it.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890
We finally got
permission to do that.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.840
And this very next
weekend, Ally, you all

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.510
are doing a rebolting
effort out there.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.550
They have enough
volunteers for that.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.160
They could use a little more
coin for the hardware, however.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.520
And so if you would like to make
a donation to the local group,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.150
you can do that with your
badge, and Google will match it.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.610
You can also support
the Access Fund,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.750
as a national organization.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.960
We get the majority of our
funding for our 24 staff

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.650
through individual donations
from people just like you.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.670
Since 2011, Google
employees and the company,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.559
through gift matching,
have given us over $38,000.

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.100
So if you're a part of that, I
want to thank you, personally,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.040
for supporting
climbing and this--

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.237
utilizing this generous gift
matching that Google offers up.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.070
We've also-- we're
working on the Gold Wall.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.810
We got Jailhouse
open, a while back.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.510
Anybody-- any Jailhouse
aficionados here?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.010
OK.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.250
Not as many.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.940
That's cool.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.380
Something to aspire
to-- it's kind of hard.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.810
We're working on the Yosemite
Climbing Management Plan--

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.730
who's been to Yosemite, here?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.420
And climbed Yosemite?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.700
El Cap?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880
All right.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.490
More things to aspire to.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.890
We're also doing a stewardship--

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.460
Access Fund is doing
a stewardship training

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.710
in Yosemite this very weekend.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.909
So we're taking local climbing
volunteers and land managers

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.450
for four days and
then teaching them,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.610
like-- what is this
climbing thing?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.940
How do you manage it?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.179
How do you take--

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.720
how do you take care
of these places?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.730
One of the issues that we're
dealing with in our community

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.357
now is that climbing
gyms are sprouting

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:15.940
up all over the
nation and more people

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.024
are coming into the sport.

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:18.898
And so, on the one hand,
that's great-- we're

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.650
becoming more of a
political constituency,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.120
climbers voices actually matter.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.312
We just got back
from Washington DC--

00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:26.395
Tommy and I were there
advocating for public lands

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:27.877
and Bears Ears--

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:28.960
the voice of the climbers.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.630
Honestly, unthinkable even
maybe eight years ago,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.240
that climbers would be a
political constituency.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.084
We are-- from my perspective,
that's good news.

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.500
The flip side of
that is-- there's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.682
more of us in the outdoors.

00:03:39.682 --> 00:03:41.890
And so increasingly, certainly
with Bay Area Climbers

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.390
Coalition and the Access Fund--

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.370
increasingly, we're
working on not just making

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.470
sure that we have
access to these places,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.940
but they're not getting trashed
as a function of our use.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.400
So again, we're doing
a lot in the area.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.580
I won't go more
into that, really,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.070
but thank you for your
generosity in that.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.570
We are doing a--

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.850
we're doing our stand up
for public lands event--

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.090
these little cards are
available over there--

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.930
in Oakland, September ninth.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.030
He's not confirmed yet,
but I think Jimmy Chin's

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.230
going to be the key note.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.801
So if you're friends
with him on social media,

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:14.800
give him a little nudge.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.180
But hopefully he's
going to confirm.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.539
And so, yeah-- so
again, that's great.

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.080
Oh, and our partnership
with Google--

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.130
so Sandy is incredible.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.110
She was the force behind
the Street View Mapping

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
of the Nose, and has
done a really great job,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.510
from my perspective, of
identifying other cool things

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.130
to do in the climbing world.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.449
And we did a Street View Mapping
of the Homestead in Arizona.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.990
So if you're at your
desk, and you've

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.890
got a little time to kill,
try to find the Street

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.270
View of the Homestead.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.870
We-- have you all seen the
trekker that you guys have--

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.281
like weigh 55 pounds?

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.030
We hiked through one
of our climbing areas

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.238
and mapped it out for you,
so you can check that out.

00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:58.930
We're also-- Google
is supporting us

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.390
in an inventory and
a mapping project

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.380
at Red Rocks, outside of Nevada.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.370
So one of the greatest
climbing areas in the country.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.621
Your company is supporting
us in walking through there

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.453
and doing an inventory,
so we can figure out

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:12.880
where the trails are, and which
ones need to be worked on.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.177
So we have a great partnership
with your company, as well.

00:05:16.177 --> 00:05:17.760
And I'm personally
just kind of a fan.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.890
So finally, though--

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.700
Tommy.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.010
So I'll keep this fairly short.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.330
Tommy is one of the greatest
climbers of our generation,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.410
hands down.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.260
He's a great guy.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.050
He served on our
board for six years

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.150
when he had a lot of
other things to do.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.990
And I think the one
thing I would just say,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.090
before I turn it
over to Tommy is--

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.910
it's really hard
for us to fathom

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.440
the amount of time
and dedication

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.630
it took for him to do the
Dawn Wall with a completely

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.560
uncertain outcome.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.120
So my little tiny
insight into that--

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.670
so I was fortunate
enough to climb

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.670
the Nose of El Capitan in 2012.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.460
And I climbed it
with two other guys.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.180
We climbed it in a day.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.080
We got to the top.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.860
We were exhausted.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.609
We were beat down.

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:06.710
We were walking down the
east ledge's descent,

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.630
rappelling down,
kind of in a stupor,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.420
and there's a head lamp at
the bottom of the ropes.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.559
It's like 10:30 at
night, maybe 11.

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:14.975
I can't remember
what time it was.

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:16.580
And it looked like
somebody was going

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.530
in the wrong
direction-- coming up

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.060
the ropes we were going down.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.640
Who the heck would
be by themselves,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.310
humping a huge load, in
the middle of the night?

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.630
Tommy Caldwell.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.220
That is the sort of dedication
it took to not only find

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.680
that there was a possible
route on that part of El Cap,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.650
but then, ultimately, rehearse
the moves over many years

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.240
and finally ascend the thing.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.070
It's incredible the
amount of dedication

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.390
and just the number
of hours he put in,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.390
where nobody was looking,
there were no cameras,

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.556
and it was just what he did.

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:50.860
So Tommy, it's my
pleasure to introduce you.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.367
Come on up and--

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:53.033
Tommy Caldwell--

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:57.789
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.330
TOMMY CALDWELL:
Yeah, I got this one.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.830
Hello.

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:02.570
Awesome.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.260
This is actually my second
time coming to Google

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.480
to present a show.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.964
We came to present the
Street View one other time.

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.380
And it was pretty
surprising to me

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.450
when I came before-- it was
like this roomful of climbers.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.280
I thought I'd come
speak to a bunch of tech

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.220
nerds or something, and it turns
out it's climber nerds instead.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.410
Yeah, it felt like I was
in a room of friends.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.200
It's been pretty
extraordinary to me,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.290
to see climbing go
where it's gone.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.470
I mean, I felt like I spent
the majority of my life

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.420
in this close-knit
community, where

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.780
it was just a bunch of climbers
and I knew basically everybody.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.010
But in the last few years, or
10 years or so, it's expanded

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.130
and climbing is having this
reach that it never has before.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.610
I mean, just the
fact that there's

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.790
is this many climbers
at Google, and I'm

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.090
coming to Google to speak these
days, and going to Capitol Hill

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.290
and lobbying--

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.540
we have a voice,
and, really, Google's

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.589
been a big part of that.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:59.130
And so I just want
to thank you guys.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.680
Thanks, Sandy.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.930
Yeah-- helping to spread the
great word because I feel

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.810
like climbing has the
power to transform lives,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.700
and it's such a great activity.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.130
So my presentation today--

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.170
I was-- I'm in the
midst of a book tour--

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.020
crazy book tour--

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.530
25 stops or something
in three weeks.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.520
And Sandy managed,
like she always does,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.070
convince us to squeeze
one more in, here, today,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.380
which is really fun.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.620
Yeah so this book is--

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.280
it's pretty deep.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.627
I think that when people
start reading it, they'll--

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.210
you know, that's
been the major input,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.380
like, I was really vulnerable.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.169
And I've got to admit when I--

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.799
when I sat down and I knew
I wanted to write something,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.230
I would try to transcend the--

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.020
you know, kind of the typical
climbing book or even sports

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.870
memoir world, and I knew
I had to go really deep.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.287
I tried to think as little
about what other people would

00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:53.870
think of that.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.130
I just knew I
needed to make it as

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.450
close to my heart as possible.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.160
And then, on publication
day, last week,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.810
I was walking to my first event
feeling slightly unnerved,

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.680
a little vulnerable.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.600
I was like, I'm about to
expose the depths of my soul

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.825
to the entire world.

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:09.200
And I was walking
down the street

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.419
in New York City, on my way
to my first event, and--

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.210
hold on one second.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.140
And I came across
this sign, right here.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.350
Crossing the street--
high four and a half.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.540
New York City giving
me a little nudge--

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.460
everything is going
to be just fine.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.000
As this book is
revealed to the world,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.420
I've had quite a few people
in the literary world come up

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.410
to and be like--

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.300
a memoir at age 38?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.400
Like-- aren't you
supposed to be at least 70

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.500
or something to write
something like that?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.730
And the truth is-- maybe.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.770
Maybe you should wait that long.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.856
But there's a reason that I
decided to write this book now,

00:09:53.856 --> 00:09:55.480
and it really comes
down to this moment

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.063
that Brady mentioned
on the Dawn wall.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.500
This is January 14, 2015.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.099
And this was a crazy day in
my life, for a lot of reasons.

00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:03.640
First of all, it
was something that I

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.060
had worked for really for
seven years, specifically

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.810
on this route.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.120
But in a way, I felt like
it was the culmination

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.651
of like my entire life.

00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:13.150
I started climbing
when I was three,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.710
and this kind of
took all the skills

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.960
that I had accumulated to
come to this one moment

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.240
that I really wasn't sure
was ever going to happen.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.550
I worked on this thing
for a lot of years,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.160
and I totally gave up
on several occasions,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.900
and something would
always bring me back.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.180
And it was just this
incredible journey.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.810
And this moment, here, was
the realization of that,

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.287
so it was really emotional.

00:10:33.287 --> 00:10:34.870
The other reason it
was crazy, though,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.576
is because, like I said,
I felt like I've always

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:39.700
lived in this little
close-knit climbing community.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.990
And I've been a
professional climber,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.970
so climbers have followed
along in this way,

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.580
but topping out
on this day was--

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.140
something happened in the media.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.265
About three years before
this, my climbing partner,

00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:54.310
Kevin Jorgenson, had
started using social media

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.130
to tell people about what
we're doing up on the wall--

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.520
started posting updates
on this climb to Twitter.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.340
And at first, I was
kind of a curmudgeon.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.080
I was like, no
climbing, it's soulful.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.490
It's just about me and your
buddy in the mountains,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.656
and we shouldn't really let
anybody into this world.

00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:11.804
But we came down from
this first climb--

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:14.470
or this year that he was posting
Twitter updates, and every day,

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.500
people would come up
to me and be like--

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.770
man, when are you going back?

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.482
That was the most
inspiring thing ever.

00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:21.190
You know, the highlight
of my day at work

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.100
was watching-- you
know, going on Twitter

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.690
and figuring out what
you guys were doing.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.800
And so I started to change
my view on it a little bit.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.890
I started to feel like
if we weren't sharing,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.490
it was almost like
being selfish.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.620
We were keeping this
experience to ourselves.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.860
So I followed suit.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.790
I started going on
Facebook and Instagram,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.220
and doing the same thing
in the subsequent years.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.890
And for a while, the climbing
community followed along.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.473
Then, most people gave up on us
because they're like-- they're

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.109
never going to do that thing.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.650
Nobody had actually
worked on a route

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.300
for that many years in a row.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.870
But then, in 2014,
or the end of 2014,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.370
beginning of 2015, as it seemed
like it might actually happen,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.290
the climbers got super stoked.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.390
And then that energy
started to bleed

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.215
outside of the climbing world.

00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:08.590
A gentleman by the name of
John Branch from "the New York

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.380
Times" wrote an article
for "the New York Times".

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.810
It got picked for the
cover of the newspaper

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.550
and there was a lot of interest.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.880
And then it just kind
of spread from there.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.250
The Times decided to run
articles on the cover

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.010
for like five consecutive
days, and there were something

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.170
like 13 billion media--

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.790
media impressions.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.290
And so we were up
there on the wall,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.837
in our little
community of climbers,

00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.170
and we had a filmmaker up there.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.910
And we were looking
down at El Cap meadow

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.264
and seeing all these trucks show
up, and it was kind of nuts.

00:12:37.264 --> 00:12:38.680
So I hucked my
phone off the wall.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.012
I was like-- we've got to stay
in the midst of this climbing

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.970
experience, but when we
topped out on this day,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.261
you couldn't ignore it anymore.

00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:47.790
I had climbed El Cap
65 times by this point,

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.749
and nobody had ever
greeted me on top.

00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:51.165
And this was the
middle of January

00:12:51.165 --> 00:12:55.067
and like 80 people showed up on
the top of El Cap with cameras.

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.650
The president called--
President Obama

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.650
called to congratulate us.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.300
There was this really crazy
phenomenon over the next days,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.510
where I would walking down
the streets in Yosemite,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.630
or I went to New York
pretty quickly after this,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.309
and like, old
ladies would come up

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:10.600
to me with tears in their eyes.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.016
And they're like-- that was
the most inspiring thing ever.

00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:15.640
And I was thinking to myself,
like-- old ladies are just

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.880
not the demographic
I thought would be

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.490
inspired by this kind of thing.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.230
This is so strange.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.410
But one thing this did
is it kind of clued me

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.360
into the power of storytelling.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.072
I think people think that social
media is this quick tip format,

00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:31.280
but I actually think when
it's done most effectively,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.390
it's a pretty long--

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.430
long format way to
still tell stories.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.690
You can actually follow
somebody's life indefinitely.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.310
And these news stories
were cool, in some ways.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.580
And sort of the most
reputable news sources did--

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.890
did the story justice, I
felt like-- like the New York

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.250
Times and NPR.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.610
But the vast majority
just took climbing

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.040
and they sensationalize--
sensationalized it.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.280
They had all the facts wrong.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.580
They said we were
climbing without ropes.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.100
And it like-- a little
bit of my heart broke.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.860
I was like, oh, this sport
that I am so endeared to,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.000
and is actually being
spread to the world.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.750
It's great it's being
spread in the world,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.930
but it's like-- they're
not getting it quite right.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.790
And so I started to feel like
I needed to write a book.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.726
And so yeah-- it was funny.

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.100
I came down from
the Dawn Wall, I

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.260
had all these
emails in my inbox,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.790
and I had kind of decided
that I wanted to write a book.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.540
And so I started going
through the emails,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.010
and there was a
few literary agents

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.160
and publishing companies.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.339
And so I emailed
them back, and I

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:35.630
decided to go to New York City.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.980
And on the plane,
I was like, oh, I'm

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.360
going to meet with
literary agents,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.401
but I have, really, no
idea what I'm going to say

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:41.790
or how to write a book.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.230
So I just quickly
started typing,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.020
and I like typed my
whole life story out

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.900
on the airplane on the
way to New York City.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.300
And then I emailed it off
that night to the people

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.156
I was meeting the next morning.

00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:54.030
And then I met-- went
and met with everybody,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.235
and most of them were like--

00:14:55.235 --> 00:14:57.110
yeah, you should probably
get a ghost writer.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.030
Most athletes don't actually
write their own memoirs.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.180
But there was this one
guy, David Laribel,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.060
who believed in my story,
for whatever reason.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.697
And he said, I
think you can write.

00:15:09.697 --> 00:15:11.030
I think you have potential here.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.530
And he sort of
started advising me,

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.529
so that's the guy I picked
as my literary agent.

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:17.270
He said, you should write
a 50 page book proposal

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.060
and show them what
you can actually do.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.210
And so I spent two months
working on this book proposal.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.602
And, you know, it was kind
of-- it was this thing where--

00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:29.310
I didn't really know
how to write a book,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.410
but I know how to
climb mountains,

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.993
so I just started to approach
it like I do climbing mountains.

00:15:32.993 --> 00:15:34.130
First, I did some research.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.840
And I'm really lucky to live in
this community of good authors.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.360
I called up Jon Krakauer,
who-- you guys have probably

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.276
heard of him, he's a bit
of a friend of mine--

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.250
and got some information
from him, and Jim Collins,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.700
and they expressed
a lot of confidence

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.077
in me, which was huge.

00:15:51.077 --> 00:15:53.410
And they also just kind of
gave me some business advice.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.860
But then, really, the
most important thing

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.300
when you're writing
a book, or when

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.841
you're climbing a
mountain, actually,

00:15:57.841 --> 00:15:58.910
is to get a good partner.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.640
So I called my next door
neighbor-- this guy,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.950
right here, Kelly Cordes,
and I decided that he would--

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.290
we decided together that we
were going to kind of embark

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.331
on this journey together.

00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:12.140
And the working process was--

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.940
I would sit down and
write the chapters,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.950
and try and make them
as good as I could.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.900
And then he would take
his more literary mind

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.210
and help me elevate them.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.441
And so I think the whole
ghostwriting thing didn't

00:16:25.441 --> 00:16:27.940
really appeal to me because as
a climber, I was like-- well,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.560
you don't hire somebody to
climb a mountain for you,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.190
but you do find a good partner.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.095
And so I think it
worked pretty well.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.470
I hope people will
like the book.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.680
It's

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.110
Kind of a testament that
if you get the right people

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.760
on the bus with you and
you work really hard,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.510
you can venture
into realms that you

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.120
have no idea what it's like.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.360
And, climbers do
this all the time.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.800
So I sat down and
I started writing.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.540
And you would think
after the Dawn Wall,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.050
I would have written
about the Dawn Wall,

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.630
but I felt moved to write
about a very different moment

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.140
in my life.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.569
It was 15 years earlier.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:10.790
And it was this moment that
was so intense that I had never

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.700
really let myself go
back there, I think.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.430
Climbers tend to
focus very intensely

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.940
on the things that will help
them get their jobs done--

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.599
or really, people that really
excel in any world do this,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.369
I suppose.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.370
And for me, writing was
very different than that.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.930
Instead of focusing
intensely, I felt

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.780
like I had to take those
binoculars off and see

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.410
everything.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.040
And so I went back to this
moment when I was 21 years old.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.820
This first excerpt to read
is my first big international

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:48.240
climbing expedition to the the
of Kyrgyzstan, in Central Asia.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.380
And this-- the other
characters in this excerpt

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.770
are Jason Singer
and John Dickey.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.870
They were the male
members of the expedition.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.100
Beth Rodden was my
girlfriend at the time.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.280
And then Su and Abdul are
members of the Islamic Movement

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.320
of Uzbekistan.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.130
We, as relatively naive,
young, American climbers

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.660
had gone into this
mountain region

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.030
figuring that the
mountains are a safe place.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.550
In this part of the world,
that wasn't the case in 2001.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.730
There was kind of
an opium trade trail

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.740
that appeared through
the mountains.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.542
And the Islamic
Movement of Uzbekistan

00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:27.000
moved over these really high
mountain passes, when the snow

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.950
melted, from one side of us.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.696
And then the Kyrgyz military
came from the other side,

00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:33.320
and we were at that
point of collision.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.920
We got taken hostage
for six days in a war.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.910
We had to abandon everything
that we had with our captors--

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.330
no warm clothes, no
food, on the verge

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.840
of hypothermia for six days,
where we just got closer

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.610
and closer to death, frankly.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.220
And by the end, it was
getting pretty real.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.977
So this excerpt is
this moment that I

00:18:56.977 --> 00:18:58.060
felt moved to write about.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.934
So this was-- these were
the very first words

00:18:59.934 --> 00:19:02.340
I wrote in this book.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.200
"Starvation is a funny thing.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.370
You feel it first in your
stomach, a nauseating pain,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.720
low in your gut.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.000
Your breathing becomes
labored and your body slows.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.590
Your mind goes next.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.390
Indifference takes over.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.010
Emotions dull.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.190
But after several days, the
pain in my stomach went away.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.220
I still don't know how it
happened or where it came from,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.850
but as everyone else grew
weaker, I felt stronger.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.070
I noticed my night
vision improving.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.900
Lines became crisp.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.050
By the time the sun had
set on the sixth day,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.380
I was aware of every
sound, every movement.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.050
I felt a lightness,
a vitality, as

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.300
though I could race
straight uphill

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.190
without my heart rate rising.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.920
I saw myself again as a warrior.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.680
On our sixth night, our
captors hatched a plan.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.830
They, too, were
starving and cold.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.000
So Abdul would return
to our base camp

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.030
to scavenge any remaining
food and warmer clothes.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.030
The rest of us would ascend
a 2,000 foot mountain side--

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.270
a mixture of callous fields and
nearly vertical cliff bands.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.570
To us, at least in our normal
states, it was easy terrain.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.350
Abdul, after gathering
more rations,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.440
would come up another side,
a less treacherous way,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.030
and meet us on top.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.880
For the first time,
we were alone with Su.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.850
The moon plays tricks in the
darkness, casting shadows

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.700
that dance across the cliffs.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.320
A jumbled mess of stone
disappears below--

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.520
blackness.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.340
Far in the distance, stars
illuminate the jagged spires

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.830
and snow covered mountains.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.200
Su's feet skid as he
lets out a pain grunt.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.450
I watch as Singer
guides him, pointing out

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.390
footholds and hand-holds
solid enough to grab.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.022
The plan had been for Beth
and me to stay above, out

00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:45.650
of the fall line.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.910
We climb higher.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.130
Su wobbles again and I
hear the clatter of rocks

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.635
tumbling down the
nearly sheer drop off.

00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:52.250
Now.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.030
Now.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.490
Silently, I'm urging
them to do it--

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.230
willing them to do it.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.300
Singer and Dickey
resume their guiding.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.320
More spots pass where Su
is exposed and insecure.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.780
I try not to think about what
it is that I wish-- that I'm

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.820
wishing that they would do.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.210
As the top nears, Su gains
confidence and scrambles ahead

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.700
of them, using his hands
to keep his balance

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.770
as he clambers over loose rock.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.730
At a more difficult section,
just 50 feet from the top,

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.710
but 20 feet to our
right, he slows.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.810
Singer and Dickey
are still below.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.220
I glance down.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.600
Our eyes meet.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.740
They nod.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.060
I look at Beth.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.830
I'm going to have to
do this, I whisper.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.810
It has to be me.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:33.950
She trembles.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.750
Shadows cross her face.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.990
Her lips opened slightly,
but no sounds escape.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.150
For a moment, we
stare at one another.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.620
She dips her head--

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.150
I know.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.910
The strength has been growing
into a monster inside of me,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.460
emerging from nowhere,
from everywhere,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.390
unlike anything I've known.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.540
I accelerate across
a series of footholds

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.190
with the swiftness
of a mountain goat,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.360
staying silent
through the shadows.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.360
15-- 10-- five feet
away and still,

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.090
Su doesn't see me coming.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.790
The barrel of his rifle
glistens under the stars.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.410
I see the outline
of the grotesque

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.910
mole on his upper lip.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.150
My foot dislodges a
loose chunk of rock.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.010
He turns sharply towards me.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.230
Our eyes lock.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.640
I lunge for the strap of the
gun slung over his shoulder.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.180
I pull as hard as I can
and push his shoulder.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.970
His body arcs backwards
through the blackness, outlined

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.070
by the moon.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.240
He cries out in
surprise and fear.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.400
His body lands on a
ledge with a sickening

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.190
thud and then bounces
towards oblivion.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.050
For a moment, I hear
and feel nothing.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.110
Then, vertigo strikes me.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.000
I think the sun is rising.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.890
Glimmers of light blur into
long, indistinct streaks,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.820
somehow real and surreal
at the same time.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.790
Suddenly, as if a stone has
crashed down on my head,

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.680
every muscle in my
body contracts and I

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.250
squeeze my eyes shut
as hard as I can.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.510
I scramble and sprint
the remaining distance

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.010
to the top of the mountain,
where I stand alone, panting.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.670
I drop to the ground
and tuck myself

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.010
into as tight of a
ball as possible.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.500
I rock back and forth, sobbing.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.720
Everything I've held
inside floods out of me.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.120
I just killed a man.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.720
Not an evil villain, but a man
not so different from myself--

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.140
scared, juvenile, a man
who probably had a family

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.330
at home waiting for his return.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.640
I shouted at God to wake
me from this nightmare.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.080
It was too horrible to be real.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.650
I shook uncontrollably and
wondered if I was going mad."

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.170
So yeah, writing those
first words in this book

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.870
was like this incredibly
cathartic experience.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.850
Not only was it kind of
traumatizing, in a way,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.640
because I can suddenly
like feel that fear again

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.560
and smell the
smells, but it also

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.010
started to help me knit together
these kind of crazy experiences

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.880
I had.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.724
And when I thought
about writing a book,

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:48.140
I kind of thought I was going
to write a typical adventure

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.430
story, something
relatively uplifting.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.680
And then I wrote these
scenes, and I was like--

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.650
whoa, this is heavy.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.430
Like, the heaviness of my
life kind of struck me.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.760
And so I think this book has
a lot of heaviness in it.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.850
And so I felt like,
after writing that,

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.904
like I needed to
finish this book.

00:24:09.904 --> 00:24:11.570
Before, I knew I
wanted to write a book.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.986
Afterwards, I just
knew that there

00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:16.359
was no option but to actually
continue writing this thing

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:17.150
and see it through.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.107
And I became very,
very obsessed by it,

00:24:19.107 --> 00:24:22.270
by the same way
that I do climbing.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.660
So Kelly and I
really-- we sat down

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.470
and we started to kind of
dissect my life a little bit.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.830
We wanted to bring out some of
the essence of what climbing

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.940
is, of what my story is,
which, in a lot of ways,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.700
it's of overcoming
adversities-- taking

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.390
these hard experiences in life
and figuring out-- figuring out

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.110
how to have them energize you,
and turn them into something

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.160
good.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.000
And as I started back at the
beginning, in my childhood,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.419
I realized that everything
was so intertwined.

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:53.960
When I wrote that
Kyrgyzstan section,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.940
I think I did it then because
I felt like it was somehow

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.980
related to the Dawn Wall.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.021
But when I started at the
beginning, I was like--

00:24:59.021 --> 00:25:01.010
it's all intertwined.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.065
And so I started to
think about things like--

00:25:04.065 --> 00:25:09.380
a big emerging thing was
this father-son relationship.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.540
What does it mean to have this
father that is so full of life

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.274
that he's able to make
his body look like this?

00:25:18.274 --> 00:25:19.190
Kind of a crazy dude--

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.270
and then what's the
psychological effect, if as

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.760
a kid, if all you want to do is
to make yourself look like him?

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.900
Yeah.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.380
I really love the part
of this book that really

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.594
deals with that relationship.

00:25:34.594 --> 00:25:36.260
I think I realized
how powerful that is.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.150
And especially as
a dad these days,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.870
I wanted to kind of analyze
how my dad had raised me,

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.510
just to see how I would
do things differently.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.470
And then another big theme
is the power of nature.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.240
I mean, my dad had me
out in the mountains

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.860
from a really young age.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.170
He loves tell the story
about me taking me

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.090
into a raging blizzard
when I was three years old,

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.691
and digging a snow
cave, and having

00:25:58.691 --> 00:26:01.190
us sleep in the snow cave, where
he said he actually changed

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.148
my diapers, in a snow
cave, in a blizzard, when

00:26:03.148 --> 00:26:05.280
I was three years old.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.700
And we did things like
this all the time.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.410
Like, I-- there was--

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.690
I have countless
memories of like running

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.650
from lightning storms.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.560
By the time I was six, I
knew like when lightning

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.060
is close by, you need to like
crouch in this certain position

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.351
so that the electricity won't
travel through you if you

00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:20.750
get struck by lightning.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.470
And I learned to really
love this environment, but I

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.002
also, possibly, like the--

00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:30.200
like what risk is might
have got a little bit

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.280
tweaked in my head.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.470
Like I became--

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.470
I became almost addicted
to these experiences,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.390
in this weird way.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:43.140
And so a lot of this
book deals with risk.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.312
This is an interesting
quote that I came across

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.520
when I was writing this book.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.074
This is from a friend of
mine, actually, Tom Hornbein,

00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:52.490
who wrote a really, really
beautiful book called "the West

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.230
Ridge of Everest".

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.110
He was on the team that did
the first ascent of that route

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.320
on Everest, way back when you
had to hike 200 miles even

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.450
just to get to the
base of the mountain.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.170
But he's a doctor,
and so the quote is,

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.270
"maybe we can view risk
like we would a drug--

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.330
beneficial to the organism
in its proper dose--

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.015
too much or too little
may be harmful".

00:27:17.062 --> 00:27:18.770
So the middle part of
this book is really

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.310
just story after story of me
going out in the mountains

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:28.130
and pushing myself, sometimes
to pretty extreme places,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.437
and I wondered why I did this.

00:27:31.437 --> 00:27:33.020
Here's another passage
from the middle

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.145
that I'm going to read you.

00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:35.630
This is my first
trip to Patagonia

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.050
in southern Argentina.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.730
"The days passed and we
couldn't push any higher.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.200
Nearly 2,000 feet up the wall,
we came upon a small perch--

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.590
perch atop a detached flake,
some 16 inches off the rock

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.360
face and three feet wide.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.220
The snow and ice caked
itself in the narrow gap.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.040
This would have to be our bivy.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.890
We packed more snow
to level the surface.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.620
Backs to the wall and sitting
upright, feet and legs

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.650
stuffed into a light
person, two person--

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.810
lightweight, two-person bivy
sack with no sleeping bag,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.115
we tried to rest.

00:28:07.115 --> 00:28:09.050
I ran slings around
my upper body

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.390
to latch myself to the rock.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.960
I clipped my helmet strap to
the lines to support my head.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.470
I was like an insect
caught in a spider's web.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.560
Dust spilled spectral
red, yellow, blue, indigo,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.620
and violet, all stacked
and blended together

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.600
across the western sky.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.360
The wind had exhausted
itself and lain down.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.710
All was still.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.380
All was real and
utterly beautiful.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.200
Only when I closed my eyes and
the natural wonders went dark,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.960
did a lance of cold
and fear pierce me.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.120
Teeth chattering,
flesh stinging cold

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.190
had me rattling against
my web of slings

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.230
like a shivering puppet.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.480
Why the hell would anybody
put himself through this?

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.940
I beat my heels up
and down, trying

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.370
to stir blood flow
into my wooden feet.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:53.870
The cold had seeped
into my brain

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.670
and I kept thinking
that I was going

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.530
to lose my toes and fingers.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.740
I thought of Beth, and lying
nestled against her body

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.390
radiating heat.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.315
I had visions of the
black and withered toes

00:29:04.315 --> 00:29:07.460
of friends of frostbite
victims that I had seen.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.860
Finally, first light crept in.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.440
As high as we were, on the
highest mountain in the range,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.250
we stared at the sliver of
sun, awaiting its warmth,

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.820
grateful that we were now
in some kind of purgatory--

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.760
not quite heaven, but
no longer frozen hell.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.170
I began untangling myself
from the web of slings.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.700
We rose and continued
climbing, but our pace slowed.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.090
Seeps of meltwater leftover
from the last storm

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.360
had frozen, leaving the face
coated in a treacherous veneer

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.650
of verglas.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.330
Clouds built overhead.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.130
We could hear the wind
coming from the west

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.314
like an enraged beast.

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:44.480
Though Topher and I were
protected on the east face,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.390
I could see massive chunks
of ice flying from the summit

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.330
and landing a mile
away on the glacier.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.820
I was strangely at peace
as the mountain came alive

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.620
and the sky turned dark.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.840
We were some 2,500
feet above the glacier

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.020
when we began a hasty retreat.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.510
The storm blasted in
with alarming suddenness,

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.470
growing as we descended,
leaving us soaked and shivering.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.470
We stumbled down the glacier
protected by Fitz Roy's hulking

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.430
mass.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.290
When we emerged from
the sheltered side,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.090
the wind threw me to the ground.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.580
I knelt on the glacier,
anchored by my ice tool,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.770
and I tucked my head to avoid
the flying shards of ice.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.320
Soon after, I lost
hold of my helmet

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.620
and watched it blow into
the sky over the horizon.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.320
Despite the storm's flurry,
soon the wind calmed

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.880
and the skies cleared.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.890
Different sounds then emerged--

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.350
the rumble of collapsing
seracs, the crunch

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.740
of crampons in the snow,
the rhythm of our breaths.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.740
Rocky summits glowed
crystal clear.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.106
There was beauty as peaceful
as anything I had known."

00:30:45.106 --> 00:30:46.530
So a lot of this
was really trying

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.310
to digest these
experiences, and trying

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:55.110
to figure out why I
feel almost moved,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.590
or the need to push
myself to these extremes.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.230
And I wrote this at a time in
my life, which was actually

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.688
really good because I was trying
to figure out not only how

00:31:03.688 --> 00:31:07.050
to be a good husband
to my wife, but also

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.384
be a good dad to my kids.

00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:11.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.920
TOMMY CALDWELL: Everybody
loves that photo.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.240
The last excerpt that
I'm going to read,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.590
here, is a letter that
I wrote to my son, Fitz,

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.530
after another trip to Patagonia.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.590
This was my fourth trip to
this same mountain range.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.580
And this is kind of
where my thoughts went

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.119
after I was a new dad, and I
actually went on this trip.

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:37.410
This was the first time I
went to a big mountain region

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.590
and brought my family with me.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.140
They were staying
in town at the base

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.510
of the mountains for the
majority of this trip,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.670
while I won't go into
the mountains and climb.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.050
So this is the letter--

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.220
"it's hard to believe
that just one week ago, I

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.070
said goodbye to you and your
mom as you boarded the bus

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.490
to start your travels home,
and I hiked into the mountains.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.340
So much has happened since
then and I'm struggling

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.020
to wrap my head around it.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.989
I've had a huge
adventure, for sure.

00:32:02.989 --> 00:32:04.530
I wonder if you
would have recognized

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.370
Alex and me staggering back into
El Chalten, with ripped clothes

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.880
and the fuzzy remains of our
rope draped over my shoulder.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.510
Alex had to walk close behind
me because he was snow blind.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.767
We looked and smelled awful.

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:19.350
When we got to town,
we heard the news

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.250
that Chad Kellogg was dead--

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.610
killed by rockfall
two days earlier.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.900
Do you remember him smiling--

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.260
smiling at you from the end
of the table at [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.495
He was a new friend, as
experienced a climber

00:32:30.495 --> 00:32:32.010
as any of us.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.930
The news made me nauseous
and took my breath away.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.930
I choose to climb where
the risks are manageable

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.570
and tell myself that
experience will keep me safe,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.880
but this could have happened
to anyone on the mountain.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.440
I think of you and your mom--

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.510
she knew who she was
marrying, but you

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.115
had no choice in the matter.

00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:49.490
I contemplate the
last five days,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.580
the more than 12,000 vertical
feet of climbing, and 100 or so

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.410
repels we just did--

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.820
was it real?

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.370
I feel inspired in a way that
only love and a grand journey

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.930
can bring about.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.810
While you and your mom
were cozy back in Colorado,

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.700
I was in the middle
of a struggle.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.190
My partner, Alex, and I had
dreamed, like so many others,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.950
of traversing the
entire Fitz Roy range.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.960
It was an obvious goal,
but I didn't really

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.700
believe we would succeed.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.840
No one had, yet.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.850
It was just too big.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.650
And yet, here we were,
a third of the way

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.660
through the traverse,
and high on Cerro Fitz

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.820
Roy-- the mountain
you're named after."

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.900
I omitted the middle
of the letter but--

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.135
"sitting safely now,
in central El Pino,

00:33:30.135 --> 00:33:33.000
I ink my journal with
more ramblings of life,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.250
love, the pursuit of a dream--

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.140
pondering the merit of
mountain climbing now

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.730
that I am a father.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.200
Risk is selfish.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.040
The biggest tragedy
I can imagine

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.820
is not being there to see
you take your first steps,

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.710
fall in love for the
first time, or come

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.543
to realize that you're
blessed with the most

00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:51.900
beautiful, joyful, and
graceful mom in the world.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.240
But for me, climbing makes
everything else fit into place.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.170
It's what lights the
fire, makes me a dreamer.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.170
The need to battle is built
into the fabric of who we are.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.110
As humans, we may fight
with the ones we love,

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.560
poison our bodies
with drugs, go to war.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.960
For many, the struggle
is a desperate attempt

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.139
to fill a void, but I find
my battle on the mountain,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.920
despite the risk and
fear that resides there.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.880
It breathes life into me.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.560
If I can show you
one thing, I hope

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.050
it will be choose your own--

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.560
chosen struggle, wherever
you may find it, with vigor,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.810
optimism, and love.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.920
I love you, Daddy."

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.770
So yeah, the middle of
this book gets a bit heavy,

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.080
but there is a happy
ending, I will say.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.260
And it really comes
down to me figuring out

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.080
that the answer is really
finding this balance--

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.830
finding the climbs
and the experiences

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.389
in life that fulfill me, that
bring me into the mountains,

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.820
that challenge me, but
that I'm relatively

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.260
certain I'll live through.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.674
And so that was the Dawn Wall.

00:34:59.674 --> 00:35:02.090
That's one of the reasons I
got so obsessed by this thing.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.030
I could bring my
family to Yosemite.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.070
I would go up on the wall,
and I never feared death,

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.160
but I was totally lit
up by the journey.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.020
Instead of going into
the Dawn Wall thing,

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.781
I'm going to show you
guys a little trailer.

00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:17.030
This is-- I hesitated a
little bit showing this to you

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.610
today because it's
a bit complicated,

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.045
but the filmmaker,
Josh Lowell, he

00:35:22.045 --> 00:35:24.890
was along with us on the
journey for seven years,

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.460
and he's been working very
hard to make this film.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.310
He didn't have the time
to make a trailer for me

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.797
to show at these events.

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.880
They had sold the distribution
rights of this film

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.020
to Red Bull Media House.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.720
And so Red Bull Media House
put together this trailer.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.766
It's a little bit cheesy.

00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:42.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.590
If you like Disney movies,
you'll probably love it.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.730
But yeah, so anyways-- this
is actually kind of a preview,

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.390
in a way, to a film that
will probably out this fall.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.270
Maybe this fall-- we'll
see when it comes out.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.380
But just remember-- put
your cheese goggles on

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.038
and, yeah-- enjoy.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.211
- Hey guys, it's John Branch
from "The New York Times."

00:36:17.211 --> 00:36:18.211
How's it going up there?

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.380
- On the air tonight
with a story of two

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.010
men attempting to free climb
the famously steep face

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.155
of El Capitan in Yosemite.

00:36:32.155 --> 00:36:35.380
- Tommy Caldwell and Kevin
Jorgenson attempt the hardest

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.614
free-climb in the world--

00:36:36.614 --> 00:36:42.250
- --using only their finger
tips to grasp razor sharp edges.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.840
- It's been six
years in the making--

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.170
3,000 feet of
straight up granite.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:51.820
- I mean, it just
looked impossible.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.831
- This is just a
monumental project.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.170
- There's a lot in Tommy's
past that prepared him

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.930
for this incredible challenge.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.040
- For Tommy Caldwell, this is
not his most miraculous story

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.992
of survival.

00:37:06.992 --> 00:37:08.350
- He was taken hostage.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.040
- We wake up into gunshots.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.280
- Tommy was using his
parents old table saw.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.140
- He did something that
he should never do.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.955
- When I heard he'd cut
his finger off-- you now,

00:37:17.955 --> 00:37:19.080
so much for Tommy Caldwell.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.280
- He cuts off his finger and
then he comes back way better.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.880
- He overcame all
of these challenges

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.890
and it just made him
even more determined.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.432
- Seeing footage of Tommy trying
to free-climb the Dawn Wall,

00:37:30.432 --> 00:37:33.895
trying to do these crazy moves--

00:37:33.895 --> 00:37:35.813
I just sent him a
Facebook message-- hey,

00:37:35.813 --> 00:37:37.148
do you need a partner?

00:37:37.148 --> 00:37:38.199
And here we go.

00:37:38.199 --> 00:37:40.824
- This might be the last time we
walk for a couple weeks, dude.

00:37:40.824 --> 00:37:42.880
- Yeah.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.075
- That way is made up
of thousands of little

00:37:46.075 --> 00:37:49.630
micro-sequences that have
to be done perfectly.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.420
- Everything was going
smoothly until Jorgenson

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.130
couldn't grasp pitch 15.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:59.042
- Jorgenson was stopped by the
sheer difficulty of the climb.

00:37:59.042 --> 00:38:00.500
- Going to the top
of without Kevin

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.160
was going to be devastating.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.350
- What are you thinking?

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.600
- Everything I can to help him.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.080
- We were in this
thing together.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.170
- I just had to give
it one more try.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.921
- I decided in that moment that
we were going get to the top

00:38:11.921 --> 00:38:12.420
together.

TOMMY CALDWELL: Cool.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.080
Yeah, that's what I
got for you guys today.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.670
Is there any questions?

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.450
AUDIENCE: In the film with you
and Alex climbing Fitz Roy,

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.180
you mentioned that
you had taken risks

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.720
that you felt were inappropriate
because you had just

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.210
become a father--

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.350
would you-- do you
still believe that?

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.050
Or would you like to
elaborate on that?

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.300
TOMMY CALDWELL: Yeah, I mean,
it's-- for me, I think--

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.680
for me, I think the way that
I was raised, like I said,

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.810
it maybe altered risk in
my mind, just a little bit.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.530
And so when I'm up on the
mountain and scary things

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.210
happen--

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.856
usually, my go-to, like my
reaction at the time is to be

00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:38.355
like--

00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:39.720
it's probably not
going to happen again.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.845
Like, a giant rock falls
off the mountain and lands

00:39:41.845 --> 00:39:44.391
20 feet from us, and makes
this big boom, and I'm like--

00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:46.140
that's probably not
going to happen again.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.920
And I understand, in a way,
that that's not totally right.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.550
Like, that's not normal.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.120
And so I have to be
cautious from afar.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.835
Alex Honnold is like my
drug dealer, in a way,

00:39:56.835 --> 00:39:57.660
he's my pusher.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.500
He's like-- it's going to be
so good, if you get us up there

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.010
and simul climb.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.450
It's true-- it is
like addicting.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.500
And I get pulled into
that world, occasionally,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.930
but hopefully I'll
find that balance.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.620
It's really part of
what writing this book

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.411
is because I hope it'll
hit home, you know.

00:40:15.138 --> 00:40:17.028
Cool.

00:40:17.028 --> 00:40:17.528
Yup.

00:40:17.528 --> 00:40:19.920
Right there.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.780
AUDIENCE: You worked
for years on Dawn Wall,

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.360
and you finally succeeded--
congrats on that, of course.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.443
TOMMY CALDWELL: Thank you.

00:40:25.443 --> 00:40:27.450
AUDIENCE: But then
Ondra repeated

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.417
relatively soon afterwards--
what was your take on that?

00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:32.500
TOMMY CALDWELL: Yeah, so--

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.791
yeah, for those of you who
don't know, there was this--

00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:38.760
there was this Czech phenom
climber, Adam Ondra, who came,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.750
I guess, about a year or two
years after I finished the Dawn

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.380
Wall, and basically did in a
month what it took me seven

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.910
years to do, which was--

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.530
honestly, I wish it would have
taken him like a year, maybe.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.570
But it was hugely inspiring.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.390
And I think-- he trains
like an Olympian.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:02.370
He's like-- he's got so much
fire, and he's very scientific.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:05.550
And it's like a testament
to where this world can go.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.620
I think, in terms of
difficulty of rock climbing,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.030
there's a vast world.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.710
We only understand
this much about it.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.920
And I'm going to be
the hugest fan of what

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.280
happens in the future, forever.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.821
I'm definitely going to be one
of those old men in the coffee

00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:20.204
shop just talking
about the climbing,

00:41:20.204 --> 00:41:22.620
constantly, because it's so
fun to see that stuff go down.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.370
Cool.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.453
Well, yeah, we'll be hanging
out for a little bit,

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:32.556
but thank you, Sandy and Brady.

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:33.450
SANDY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.210
TOMMY CALDWELL: Yeah, go ahead.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:34.840
No, I'm good.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.500
I'm done, thank you.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.083
SANDY: Thanks.

00:41:36.083 --> 00:41:37.805
Well, I just wanted
to say, like, one,

00:41:37.805 --> 00:41:38.680
thank you for coming.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.674
Thank you to Brady.

00:41:39.674 --> 00:41:42.340
They're both very nice, but it's
a massive team of people that's

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.245
been helping both Tommy, Alex,
Sundar, and the Access Fund,

00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:46.870
and it's just--

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.460
I mean, that's the
mating part about Google,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.230
is that if you have an idea,
you can really push it.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.894
So if you are excited
about something,

00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:54.310
if you want to do something
with them, if you have ideas--

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.985
please come talk to me,
definitely reach out to Brady.

00:41:57.985 --> 00:41:59.860
And huge thanks also,
Wayne, is in the back--

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.080
his whole team were really
instrumental in the Street

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.069
View, and getting Earth
imagery of Yosemite,

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:05.360
that made the project possible.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.400
So thank you.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.230
TOMMY CALDWELL: Oh yeah, and
maybe I'll just add to that.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.021
It's funny-- when I
was up on the Dawn Wall

00:42:10.021 --> 00:42:11.950
and this whole media
thing was going down,

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.370
the Street View team was
kind of like assembling,

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.360
and it just happened to
be the same filmmakers

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.401
that I was up there with.

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:20.270
And so on our rest days, we were
like bringing GoPro's up there,

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.330
and building these bundles,
and taking everything

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.050
out testing them up on the wall.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.430
And this world of--
trying to figure out

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.680
ways to tell these stories
and bring them to the world

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.271
has become a really fun
thing, and yeah, Google's

00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:33.020
been part of that.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.020
And so I came down
from the Dawn Wall.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.825
I went on the Ellen
DeGeneres show.

00:42:36.825 --> 00:42:38.200
I went to LA for
a few days, then

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.630
I came right back to
Yosemite and went back up

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.320
on El Cap to film that
Street View thing that Sandy

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.320
showed in the beginning.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.170
So yeah, like she said, if
there's-- if there's any way

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.690
to integrate climbing
into this Google world,

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.330
it's fun for climbers
to do that so.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.030
TOMMY CALDWELL: Awesome.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.630
Thank you.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.880
Oh, yeah.
