00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.610
We're getting near the end of
lesson one in this course.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.939
And in a normal course, after finishing
lesson one, you would go on and

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.560
watch lesson two.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.740
But we don't have a lesson two.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.420
In fact,
this is the only lesson in the course.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.370
Where you would usually find lessons
you'll instead find a curated library of

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.400
research publications,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.340
media articles, original interviews,
and things to help you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.870
develop your understanding of whatever
topics you're most interested in.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.970
In this course, instead of watching
a series of lessons in some sequential

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.880
order, you'll instead find your way
through this library however you want.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.670
Choose the topics that are most
interesting to you and

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.790
really delve into them.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.500
Read about them.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.010
See if you can find your own sources for
them.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.180
If you have any questions on
what you should go into or

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.420
what you should read about.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.190
Ask your mentor,
ask your classmates, ask me, and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.810
we'll help you guide you
through the course library.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.270
But the goal is that your trajectory in
this course is really determined by you.
