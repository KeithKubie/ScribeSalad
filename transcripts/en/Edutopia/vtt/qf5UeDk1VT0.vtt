00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:02.486
&gt;&gt;Beth: Latta is a very small town.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.146
We have two stop lights.

00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:05.846
It is more family-oriented.

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:07.286
Everybody knows everybody.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:12.666
But as far as anything big,
there's nothing here in Latta.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.796
&gt;&gt;John: The biggest asset we have
is not the church on Main Street,

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.816
it's not the small little
industry on the outskirts of town.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.936
The biggest asset we got in this
community is the school system.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:27.906
We are in a poor, rural district, but
the parents and the community expects us

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:28.856
to do the very best we can.

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:40.486
&gt;&gt;John: We were basically
a pretty traditional school district

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:42.546
in teaching methods and instruction.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.686
What I felt like we were missing was
"Is this really what our students need?"

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.506
We didn't know how to reach
every child in the classroom.

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:54.546
So, I challenged the administration,
"Come up with a program that's going

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.206
to raise the rigor, that's
going to be fair and equitable,

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.826
so every student in that
class is learning.

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:03.606
&gt;Student: "You're a frog," she said.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:04.976
"You wouldn't understand."

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:11.426
&gt;&gt;Dollie: We chose Montessori
because we were looking for a program

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:16.576
that had consistency with reading
instruction as well as math,

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.506
but social-emotional is a
huge part of Montessori.

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:24.776
We're actually providing for the whole
child and not just reading and math,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:26.316
science and social studies.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:30.266
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We're not just teaching them
standards and content, but we're trying

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.996
to teach them how to be a person.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.326
They're learning how to respect others.

00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:36.156
They're learning to take
care of themselves

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.926
and their environment,
not just two plus two.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.186
&gt;&gt;Dollie: The transition was difficult.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.146
I'll be very honest with you.

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.596
&gt;&gt;Dana: And this time,
instead of me mostly doing it,

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:49.976
you're going to do the tens, Maddie.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:53.706
&gt;&gt;Dollie: I've got some
teachers that have been

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:55.226
in traditional for thirty years.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:02:00.866
So, it was very difficult for them to
move over to a completely different way

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.856
of presenting lessons and
setting up your classroom.

00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:07.206
&gt;&gt;Beth: I've been teaching
for seventeen years.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:11.176
This is my first year
teaching Montessori.

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:15.096
The training process lasted
probably about two years.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.216
Traditional was a little bit different,

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:19.456
because I had the whole
class the same age.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:22.996
However, now I have all of
the first year, second year,

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.666
and third graders in one class.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.286
&gt;&gt;Beth: All right.
Let's do that.

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:30.076
&gt;&gt;Beth: The older kids can really serve

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.786
as those role models
for the younger ones.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:33.406
&gt;&gt;Student: That one turned it down.

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:34.906
&gt;&gt;Beth: They're like little
mamas and little daddies,

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:36.506
because they watch out for them.

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:38.806
If they're not doing something,
I have some that'll, you know,

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:40.956
touch the little first grader and
say, "You need to get back to work."

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:45.686
&gt;&gt;Bella: We have been
working on our work plans.

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:49.306
&gt;&gt;Beth: Work plans, to me,
is the toughest part of it.

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:52.056
I still teach pretty much the
same thing to all the students,

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:53.186
but they're at a different pace.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.156
&gt;&gt;Amanda: This is the last ant.

00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:57.176
Can you spell "last" for me?

00:02:57.256 --> 00:03:00.046
&gt;&gt;Amanda: In my opinion, Montessori
is just a different way of learning.

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:03.686
It's more about the individual child
learning what they need to learn.

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:06.336
Some children will work together.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.156
Some like to work individually.

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:12.566
When they need help in any
way, they'll let us know

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:13.936
and we sit down and help them.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.256
&gt;&gt;Beth: The traditional classroom

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:22.246
versus the Montessori
classroom is totally different.

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:26.106
In the Montessori classroom,
students have rugs that they work on.

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:27.936
They have their lesson on that rug.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.906
As they get finished with a lesson, they
can get up, they can move, they can go.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:33.716
&gt;&gt;Amanda: And in division
we always start with our thousand.

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:37.086
&gt;&gt;Amanda: It's really more of a
follow-the-child path that we take.

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.706
&gt;&gt;Amanda: The hardest part about
Montessori education is making sure all

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:45.926
of the standards are
mastered for all grade levels.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.396
We have to teach the same content
as any other public school,

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:52.296
I just think that we go
further than the standards.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.116
the goal of Montessori is
just teaching the whole child.

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:59.696
&gt;&gt;Dollie: Montessori is one of those
situations where you almost have

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.420
to live it before you understand it.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.420
To believe in the program
you have to be a part of it.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.220
&gt;&gt;Dollie: As we shifted from
traditional to Montessori,

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:11.816
I think the biggest impact is

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:15.106
that our children have
become independent thinkers

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:17.796
and very good problem-solvers.

00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:21.386
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We truly get
to know the child.

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:27.166
I watch kids grow from barely
being able to read CBC words,

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.646
to where they're reading novels.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:32.976
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Just seeing the full circle
just come together is really amazing.

00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:41.096
&gt;&gt;John: Montessori is very much in tune
to what's going on in today's world now:

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:44.316
cooperative learning,
helping your peers,

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.496
learning at your own
speed, being challenged.

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:50.166
We're creating kids that want to learn,

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:54.786
but Montessori in itself,
to me, is not the answer.

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:59.246
It's taking advantage of that
enthusiasm, that thirst for learning,

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:03.706
in a great philosophical environment
that lets the child thrive.
