the fact that we now understand how
 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.470
the fact that we now understand how
important it is for caregivers to be

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480
important it is for caregivers to be
 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.560
important it is for caregivers to be
connected and that we now have the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570
connected and that we now have the
 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.990
connected and that we now have the
toolkit necessary to do that a few years

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000
toolkit necessary to do that a few years
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.150
toolkit necessary to do that a few years

exist the ability of information to flow

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279
exist the ability of information to flow
 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.179
exist the ability of information to flow
freely didn't exist and I think right

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189
freely didn't exist and I think right
 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.850
freely didn't exist and I think right
now there's a sense that if you do the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860
now there's a sense that if you do the
 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.900
now there's a sense that if you do the
right job for patients with

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910
right job for patients with
 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.210
right job for patients with
comorbidities you can seriously make

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220
comorbidities you can seriously make
 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.210
comorbidities you can seriously make
their lives better and there's a toolkit

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220
their lives better and there's a toolkit
 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.750
their lives better and there's a toolkit
that exists to do that and I think it's

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760
that exists to do that and I think it's
 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.009
that exists to do that and I think it's
very exciting that the other thing that

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019
very exciting that the other thing that
 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.599
very exciting that the other thing that
I'm really excited about is the fact

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609
I'm really excited about is the fact
 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.250
I'm really excited about is the fact
that medical science is going to get a

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260
that medical science is going to get a
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.540
that medical science is going to get a
lot better with data and we now know

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550
lot better with data and we now know
 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.799
lot better with data and we now know
that patients who had a certain type of

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809
that patients who had a certain type of
 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.810
that patients who had a certain type of
belly fat 25 years ago are more likely

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
belly fat 25 years ago are more likely
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.279
belly fat 25 years ago are more likely
to have Alzheimer's we know that sir

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289
to have Alzheimer's we know that sir
 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.200
to have Alzheimer's we know that sir
cholesterol levels have a long-term

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210
cholesterol levels have a long-term
 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.910
cholesterol levels have a long-term
impact of Alzheimer's we know who their

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
impact of Alzheimer's we know who their
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.439
impact of Alzheimer's we know who their
whole series of things that we now know

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449
whole series of things that we now know
 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.500
whole series of things that we now know
from looking at databases that we could

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510
from looking at databases that we could
 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.070
from looking at databases that we could
not have possibly known before we had

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080
not have possibly known before we had
 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.170
not have possibly known before we had
the longitudinal database and we're

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180
the longitudinal database and we're
 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.120
the longitudinal database and we're
going to be taking DNA and we're going

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130
going to be taking DNA and we're going
 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.040
going to be taking DNA and we're going
to have one of our projects is going to

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050
to have one of our projects is going to
 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.370
to have one of our projects is going to
have DNA on about 500,000 people so it's

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
have DNA on about 500,000 people so it's
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.720
have DNA on about 500,000 people so it's
going to be a huge database we're going

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730
going to be a huge database we're going
 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.210
going to be a huge database we're going
to tie the DNA database to electronic

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
to tie the DNA database to electronic
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700
to tie the DNA database to electronic
medical record and we're going to start

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710
medical record and we're going to start
 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.650
medical record and we're going to start
looking for correlations and we're going

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660
looking for correlations and we're going
 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.820
looking for correlations and we're going
to discover things and we're going to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830
to discover things and we're going to
 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.800
to discover things and we're going to
learn we're going to learn things right

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
learn we're going to learn things right
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.780
learn we're going to learn things right
now that we don't even suspect there's

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
now that we don't even suspect there's
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.920
now that we don't even suspect there's
going to be learning it's going to come

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930
going to be learning it's going to come
 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.600
going to be learning it's going to come
out of that I think it's going to be

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610
out of that I think it's going to be
 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.810
out of that I think it's going to be
extremely powerful and when that happens

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820
extremely powerful and when that happens
 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.610
extremely powerful and when that happens
then we can start focusing optimal care

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620
then we can start focusing optimal care
 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.400
then we can start focusing optimal care
on patients in a very important way so

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410
on patients in a very important way so
 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.690
on patients in a very important way so
that gives me great confidence in and is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
that gives me great confidence in and is
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.730
that gives me great confidence in and is
very exciting and I think we're very

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740
very exciting and I think we're very
 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.170
very exciting and I think we're very
close to a golden age we're very close

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180
close to a golden age we're very close
 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.380
close to a golden age we're very close
to a medical science golden age that is

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
to a medical science golden age that is
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.410
to a medical science golden age that is
only empowered by data most medical

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420
only empowered by data most medical
 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.200
only empowered by data most medical
research projects right now have 200

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
research projects right now have 200
 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.600
research projects right now have 200
patients 300 patients they run for three

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
patients 300 patients they run for three
 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.060
patients 300 patients they run for three
years and they stop if you look at the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
years and they stop if you look at the
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.320
years and they stop if you look at the
kind of medical research that's out

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330
kind of medical research that's out
 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.719
kind of medical research that's out
there it's tiny samples for short

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729
there it's tiny samples for short
 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.670
there it's tiny samples for short
timeframes and we're going to have the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
timeframes and we're going to have the
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.850
timeframes and we're going to have the
ability to do massive samples an

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
ability to do massive samples an
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.309
ability to do massive samples an
extended time frames and figure things

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319
extended time frames and figure things
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.710
extended time frames and figure things
out that you can't figure out without

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
out that you can't figure out without
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.730
out that you can't figure out without
that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740
that
 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.730
that
so that's right
