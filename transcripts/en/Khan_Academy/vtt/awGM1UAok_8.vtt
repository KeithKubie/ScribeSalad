00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:03.556
"According to last week's survey, most

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:07.183
voters were disappointed by legislators'

00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:11.668
inability working together on key issues,

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:13.408
[or] no error. So, the part that feels

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:17.906
fishy to me is, right around here,

00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:20.328
because we are talking about "legislators'

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:25.145
inability [to] work together". Let's read

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:26.580
the whole thing. "According to last week's

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.492
survey, most voters were disappointed by

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:34.992
legislators' inability [to] work together

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.276
on key issues". Right, what are they

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:39.598
complaining about? The "inability [to]

00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:41.359
work together". They are not complaining

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.465
about, "inability working together". That

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:46.269
doesn't even actually make any grammatical

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.977
sense. I don't even know what, "inability

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:50.148
working together" even means. They're

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:52.442
trying to say, "inability to work together

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:55.979
on key issues". So, it is definitely part C,

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.234
right over here, where we have the error.
