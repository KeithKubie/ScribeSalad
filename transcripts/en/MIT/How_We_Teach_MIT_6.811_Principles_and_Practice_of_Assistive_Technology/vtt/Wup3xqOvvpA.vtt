GRACE TEO: In terms of
choosing our clients

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.122
there were a few criteria
that we were looking for.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.080
Other then the fact that
they had a disability,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.510
you had to have
been pretty stable,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.080
so it wasn't going
to be fluctuating

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.130
too much over the semester.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.520
And that is to make the design
constraints a little bit more

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.960
simple for the students.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.730
Apart from a stable
disability, I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.510
think what we loved
about the clients

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.300
this semester is
their motivation

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.670
to educate our students.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.420
Having that intrinsic
quality of being an educator

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.300
was important for us.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.140
They had to be able to
articulate their challenges

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.800
really well for the
students, and be

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.540
able to be patient
with the students,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.080
because they're all learning
through this process.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.830
And they might not
get the design process

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.100
right the first time.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.680
But having clients
that were adventurous,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.320
willing to try out new
things with the students,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290
that was very important.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.770
The third piece was
purely logistical.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.840
So, our students
are going to want

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.200
to interact with their
clients as many times as

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
possible over the semester, so
we made sure that they were all

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.140
accessible from MIT, I
think within a one hour

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.260
radius of MIT.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.370
I think one thing you'll find
in a disability community

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.310
is that once you
talk to one person,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.640
it's such a tight community
that word travels really fast.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.530
So we had a little
bit of a lucky break

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.120
in that we contacted the
Cambridge Commission for People

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.990
with Disabilities,
and Kate Thurman there

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.070
helped us to send out an
email to the entire community

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.470
of people with disabilities.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.580
And then I'm pretty sure we got
about 50 emails, if not more,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.420
from people who were
interested in being clients.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.690
And so we either tried to
talk to them over the phone

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.404
or visit them in person
to get to know them.

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:04.320
WILLIAM LI: I think, to
be very honest though,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.230
in terms of having clients
involved in the class--

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.630
participating in lectures
and some of the labs,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.620
and also certainly being very
much a part of the design

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.490
process-- to be very honest
it's a tricky decision,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.910
and something that we decided
to try this year sort of to see

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.760
what would happen.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.730
I think a big part
of it is really

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.800
the user-centered or
participatory design

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.646
nature of the class
that we really

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.870
want students to understand
the person that they're

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.520
working with.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.070
Understand their challenges, and
realities, in all the contexts

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.800
that they're in, in
their home, or when

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.060
they're out in Boston,
or even at MIT as well.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.270
So I think one big part of it
was to really give students

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.620
the opportunity to interact
more with their clients,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.550
and really get their feedback
quickly, and work on the design

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.350
process together.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.840
I think the other
part is we really

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.610
tried to see our
clients as collaborators

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.720
with the students.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.000
As Grace mentioned,
really, I think

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.830
clients are most attuned
to their own needs,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.960
and their own ideas.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.150
Or their own needs in terms
of what assistive technologies

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.520
might be useful.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.530
So they really are
able to give kind

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.170
of the best possible feedback.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.270
So having them [? embedded, ?]
or participating in the class,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.072
I think was really important
and really a valuable experiment

00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:55.971
or experience to try.

00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:57.470
GRACE TEO: William
is exactly right.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.950
It was an experiment this year.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.250
We had lab assistants
in the class this year

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.540
who were students last
year, and they did not

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.210
have clients in their class.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.470
And when we first
made a decision

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.400
to say OK, clients
can be in our class,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.360
and our lab assistants
saw how that was going,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.880
they raised quite
a few concerns.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.404
By the end of the
day we said, you

00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:23.280
know what, our
students just need

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.704
to learn how to negotiate
these situations.

00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:27.120
It's part of the
learning process.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.790
It's an important thing
to be able to work around

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.750
these kinds of situations.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.520
And that's fine.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.570
The other thing
that I don't like

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.170
is when we talk
about disability,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.820
or we teach students how
to talk about disability,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.130
as if people with
disabilities are

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.210
this outside group
that we are kind

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.085
of observing from the inside.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.360
I think it's a much more
inclusive way of teaching

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.980
if we can bring in
people with disabilities

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.620
to talk about their own
experiences with the students.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.792
Instead of us just
showing slides and saying,

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.250
these are the terms
that you should

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.040
use when you're talking to
people with disabilities.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.450
It means so much more
coming from the people

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.460
with disabilities themselves.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.260
In terms of how we set up
the students and the clients

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.970
and coordinated that
interaction-- so let

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.710
me start right
from the beginning.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.210
We meet with the clients.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.670
Once we know we've
selected them,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.147
I believe we selected
about 15 clients

00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:34.230
at the start of the class.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.150
And we told them,
there is a potential

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.100
that you will get to work
with students this semester,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.505
and this is the
expectation, that you

00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:45.400
are able to give two to
three hours each week

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.920
to meet with our students
from this date to this date.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.460
Then we went to our
students and gave them

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.800
a whole list of the clients.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.190
And we didn't
describe the clients

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.630
in too much detail other than
some potential challenges

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.550
that they had that students
might want to work on.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.220
Then we let the students
decide for themselves

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.120
which clients they were
interested in working with.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.440
Based on their skill sets,
and based on their interests,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.830
we meshed up students
with the clients.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.690
And so at the end
of it, we actually

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.870
only had 11 student teams and
so 11 clients that were matched.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.270
So we had to tell the remaining
four clients, I'm sorry,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.200
you were not matched
for this semester,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.220
but we really appreciate
your availability.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.410
So right after we finished
that matching, we basically

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.230
sent an email to the clients and
the students, introduced them,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.730
told them this is how you
can contact each other.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.260
And then for the very
first client meeting

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.750
for the students, their mentors
went along with the students

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.540
to just make sure the
interaction went well.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.280
Something that Seth,
Professor Teller, established

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.820
in the class probably
from the first year or so,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.170
was the student client contract,
where the student will say,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.510
we are going to work with
you as well as we can,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.690
these are the expectations
that you can hold us to.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.800
And then the clients
also have expectations

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.490
that the students
can hold them to,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.150
and they both sign off for that.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.620
And it's just a
way of facilitating

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.390
that initial interaction
so that both sides are

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.840
able to talk about what
they will be able to do,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.900
and what they won't
be able to do.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.730
And managing those
expectations is a huge part

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.250
of any kind of relationship.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.510
WILLIAM LI: Yeah, this
contract, and really setting

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.010
the expectations.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.360
Setting the stage for
students to succeed,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.720
and clients to really understand
what the process is about

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.470
and how they can be most
valuable to the students

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.520
in terms of giving feedback
and sharing their ideas openly,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.470
and really knowing
that they're kind

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.840
of an equal partner in the
team's project is really key.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.260
I think Grace did
a lot of great work

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.900
this year in terms
of the curation part.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.080
We had a chance to talk to
a lot of potential clients,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.100
and really figure
out what would be

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.200
the best match for the
expected makeup of students

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.800
in our class.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.590
As grace mentioned,
clients who are

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.679
adventurous, and
interested in learning,

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.770
and interested in
teaching, and open minded,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.309
have some assistive
technology idea in mind.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:47.200
I think this is a big part, the
front part of the class that

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200
can be really valuable
to help set it up

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.890
for success for the semester.
