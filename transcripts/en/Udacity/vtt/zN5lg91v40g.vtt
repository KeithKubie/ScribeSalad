00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's now consider static power, which is what

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.990
prevents us from lowering the voltage too much.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.380
Our transistors are really like electronic faucets. Water

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.500
comes here, and if the valve is open,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.410
water will flow out. If the valve is closed, no water. But in a transistor it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.630
like this valve is controlled by water pressure

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.470
from another faucet. So if the power supply

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.770
voltage is dropped, there is less pressure when the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.920
faucet is closed and as a result, because there is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.845
water pressure here and the valve is not closed

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:38.230
very well. There will be some leakage of water, because

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.300
the faucet is not totally closed. So, one component

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.530
of static power is this leakage. So the problem is

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.160
that, as we lower the voltage, this leakage goes

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
up. So we reduce dynamic power by lowering the voltage.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.716
But that increases the static power. If we

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:56.340
have already lowered this voltage by a lot, then

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.092
the pressure on this valve here is relatively wimpy

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.040
already. If we still lower the voltage further, what's

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.624
going to happen is we're going to get a much

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.250
larger stream of leakage here. So if we draw

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.010
the voltage on the horizontal axis and the power

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.206
on the vertical axis, what we get is when

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:19.496
the voltage is very high our dynamic power

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.786
is also very high, but it drops quickly as

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:25.990
we lower the voltage. So this is our

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.740
dynamic power. However, our leakage power is very low

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.360
when the voltage is high. And it grows

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.330
up very, very quickly because of the increase in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.550
leakage as the voltage is dropped. So our total

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.600
power does something like this. There is a voltage

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.620
at which the overall power is lowest. If you

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.750
increase the voltage further, you're spending too much dynamic power,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.890
so the overall power goes up and you're not

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.694
reducing the static power by much anymore. Whereas, if you

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:56.400
go much further down from this voltage, then the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.560
static power becomes very large. And you are no longer

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.670
reducing the dynamic power to compensate enough for it.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.600
So this is why modern processors cannot just arbitrarily lower

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.870
the voltage to decrease the dynamic power. And also

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.060
why they are starting to have problems with static

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.280
power because we have already lowered voltage to the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.970
point where the static power becomes an issue. Also

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.130
note that the leakage through the transistor like this

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.260
is not the only source of leakage that results

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.250
in static power consumption. Because the transistors are very

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.800
small they're acting as faucets who's valves are now

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.540
leaky too simply. Some water is coming through

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.700
here. Some of the water that is building up

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.930
the pressure is also leaking out and so on.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.050
So there are multiple other sources for why the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.070
static power exists. But to understand the relationship

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.486
between static and dynamic power, it's efficient to understand

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.597
that, for example, for voltage, dynamic power and static

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:57.037
power are trying to pull the voltage in opposite

00:02:57.037 --> 00:03:00.010
direction, and the optimum is somewhere in between.
