00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.320
You're probably pretty familiar
at this point with

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.360
how to solve two equations
and two unknowns.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.910
Let's say we had the equation
2x, I don't know, minus y is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.740
equal to 10.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.270
And let's say you had x
plus 3y is equal to 5.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.130
And there are a lot of different
ways to solve it.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.210
And visually, the representation
we use in our

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.260
heads, is that this represents
a line, and this

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.320
represents a line.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.300
And if they're not parallel to
each other, they're going to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.280
intersect at a unique point.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
And that unique point will
be the solution.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.670
That unique x and y will be
the point where these two

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.570
lines intersect.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.230
And so one way that we can solve
these is we can multiply

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.550
either of these equations
by scalars, by numbers.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.570
And we have to multiply both
sides of the equation, and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.370
then add them to the
other equation.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.280
So what we could do, and we do
it in such a way is that we

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.100
eliminate variables.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.420
So for example, let's
say we wanted to get

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.680
rid of the y term.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.655
So we could take this equation
and then add it to what?

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.340
So we have a 3y here.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.650
So then if we made this into a
minus 3y, when you add the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.910
two, you would get 0.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.160
The y's would eliminate.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.280
Let me do it this way.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.990
If you multiply this top
equation by 3, you get 6x

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.570
minus 3y is equal to 30.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.270
Multiply both sides by 3.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.710
And the bottom equation we're
keeping the same.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.570
x plus 3y is equal to 5.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510
And then you just add the two.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.830
So 7x.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.660
That's a 0, is equal to 35.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.800
I picked these numbers at
random, but it seems that they

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.950
actually work out.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.540
So we get x is equal to 5.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.710
And then you could go back, and
you take this, and you can

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100
substitute it back into either
one of these equations.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.200
So you would have-- let's
do the first one.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.229
2 times 5 minus y
is equal to 10.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.110
10 minus y is equal to 10.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.800
y would be equal to 10, right?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.670
10 minus 0 is 10.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.190
And it's true here in this
equation as well.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.090
So that's how you solve two
equations of two unknowns.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.820
So how do you do it with
three equations?

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.190
So I have here-- let
me write it down.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.800
I designed this equation, so
it's actually reasonably

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.595
straightforward to solve.

00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:44.620
You have minus x plus 2y
minus z is equal to 9.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:57.630
I have 3x minus 7y minus 2z
is equal to minus 20.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:08.740
And I have 2x plus 2y plus
z is equal to 2.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.250
Now first of all, what's the
visual representation of this?

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.000
And if you watched the intuition
when I talked about

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.850
the video on the intuition of a
three variable integration,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.090
you know that each of these
represent a plane in three

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.040
dimensions.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.410
And so, if you're trying to
figure out what x, y, and z

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.320
satisfy all three of these
equations, you're essentially

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.800
saying, what point in
three-dimensional space exists

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.350
on all three of these planes?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.080
And that point is essentially
the intersection of these

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.700
three planes.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.800
And that's very hard to draw,
so I won't do it now.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.170
But you might want to watch
that visual intuition--

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.380
intuition video that I did.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.740
But anyway, let's go to
actually solving it.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.140
So solving three equations and
three unknowns, you actually

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.580
do the same thing as
you did with two

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.550
equations and two unknowns.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.150
It's just a lot messier.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.870
And it's just a little bit more
confusing in terms of

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.500
which variable do you need
to eliminate, and when.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.650
And because of that, it's very,
very, very important to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.560
be systematic about it.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.730
So the way I like to do it is,
I like to-- and this is

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.340
actually called Gaussian
elimination, or Gauss-Jordan

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.640
elimination, and it's done a
little bit more formally in

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.170
linear algebra.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.440
But essentially, I like to
eliminate the two x's in these

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.820
two equations, and then
I like to eliminate

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.530
this y in this equation.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.950
So all you're left
with is a z here.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.620
And then you'd have z
equals something.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.580
Then you can substitute into
this equation, then you can

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.550
substitute for y.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.700
And then you could substitute
the y and the z back to this

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.150
equation, and solve for x.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.940
So let's do that.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.790
I know that sounds a little
daunting, but I think if we

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.600
actually do the problem, it'll
be a little bit more

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.490
straightforward.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.230
So before we break into the
mechanics, I want to show you

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.860
something else.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.680
And this is-- depending when
you're doing this, your

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.230
teacher might be upset or
impressed that you do this--

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.980
but this is just an easier
way to save time.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.980
It's to write an augmented
matrix that represents these

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.400
three equations of
three unknowns.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.070
And what do I mean by that?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.985
We're going to be rewriting
these over and over again.

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:19.590
And instead of writing an x, a
y, a z, and the equal sign

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.470
every time, let's just write
the numbers that matter.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.800
So we can represent this as-- So
minus x, we could say this

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.690
is minus 1, 2, minus 1.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.370
And this is called an
augmented matrix.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.470
Because we'll put a 9 here.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.660
So this just says, minus x plus
2y minus z is equal to 9.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:48.680
And then we say 3x minus 7y
minus 2z is equal to minus 20.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.720
I'm not doing anything here.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.100
I'm just rewriting it in a form
that has a little bit

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.150
less letters in it.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.400
And then the last equation
is 2x plus 2y plus

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.860
z is equal to 2.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.020
So the first thing I said that
wanted to do, is I wanted to

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.910
eliminate these two
x terms. Right?

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.000
Remember, these just correspond
to these two terms.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.560
So how do I do that?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.900
Well I'm going to keep the top
equation the same, minus x,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.910
plus 2y minus z is equal
to positive 9.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.160
That's just that equation.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.670
And remember, you could
write it out.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.050
You could rewrite these with
x's and y's all the time.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.870
I'm just doing this for a little
bit of simplicity.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.050
And your teacher actually
might do it this way.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.010
So that's more useful.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.430
And I like to do it this way.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.910
So how can we eliminate this 3x
here, or this 3 right here?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.470
Well what if we took this
equation, and added it to 3

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.830
times this equation?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.370
Or another way, we substituted
this equation with this

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.360
equation, plus 3 times
this equation.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.250
So what happens?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.910
So we take each of these terms,
and add to it 3 times

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.040
each of these terms. So 3x plus
3 times minus x, that is

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.356
equal to 0.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.840
Right?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.550
I'm just multiplying this top
equation by 3, and adding it

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.830
to this equation.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.130
So minus 3x plus 3x-- Let me
actually do it one time, just

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.030
so you see what I'm doing.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.660
I just multiplied this
top equation by 3.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:41.980
So you get minus 3x plus 6y
minus 3z is equal to 27.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.050
And I'm adding that to this.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.080
So minus 3x plus 3x is 0.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.350
6y minus 7y is equal
to minus y.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:06.650
And then minus 3z plus minus
2z is equal to minus 5z.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.030
This is very computationally
intensive, you can tell.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.340
And then 27 plus minus 20,
that's just equal to 7.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.640
I'm going to dwell on this step
a little bit, because I

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.900
really want you to understand
what I'm doing.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.480
Because if you understood what
I just did in this step,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.420
you'll understand the rest
of this video, frankly.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.670
So I just replaced this
equation-- which is the same

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.780
thing as this equation--
with this equation

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.059
plus 3 times this.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.260
So I said, 3 plus 3 times
negative 3 is 0.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.140
Minus 7 plus 3 times
2 is minus 1.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.950
Minus 2 plus 3 times
minus 1 is minus 5.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.610
Minus 20 plus 3 times 9 is 7.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.860
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.190
So now, let's do the
same thing here.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.350
Let's try to eliminate
this 2x.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.300
So if you want to eliminate this
2x, we could take this

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.220
equation and add to it 2
times this equation.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.830
So what will happen?

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.040
We'll have 2 plus
2 times minus 1.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.910
That's 0.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.740
2 plus 2 times 2.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.800
Well that's 6.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.040
And then we have 1 plus
2 times minus 1.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.020
Well that's minus 1.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.710
Right?

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.360
2 times minus 1 is minus 2.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.970
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.300
And then 2 plus 2 times 9.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.520
So that's 2 plus 18.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.190
So that's 20.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.310
And once again, we could
rewrite this

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.160
equation right here.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.290
This middle equation right
here is the same thing as

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.000
minus y minus 5z
is equal to 7.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.070
Just so you remember, this is
just another representation of

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.210
these actual linear equations.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.890
I just don't feel like writing
the x's, y's, and z's and the

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.750
equal signs.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.010
But anyway, now let's see
if we can eliminate

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.530
this term down here.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.810
So how could we do that?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.970
Well we could add this equation,
we could substitute

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.770
this equation with this equation
plus 6 times this

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.170
one, right?

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.780
Because if you have this plus
6 times this, you'd

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.050
have 6 minus 6.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.670
And you'd get a 0 here.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.860
So let's do that.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.050
Let's write the augmented
matrix.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.430
We're not changing
the top line.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:25.135
So we get minus 1x plus 2y
minus z is equal to 9.

00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:27.690
We're actually not even changing
this equation.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:36.210
So we're getting 0x minus y
minus 5z is equal to 7.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.580
And now we're replacing this
with this plus 6 times this.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.590
So the 0 plus 6 times 0 is 0.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.930
6 plus 6 times minus 1.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.190
That's 6 minus 6.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.770
That's 0.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:57.110
Minus 1 plus 6 times minus 5.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.220
That's minus 1 minus 30.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.530
So it's minus 31.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.510
And then we have 20
plus 6 times 7.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.200
So that's 6 times 7 is 42.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.420
So that's 62.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.640
Now we're actually almost
done solving.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.390
What can we do here?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.400
So I just want to make sure you
understand our position.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.460
What is this last equation?

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.830
This 0, 0, minus 31, line 62?

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:31.170
Well, this last equation is just
minus 31z is equal to 62.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.230
And so we can divide both sides
of this equation by

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.850
minus 31, and we'd get z
is equal to minus 2.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.680
But if we were to do that using
our augmented matrix

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.540
notation, we would just say,
well let's just divide both

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.050
sides of this bottom equation
by minus 31.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:56.120
And we would get minus
1, 2, minus 1, 9, 0,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.810
minus 1, minus 5, 7.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.640
So we're dividing this
one by minus 31.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.036
So it's 0, 0, 1, minus 2.

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:09.560
And there you have it.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.450
So we have at least
solved for z.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:12.810
Right?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.910
This equation is the same thing
as this one. z is equal

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.570
to minus 2.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.760
Now at this point, what we
have just done using this

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.490
augmented matrix, this is called
Gaussian elimination.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.260
Now we can continue this.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.650
And we can eliminate
this term, this

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:27.090
term, and this term.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.600
And it would be called
Gauss-Jordan elimination.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.690
Or, we could use the fact that
z is equal to minus 2.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.330
And then we could substitute
back into this equation to

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.480
solve for y.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.900
And then we'd have our
values for y and z.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.600
And we could substitute back
into this equation.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.960
Let's do it that way,
just for kicks.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.830
So this is called upper
row echelon form.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.970
I always forget the terminology,
but let's keep

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.010
this equation in mind.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.610
And let me erase all of
this, so we have some

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.350
room to work with.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.930
I can't do anything without
some room to work with.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.685
Let me even erase
this up here.

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.310
And as you can tell,
this is very

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.580
computationally intensive.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.650
And it's not my cup of tea.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.375
It's not what I would
want to do if I had

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.880
the weekend to myself.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.950
But anyway, let me write these
equations in kind of this

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.140
format, so we can kind of go
back to our traditional world.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.640
So this equation right
here, this is

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.860
actually the same equation.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.040
We never changed it.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.890
Minus x plus 2y minus
z is equal to 9.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:40.440
This equation is minus y
minus 5z is equal to 7.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.600
And then this equation is
z is equal to minus 2.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.270
So we solved for z.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.250
This equation essentially
solves for z.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.250
And now we can substitute
back into this one.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:59.350
So we have minus y minus 5 times
z, which is minus 2, is

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.840
equal to 7.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.880
So minus y plus 10
is equal to 7.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.290
Minus y is equal to minus 3.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.810
y is equal to 3.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:12.420
There we have it.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.290
We solved for z and y.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.120
And now we could substitute
the y, the z into this top

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.630
equation, and solve for x.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.400
So what do we have?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.730
And then we're done.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.460
Let's see.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:32.310
Minus x plus 2 times y, so 2
times 3, minus z-- minus minus

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.690
2, that's z-- is equal to 9.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:44.190
So minus x plus 6 plus
4 is equal to 9.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.010
Mine x plus 10 is equal to 9.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.630
Minus x is equal to minus
1, or x is equal to 1.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.080
So the solution-- oh my God.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.230
My phone is ringing.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.190
So many people calling me.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.140
I think it's my wife.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.980
She might be downstairs.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.140
We're supposed to go eat out.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.140
But anyway, let me
just finish this.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.080
So the solution to this 3 by 3
equation is the point x is

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.400
equal to 1, y is equal to 3,
and z is equal to minus 2.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.750
And that's the unique point in
three-dimensional space that

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.010
lies on all three
of these planes.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.410
Or the unique point where these
three planes intersect.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.720
Anyway, I hope you got that.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.420
And it's time for me to go
have dinner with my wife.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.980
See you soon.
