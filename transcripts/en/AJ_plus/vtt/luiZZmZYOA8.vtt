00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.100
There are millions of people in this country who can’t vote because they live in a United States territory.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.240
"In the U.S. Constitution, if you're a U.S. citizen,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.600
you can vote for president.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.360
We have no voting rights in U.S. federal elections."

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.500
A territory is not a state.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
They’re controlled by the U.S. federal government.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520
But the people living in these territories

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.680
don’t have the same rights as those living in the 50 states.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.140
For example, thousands of them have served in the U.S. military.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.420
But they can’t even vote for president.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.460
There are currently 4 million people in this situation.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.920
They live in the American territories of Guam,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.940
Puerto Rico, American Samoa,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.120
the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.160
And this doesn’t include the many uninhabited islands

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
that the U.S. controls.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.740
Hey guys, I’m Jun,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.220
and this Sunday we’re gonna talk about U.S. territories,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.520
where they are, what rights they have

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.420
and what rights they don’t have.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.170
If you didn’t know that people from most territories are citizens,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.120
you’re not alone.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.200
Only about half of Americans are aware that Puerto Ricans are also Americans.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.800
So we’re going to start with this island first.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.360
Puerto Rico is the largest territory

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
and was acquired by the U.S. after the Spanish-American War.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.400
Puerto Ricans have been citizens for over 100 years.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.060
Their status came to the rest of the country’s attention after Hurricane Maria

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.680
devastated the island in 2017.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.600
Puerto Ricans are American citizens.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.340
But when it came to aid after the storm,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.600
many felt like they were treated differently.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.280
Here's the mayor of San Juan in Puerto Rico pleading for help.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.180
“If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying.”

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.440
President Trump’s response to that plea?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.580
“They want everything done for them.”

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.600
The reason Puerto Ricans were pleading so desperately for help is because the situation was so dire.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.580
It’s estimated that over 4,000 people died as a result of the storm.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.360
10 months after Maria, a thousand people were still without power,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.160
and thousands were homeless.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.040
Taxation was another big topic of conversation – and misinformation – after Maria.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320
Puerto Rico does not pay federal income taxes,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.820
because it has its own system of self-governance.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.360
But it does pay, and so do the other territories, other federal taxes including Social Security and Medicare.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.060
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also pay federal unemployment taxes.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.097
The political limbo of Puerto Rico and the other territories creates a very one-sided relationship

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.520
with the rest of the U.S.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.420
Puerto Rico has voted on statehood numerous times,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.900
most recently right before Maria.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.520
And although voter turnout was low,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.960
97% of those who showed up at the polls voted in favor of making it the 51st state.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.960
But the result of their vote can’t change Puerto Rico’s status.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.140
It’s ultimately up to voting members of Congress to determine the island's

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.720
and the other territories’ political fate.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.320
"Most members of Congress,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.140
they couldn't find Guam on a map,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.620
and they don't want to,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.360
because it's completely off their radar."

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.580
In the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.600
the situation is similar.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.860
“About 70% of the territory’s 107,000 residents are still without power

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.640
more than a month after the storm made landfall.”

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.480
“I have no power in my own home.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.440
And those of you in Florida and in Texas and in other places would not stand for that.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.340
But you expect us to stand for it.”

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.720
These small islands

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.100
were also hit hard by Hurricane Maria

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.440
and the devastating Hurricane Irma that hit right before.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.840
They were both category 5 hurricanes –

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.120
though the impact on the U.S. Virgin Islands has gotten much less news coverage.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.200
That could be because their total population is fairly small,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.980
just over 100,000.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.200
The U.S. Virgin Islands were bought from Denmark in 1917 for strategic military purposes.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.160
Though they’ve had over 90 years of citizenship,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.340
they are still only a non-voting member of Congress.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.080
That representative you heard from, Stacey Plaskett,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.800
she’s using every opportunity to remind politicians

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.640
in Washington about the millions of people in the territories who have had their rights denied.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.860
“Once again, the people who have no vote on this floor, the people who have no say in this country –

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.820
although they are U.S. citizens –

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.760
are going to be left out.”

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.940
Next we’re going to talk about American Samoa,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.320
over 7,000 miles away from the U.S. Virgin Islands.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.860
The people here are born on U.S. soil.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.500
They can freely visit and live in the rest of the United States.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.560
But their situation is a little different.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.560
They’re U.S. nationals, not citizens.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.660
"American Samoa is home to a great many veterans,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.860
especially on a per capita basis,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.860
as our people enlist at high rates in the U.S. armed forces."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880
Even if they move to one of the states,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.740
they can’t vote, they can’t run for office

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.220
and are prohibited from certain jobs.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.220
They really are the most disenfranchised of the territories.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.300
Now, the first U.S. Navy presence was established here over a hundred years ago.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.120
Though the Navy governed the island for decades,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.480
it wasn’t until 1978 that American Samoa was granted a congressional representative,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.400
and that representative wasn’t actually sent to Congress until 1981.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.020
But remember, that person can’t vote.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.320
There’s also a debate happening on the island right now over citizenship.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.920
Some fear that becoming fully American will mean giving up certain land rights for indigenous people,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.280
opening up a traditional practice of land ownership to discrimination lawsuits.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.040
But others argue that since they’re born on U.S. soil,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.700
they should be able to have full voting rights.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.800
These claims were denied by a court in 2015,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.840
citing the racially motivated “Insular Cases.”

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.660
These cases established the rights of U.S. territories over a hundred years ago,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.100
describing the people in the territories as 
“uncivilized,” "non-white," “alien races.”

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.080
And then there’s Guam.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.440
We just did a whole series where we traveled to the island.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.800
And you can check out the link in the comments.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.940
It’s estimated that one in eight adults on the island of Guam are veterans.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.580
That’s one of the highest enlistment rates per capita in the country.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.860
But those that serve and come back to Guam

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.300
still can’t vote for their commander-in-chief, the United States president.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.860
They also have issues accessing medical care, and fly thousands of miles to Hawaii for services.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.600
“All we’re asking is the same treatment that any veteran is getting east of Guam,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.200
you know, any veterans getting treatment in the mainland, in Hawaii.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.720
And we just want the same treatment.”

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.180
This burden is also experienced by veterans in American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.100
The people of Guam have a long history of military service, but also fighting for self-determination.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.920
The first efforts at self-governance date back to 1901,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.180
soon after Guam became a territory of the United States.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.140
This fight eventually led to citizenship in 1950.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.480
Now, 70 years later and with only limited rights,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.800
there’s an independence movement picking this fight back up.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.300
If you want to learn more about that movement, watch part 2 of our series.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.080
Now let’s talk about the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.660
There are 14 islands in this territory, also called the CNMI.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.700
The majority of people live on three of these islands.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.840
One of these islands, Tinian, is where the Enola Gay took off before it dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.480
Originally, language and culture connected Guam and the CNMI.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.960
But since 1898, Guam has been politically separate.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.100
In 1983, the CNMI made a deal with the U.S. for citizenship.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:15.860
In exchange, the U.S. military got a 50-year lease for a small, uninhabited island to practice dropping bombs.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.640
The lease cost less than $21,000.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.380
Now the U.S. military plans to use other islands for bombing and military training sites

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.160
that will be part of a military buildup in the region,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.480
which includes moving 5,000 troops from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.840
Authorities and residents in the Northern Marianas oppose this plan.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.600
They’re concerned about the impacts of the bombing on their native land,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.740
the environment and the local tourism industry.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.540
The NGO Earthjustice and other community groups have filed a lawsuit.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.160
"Essentially, we're all in the same boat.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.440
We're reliant upon U.S. Congress to determine our rights.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.080
We don't have a vote there,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.300
so we don't have bargaining power.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.560
Anything they do that applies to us,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.920
it's just hit-and-miss."

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.500
This history of U.S. territories is one that's rarely taught in schools.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.620
But there’s a lot at stake for the people in the territories who are treated like second-class citizens,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.260
whether it’s veterans who have served in the U.S. military

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.740
or people trying to rebuild after losing everything.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.880
People who live in U.S. territories are born and raised on U.S. soil.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.340
So shouldn’t they have the same rights as everyone else?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.060
Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the video.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.120
If you think other people should know about the second-class status of people in U.S. territories,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.340
please share this video, and let us know what you think.
