00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:03.054
- [Instructor] Luiza runs
a lawn-mowing business.

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:05.137
She decides to measure the rate

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:08.137
at which the volume of fuel she uses

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:12.816
increases with the area of the lawn.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.598
What would be an appropriate
unit for Luiza's purpose?

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:21.804
So let me reread this to
make sure I understand it.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.689
She decides to measure.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.389
She's gonna measure the rate

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:29.389
at which the volume of fuel she uses

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:34.456
increases with the area of the lawn.

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:39.459
So her unit should be something
that says volume per area.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.560
She wants to see how her
volume of fuel increases

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.153
with the area of the lawn.

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:50.320
So it should be volume per
area, should be her rate.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.051
So let's think about which of these units

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.051
give us volume per area.

00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:01.088
So liters right over here,
that is definitely volume

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.931
but this right over here
isn't area, this is distance.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.304
If it said square kilometers
or kilometers squared

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:08.577
then we'd be in business.

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:10.413
So we could rule this one out.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:11.844
Centimeters per kilometer.

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:15.691
Well, this is a distance per
distance, not a volume per area

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.066
so we can rule that out.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.022
Centimeters per square kilometers.

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:22.507
Well, this is a distance per area

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:25.004
or distance per distance squared

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:28.365
but that is not volume per area.

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:30.454
So let's rule that one out.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:32.577
Now, liters per kilometer squared.

00:01:32.577 --> 00:01:34.051
This one's looking good.

00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:36.218
This is a volume in liters

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.069
and this right over here is an area

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.033
and this isn't the only
one that would have worked

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:43.329
but this is out of the choices,

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.914
this is the only one that works.

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:47.572
If they gave, if it was something like

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:51.655
a pint per foot squared
or a pint per square foot

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:57.228
or even if it was meter
cubed per kilometers squared,

00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:02.186
that would have also been volume per area

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.851
but this is the best choice of these.

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.351
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:19.501
Snow is piling outside Cameron's house.

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:24.281
He decides to measure the
rate at which the height,

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:27.864
the height of the pile
increases over time.

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:31.967
What would be an appropriate
unit for Cameron's purposes?

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:33.082
And like always, pause the video

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.485
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:38.794
So the rate at which
height increases over time.

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:41.729
So it should be a height per time

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.224
or really I should say a distance per time

00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:46.124
is what the height is going to be doing,

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.864
the rate at which the height
is changing over time.

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:53.400
It should be a distance or
maybe even better, a length.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.150
Length per unit time.

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.604
So let's see, this is hours per meter.

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:02.980
So this is time per length.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.982
This is the reciprocal of that.

00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:09.065
This one right over here,
this is time per length

00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:14.858
as opposed to length per time
so I would rule that one out.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:15.839
Liters per minute.

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.134
This is a volume per unit time,

00:03:18.134 --> 00:03:19.279
not a length per unit of time.

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.548
Rule that one out.

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:22.524
Minutes per liter.

00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:24.742
This is a time per volume.

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:26.675
Well, we don't wanna do a time per volume.

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.636
We want a length per time.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:33.020
Meters, that's a length per time, hour.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.911
That one works.

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.244
Meters per hour.

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:38.078
This is a length

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.585
and that is a time.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:44.798
And it's good to always go
back to the original context.

00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:45.798
He decides to measure the rate

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:48.616
at which the height of the
pile increases over time.

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:49.449
So if someone said, hey,

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.528
that height of that pile
is increasing five meters.

00:03:52.528 --> 00:03:54.275
Well, that would be too much for snow

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.396
but let's say it's increasing
half a meter per hour

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.240
which even that would be quite fast

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.631
but half a meter per hour.

00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:02.696
That makes sense in your brain.

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:05.644
Hey, every hour I'm gonna get
half a meter more of snow.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:07.732
If someone were to tell you,

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:11.899
hey, the snow outside is
increasing at a rate of five hours,

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.330
is increasing at a rate of
say five liters per minute,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.844
well, that right there,

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:22.121
that could be maybe the volume of snow

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.256
maybe over your entire lawn or something

00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:28.109
but that would not be giving
you the height per time.

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:31.137
Height per time would
be the length per time.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.470
Right over here.
