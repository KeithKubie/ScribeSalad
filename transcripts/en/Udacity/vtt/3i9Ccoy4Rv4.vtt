00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.640
Well I mean I hope you run faster than the bear at least.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; Well I hope so too, but to survive

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.260
you only have to run faster than the slowest person

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.340
there. The slowest person is the one that's going to

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.100
get caught and eaten, and everyone else is going to survive.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt; So you don't have to be the fastest person in the group.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.130
&gt;&gt; Right. Directed selection is not about survival

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.280
of the fittest, but survival of the fit enough.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.030
So the mutations that cause you to run faster

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.390
aren't necessarily trying to make you the fastest person,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.710
just not the slowest.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.380
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
