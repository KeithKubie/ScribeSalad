00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look more at what we got from dir(s).

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We can see that the first part of it all these parts up to here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
All these methods start with two underscores. We have names like <u>None</u>.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These also known as special method names or more co-locally known as magic methods

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the reason they're magic is that they can be used in special ways.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
For example, the _eq method, well that's the one that's used when we have a double equal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Another interesting one is the _str method.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is what happens when we print s, it's actually turning that into str of s,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and str uses this method.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, for this quiz, your goal is to find the set method

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that will provide the desired behavior that we specified for union.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, if we do a.. method passing in b, that would mutate a to be the union of a and b.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We haven't told you what that method is yet but you should be able to figure it out yourself

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
using experiments as well as the documentation if necessary.
