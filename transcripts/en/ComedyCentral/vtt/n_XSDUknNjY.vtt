The BBC series
<i>Natural World</i> filmed a segment

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.705
where Kangaroo Dundee--
no relation--

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.875
fed a wombat an ear of corn,

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.244
which is now my new favorite
euphemism for sex.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.846
Unfortunately, Pete the wombat
was not on board.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.314
So, comedians,
how does he react?

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.383
He screams like
a death metal singer,

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.552
he chomps into
the handsome man's nose,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.088
or he rips a fart?
Uh, Mark.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.458
A-- Screams like
a death metal singer.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:28.128
Well, I guess that could be an
interpretation of what happens.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.630
Let's take a listen.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.166
Um, want some?
Want a treat?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.402
-(wombat passes wind)
-Oh! -(laughter)

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.204
Wasn't me.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:42.309
-(applause and cheering)
-(wombat passes wind)

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.778
-He farts just like us!
-HARDWICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.780
That could pass
for a human fart.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.148
They... they fart...

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.850
MARON:
But now he's gonna be

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.952
-the farting wombat, like Grumpy
Cat. -HARDWICK: He's gonna...

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.087
It's like,
it's the farting wombat.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.255
Gonna be a billionaire.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.294
A Internet star is born!

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.495
You know, you guessed wrong,

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.896
but I'm still gonna give you
100 points

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.996
for the predicting the next big
Internet meme, Marc Maron.
