[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.755
I really love the
Imaginary Foundation.

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.430
The Imaginary Foundation
is a think tank,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.450
a clandestine, mysterious
think tank in Switzerland

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.190
that has created
apparel as a conduit

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.560
to spread the power
of human imagination.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.480
Now, what's most amazing
about the Imaginary Foundation

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.620
is the mesmegasmic, psychotropic
dimension of its imagery.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.430
The places that
the images convey,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310
the places that
they induce inside

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.250
of the viewer, the cosmic
wink that reverberates

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.176
in your very being when you
consume the imagery just,

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.360
to me, is astonishing.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.320
Wherever that place is that the
artist behind that is privy to,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.670
thank you for sharing a
twinkle of that reverence

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.293
with the rest of us.

00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:16.422
Here's to the director of
the The Imaginary Foundation.
