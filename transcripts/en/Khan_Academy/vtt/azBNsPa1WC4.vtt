00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.122
So let's say that this is
an equilateral triangle.

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:05.080
And what I want to do is
make another shape out

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.205
of this equilateral triangle.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.621
And I'm going to
do that by taking

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:09.370
each of the sides
of this triangle,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.855
and divide them into
three equal sections.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.736
So my equilateral triangle
wasn't drawn super ideally.

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.110
But I think you'll
get the point.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.810
And in the middle section
I want to construct

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.105
another equilateral triangle.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.680
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.090
And then right
over here I'm going

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.740
to put another
equilateral triangle.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.270
And so now I went from
that equilateral triangle

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.250
to something that's looking
like a star, or a Star of David.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.670
And then I'm going
to do it again.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700
So each of the sides
now I'm going to divide

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.410
into three equal sides.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.000
And in that middle
segment I'm going

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.295
to put an equilateral triangle.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.370
So in the middle
segment I'm going

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.350
to put an equilateral triangle.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.950
So I'm going to do it for
every one of the sides.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.600
So let me do it right there.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.760
And then right there.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.030
I think you get the idea,
but I want to make it clear.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.260
So let me just, so then like
that, and then like that,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.060
like that, and then almost
done for this iteration.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.840
This pass.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.260
And it'll look like that.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.330
Then I could do it again.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.663
Each of the segments I can
divide into three equal sides

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.260
and draw another
equilateral triangle.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.440
So I could just there,
there, there, there.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.260
I think you see
where this is going.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.534
And I could keep going
on forever and forever.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:38.950
So what I want to
do in this video

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.930
is think about
what's going on here.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.000
And what I'm actually
drawing, if we just

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
keep on doing this
forever and forever,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.990
every side, every iteration,
we look at each side,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.520
we divide into
three equal sides.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.177
And then the next iteration,
or three equal segments,

00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:53.760
the next iteration,
the middle segment

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.799
we turn to another
equilateral triangle.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590
This shape that we're
describing right here

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.950
is called a Koch snowflake.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.300
And I'm sure I'm
mispronouncing the Koch part.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.480
A Koch snowflake,
and it was first

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.229
described by this gentleman
right over here, who

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.270
is a Swedish mathematician,
Niels Fabian Helge von

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.610
Koch, who I'm sure
I'm mispronouncing it.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.740
And this was one of the
earliest described fractals.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.690
So this is a fractal.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.120
And the reason why it
is considered a fractal

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.890
is that it looks the same,
or it looks very similar,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.630
on any scale you look at it.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.591
So when you look at it at this
scale, so if you look at this,

00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:31.090
it like you see a
bunch of triangles

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.320
with some bumps on it.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.130
But then if you were to
zoom in right over there,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.190
then you would still see
that same type of pattern.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.926
And then if you were
to zoom in again,

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.300
you would see it
again and again.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.320
So a fractal is anything
that at on any scale,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.770
on any level of zoom, it kind
of looks roughly the same.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.270
So that's why it's
called a fractal.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.790
Now what's particularly
interesting,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.700
and why I'm putting it at this
point in the geometry playlist,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.417
is that this actually has
an infinite perimeter.

00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:58.500
If you were to keep doing
it, if you were actually

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.690
to make the Koch
snowflake, where

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.130
you keep an infinite number
of times on every smaller

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.840
little triangle
here, you keep adding

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.754
another equilateral
triangle on its side.

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:11.670
And to show that it has
an infinite perimeter,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.890
let's just consider
one side over here.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.960
So let's say that
this side, so let's

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.024
say we're starting
right when we started

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:19.940
with that original
triangle, that's that side.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.565
Let's say it has length s.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:23.565
And then we divide it
into three equal segments.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.910
So those are going to
be s/3, s/3-- actually,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.670
let me write it this way.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.170
s/3, s/3, and s/3.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.730
And in the middle segment, you
make an equilateral triangle.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.462
So each of these sides
are going to be s/3.

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:47.290
s/3, s/3.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.472
And now the length of this new
part-- I can't call it a line

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:53.180
anymore, because it
has this bump in it--

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.580
the length of this part right
over here, this side, now

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.510
doesn't have just a length
of s, it is now s/3 times 4.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.160
Before it was s/3 times 3.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.730
Now you have 1, 2, 3, 4
segments that are s/3.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.400
So now, after one
time, after one pace,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.160
after one time of doing
this adding triangles,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.480
our new side, after
we add that bump,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.760
is going to be four times s/3.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.730
Or it equals 4/3 s.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.670
So if our original
perimeter when it was just

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.100
a triangle is p sub 0.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.930
After one pass, after
we add one set of bumps,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.840
then our perimeter is going to
be 4/3 times the original one.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.630
Because each of the sides are
going to be 4/3 bigger now.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.610
So this was made
up of three sides.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.870
Now each of those sides
are going to be 4/3 bigger.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.400
So the new perimeter's
going to be 4/3 times that.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.680
And then when we take
a second pass on it,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.740
it's going to be 4/3
times this first pass.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.650
So every pass you take,
it's getting 4/3 bigger.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.380
Or it's getting, I guess,
a 1/3 bigger on every,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.437
it's getting 4/3
the previous pass.

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.520
And so if you do that an
infinite number of times,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.220
if you multiply any
number by 4/3 an

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.180
infinite number of
times, you're going

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.820
to get an infinite number
of infinite length.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.274
So P infinity.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.690
The perimeter, if you do this
an infinite number of times,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.370
is infinite.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.920
Now that by itself
is kind of cool,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.461
just to think about something
that has an infinite perimeter.

00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.192
But what's even neater is that
it actually has a finite area.

00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:29.900
And when I say a finite
area, it actually

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.164
covers a bounded
amount of space.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.080
And I could actually
draw a shape around this,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.120
and this thing will
never expand beyond that.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.620
And to think about
it, I'm not going

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.240
to do a really
formal proof, just

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.520
think about it, what happens
on any one of these sides.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.630
So on that first pass we
have that this triangle

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.010
gets popped out.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.340
And then, if you think about it,
if you just draw what happens,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.681
the next iteration you draw
these two triangles right

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:52.180
over there.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.270
And these two characters
right over there.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.330
And then you put some
triangles over here,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.520
and here, and here,
and here, and here.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.700
So on and so forth.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.960
But notice, you can keep
adding more and more.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.630
You can add essentially an
infinite number of these bumps,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.380
but you're never going to
go past this original point.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.490
And the same thing is going
to be true on this side

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.540
right over here.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.240
It's also going to be true
of this side over here.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.920
Also going to be true
at this side over here.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.680
Also going to be true
this side over there.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.130
And then also going to be
true that side over there.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.750
So even if you do this an
infinite number of times,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.450
this shape, this Koch
snowflake will never

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.430
have a larger area than
this bounding hexagon.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.190
Or which will never have a
larger area than a shape that

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.342
looks something like that.

00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:35.925
I'm just kind of
drawing an arbitrary,

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:38.070
well I want to make it
outside of the hexagon,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.850
I could put a circle
outside of it.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.690
So this thing I drew in blue, or
this hexagon I drew in magenta,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.050
those clearly have a fixed area.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.290
And this Koch snowflake
will always be bounded.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.070
Even though you can add these
bumps an infinite number

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.050
of times.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.057
So a bunch of really
cool things here.

00:06:55.057 --> 00:06:55.890
One, it's a fractal.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.880
You can keep zooming in
and it'll look the same.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.750
The other thing, infinite,
infinite perimeter,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.787
and finite, finite area.

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:06.120
Now you might say, wait Sal, OK.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.590
This is a very abstract thing.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.510
Things like this don't actually
exist in the real world.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.850
And there's a fun
thought experiment

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.880
that people talk about
in the fractal world,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.540
and that's finding the
perimeter of England.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.390
Or you can actually
do it with any island.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.020
And so England looks
something like--

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.750
and I'm not an
expert on, let's say

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.600
it looks something
like that-- so at first

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.099
you might approximate
the perimeter.

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:28.330
And you might measure
this distance,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.240
you might measure this
distance, plus this distance,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.970
plus this distance, plus that
distance, plus that distance,

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.051
plus that distance.

00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:38.050
And you're like look, it
has a finite perimeter.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.660
It clearly has a finite area.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.070
But you're like, look, that
has a finite perimeter.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.610
But you're like, no,
wait that's not as good.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.610
You have to approximate it a
little bit better than that.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.068
Instead of doing
it that rough, you

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.762
need to make a bunch
of smaller lines.

00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:50.470
You need to make a
bunch of smaller lines

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.400
so you can hug the coast
a little bit better.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.647
And you're like, OK, that's
a much better approximation.

00:07:55.647 --> 00:07:57.730
But then, let's say you're
at some piece of coast,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.620
if we zoom in enough,
the actual coast line

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.492
is going to look
something like this.

00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:05.950
The actual coast
line will have all

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.240
of these little divots in it.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.960
And essentially, when you did
that first, when did this pass,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.292
you were just measuring that.

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.750
And you're like, that's not
the perimeter of the coastline.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.791
You're going to have to
do many, many more sides.

00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:22.300
You're going to do something
like this, to actually get

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.747
the perimeter of the coast line.

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:27.330
And you're just like,
hey, now that is

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.179
a good approximation
for the perimeter.

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:31.720
But if you were to zoom in on
that part of the coastline even

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.539
more, it'll actually turn out
that it won't look exactly

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.429
like that.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.230
It'll actually come
in and out like this.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.230
Maybe it'll look
something like that.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.689
So instead of having these
rough lines that just measure it

00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:43.605
like that, you're going
to say, oh wait, no, I

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:46.280
need to go a little bit closer
and hug it even tighter.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.390
And you can really keep
on doing that until you

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.560
get to the actual atomic level.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.300
So the actual coastline of
an island, or a continent,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.640
or anything, is actually
somewhat kind of fractalish.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.760
And it is, you can
kind of think of it

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.477
as having an almost
infinite perimeter.

00:09:02.477 --> 00:09:04.060
Obviously at some
point you're getting

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.640
to kind of the atomic level,
so it won't quite be the same.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.450
But it's kind of
the same phenomenon.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.420
It's an interesting thing
to actually think about.
