00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.770
INTERVIEWER: Parasitic
diseases like malaria, loa loa,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.680
and river blindness effect
billions of people every year.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.490
In 2015, 3.2 billion people
were at risk of malaria alone.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.970
That's half the
world's population.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.680
In order to save lives,
quick diagnosis and treatment

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.630
is crucial.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.240
But that's not always possible
for those most affected

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.810
by these diseases in
the developing world.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.160
But that could all change thanks
to a modified piece of tech

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.351
that we already know and love.

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.100
MATTHEW BAKALAR: We
build microscopes that

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.759
are based around a cell phone.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.420
INTERVIEWER: That's Matt
Bakalar, a bioengineering Ph.D.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.870
Student at the University
of California Berkeley.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.390
He's part of a
project team that's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.570
been working on the CellScope
Loa, an optical device that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.160
converts a cell phone's camera
into an inexpensive handheld

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.816
microscope.

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:48.940
MATTHEW BAKALAR: So the
way this works is you slide

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.790
the phone into the holder here.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.480
And then we run an
app, just like you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.780
would if you were loading
up Facebook or Gmail.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.270
The operator would
take somebody's finger,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.190
prick their finger, and then
load a small volume of blood

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.390
directly into this
glass capillary.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.550
Then all you do
is you insert this

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.190
into the side of the device,
and you can begin a test.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.600
What we'll see on the screen is
a magnified image of the blood.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.860
And when everything looks
good, we just press go,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.974
and the test will begin.

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:18.640
INTERVIEWER: During
the test, the device

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.940
captures five-second
video clips as it moves

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.520
across the magnified sample.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.760
CellScope's software
then scans each clip

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.100
for irregular movement caused
by parasites in the blood.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.180
Unlike traditional
microscopic analysis,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330
which could take
days or even weeks,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.170
the CellScope test
takes just 30 seconds,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.490
meaning that if the
software detects a parasite,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.800
the patient could be
diagnosed and given treatment

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.340
almost immediately.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.290
This is really amazing.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.170
This is a cell phone
that so many people

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.950
have that can diagnose
you for loa loa

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.050
or a number of other
different diseases.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.750
Is that correct?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.625
MATTHEW BAKALAR: Yep.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.860
So this device itself only
diagnosis for loa loa.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.230
But its devices that
look very, very similar

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.230
to this that can work on
other diseases as well.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.063
Anything that you can
see with a microscope,

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:05.040
you can see with this.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.665
INTERVIEWER: The team is betting
this technology will be a game

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:09.720
changer, in places where
visiting a hospital

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.730
can be difficult, expensive,
and time consuming.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.300
Do you have to have somebody,
a trained pathologist,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.850
look at the results on the phone
to determine what's going on?

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.890
Or can the average
person find out

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.690
if they have say TB or malaria.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.400
MATTHEW BAKALAR: Right,
so that's the great thing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.330
about the device.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.680
So we've taken a job
that was typically

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.880
done by a trained
pathologist, and we

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.005
do that instead with software.

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.130
INTERVIEWER: I met with
Professor Dan Fletcher, who

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.960
explained how CellScope
was born from a project he

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.969
set in his optics class
several years ago.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.760
DAN FLETCHER: The
challenge to the students

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.760
was, can you convert
this mobile phone

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.260
camera into something that takes
a picture of a blood sample?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.840
The trick was, you couldn't
change what was in the phone.

00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:00.130
INTERVIEWER: When the
students first started,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.050
they were innovating using
cell phones with limited optics

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.690
and software capabilities.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.750
But in a short span
of time, and thanks

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.540
in large part to consumers
demanding better cameras

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.670
and faster processors,
cell phones

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.192
have gotten a lot smarter.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.400
MIKE D'AMBROSIO: The
development both of the hardware

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.950
and of the entire
infrastructure that

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.160
allows us to run great
software on the devices

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.729
has enabled our prototypes
to go from really

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.770
rudimentary microscopes
all the way to integrated

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.720
medical diagnostics, which are
used to treat tens of thousands

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.085
of people in Cameroon.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.210
INTERVIEWER: And the team
has been fortunate enough

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.610
to see firsthand the
impact the CellScope has

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.470
had in Cameroon, where for
many, the cost of seeing

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.167
a doctor in a hospital
is simply out of reach.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.500
MATTHEW BAKALAR: So I was
very nervous in the beginning.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.250
And then you start to see
the first few patients

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.360
running through,
getting their results,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.830
and really smiling and
being happy about it.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.830
I think the fact that they
were included in the diagnosis

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.120
really makes a difference.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.725
So rather than taking some blood
and sending it off to a lab,

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:00.100
you really feel
like you're there

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.530
doing something
that's worthwhile,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.010
spending your time
making a difference.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.260
So it's great to see
a piece of technology

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.300
that you've engineered
perform in the field.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.750
But this is different than
what we would normally

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.340
do in science.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.950
Here, we're actually interacting
with people who are directly

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.920
benefited from this technology.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.210
MIKE D'AMBROSIO: So a lot
of people these days carry

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.590
around these mobile devices.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.660
And it's not really in
the front of your mind

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.371
how powerful this device is.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.870
INTERVIEWER: After learning how
many lives the CellScope has

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.190
already managed to
improve, it's mind

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.250
blowing to think how many other
life changing innovations could

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.600
be developed around a piece of
technology that so many of us

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.570
take for granted.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.030
William Tarpeh is another
scientist at Berkeley

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.480
who's created a
groundbreaking innovation.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.210
Watch this DNews
episode to learn

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.260
about how he's turning pee
into fertilizer to help

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.704
feed the world.

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:54.620
We want to take a moment
to thank our partner,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.590
the Blum Center for
Developing Economies

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.330
at the University of California
Berkeley, an innovation

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.544
and research hub that's tackling
issues in global poverty.

00:05:02.544 --> 00:05:04.710
