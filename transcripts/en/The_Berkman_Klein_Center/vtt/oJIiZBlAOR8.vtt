00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.060
 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.260
Unauthorized modifications
of copyrighted works

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.840
implicate two distinct interests
on the part of copyright owners.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.410
The first of those interests we
considered in lecture number two.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.270
Modifications of copyrighted works
can threaten the owner's moral rights,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.980
specifically their rights for integrity.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.470
Recall in this connection von
Gerkan's "Berlin Train Station"

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.360
or Snow's "Canadian Geese."

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.590
When those works were modified, the
authors experienced pain and anger,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.320
and sued successfully to
stop the modifications.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.690
The legal rules underlying their
lawsuits, we've already discussed.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.260
The second of the interests is economic,
rather than moral and character.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.940
Making or licensing modifications
of their works is one of the ways

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.200
that copyright owners earn money.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.860
If they could not prevent unauthorized
modifications, they would earn less.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.930
The economic rights
related to modifications

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.080
will be the focus of this last
segment of today's lecture.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.420
To many copyright owners, this
source of revenue is very important.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.260
Here's an example.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.790
J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry
Potter series of stories, of course

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.570
earns royalties when her
books are reproduced and sold.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.510
But she also collects
license fees from people

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.080
who translate her books
into other languages,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.730
and more importantly,
in studios that wish

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.580
to make motion picture
adaptations of her stories.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.870
The studios, in turn,
not only earn money

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.060
by distributing copies of the
films through the myriad channels

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.450
I described in lecture
number three, but also

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.630
when subtitled versions are released,
and when various paraphernalia based

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.430
upon the stories is manufactured and
sold-- dolls, glasses, Quidditch pads,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.539
and so forth.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.080
The expectation of
those ancillary revenue

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.590
streams increases the
license fees the studios

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.710
are able and willing to pay to Rowling.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.790
These and other sources of
income growing out of the novels

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.850
made Rowling, at least at
one point, a billionaire.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.490
Rowling's capacity to control these
various offshoots of her novels

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.790
finds apparent support in Section
106(2) of the Copyright Statute.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.280
That section provides, as you
can see, that a copyright owner

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.580
has the exclusive right "to
prepare derivative works based

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.680
upon the copyrighted work."

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.600
So what's a derivative work?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.140
Section 101 tells us,
quote, "A derivative work

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.610
is a work based upon one
or more preexisting works,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.730
such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.950
fictionalization, motion picture
version, sound recording, art

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.720
reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.120
in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted."

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.680
In view of the growing importance
of the revenue streams associated

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.320
with such adaptations, you
might expect that there

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.820
would be a great deal of case
law interpreting and applying

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.050
Section 106(2).

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.440
Interestingly, there's not.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.670
The main reason is that the reproduction
right-- which, as we've seen,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.850
is shielded by Section 106(1)-- is
now construed so broadly that it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.820
encompasses almost all of the territory
that you would expect to be covered

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.100
by 106(2).

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.920
Indeed, the scope of 106(2) is
most often defined by 106(1).

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.310
If a defendant's work does not
incorporate enough of the plaintiff's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.850
work to violate the
rules that we considered

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.410
in the previous segment
of this lecture, it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.890
does not constitute a derivative work
and, thus, does not violate 106(2).

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.260
 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
A good illustration of the way in
which the derivative work right is now

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.149
overshadowed by the
reproduction right can

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:24.870
be found in the case of Castle Rock
Entertainment versus Carol Publishing.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.060
The plaintiff owned the copyright in the
well-known Seinfeld television series.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060
The defendant prepared
what are called a, quote,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.590
"trivia book," which posed questions of
varying levels of difficulty concerning

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.540
what happened in the television show.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.580
For example, one question asked
readers to match the names on the left

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.220
with the characteristics listed
on the right of this slide.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.210
When the defendant first
released the trivia book,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.990
the Seinfeld copyright owners appeared
to have been amused, rather than angry.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.950
Indeed, NBC, which broadcast the
show, initially asked the defendants

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.890
for free copies of the
book, which it then

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.960
distributed with promotions of the show.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.900
Note how sharply this
casual response contrasts

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.450
with the anger expressed by von Gerkan
and Snow when their works were adapted.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.800
In any event, it eventually occurred
to the copyright owners in Seinfeld

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.950
that the trivia book
encroached on their rights.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.900
They brought a copyright
infringement suit and prevailed.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.990
It's not at all obvious that
the plaintiff should have won.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.620
Is it really the case that the
creator of a work of fiction

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.250
can prevent others from
writing a separate work that

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.530
asked questions concerning the plot?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.600
If a high school English
teacher assigns a novel

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.000
and then creates a
multiple choice quiz that

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.480
requires students to answer questions
concerning what happened in the book,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.250
is she engaged in
copyright infringement?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.250
What if she sells compilations
of her quizzes to other teachers?

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.110
I leave that to you.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.880
For the moment, we're concerned
only with the statutory basis

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.390
of the court's ruling.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.500
At the very beginning of the Court of
Appeal's analysis in the Castle Rock

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.660
case, it seems that the key issue will
be whether the trivia book constitutes

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.800
a, quote, "derivative work," an
adaptation that will bring it

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.000
within the statutory
definition of derivative work.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.160
So the first sentence of the pertinent
section in the court's opinion

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.210
is, quote, "The Copyright Act
of 1976 grants copyright owners

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.070
a bundle of exclusive
rights, including the rights

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.700
to reproduce the
copyrighted work in copies

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.720
and to prepare derivative works
based upon a copyrighted work."

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.070
But in the second
sentence of the opinion,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.590
the court shifts to the now
familiar language of reproduction.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.230
Quote, "Copyright
infringement is established

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:06.460
when the owner of a valid copyright
demonstrates unauthorized copying."

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.800
Section 106(2) then plays no
further role in the court's opinion.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.650
 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.940
In this respect, the Castle
Rock opinion is typical.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.510
Rarely does a copyright owner's
right under Section 106(2)--

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.610
to control derivative works-- give him
power greater than he already enjoys

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.860
under 106(1).

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.790
But every once in awhile, the difference
between the two provisions matters.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.740
The principal examples are listed
in the map in front of you.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.960
First, a defendant
will sometimes purchase

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.690
an authorized copy of a copyrighted
work and then physically

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.500
alter it or integrate
it with another work.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.850
In such a case, the defendant
has not violated 106(1)

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.530
because he's not made a copy.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.450
He's bought one.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:02.920
Thus, he can be liable, if at all,
only for preparing a derivative work.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.650
Two cases of this sort involving
very similar facts are notorious.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.520
In each one, the
defendant purchased books

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.250
containing copies of the
plaintiff's copyrighted artwork,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:20.060
cut out individual images from those
books, glued the pictures onto tiles,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.840
and then sold the tiles.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.300
In one of the cases, the
Ninth Circuit concluded

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.640
that section 106(2) had been violated.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.130
Quote, "By borrowing and mounting the
pre-existing copyrighted individual art

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.140
images without the consent
of the copyright proprietors,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.460
appellant has prepared a derivative work
and infringed the subject copyrights."

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.330
Close quote.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.340
In the other case, the
Seventh Circuit, dismayed

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.560
by the implications of
the Ninth Circuit's ruling

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.920
concerning the status of many
common and innocuous habits,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.550
like marking up copies of case
books, took the opposite position.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.010
As you might expect, such
disputes don't arise often.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.930
 

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:11.770
The second context in which
106(1) and 106(2) might diverge

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.590
concerns the requirement of fixation.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.250
As we discussed in the previous
section of this lecture,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.960
to establish a violation of
the right of reproduction,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.880
plaintiff must show, among
other things, the defendant

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.070
made a copy of the plaintiff's work.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.230
And that, in turn, requires
that the thing the defendant

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.290
produced be fixed for more
than a transitory duration.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.930
Notice that the language
of 106(2) is different.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.310
It makes no mention of
copies or phonorecords.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.850
Instead, it refers
to, quote, "preparing"

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.850
close quote derivative works.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.840
That seems to leave open
the possibility that 106(2)

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.920
could be violated without
making anything firm.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.050
One passage in the pertinent
legislative history

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.640
lends support to that possibility.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.080
The House of Representatives report
that companies the 1976 statutory reform

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.960
contained this sentence.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.920
Quote, "Preparation
of a derivative work,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.050
such as a ballet, pantomime,
or improvised performance,

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.060
may be an infringement
even though nothing is ever

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.790
fixed in tangible form."

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.010
Close quote.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.150
Despite the apparent
clarity of this statement,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.650
the courts have been very reluctant
to accept violations of 106(2)

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.720
in the absence of some kind of fixation.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.680
For example, the Ninth
Circuit has ruled that, quote,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.820
"To narrow the statute
to a manageable level,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.690
we have developed certain criteria
the work must satisfy in order

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.970
to qualify as a derivative
work, one of which

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.110
is that it must exist in a
concrete or permanent form."

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.610
Close quote.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.350
 

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.570
Finally, a few odd
statutory provisions treat

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.690
parties who make derivative
works more favorably

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.120
than those who merely make copies.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.649
One such provision is
Section 104A(d)(3),

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:15.190
which governed the rights and
obligations of a person who has

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:21.040
prepared a derivative work based upon
an underlying work that used to be

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.800
in the public domain in the United
States because of a failure to comply

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.130
with US formalities, but has now
been restored to copyright protection

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.880
because of the TRIPS Agreement.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.790
The statute permits such a person to
keep on exploiting his derivative work,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.300
provided that he pays the
owner of the restored copyright

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.410
a reasonable compensation.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.040
To avail himself of this
option, he must show

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.560
that his product is a derivative
work, not just a copy of the original.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.810
How much must he have changed
the original work to qualify?

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.520
In the judgment of the
Third Circuit, not much.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.090
Changes that embody, quote, "some
minimal degree of creativity"

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.160
close quote, suffice.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.430
 

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:15.360
One last aspect of Section
106(2) merits reiteration.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.560
What happens when you prepare a
derivative work without permission?

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.350
Well, you expose yourself to the various
remedies for copyright infringement

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.650
that we'll consider in detail in
the last lecture in this series.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.940
But something else happens
that's perhaps less obvious.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.240
You forfeit whatever
copyrights you might otherwise

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.790
have enjoyed in your derivative work.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.540
The relevant statutory
provision is Section 103(a),

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:49.280
which provides the subject matter of
copyright, as specified by Section 102,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.690
includes compilations and derivative
works, but protection for a work

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.170
employing pre-existing material in
which copyright subsists does not

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.100
extend to any part of the work in which
such material has been used unlawfully.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.620
 

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.220
A nuance lurks in this language.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.210
Some courts have held that a person
who, without permission, makes

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.000
a derivative work
forfeits protection only

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.100
in the portion of the
derivative work that is, quote,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.150
"pervaded" by the underlying work.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.580
In other words, you may
still claim a copyright

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.280
in a portion of the derivative
work that is entirely untainted.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.900
Putting that nuance to one side, the
main point is that, in this context,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.050
an infringer doesn't get
copyright protection,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.745
even for his own creative material.

00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.340
 

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.780
In lecture three, I discuss
this principle briefly

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.850
in connection with the
Sylvester Stallone Rocky case.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.570
Here's another, even
more odd illustration.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.900
At one point in his career, the
artist sometimes known as Prince

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.640
adopted as his name the
image shown on your screen.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.360
During this period, a
guitar maker and Prince fan

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.200
by the name of Ferdinand
Pickett made a guitar

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:16.884
that incorporated most of this shape and
allegedly showed the guitar to Prince.

00:14:16.884 --> 00:14:19.300
Pickett apparently hoped that
Prince would buy the guitar,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.180
and thus enhance Pickett's reputation.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.230
Prince did not do so, but instead
commissioned another guitar maker

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.640
to fabricate guitars incorporating his
symbol and played them in concerts.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.100
Enraged, Pickett brought a
pro se copyright infringement

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.690
suit against Prince.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.920
Pickett acknowledged that Prince
held a valid copyright in the image

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.580
he had selected as his name,
and that Pickett's guitar was

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.960
a derivative work based
upon that copyrighted image.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.380
Nevertheless, he contended
that Prince could not

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.560
make a copy of Pickett's guitar
without Pickett's permission.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.580
Seven years later, the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.670
finally resolved the
dispute in Prince's favor.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.510
Judge Posner, writing for
the court, expressed doubt

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.300
that Pickett's guitar embodied
sufficient originality

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.700
to warrant a copyright
in the first place.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.650
But in any event,
Posner ruled, its status

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.750
as an unauthorized derivative
work meant that Pickett

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.690
had no copyright protection for it.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.780
Thus, even if Prince had seen
and copied Pickett's guitar,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.710
he would not be liable.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.060
The trial judge's comment
on the case seems apt.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.780
Quote, "Defendant may as well have had
in mind this protracted litigation when

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.930
he asked, 'Why do we
scream at each other?

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:52.730
This is what it sounds
like when doves cry.'"

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.980
As Mark Lemley has observed,
patent law works quite differently.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:04.260
A person who, without permission, makes
an improvement on a patented invention

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.840
may obtain a patent for his improvement.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.070
This creates a situation of
so-called blocking patents.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.330
Neither the holder of the
patent on the original invention

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.370
nor the holder of the
patent on the improvement

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.710
may practice the improvement
without the permission of the other.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.400
So is the net result that
the improvement never

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.430
gets manufactured and used?

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.590
Sometimes.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.990
But what usually occurs
is that the two parties

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.410
negotiate a deal by which
they divide in some way

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.370
the benefits of the
now improved invention.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.610
In Lemley's view, this setup
creates a more efficient pattern

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.380
of incentives for both primary
and secondary innovators

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.910
than the copyright system.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.710
You might ask yourself, what would have
happened in the Stallone and Prince

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.320
cases if a system of
blocking copyrights,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.070
analogous to the system of blocking
patents, had been in place?

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.680
 

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.990
This concludes our
analysis of the rights

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.790
of reproduction and modification.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.359
Next week, we'll take up the
distribution and public performance

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.800
rights.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.398
Thank you.

00:17:13.398 --> 00:17:13.898
