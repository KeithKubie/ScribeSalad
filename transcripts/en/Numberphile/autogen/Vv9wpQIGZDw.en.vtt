seasons so what's happened is me and we
 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.310
seasons so what's happened is me and we
may Adam we've got together and we've

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320
may Adam we've got together and we've
 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.660
may Adam we've got together and we've
come up with a mathematical model and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670
come up with a mathematical model and
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.570
come up with a mathematical model and
we've simulated 1 million seasons in the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580
we've simulated 1 million seasons in the
 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.890
we've simulated 1 million seasons in the
English Premier League which is the

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900
English Premier League which is the
 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.060
English Premier League which is the
Football League that we have here in

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070
Football League that we have here in
 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.439
Football League that we have here in
England just to see what happens

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449
England just to see what happens
 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.040
England just to see what happens
basically ok so for those that you don't

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050
basically ok so for those that you don't
 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.439
basically ok so for those that you don't
know this is how the the Premier League

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449
know this is how the the Premier League
 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.300
know this is how the the Premier League
works it's the top flight of English

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310
works it's the top flight of English
 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.210
works it's the top flight of English
football or soccer as a Americans like

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220
football or soccer as a Americans like
 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.009
football or soccer as a Americans like
to call it and basically there are 20

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019
to call it and basically there are 20
 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.929
to call it and basically there are 20
teams everybody plays each other

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939
teams everybody plays each other
 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.299
teams everybody plays each other
home-and-away and if you win the game

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
home-and-away and if you win the game
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.580
home-and-away and if you win the game
you get 3 points if you draw you get 1

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590
you get 3 points if you draw you get 1
 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.810
you get 3 points if you draw you get 1
points if you lose you don't get any

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820
points if you lose you don't get any
 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.369
points if you lose you don't get any
points it basically just taught up the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379
points it basically just taught up the
 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.180
points it basically just taught up the
points and see who's got the most point

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
points and see who's got the most point
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.590
points and see who's got the most point
if there's any sort of ties or some

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
if there's any sort of ties or some
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.790
if there's any sort of ties or some
teams have the same number of points

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800
teams have the same number of points
 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.200
teams have the same number of points
there's no playoffs or anything like

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210
there's no playoffs or anything like
 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.660
there's no playoffs or anything like
that it goes down to something called

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670
that it goes down to something called
 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.650
that it goes down to something called
goal difference

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660
 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
which is basically you take the number

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670
which is basically you take the number
 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.550
which is basically you take the number
of goals that a team is scored and take

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560
of goals that a team is scored and take
 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.870
of goals that a team is scored and take
off the number of goals they've conceded

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880
off the number of goals they've conceded
 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.210
off the number of goals they've conceded
after that you go it goes on goals

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220
after that you go it goes on goals
 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.570
after that you go it goes on goals
scored and after that it's just they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580
scored and after that it's just they
 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.500
scored and after that it's just they
just agree a tie

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510
just agree a tie
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.550
just agree a tie
there's no ranking and you can actually

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560
there's no ranking and you can actually
 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.830
there's no ranking and you can actually
have literally two teams with identical

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
have literally two teams with identical
 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.380
have literally two teams with identical
records in principle and literally they

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390
records in principle and literally they
 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.490
records in principle and literally they
won't be ranked they'll just say well

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500
won't be ranked they'll just say well
 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.440
won't be ranked they'll just say well
equal

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450
 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.030
[Applause]

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040
[Applause]
 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.550
[Applause]
obviously the goal is to is to win win

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560
obviously the goal is to is to win win
 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.980
obviously the goal is to is to win win
the championship but it's also really

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990
the championship but it's also really
 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.870
the championship but it's also really
important to get into the top four

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880
important to get into the top four
 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.910
important to get into the top four
because the teams to get into the top

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920
because the teams to get into the top
 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.020
because the teams to get into the top
four they go and so there's something

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
four they go and so there's something
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.400
four they go and so there's something
called the Champions leave the next

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410
called the Champions leave the next
 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.750
called the Champions leave the next
season which is really lucrative loads

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760
season which is really lucrative loads
 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.630
season which is really lucrative loads
of money the big thing you want to avoid

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
of money the big thing you want to avoid
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.210
of money the big thing you want to avoid
is relegation so that's finishing in the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220
is relegation so that's finishing in the
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.220
is relegation so that's finishing in the
bottom three if you finish in a bottom

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230
bottom three if you finish in a bottom
 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.830
bottom three if you finish in a bottom
three you actually drop down to the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
three you actually drop down to the
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.510
three you actually drop down to the
division be loads of the league below

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
division be loads of the league below
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.070
division be loads of the league below
the subsequent season and that's really

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080
the subsequent season and that's really
 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.750
the subsequent season and that's really
bad because obviously it's nowhere near

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760
bad because obviously it's nowhere near
 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.850
bad because obviously it's nowhere near
as glamorous far less income all

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860
as glamorous far less income all
 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.170
as glamorous far less income all
together a whole lower standard of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180
together a whole lower standard of
 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.460
together a whole lower standard of
football and you don't want to be there

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
football and you don't want to be there
 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.150
football and you don't want to be there
basically so that's the thing to avoid

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160
 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.980
so football fans everywhere you know we

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990
so football fans everywhere you know we
 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.690
so football fans everywhere you know we
like to argue about you know how many

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700
like to argue about you know how many
 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.130
like to argue about you know how many
points do you need to win the league for

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140
points do you need to win the league for
 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.050
points do you need to win the league for
example I mean that's that's a big issue

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
example I mean that's that's a big issue
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.520
example I mean that's that's a big issue
this season because you know there's two

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
this season because you know there's two
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.080
this season because you know there's two
teams that I've got really great records

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
teams that I've got really great records
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.250
teams that I've got really great records
they're Liverpool and Manchester City

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
they're Liverpool and Manchester City
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.470
they're Liverpool and Manchester City
and it looks like you're gonna need a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
and it looks like you're gonna need a
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.090
and it looks like you're gonna need a
lot of points to win the league this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
lot of points to win the league this
 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.430
lot of points to win the league this
season it's a thing you can ask normally

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
season it's a thing you can ask normally
 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.660
season it's a thing you can ask normally
how many points would you need to win

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
how many points would you need to win
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.250
how many points would you need to win
the league how many points do you need

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
the league how many points do you need
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.990
the league how many points do you need
to guarantee entry into the Champions

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
to guarantee entry into the Champions
 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.520
to guarantee entry into the Champions
League the next season to finish in that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
League the next season to finish in that
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.190
League the next season to finish in that
top four and of course the one that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
top four and of course the one that
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.930
top four and of course the one that
people really worry about is how many

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
people really worry about is how many
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.730
people really worry about is how many
points do you actually need to avoid

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740
points do you actually need to avoid
 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.890
points do you actually need to avoid
relegation what people talk about the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900
relegation what people talk about the
 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.170
relegation what people talk about the
magical forty point mark so this is why

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180
magical forty point mark so this is why
 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.610
magical forty point mark so this is why
we got interested we were interested in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620
we got interested we were interested in
 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.690
we got interested we were interested in
asking these questions from a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700
asking these questions from a
 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.850
asking these questions from a
mathematical point of view so of course

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
mathematical point of view so of course
 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.120
mathematical point of view so of course
we could answer some of these questions

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
we could answer some of these questions
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.050
we could answer some of these questions
theoretically but in not very

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
theoretically but in not very
 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.120
theoretically but in not very
interesting way so for example if you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
interesting way so for example if you
 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.360
interesting way so for example if you
get 64 points you're guaranteed not to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
get 64 points you're guaranteed not to
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.940
get 64 points you're guaranteed not to
be relegated that's a fact right you can

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950
be relegated that's a fact right you can
 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710
be relegated that's a fact right you can
show that quite easily but of course

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
show that quite easily but of course
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.350
show that quite easily but of course
anybody gets 64 points or 63 points

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360
anybody gets 64 points or 63 points
 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.030
anybody gets 64 points or 63 points
actually is not going to get relegated

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
actually is not going to get relegated
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.400
actually is not going to get relegated
in any reasonable season so we wanted to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410
in any reasonable season so we wanted to
 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500
in any reasonable season so we wanted to
think more about probabilities and what

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510
think more about probabilities and what
 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.630
think more about probabilities and what
you know what's likely to happen but

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640
you know what's likely to happen but
 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.340
you know what's likely to happen but
mathematically that's pretty much

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350
mathematically that's pretty much
 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.800
mathematically that's pretty much
impossible to do what we call

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810
impossible to do what we call
 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.740
impossible to do what we call
analytically so you really have to run

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
analytically so you really have to run
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.330
analytically so you really have to run
computer simulations use this idea of a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
computer simulations use this idea of a
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.420
computer simulations use this idea of a
Monte Carlo simulation you use sort of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430
Monte Carlo simulation you use sort of
 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.300
Monte Carlo simulation you use sort of
randomness to sort of try to create

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310
randomness to sort of try to create
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.820
randomness to sort of try to create
random seasons and then over a lot of

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830
random seasons and then over a lot of
 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.000
random seasons and then over a lot of
seasons the sort of probabilistic

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
seasons the sort of probabilistic
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.890
seasons the sort of probabilistic
scenario sort of play out this idea of

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900
scenario sort of play out this idea of
 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.680
scenario sort of play out this idea of
Monte Carlo simulations they go back to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
Monte Carlo simulations they go back to
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.570
Monte Carlo simulations they go back to
the atomic bomb actually so we had a bit

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580
the atomic bomb actually so we had a bit
 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.150
the atomic bomb actually so we had a bit
of a journey in building up building our

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160
of a journey in building up building our
 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.890
of a journey in building up building our
model we started off with some simpler

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
model we started off with some simpler
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.570
model we started off with some simpler
models and then developed a quite

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580
models and then developed a quite
 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.370
models and then developed a quite
sophisticated one which is kind of based

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380
sophisticated one which is kind of based
 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.170
sophisticated one which is kind of based
on the kind of thing that bookmakers

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180
on the kind of thing that bookmakers
 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.090
on the kind of thing that bookmakers
used to predict outcomes of games we use

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100
used to predict outcomes of games we use
 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.680
used to predict outcomes of games we use
something called a Poisson distribution

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
something called a Poisson distribution
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.320
something called a Poisson distribution
to sort of get the expected goals we

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330
to sort of get the expected goals we
 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.480
to sort of get the expected goals we
said a given team would have in a given

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490
said a given team would have in a given
 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.940
said a given team would have in a given
game and built the model from that and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950
game and built the model from that and
 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.180
game and built the model from that and
that used data from from last season's

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190
that used data from from last season's
 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.040
that used data from from last season's
Premier League actually it's kind of a

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050
Premier League actually it's kind of a
 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.870
Premier League actually it's kind of a
weird season in as much as Manchester

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880
weird season in as much as Manchester
 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.630
weird season in as much as Manchester
City had an anomalously good season they

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640
City had an anomalously good season they
 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.190
City had an anomalously good season they
got 100 points we're at the mercy of

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200
got 100 points we're at the mercy of
 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.020
got 100 points we're at the mercy of
that but we had to use something and we

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030
that but we had to use something and we
 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.700
that but we had to use something and we
literally played out the games in the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710
literally played out the games in the
 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.370
literally played out the games in the
simulation so we did it as I said 380

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380
simulation so we did it as I said 380
 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.610
simulation so we did it as I said 380
games over a season a million seasons it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
games over a season a million seasons it
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020
games over a season a million seasons it
is quite quick I mean I'm not going to

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030
is quite quick I mean I'm not going to
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.580
is quite quick I mean I'm not going to
take the credit for this I'm sure if I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590
take the credit for this I'm sure if I
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.050
take the credit for this I'm sure if I
wrote a bit code that tried to do this

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060
wrote a bit code that tried to do this
 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.270
wrote a bit code that tried to do this
it would take forever but my friend Adam

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
it would take forever but my friend Adam
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440
it would take forever but my friend Adam
is much better at that sort of thing

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450
is much better at that sort of thing
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.850
is much better at that sort of thing
than me and was able to write a very

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
than me and was able to write a very
 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490
than me and was able to write a very
efficient code which did it in about 20

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
efficient code which did it in about 20
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.260
efficient code which did it in about 20
minutes half an hour or so and so we

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
minutes half an hour or so and so we
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.760
minutes half an hour or so and so we
were really able to go out some fun

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770
were really able to go out some fun
 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.440
were really able to go out some fun
statistics out of it basically how many

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450
statistics out of it basically how many
 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.120
statistics out of it basically how many
points you need to win the Premier

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
points you need to win the Premier
 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.770
points you need to win the Premier
League on average based on this

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780
League on average based on this
 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.070
League on average based on this
simulation well it turned out of the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
simulation well it turned out of the
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050
simulation well it turned out of the
mean number of points that finish second

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060
mean number of points that finish second
 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.630
mean number of points that finish second
place was eighty five point two so

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640
place was eighty five point two so
 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.159
place was eighty five point two so
basically that's telling us that you if

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169
basically that's telling us that you if
 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.890
basically that's telling us that you if
you get 86 points chances are you gonna

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
you get 86 points chances are you gonna
 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.080
you get 86 points chances are you gonna
win the league in reality you know the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090
win the league in reality you know the
 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.909
win the league in reality you know the
team winning the league was getting 95

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919
team winning the league was getting 95
 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.130
team winning the league was getting 95
points or so in this simulation again

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140
points or so in this simulation again
 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.930
points or so in this simulation again
that's because city did so well our

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940
that's because city did so well our
 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.340
that's because city did so well our
season and we were using last season's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350
season and we were using last season's
 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.409
season and we were using last season's
data to get the Champions League for

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419
data to get the Champions League for
 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.200
data to get the Champions League for
example on average you would need 72

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210
example on average you would need 72
 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.970
example on average you would need 72
points according to this simulation

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980
points according to this simulation
 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.220
points according to this simulation
which is a reasonable figure there are

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230
which is a reasonable figure there are
 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.590
which is a reasonable figure there are
some circumstances where you would you

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600
some circumstances where you would you
 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.630
some circumstances where you would you
would need a lot more or a lot less but

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640
would need a lot more or a lot less but
 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.730
would need a lot more or a lot less but
that was generally the ballpark now the

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740
that was generally the ballpark now the
 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.620
that was generally the ballpark now the
crunch to avoid relegation well we can

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
crunch to avoid relegation well we can
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.720
crunch to avoid relegation well we can
look at the at the number of points on

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730
look at the at the number of points on
 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.200
look at the at the number of points on
average scored by the xviii team so

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210
average scored by the xviii team so
 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.880
average scored by the xviii team so
that's the the top team that did get

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890
that's the the top team that did get
 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.310
that's the the top team that did get
relegated and they got 32 and a half

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320
relegated and they got 32 and a half
 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.020
relegated and they got 32 and a half
points was the mean so that basically

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030
points was the mean so that basically
 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.900
points was the mean so that basically
means that 33 points should be enough to

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910
means that 33 points should be enough to
 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.820
means that 33 points should be enough to
avoid relegation based on the sort of

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830
avoid relegation based on the sort of
 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.860
avoid relegation based on the sort of
the simulators you would get from from

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870
the simulators you would get from from
 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.540
the simulators you would get from from
from last season's there that's quite

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550
from last season's there that's quite
 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.980
from last season's there that's quite
low I think that's bit on the low side

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990
low I think that's bit on the low side
 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.690
low I think that's bit on the low side
but again you know if you've read

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700
but again you know if you've read
 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.219
but again you know if you've read
averaged over more seasons with our

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229
averaged over more seasons with our
 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.510
averaged over more seasons with our
datum probably we would have maybe got a

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520
datum probably we would have maybe got a
 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.320
datum probably we would have maybe got a
higher figure there

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330
higher figure there
 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.760
higher figure there
so over a million seasons what sort of

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770
so over a million seasons what sort of
 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.219
so over a million seasons what sort of
things happened so for example what's

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229
things happened so for example what's
 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.839
things happened so for example what's
the most points that somebody won the

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849
the most points that somebody won the
 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.430
the most points that somebody won the
league with needless to say Manchester

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440

disaster right you could get relegated

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810
disaster right you could get relegated

was 44 and actually that's that's kind

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349
was 44 and actually that's that's kind
 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.570

you think about it you know the models

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680
you think about it you know the models

you think about it you know the models
not perfect one thing it doesn't do very

not perfect one thing it doesn't do very
 

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.120
not perfect one thing it doesn't do very
well for example is particulars the

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.130
well for example is particulars the
 

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.620
well for example is particulars the
reason for that is because they're nil

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.630
reason for that is because they're nil
 

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.390

a team gets sort of set in like that

then that dictates what happens next and

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:22.940
then that dictates what happens next and
 

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.550

the model doesn't do that because it's

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560
the model doesn't do that because it's
 

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.680
the model doesn't do that because it's
really really about randomness okay so

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:26.690
really really about randomness okay so
 

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.780
really really about randomness okay so
it doesn't really capture nil nails very

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:28.790
it doesn't really capture nil nails very
 

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.280
it doesn't really capture nil nails very
well so that's one of one of the

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.290
well so that's one of one of the
 

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.320
well so that's one of one of the
weaknesses of it and actually it's not

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.330
weaknesses of it and actually it's not
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.510
weaknesses of it and actually it's not
really clear how you would fix that's

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:34.520
really clear how you would fix that's
 

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.330
really clear how you would fix that's
tricky

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:39.340
