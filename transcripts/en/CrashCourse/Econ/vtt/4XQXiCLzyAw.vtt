Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, this is Crash Course
Economics,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.689
and today we’re going to talk about Immigration
and how it affects economies.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.769
So, that poem on the statue of liberty?
The one that reads in part,

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.000
“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled
masses yearning to breathe free,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.370
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.780
That’s some lofty stuff, right?

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.840
Well, sentiment aside, immigrants are good
for the economy.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.100
Before we get into the Economics of Immigration, let’s step back and have a quick look at the history.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.220
Homo Sapiens have been moving around the planet
for a long, long time.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.120
Estimates vary, but modern humans started to spread out from Africa between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.700
and since then they’ve been busily migrating
all over the globe.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.950
By 12,000 years ago, we were on all the continents
except Antarctica.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.130
Because Antarctica is a terrible place to
live if you aren’t a penguin.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.771
And honestly, even they seem unhappy there.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.780
Today we’re going to look at international
migration, when people move between countries,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.410
rather than internal migration, which refers to people moving around within their home country,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.440
because international migration has the most
appreciable economic effect.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.160
We’re also not going to talk about forced
migrations,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.220
like the Atlantic Slave Trade that kidnapped
many million Africans,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.840
and transported them to the Americas as chattel
between the 16th and 19th centuries.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.720
We’re going to focus on voluntary migration

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.680
because people who choose to move internationally
are very often seeking economic opportunity.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.820
In 1889, a geographer named Georg Ravenstein
wrote in his Laws of Migration,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.680
“Bad or oppressive laws, heavy taxation,
an unattractive climate,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.420
uncongenial social surroundings, and even
compulsion...

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.140
all have produced and are still producing
currents of migration,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.980
but none of these currents can compare in
volume with that which arises from

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.420
the desire inherent in most men to ‘better’
themselves in material respects.”

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.500
Ravenstein was writing during the Great Atlantic
Migration,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.540
which began in the 1840s as huge numbers of
Europeans relocated to the Americas.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.420
Between 1880 and 1910 alone,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.020
somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 million
Europeans arrived in the United States.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.040
The 19th century also saw a smaller, but still significant, number of Asian immigrants arrive in the US,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.220
mostly settling on the West Coast.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.280
Many of them came to join in the Gold Rush
-- working as laborers in the mines.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.190
They also worked in factories and helped build
the Transcontinental Railroad.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.650
All this immigration was, in many ways, a
result of technological advances.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.860
Improved transportation like steamships reduced the cost and difficulty of migrating across the Atlantic,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.430
and the rapidly growing industries of the
United States needed workers to keep producing.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.060
This influx of immigrants, while good for the industrial economy of the US, eventually ran into resistance.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.620
Beginning in the late 19th century, a series
of laws were passed to restrict immigration.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.640
By the 1930s, European immigration was severely curtailed, and Asian immigration was banned outright.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.040
Many of these laws remained in effect until the 1960s, when new laws helped precipitate a wave of immigration.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.440
And today, immigration's a really big deal.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.859
Even as we’re making this video,

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.079
immigration is one of the most contentious
issues in the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.800
The executive, legislative, and judicial branches are in a three way fight about how we handle immigration.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720
We’re not going to give an up-to-the-minute
journalistic report on immigration policy,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.060
but we can talk about the economic arguments
for and against.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.319
First, and let’s just get this out of the
way,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.780
the overwhelming majority of economists agree that immigration is a good thing for national economies.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.900
Many, many studies indicate that increased immigration is associated with overall increases in GDP and productivity.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.420
Opponents of immigration, however, point to some of the costs that can come along with immigration.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.080
They point to data indicating that immigrants
with low skills are likely to remain poor,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.160
and that some of those economic disadvantages
can be passed to their children;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.640
that recent immigrants use a lot of social
services;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.940
that immigration might result in short term
drops in wages

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.200
and contribute to inequality by shifting money
from labor to capital.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.359
And the data -- it bears some of this out.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.720
The thing is, though, these arguments don’t look at the net effects of immigration.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.020
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.600
Harvard economist George Borjas wrote about a family of economic models he called the Immigration Surplus.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.800
Population growth via immigration increases
the demand for goods,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.580
which can, in the long run, lead to more hiring
and higher wages.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.210
This can come at the cost of people who are
already working,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.420
as inexpensive immigrant labor can drive down
wages.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.620
But most economists point to this as a
short-term effect,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.560
and that the overall growth in the economy driven by population growth will eventually push wages up.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.520
So the benefits of immigration tend to not
only outweigh, but to exceed the costs.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.800
Studies indicate this holds true, even in
cases of extreme immigration events.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.500
Labor markets quickly adapt to inflows of
new workers.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.380
One study looked at the effects of the Mariel
Boatlift on the labor market in Miami.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.180
In 1980, nearly 100,000 Cuban migrants arrived in South Florida, and around 60,000 of them settled in Miami.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.650
Despite this massive influx of labor supply,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.190
the study found the Mariel immigration didn’t
drive down wages of native workers,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.500
and didn’t cause widespread unemployment.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.340
The immigrants were quickly absorbed into the workforce with negligible effects on other workers.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.139
One of the interesting things about the immigration
surplus is that

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.479
it only accounts for benefits that accrue to citizens who already lived in the country before the immigrants arrived.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.479
It doesn’t take into account the huge economic
benefits the immigrants themselves enjoy.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.599
Irish workers who came to the US in the 1870s
could double their wages.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.960
Guatemalans who immigrated to the US in the 1990s, were able to increase their incomes sixfold.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.379
An economist named John Kennan has estimated that if immigration restrictions were eliminated worldwide

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.280
the world’s labor supply would double,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.599
there’d be significant economic growth,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.540
and that workers from developing countries could see their wages jump from $8,900 to more than $19,000.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.720
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.780
Borjas’s Immigration Surplus findings do draw a distinction between high and low skill workers.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:14.120
It notes that the arrival of larger numbers of high skill workers is associated with a larger immigration surplus.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.280
And the model also indicates that if immigrant
flows are too weighted toward unskilled workers,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.540
the immigrant surplus will be smaller, and the growth that comes along with immigration can be slowed.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.600
But, the surplus, in most cases, still exists.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.260
Encouraging the immigration of high-skill
workers has other benefits as well.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.470
Studies indicate that high-skill immigrants
are innovators.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.970
One such study found that foreign-born entreprenuers
register about 25% of new patents in the US,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.240
and another found that a 1998 doubling of
the quota for H1-B visas

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.080
-- which enable employers to more easily hire
high-skill foreign workers --

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.940
that led to an average 15% revenue increase
for companies that participated.

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.429
Doesn’t take an Einstein to figure maybe
you want to expand the H1-B Visa program.

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:06.160
One subtext to this high-skill versus low-skill
conversation here in the United States

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.560
-- and it gets to one of the most contentious
parts of the immigration debate --

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.300
is how immigrants actually get or got into
the country.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.820
It centers on the differences between immigrants
who arrive in the U.S. via official channels,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.080
and those that enter the country without going
through the legal documentation process.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.620
So, what do we do with 11 million undocumented
immigrants who are already here?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:35.620
Well, in 2014, the federal government deported 369,000 immigrants, 9 times as many as were expelled in 1994.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.780
And from an economic standpoint, kicking people
out might not make the most sense.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.820
In fact, a wide range of studies find that extending legal status to undocumented immigrants would be a net positive.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.800
Proponents say that newly documented workers
would gain labor protections,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.500
and would be free to pursue work that better
matches their skill-set.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.860
As a result, on average, some economists estimate
these workers wages could rise up to 15%.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.920
And when workers get paid more, they tend
to buy more stuff.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.419
That increased demand, once again, leads to
more production, which leads to more hiring.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:10.259
And that’s not just pie in the sky liberal
thinking.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.420
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
projected in 2007

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.931
that immigration reform would bring undocumented
workers into the tax base,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.600
and that growth in revenue would offset costs
by a ratio of two to one.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.680
Many partisan organizations agree on this
point as well.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.020
The liberal think tank, Center for American
Progress, estimated that

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.960
giving undocumented workers legal status could create more than 200,000 additional jobs per year.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.760
Grover Norquist, of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote that legalizing undocumented workers would,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.220
“free millions of those now working to move
to where their work is

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.240
most productive for themselves and the national
economy.”

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.840
And the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote
in 2006 that,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.940
“Whether low-skilled or high-skilled, immigrants
boost national output,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.410
enhance specialization, and provide a net
economic benefit.”

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.510
Let’s stop for a minute, and really
appreciate the rareness of this situation,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.760
that the Center for American Progress and
the Heritage Foundation AGREE on something.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.280
Researchers have modeled the economic effects
of different possible policy responses to

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.320
undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.920
-- full deportation, full legalization and
full legalization with added border control.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.060
They found that full deportation would cut
GDP by 0.61%

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:31.300
and full legalization would, on the other
hand, INCREASE GDP by 0.53%.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.480
Legalization with more border enforcement
winds up in the middle increasing GDP by 0.17%

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.940
So, if the debate over immigration were solely about economics, there wouldn’t be much of a debate.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.440
But, as we’ve learned, the world is a complex
place.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.900
Many immigration opponents argue that expanding
immigration is a security risk.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.920
They argue that relaxed border enforcement can lead to more illegal items like drugs being smuggled into the country.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.900
There’s also a strong sentiment that people shouldn’t be rewarded with citizenship for breaking the law.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.420
But let’s go back to the broader community
of all immigrants.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.500
Cliché as it might sound, the US really is
a nation of immigrants.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.520
The United States has the world’s largest
total immigrant population -- at 41 million.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.320
And sentiment in the U.S. about immigrants
is changing.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.480
A 2015 study from the Pew Research Center found that about half of U.S. adults say immigrants strengthen the economy.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.420
Compared to 40% who say they are a burden.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.640
Back in 1994, that was reversed.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.600
Nearly 2/3rds of the population then saw immigrants
as a burden.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.380
Only 30% said they strengthened the country.

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:36.829
Pew also discovered that young people hold
a more positive view

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:40.860
of the contributions of immigrants to the
country than older generations.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:46.680
Which means it’s likely, pro-immigrant sentiments
gonna keep on growing. Economically, and otherwise.
