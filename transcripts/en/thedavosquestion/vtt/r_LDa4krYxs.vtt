00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
&gt;&gt; The world community should be very much
concerned with what happened

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.190
in Haiti -- not with the amount of help that
Haiti just received,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800
instead how it was -- how it was being distributed
among the Haitian

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.539
people.
It was such a mess, such a disarray, and such

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.390
a disorganization that a
lot of Haitians die, a lot of people went

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.260
looting, and a lot of kids
probably went into some health problems just

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.000
because the world
community wasn't ready.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.450
And there was not a central command that would
tell all the world

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.320
organizations and medical teams from all over
the world where to go,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.649
what to do, where to send the rescuers and
what -- how to improve the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.879
general situation with people of Haiti.
I recommend the world leaders that there must

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.550
be a central command to
the United Nations or to any other source,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.939
so when the need Haiti
disaster occurs anywhere in the world, we

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.030
are ready and prepared to
help and could give all our support to a nation

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.240
that needs everything.
