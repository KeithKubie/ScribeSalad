00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.940
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.773
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:04.380
Right now I'm in Islamabad, Pakistan,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.290
but then today we are
driving towards Peshawar,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.991
which is an ancient city.

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:11.963
It's known for food and history.

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:15.150
But today we're not actually
gonna explore the city,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.830
but we're gonna drive
in route to Peshawar,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.820
we're gonna stop along the way,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.130
we're gonna have some adventures,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.280
we're gonna meet some amazing people.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.880
We're gonna eat some delicious,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.499
specialty food from the region.

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.249
(exciting music)

00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:32.953
Good morning, Ali.

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:33.786
- Morning.
- How are you?

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:34.940
- I'm good.
- We're gonna be hanging out

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.240
with some of Ali's friends,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.680
because they're actually from Mardan,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.220
which is near to Peshawar.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.110
They're gonna tour us around,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.480
they're gonna show us
some of the local spots,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.520
and I think along the way we're gonna

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.763
probably stop to eat.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.870
We've been driving for about an hour now

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.312
on our way to Peshawar,

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.700
but we're gonna stop just
at a dhaba to get some food.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.827
This is actually a very
well known dhaba, Mian Jee.

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:07.504
(energetic music)

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:22.249
- Thank you.
- And yeah,

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.630
this place is really known for dal.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.480
They've got the best dal in Pakistan,

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.839
- [Man] Yeah, in Pakistan,
this is the best dal.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.089
- The best dal?

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.343
Mm, oh yeah.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.470
So good.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.030
It's so thick and so rich.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080
Yeah like peanut buttery almost.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.510
All right this is bitter gourd

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.643
mixed with keema minced meat curry.

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:51.437
Mmm, oh nice, mmm.

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:55.198
Oh the bitter gourd adds to it.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.120
That is fantastic.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.953
Like if you have this in the morning,

00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:58.315
you'll go to sleep again.

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:00.328
- Yeah, you'll want to go to sleep again.

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:01.161
- The desi ghee, right?
- Yeah.

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.987
- [Mark] It'll put you straight to sleep.

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:04.070
- [Ali] Yeah.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.263
- Next up is to try their chickpeas.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.800
Oh wow, the chickpeas are amazing!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.523
So rich and creamy,
again so much desi ghee.

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.120
- The dud patti, which is the milk tea.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.840
Complete milk, no water in this.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.240
And it already, pure milk,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.710
you can see how it has that milk skin.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.733
Cream skin on top.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.360
Yeah, whoa that is creamy.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.490
It's like a milkshake tea almost.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.423
So they're also taking some of the paratha

00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:40.273
and dipping it into the tea, as well.

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:44.580
Oh yeah, that works well.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.210
Next up we're trying some kheer.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.543
Milk and rice, I believe,
like a pudding or a custard.

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:53.320
Mm, mm-hmm.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.290
Oh you taste the cardamom in there.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.820
It is like a really thick, sticky custard.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.196
Oh, and then you taste
the cream coming through.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:04.550
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.631
Great breakfast, great
way to start the day.

00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.278
I think we're gonna
continue the journey now.

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:13.111
(energetic music)

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.293
- Mark?
- Yes?

00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:30.550
- This is a chapli kebab
thing that we are doing.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.591
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:32.640
- And this guy is like, you know,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.131
he's been ever since we were children,

00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.218
- Oh wow.
- He's has a place over here.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.866
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:41.939
- And this is a shabu.
- Okay.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.670
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.090
This is a massive iron pan.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.380
It is literally the size of a jacuzzi tub,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.940
and we're here to eat chapli kebab.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.080
So chapli kebab, you'll find
chapli kebab all over Pakistan,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.931
but Mardan, this is the best
place to eat chapli kebab

00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.010
because this is where it originates.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.450
This is the place that
they've been going to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.693
since they've been kids.

00:04:04.653 --> 00:04:06.510
It's in there, the fire is just blazing.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.830
Looks like they're using a combination

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.520
of both gas and wood,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.190
and then they're just
frying the chapli kebab's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.410
in animal fat.
- Come this way.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.263
- [Mark] Let's go see the meat, okay.

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:20.353
- The meat.
- Ahh.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.380
We have so much with us,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.120
and I am standing on the podium now.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.610
This is the bird's eye view.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.437
Oh, these are the ingredients.

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:38.270
Okay, hold on let's
just see the ingredients

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.980
in the chapli kebabs.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.470
- Bone marrow.
- It's minced buffalo meat,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.200
but then they add bone marrow.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.360
Bone marrow, they have ginger,
chiles, onions, tomatoes,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.630
and makes the ball of
meat into a patty shape.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.340
It's like a burger patty shape,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.050
and then he scoot it into the oil,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.620
the animal fat oil,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.990
and that just sizzles away.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.633
Wow beautiful, this is amazing.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.220
That is the most massive iron griddle pan

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.210
I think you will ever see.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.320
It's so big that they actually include

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.830
the money that you, you pay for the money,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.913
and they can include that
on top of the griddle.

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:27.606
(men speaking foreign language)

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:41.791
- We first try without it,

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.085
then you try with the lemon,

00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:45.056
and then you try with the--
- You can just see

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.700
those white nuggets of marrow

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.663
just plastered into them.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.836
- That's what it is.

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:53.430
Oh my gosh.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.060
No, I mean, I thought they
were like massive onions.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.918
- It's marrow.

00:05:58.918 --> 00:06:03.918
Wow, the chunks, nuggets,
of actual like marrow.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.803
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.560
Okay, hands down, hands down
that's the greatest kebab ever.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.530
That is unlike any other
kebab I've ever had.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.120
Crispy on the outside from
being fried in animal fat.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.010
The slimy richness of the marrow,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.883
the butteriness, oh that is.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.903
The spice is the pepper in there.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.500
That is, that's actually
borderline like beyond belief.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.573
Beyond belief.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.503
I'm in disbelief.

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:45.810
I'm in total disbelief.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.654
I think I've reached the all time high

00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:51.120
of a culinary feat.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.570
If you're a meat lover,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.463
this is like as high as you can go.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.153
I don't think you can go
higher then this level.

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.516
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:08.370
They just melt in your mouth, yeah.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.093
And the hot one is so good.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.032
It melts in your mouth,

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:13.900
but then it's crispy at the same time.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.493
Oh wow.

00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:18.630
Ooh, another plate of chapli kebab.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.460
There's absolutely no way you
can even physically resist it.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.500
It's like your body needs it

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.620
when you're in the presence of it.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.720
Your body needs it.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.480
- As many amazing meals as we've had,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.900
in Mardan, Pakistan, the KPK province,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.343
meat has reached uncharted levels.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.563
That is insane.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.690
- Okay, I've got one more patty

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.920
and you can see just
those jiggly marrow bits.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.510
To me that citrus kind
of tastes like a cross

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.020
between a lemon and an orange,
but it's called a kinnow,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.000
it's a specific from
this region of the world,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.690
and yeah it just goes so well

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.530
to kind of tone down the
richness of that kebab.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.303
I cannot get over these kebabs.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.320
That will change your life.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.650
Look at that just large chunk of marrow,

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.513
just melting into the kebab.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.320
Every time you eat chapli kebab,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.750
you have to finish with green
tea to just wash it down.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.950
So that's traditional
is to drink green tea.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.023
Mmm!

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.210
Oh, but yeah, that's not just green tea.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.040
It's like loaded with cardamom.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.273
Green tea and cardamom.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.740
- You have to put some of this in.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.780
- Oh some lime?

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.613
Is that lime?

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.073
Thank you.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.620
Okay, nice, I'll try it again.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.290
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.390
Yeah, that tastes extraordinarily healthy.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.920
- Thank you.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.801
Thank you, that was so good.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.003
- This is Saman.
- Thank you, the master.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.053
And the fryer.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.490
Kebabs and burgers will
never be the same ever again.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.060
Hamburgers, I can never
look at another hamburger

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.510
and not remember the chapli kebab.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.343
Goodbye.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.349
Goodbye down there.

00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:16.507
Yeah, that was unexplainably delicious.

00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:28.281
- He's got a shop over there,

00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:31.320
shop like over there, and one here.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.660
They're also very famous
for their serving.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.763
It's like an ice stick made with cream,

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.033
and it's like an ice cream.

00:09:57.858 --> 00:10:01.300
- And then it looks like some
type of syrup that he grabs.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.433
Oh, oh and then some kind
of cream or something.

00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:16.890
So what you can do is kind
of just really stir it up.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.800
You've got the noodles in there.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.210
He added in some sweet cream,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.933
he added in the shaved in
that like ice cream roll,

00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:25.120
and grab a big bite of this.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.990
I've had falooda before,
I've seen falooda before.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.400
But it's more of like a milkshake type of,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.810
kind of like milkshake beverage.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.577
This is totally different.

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:36.892
Mmm, oh yeah.

00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:38.981
That does taste like kulfi.

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:41.034
It tastes, oh it's cold.

00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:41.867
You can taste that cardamom in there.

00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:42.850
It's sweet but not too sweet.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.510
The noodles just kind of dissolve,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.060
along with the milkiness of it.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.843
Very refreshing.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.793
It's pretty good.

00:10:54.793 --> 00:10:55.640
Those are the ice cream sticks.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.843
That's what you need to
make this style of falooda.

00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:02.095
- Actual shop is called Bah-hel Falooda.

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:04.346
- Bah-hel?
- Bah-hel Falooda,

00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:06.179
very famous in Mardan.

00:11:08.944 --> 00:11:09.903
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:10.736
Thanks so much for everything.

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.761
- Time to move on?
- Yes.

00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:12.594
- Thank you very much.
- That was an amazing day.

00:11:12.594 --> 00:11:14.068
- You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:14.901
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.104
- So we'll catch you Islamabad.

00:11:16.104 --> 00:11:18.880
- Okay, they've got to go back
to Islamabad for a meeting,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.760
but they've arranged for us
to go to the Kabul River.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.453
So I think that's the next plan.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.890
- Fire is so hot,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.853
and you can see that fish
just hissing and sizzling.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.133
This is the fried fish,
and I think that's fried,

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:47.840
I think there's friend
chilies in there, as well.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.670
He's stirring it around.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.170
Just chunks of fish just bubbling.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.283
- Lamb karahi.
- Lamb karahi, whoa.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.290
Then finally the grill station

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.860
where he's making a variety of kebabs.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.220
There's fish, there's something
called a gray partridge,

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.176
which I wanna try, and then
he has a variety of kebabs.

00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:12.073
Some of which are fish
an chicken and yes, wow,

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:14.350
oh they're right off the grill.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.870
Okay, I think we're gonna
go take a boat ride first

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.038
before we lose the light before we eat.

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.871
(energetic music)

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.690
This will be first for me,

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.483
a boat ride on the river Kabul.

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:37.046
(boat engine whirring)

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.374
The engine is a little loud,

00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:46.457
but very scenic and very cool breeze.

00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:53.104
(energetic music)

00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:10.470
Boat ride was fantastic.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.630
Now we're gonna eat and we're
gonna sit on a local style,

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.180
it's like an elevated table,
but you sit on the table.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.980
There's a carpet, you put
the food in the middle.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.110
We have a view over the river.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.893
It's ultimate dining relaxation.

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:26.810
Actually, these are entire
little partridges, look.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.880
Look at the hind legs.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.884
Should we begin with the?

00:13:29.884 --> 00:13:32.070
Yeah, let's begin with the
drumsticks, the drummers.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.683
That's the entire drumstick, thigh combo.

00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:39.040
Mm, oh you can kind of
chew through the bone, too.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.873
Oh yeah.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.490
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.787
It's like quail, like more
mm, and cumin in there.

00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:52.204
(child speaking in foreign language)

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.100
That marinade, and then how it's roasted

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.740
over that really hot charcoal.
(child speaking shrilly)

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.700
Hey man, are you enjoying?

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.720
Oh, Micah's really
enjoying the kabuli pulao

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:05.200
that we've got a plate of right here.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.720
We've got a plate of fish, fried fish

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.383
then you can just see the
coriander seeds on it.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.760
And oh, that is right out of,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.520
I think oh it's so hot.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520
All that steam.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.430
I think that is fried
in mustard oil, as well,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.870
is what I would guess.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.070
Look at how hot that is.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.680
What I love with the fish

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.562
is that they really include
a lot of coriander seed,

00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:29.090
and that really compliments the fish.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.720
It just goes so well with it.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.948
And then yeah, that's
really fragrant, it's salty.

00:14:33.948 --> 00:14:37.188
You can also taste the
cumin, I think, in there.

00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:40.320
(energetic music)

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.920
The fried skin is the best part.

00:14:44.327 --> 00:14:45.160
Well we've gotta move on

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.646
because we have one more place to eat.

00:14:47.646 --> 00:14:51.030
I think we're about 45 minutes
or so away from Peshawar.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.380
We're proceeding on, we've got
to make it to Peshawar today,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.590
but there's one more restaurant

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.390
and they are legendary for,
again, for their chapli kebabs.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.829
So we're gonna pull a double today

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:03.940
and so we've got to stop there for dinner

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.240
before we get to Peshawar.

00:15:06.856 --> 00:15:09.689
(energetic music)

00:15:12.673 --> 00:15:15.410
There are literally like 12 in a row

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.010
and we're not sure which
one is the original one,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.740
so they were trying to make some calls,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.180
trying to ask around,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.443
trying to find the original Taro Jaba.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.793
Taro Jaba, that's what it's called.

00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:25.913
That's the place that we're looking for.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.190
It literally has, oh whoa
look at that bonfire!

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.153
That is just real.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.500
This might be the coolest
restaurant like cooking station

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.560
I have ever seen in my life.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.750
That is an entire bonfire.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.570
It's just radiating.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.410
It's so hot down there,

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.800
and then they actually have like,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.178
what is this?

00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:54.011
It's like a dock.

00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:55.890
It's like a dock of a cooking station.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.750
They've invited me to come back here

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.937
to watch them as they make they meat.

00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:02.070
Wow, this is so hot and
just that animal fat.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.180
Oh, you can actually see the chunks

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.700
of animal fat in the jacuzzi
that are just melting

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.273
as he scoots the kebabs.

00:16:13.945 --> 00:16:16.980
Oh, he's mixing the meat right now.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.647
Tomatoes going, nice, and chilies.

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:31.852
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.390
Without a doubt, this is one of

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.090
the coolest restaurants of my life.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.790
So he makes the meat

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.160
and I love that shove move.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.804
He just slides it into the fat.

00:16:47.804 --> 00:16:49.193
Taro, taro?
- Taro Jaba.

00:16:49.193 --> 00:16:50.656
- Taro Jaba, right?
- Yeah.

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:51.670
Taro Jaba chapli kebab.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.644
Chapli, chapli kebab.

00:16:53.644 --> 00:16:58.644
(overlapping conversations
in foreign language)

00:17:15.756 --> 00:17:16.589
Oh, I am turning red in the face.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.480
I've been standing
pretty close to this fire

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.520
trying to get the shots.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.000
Wow, that is hot.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.850
My face is burning, I'm sweating.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.480
I don't know if that fire ever goes out.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.510
I think I can safely say this
is the coolest restaurant

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.660
I've ever, the coolest
cooking station in the world

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.770
that I've ever witnessed.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.933
I'm fascinated and just
blown away and in awe.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.310
(greetings in foreign language)

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.350
We got the special kebab
with the marrow in it again.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.670
Ah, chapli kebab, they serve the full set.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.960
The vegetables, the yeah the bread,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.230
and some kind of a like
almost pink yogurt.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.423
Gotta get that, oh it just juices.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.110
Oh look at that, oh wow.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.920
Look at that bubbling nugget of marrow.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.532
- Cheers without cheers.
- Cheers.

00:18:05.532 --> 00:18:07.332
- Cheers.
- Taro Jaba the original.

00:18:10.384 --> 00:18:11.384
Ho ho ho ho.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.403
Oh wow.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.350
- This is just amazing.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.599
- This one, you can taste more
of the tomatoes in this one.

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:31.774
It's absolutely--
(man speaks foreign language)

00:18:31.774 --> 00:18:32.870
Hello, how are you?

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.763
Again, we are just gonna
sprinkle on some of that citrus,

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.890
some kinnow, that similar to an orange

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.220
and a lemon combined, sort of,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.393
but an original orange.

00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:51.710
That is, that's an eye opener.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.970
You can like, it literally is one

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.530
of the greatest meat things.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.440
Like burgers will never be the same again.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.970
It's so unbelievably juicy.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.700
Yeah, my whole perspective
on life has changed

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.663
after this kebab.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.093
Oh yeah, oh that kind
of goes up your nose.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.830
It is unbelievable, unbelievable.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.390
Both of the chapli kebabs
that we've had today

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.440
have been like, exceptional.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.010
Both of them have been unbelievably good.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.330
I think I might like this
atmosphere setting a bit more

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.220
because it's so like ancient looking,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.230
and just that blazing bonfire.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.840
But both of the chapli kebabs are insane,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.890
and then you always gotta have green tea.

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:43.480
Mm, oh yeah the cardamom again.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.790
What a meal.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.990
Not only one time, but
two times have I had

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.060
the best kebab of my entire life.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.539
The best patty of any shape
or form of my entire life.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:56.956
(drum music)

00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:01.610
(singing in foreign language)

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.794
I haven't come to the full realization,

00:20:02.794 --> 00:20:06.590
concl, I can't even
fully conceptualize yet

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.670
how good the chapli kebabs are.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.240
This is my first day to
ever eat chapli kebab,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.940
and we had two times today,
which is not recommended,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.360
because it's so heavy and so rich,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.610
but that was like two of
the greatest decisions

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.443
I've ever made.

00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:22.590
I wanna say a massive thank you

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.020
to everybody who hosted us today.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.000
We met and interacted with so many people.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.110
Thank you so much.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.160
I want to say a massive thank you to Ali,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.921
who organized everything
from landmark travel

00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:34.895
and bukhari travels and
landmark communications.

00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:37.960
I'll include Ali in the
description box below.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.150
Check him out, he's an amazing guy.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.030
So we're just gonna drive
into Peshawar from here,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.460
and then tomorrow the next video

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.220
is going to be a full tour of Peshawar,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.660
which is an ancient city which
I cannot wait to explore.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.470
So that's coming up in the next video,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.110
and that's gonna be it for tonight.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.660

your for watching this video.
