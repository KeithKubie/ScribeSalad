appreciate the heads-up now your
 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.970
appreciate the heads-up now your
specialty do you deal with extinction we

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
specialty do you deal with extinction we
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.620
specialty do you deal with extinction we
deal a lot with extinction in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630
deal a lot with extinction in
 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.320
deal a lot with extinction in
paleontology now what is an animal that

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
paleontology now what is an animal that
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.350
paleontology now what is an animal that
might be in danger of being extinct

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360
might be in danger of being extinct
 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.680
might be in danger of being extinct
right now the Iberian lynx is a good one

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690
right now the Iberian lynx is a good one
 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.670
right now the Iberian lynx is a good one
in the cat family

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680
in the cat family
 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.300
in the cat family
possum possum not so much okay I just

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
possum possum not so much okay I just
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.420
possum possum not so much okay I just
thought maybe possum what if cats became

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430
thought maybe possum what if cats became
 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.870
thought maybe possum what if cats became
extinct all of them it would be a very

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880
extinct all of them it would be a very
 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.390
extinct all of them it would be a very
interesting phenomenon it would result

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
interesting phenomenon it would result
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.880
interesting phenomenon it would result
in a loss of a very charismatic group of

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890
in a loss of a very charismatic group of
 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.360
in a loss of a very charismatic group of
mammals

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
mammals
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.660
mammals
how would a cat become extinct what

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670
how would a cat become extinct what
 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.910
how would a cat become extinct what
would be the scenario for this sort of

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920
would be the scenario for this sort of
 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.250
would be the scenario for this sort of
thing happening so a lot of this is kind

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260
thing happening so a lot of this is kind
 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.110
thing happening so a lot of this is kind
of speculation in terms of what would

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120
of speculation in terms of what would
 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.840
of speculation in terms of what would
cause a species extinction a lot of what

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850
cause a species extinction a lot of what
 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.479
cause a species extinction a lot of what
I deal is speculation that doesn't

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
I deal is speculation that doesn't
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.090
I deal is speculation that doesn't
surprise me either but a lot of the time

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100
surprise me either but a lot of the time
 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.530
surprise me either but a lot of the time
when we're dealing with domesticated

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540
when we're dealing with domesticated
 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360
when we're dealing with domesticated
organisms whether they be

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370
organisms whether they be
 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.229
organisms whether they be
crops or animals you can see reduce

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239
crops or animals you can see reduce
 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.880
crops or animals you can see reduce
levels of genetic diversity and that

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890
levels of genetic diversity and that
 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.800
levels of genetic diversity and that
sometimes makes them more susceptible to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810
sometimes makes them more susceptible to
 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.550
sometimes makes them more susceptible to
disease

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560
disease
