Maps can suffer from poor coloring as well,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.770
let's look at a few examples on this catastrophe blog.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.120
This first map was submitted by a wind energy company looking to

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.210
build more wind farms.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
The map shows the expected amount of noise that the wind farm was

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.030
going to generate.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.760
As you can see, this map suffers from high contrast and bright colors.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.110
This map further down is just a sea of black labels.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.070
You can't actually make out many of the labels in here.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.250
If you have more time, I recommend reading through some of these examples to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.090
get a better idea of how you can utilize color in your own visualizations.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.790
The good news is, is that even if you're not sure which colors to use,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.929
there's a wealth of resources at your disposal.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
Cynthia Brewer, a Professor of Geography at Penn State, developed ColorBrewer.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.920
Which contains a set of web, print, and color blind friendly colors.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.210
While her work mainly focused on maps,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
many of the color sequences, including sequential, diverging and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.239
qualitative can be effective choices when creating most data visualizations.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.910
And if you want even more color palettes, you can check out Adobe's cooler

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.420
to either pick popular ones, or create your own.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.190
The links to those websites can be found in the instructor's notes.
