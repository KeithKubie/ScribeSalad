00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.120
It's no secret that I love cats.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.800
From having six fur babies of my own, to fostering a family of 7

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.300
to buying and reviewing every product imaginable – from the useless to the ridiculous, and volunteering at Sante D'or Foundation

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.740
or urging everyone that I know all the time to adopt, foster, and/or donate

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.620
I think it's safe to say: my love of cats is pure.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.420
So when I found out that the world has lost over 96% of its wild tigers in the last century alone,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.040
from a 100,000 to a little as 3,890, I felt devastated.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.020
You know back when I was taking like two semesters of community college, I remember writing a paper

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.280
about how domesticated tigers in the United States were actually a huge problem

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.020
And I didn't realize that even that even more dire than that,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.820
is the practice of illegal tiger trading.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.920
Tigers are killed and sold for profit by international crime enterprises

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.860
who exploit ever single part of them

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.800
their skin, bones, whiskers and teeth

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.200
to make products like ornamental accessories and textiles.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.940
So I am incredibly honored to be partnering with Tiger beer

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.960
to bolster the conservation effort of the WWF.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.220
Tiger beer, who clearly loves cats as much as I do,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.160
started a creative movement called #3890TIGERS

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.100
aimed at taking a stand against illegal tiger trading.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.560
So #3890TIGERS is part of a six year global partnership between Tiger beer and the WWF

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.720
who are committed to doubling the world's wild tiger population to 6,000 by the year 2020.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.220
And I know, being a part of a political cause these days can be confusing and hard and daunting.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.060
I mean, how do you spread a message that you're passionate about

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.700
without coming across as preachy,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.300
or how do you engage people in a simple but effective way?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.760
I know that not everybody can physically volunteer

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.840
or has the financial ability to donate

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.320
But something that everyone can do is help spread awareness.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.680
And Tiger beer has utilised the most powerful tool of spreading awareness in modern-day society

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
– the selfie.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yeah dudes, the selfie!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.060
These selfie art pledges powered by six global artists

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.140
raise awareness of the illegal tiger trading problem in visually powerful way.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.480

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.460
I'm Anna Akana,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
don't let wild tigers disappear.
