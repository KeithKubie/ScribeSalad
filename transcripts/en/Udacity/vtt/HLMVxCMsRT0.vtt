00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.340
So how'd all the logging code go?

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.370
&gt;&gt; It went great, I'm actually having
a launch party for version three soon.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.670
Let me show you all the screens and
features we made from the wireframes.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.780
We're now supporting email login and
Google login.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.560
We also created a pretty
cool reset password flow

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.940
where users are sent their
passwords via email and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.390
therefore verifying that they actually
own the email that they've given us.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.360
But we worked on more than just
login in this version of the app.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.470
We used the login data to change
what the app actually looks like.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.250
The app now controls what the user sees
based on who they are logged in as.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.150
Also, we can keep track of who
buys what items and allow for

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.140
users to signal that they're
actively shopping on a list.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now we're halfway
through our projected final launch.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.110
Anyways, we're having a little 0.3
launch party, you should come.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.190
&gt;&gt; I'll see what I can do.
