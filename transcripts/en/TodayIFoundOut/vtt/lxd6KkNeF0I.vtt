00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.779
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.110
In the video today, we're looking at whether
the United States president has to report

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.980
food, transportation and other such gifts
from taxpayers on his or her taxes.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.290
Ever wonder if the president has to report
food, transportation and other such gifts

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.290
from taxpayers on his or her taxes?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.290
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.290
The short answer is- no.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.290
And although it's difficult to find an official
explanation (or even a detailed one), after

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.000
doing a deep dive into U.S tax law, the answer
appears to lie in the United States' ridiculously

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.580
complicated tax code.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.289
To begin with, we’ll look at the matter
of Gifts

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.279
The transportation, security, housing and
other benefits received by the President and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.860
his family are not considered gifts.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.320
But assuming they were, neither Barack nor
Michelle would have to pay any tax imposed.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.910
Under U.S. Income Tax law, in particular 26
USC § 102(a), gifts are, with some exceptions,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
specifically excluded from taxable income:
“Gross income does not include the value

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.750
of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise,
or inheritance.”

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.649
Rather, taxes owed for any gift are governed
by U.S. Estate and Gift Tax law, specifically

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.030
26 USC § 2502(c) which imposes the burden
of paying any taxes due on the person who

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.859
made the gift:
“The tax imposed by section 2501 shall be

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.109
paid by the donor.”

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.570
This gift tax will kick in once the yearly
value of any gift exceeds the annual exclusion

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.270
rate per person (currently $14,000) or once
the total amount of gifts given over a lifetime

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.070
exceeds the lifetime exemption for both gifts
and transfers on death ($5.4 million).

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
So, if the perks of Air Force One and the
White House were considered gifts, the U.S.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.540
citizens would owe the IRS some dough on these
"gifts" to the President.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.580
Which, of course, is absurd.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.500
But, luckily, these extras are not simply
the largess of the people, but rather, are

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.259
necessary for the President to do his job.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.259
As such, according to federal tax law and
regulations, the gratis transportation, food

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.920
and housing received by the Commander-in-Chief
are non-taxable fringe benefits.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.021
(Note: at one time the President actually
had to pay for all this type of stuff himself,

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.810
including any White House expenses, which
is partially how Thomas Jefferson became so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.159
hugely in debt.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.950
This was also a financial burden on rare non-independently
wealthy Presidents before the law was changed,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.110
such as James Garfield who had previously
been a janitor, carpenter, and a school teacher,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.299
among other things.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.729
When he was President, he didn't even have
enough money to own a coach and had to borrow

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.829
one to get around.)

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.460
Now we move on to Non-Taxable Fringe Benefits
Defined by the IRS as "a form of pay for the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.880
performance of services," fringe benefits
are often taxable as income to the employee

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.090
who receives them.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.760
However, there are certain perks that are
specifically excluded from the imposition

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.860
of income tax, for regular Joe's and the President
alike:

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.750
First, Meals and Lodging
Although we were unable to find support for

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.930
this proposition, it appears that this exclusion
(26 USC § 119) would apply to the keep the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.310
White House, its staff (including a private
chef) and certain meals out of the First Family's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.720
taxable income.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.930
It provides in pertinent part:
“There shall be excluded from gross income

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.370
of an employee the value of any meals or lodging
furnished to him, his spouse, or any of his

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.000
dependents by or on behalf of his employer
for the convenience of the employer, but only

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.050
if – (1) meals are furnished on the business
premises of the employer, [and] (2) the employee

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.830
is required to accept such lodging on the
business premises as a condition of his employment.”

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.430
In the case of the President, this also applies
to vacation homes and travel.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.041
As historian Richard Norton Smith said:
“If the president goes on vacation, it's

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:06.830
part of the job, because the president never
goes on vacation.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.820
I don't think you can legitimately argue against
the communications and everything else that

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.040
travels with and surrounds a president.”

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.080
That said, the President and his family are
responsible for paying for certain items,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.150
including "all their own groceries, drinks,
dry cleaning and even their toothpaste."

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.960
Although as one commentator wryly put it:
"the private chef then prepares dinner using

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.980
those groceries."

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.620
Now to Transportation and Security
When it comes to excluding Air Force One,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.600
the Presidential limousine and all of the
security for the president and family, Treasury

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.780
Regulation 1.132-5 in pertinent part notes
that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.220
“the government employee may exclude the
value of the personal use of the employer-provided

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.510
vehicle that the security study deter-mines
to be reasonable and necessary for local transportation.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.260
Similarly, if an employee travels on a personal
trip in an employer-provided aircraft… the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.490
employee may exclude… the value of the flight…”

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.860
It further notes that:
“Income does not include the value of a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.270
working condition fringe [which is] any property
or service provided to an employee . . . to

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.230
the extent that, if the employee paid for
the property or service, the amount paid would

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.230
be allowable as a deduction . . .”
This certainly appears to be the case, as

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.320
each of these expenses would be incurred as
a result of the president’s employment.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.410
Bonus Fact
• All federal employees, including the President,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.060
are prohibited from keeping gifts from foreign
governments and officials that are worth more

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.450
than $350.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.880
However, particularly with lavish, ceremonial
gifts given by other heads of state to the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.500
President, the gifts are typically graciously
accepted, then turned over to the National

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Archives.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.230
For domestic gifts, as legislative attorney
Jack Maskell notes "President is generally

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.400
free to accept unsolicited personal gifts
from the American public . . . from relatives

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.250
and gifts that are given on the basis of personal
friendship."

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.120
However, the president must "publicly disclose
personal financial information, including

00:04:45.120 --> 00:05:04.690
personal gifts over minimal amounts ($350
as of 2012)."
