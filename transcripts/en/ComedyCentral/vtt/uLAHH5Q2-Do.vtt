I'M GOING TO ASK EACH OF YOU A
QUESTION.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:19.118 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT 100% REAL IN
YOUR ANSWER.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.187 line:85%
IF YOU DO, THE AUDIENCE CLAPS.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.426 line:85%

YOU.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.366 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: TRUST ME, REV, YOU

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.201 line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.437 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.674 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANOTHER SO YOU-- YOU'RE A
CHRISTIAN.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:42.675 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M CHRISTIAN, TOO.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:43.542 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M CATHOLIC.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
I LIKE TO SAY I'M A RECOVERING
CATHOLIC.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:51.784 line:91%
NOW IF THERE WAS IRREFUTABLE
EVIDENCE-- I'M NOT TALKING "DA

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:56.089 line:91%
VINCI CODE "STUFF, I'M TALKING
IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT JESUS

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:00.226 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS GAY, WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR
MIND ON GAY MARRIAGE?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.097 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH
12 DUDES.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.800 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE WERE NO WOMEN AT THAT LAST
SUPPER.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.736 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOULD IT CHANGE YOUR
MIND, IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE?

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.974 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS
IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE WHEN IT

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMES TO JESUS.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.445 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, IF GOD SPOKE TO YOU AND

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAID, "TAKE THIS ON FAITH,
MICHEL.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:22.915 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY SON IS GAY."

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:23.916 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.220 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID THAT-- IF THE GOD
THAT I SERVE --

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:30.990 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF THE GOD THAT YOU SERVE
SAID, "NOW, ARE YOU COOL WITH

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:34.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAY MARRIAGE," AND HE SAID IT
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.063 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF GOD WERE TO SAY THAT HE
WOULD HAVE TO REWRITE THE BOOK

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.700 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT HE WROTE, OKAY.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I DON'T THINK THAT'S
AN ANSWER.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.105 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO INTO
SPACE, RIGHT?

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.206 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.343 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU HAVE TRAINED
WITH THE RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.478 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M A COSMONAUT.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BUT IT WAS
DOCUMENTED YOU WERE TOO POOR.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.916 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU WEREN'T SPACE RICH.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:57.783 size:75% position:38% line:85%
NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:58.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT A KNOCK.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.654 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO YOU HAVE AN OFFER TO DO THIS
CORPORATE EVENT.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:10.897 line:91%
IF YOU DO IT, THEY'LL PAY YOUR
WAY TO SPACE, BUT THE SPONSOR IS

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.065 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHICK FILET.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.401 line:91%
THEY JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE AN
AWESOME GAY SPACE ADVENTURE.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:16.802 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO YOU DO IT?

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.405 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOWING THAT BACK ON EARTH,
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE COOL

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH IT?

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.341 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M ABOUT TO BE 100 RIGHT
NOW.

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.746 line:91%
YES, I'D DO IT, BECAUSE THE
FIRST OUT GAY IN SPACE IS WAY

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.015 size:78% position:39% line:85%
BIGGER THAN HATE CHICKEN.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:35.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE THEIR MONEY.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:39.058 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: JESSICA, YOUR TURN.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
"HATE CHICKEN."

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S A PIVOTAL VOTE ON THE
GAY RIGHTS BILL.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:45.598 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WE'RE ASSUMING YOU'RE A VERY
POLITICAL PERSON, KEEPING UP

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:46.265 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH THIS.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.934 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I HATE POLITICS, BUT GO ON.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.369 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS PERFECT FOR
YOU, THEN.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.738 line:85%
THE DECIDING VOTE IS TED CRUZ.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.109 line:91%
YOU SEE HIM MAKING SWEET RIGHT
WING LOVE TO A DUDE THE NIGHT

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:57.643 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEFORE, OKAY.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU SEE THAT.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.079 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE THE WITNESS.

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.114 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S SWEET?

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.450 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S SWEET, OKAY.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:08.754 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, NUMBER ONE, YOU CAN OUT HIM
OR, 2, YOU CAN BLACKMAIL HIM

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:13.025 line:91%
INTO VOTING FOR THE GAY RIGHTS
BILL BY THREATENING TO OUT HIM

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.994 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IF HE DOESN'T VOTE FOR IT.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHICH ONE DO YOU DO?

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.030 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BLACKMAIL.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:20.032 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BLACKMAIL.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:20.866 align:start position:0% line:85%
"KEEP IT 100".

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EASY
FOR YOU.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.835 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M SCARED.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:23.702 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M VERY SCARED.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THINGS ARE GETTING
SO BIZARRE.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.607 align:start position:0% line:85%
SALLY, ANOTHER ONE.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.010 line:91%
THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO
RULE ON GAY MARRIAGE THIS YEAR,

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.144 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WE ALL KNOW THOSE JUSTICES
ARE ON THE BENCH FOR LIFE,

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.648 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.752 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AND WITH ALL THAT IN MIND,
YOU'RE STAND BY A QUARRY

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH ANTONIN SCALIA.

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:44.156 line:91%
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
YOU'VE BOTH BEEN DRINKING, NO

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.824 align:start position:0% line:85%
ONE IS AROUND.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE MAN IS, LIKE, 78.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.994 size:88% position:44% line:85%
HE'S HAD A FULL LIFE, RIGHT?

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:51.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN IN 2016.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.933 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAYBE REPUBLICAN GETS IN OFFICE,
THEY'RE GOING TO CHOOSE--

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.770 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH I  THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO ASK IF I'D HAVE SEX WITH HIM

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:03.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO, NO, THIS
MIGHT-- IF YOU PUSH HIM OVER THE

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:10.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
EDGE, THEN THE DEMOCRAT
PRESIDENT CAN APPOINT--

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.717 size:81% position:41% line:85%
ANOTHER-- ANOTHER JUSTICE.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.254 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:16.722 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; "THE NIGHTLY SHOW."

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:20.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
LARRY WILMORE JUST ASKED, "WOULD
YOU COMMIT MURDER?"

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DO YOU SNUFF HIM OR
NOT?

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW BAD DO YOU WANT THIS BILL
PASSED?

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:27.166 line:85%
&gt;&gt; UH, I DO NOT COMMIT MURDER.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE, INCIDENTALLY, I WOULD

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEVER DO ANYTHING IMMORAL IN THE
SERVICE OF A MORAL MOVEMENT.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.012 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SHE KEPT JUST IT
100.

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:40.580 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
