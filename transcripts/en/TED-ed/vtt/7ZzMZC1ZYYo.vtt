00:00:00.815 --> 00:00:04.913
What careers did you imagine for yourself when you were in grad school?

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.415
When I was little, my mom said,

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.349
"John K!"

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.110
(My dad was Big John, I was John K.)

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.982
"You'll make a great engineer."

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:13.922
And so, for a long time, I was like,

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.425
"Yeah, I'll make a great engineer."

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.480
Sometimes I forgot what that word was

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.642
and I'd say, "Oh, my mom believes in me,

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.734
I'll be something great."

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:22.227
But I really didn't know what an engineer was,

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:24.286
and I never really got the memo

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:25.892
of how to become an engineer.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.746
I didn't know any engineers.

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.140
My mom and dad were both lawyers,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.460
everyone they knew were lawyers,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.416
I didn't know what an engineer was.

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.354
Turns out my uncle actually was an engineer,

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:33.889
I've learned,

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.231
but he lived in Schenectady,

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.936
which I didn't know where that was.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.759
I didn't spend much time with him.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:42.322
So, I went to high school and I graduated.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.032
I went to college and I graduated.

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:47.331
But instead of diving into grad school,

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.898
I just started being an entrepreneur.

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:52.371
I went into education

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:53.842
with all these other teachers

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.325
and all these other clinicians

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.309
and all these other MSWs, social workers.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.026
But I wasn't a clinician,

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.666
I wasn't a teacher,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.184
I was an entrepreneur,

00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:07.182
and I wanted to change the next generation of schools,

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:09.581
and I realized that by being a little different

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.406
than the community,

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.001
that was sort of my grad school.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.417
And so, I worked hard,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.089
I started an organization,

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:17.493
I've grown it.

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:18.753
You know, there are 500 people,

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:20.154
$35 million operating budget,

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:21.954
8 U.S. states.

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:23.163
I still didn't go to graduate school.

00:01:23.163 --> 00:01:28.672
My graduate school was running an organization.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.165
And then in 2008, when I was an old man,

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.277
I went to graduate school.

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:35.339
I got a fellowship.

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:37.583
I became an officer of an elite university,

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.097
Harvard University,

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:40.351
and I got to take courses

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.882
in every single graduate school.

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.835
I took seven classes at Harvard Business School,

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:45.764
six classes at the Graduate School of Design,

00:01:45.764 --> 00:01:48.013
a class at the School of Public Health.

00:01:48.013 --> 00:01:51.607
I went and lived in Favelas in Mexico.

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:53.587
So, I could have gone and got an MBA

00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:54.664
right out of college,

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:56.134
but I would have been a dime a dozen.

00:01:56.134 --> 00:01:58.813
Instead, I was one of ten mid-careers

00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:00.444
at this great university,

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:01.814
and I was seen as an asset,

00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:03.528
not just this, a lost leader,

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:05.141
because the graduate school needed money

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.186
to pay for the graduate students.

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:10.070
So, if I were to give some advice on career stuff,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.130
don't just dive into graduate school to get a credential

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.565
because you don't know what you want to do.

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:16.896
My brother got a perfect score on the LSATs

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.737
but took a year off going to law school

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:20.744
because he didn't know why

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:21.948
he wanted to go to law school.

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:24.726
So, I just dove into education,

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.410
built something really special.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.426
In doing so, I built up a network

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.678
that was pretty freaking tremendous.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:33.164
And I think in the next generation,

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:35.285
folks should think about

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.033
how they can be a connector of people

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.505
from different places.

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:39.818
And graduate school,

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:41.759
you can go there and build a network,

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.698
but build your social graph by activities

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:44.940
and by your reputation

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.303
and by collaborating.

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.558
And graduate school can get in the way of that.
