00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] We've already thought about

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.600
what a definite integral means.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.970
If I'm taking the definite
integral from a to b

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.550
of f of x dx,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.190
I can just view that as the area

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.420
below my function f.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.190
So if this is my y-axis,
this is my x-axis,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.150
and y is equal to f of x,
so something like that.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.980
Y is equal to f of x.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.570
And if this is a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.420
and if this is b,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.060
I could just view

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.990
this expression as being
equal to this area.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.910
But what if my function
was not above the x-axis?

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.260
What if it was below the x-axis?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.380
So these are going to be equivalent.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.320
Let's say, let me just draw that scenario.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.270
So let me draw a scenario where

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000
that's my x-axis,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.030
that is my y-axis.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.120
And let's say I have,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.150
let's say I have a function
that looks like that.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.740
So that is y is equal to g of x.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.360
And let's say that this
right over here is a,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.490
and this right over here is b.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.970
And let's say that this area

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.320
right over here is equal to five.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.270
Well, if I were to ask you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.570
what is the definite integral from a to b

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.570
of g of x dx, what do you
think it is going to be?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.730
Well, you might be
tempted to say, hey, well,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.710
it's just the area again
between my curve and the x-axis.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.640
You might be tempted to say, hey,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.750
this is just going to be equal to five.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.830
But you have to be very careful.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.720
Because if you're looking
at the area above your curve

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.400
and below your x-axis,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.780
versus below your curve
and above the x-axis,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.620
this definite integral
is actually going to be

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.030
the negative of the area.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.380
Now, we'll see later on why
this will work out nicely

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.520
with a whole set of
integration properties.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.230
But if you want to get
some intuition for it,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.490
let's just think about
velocity versus time graphs.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.500
So,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.060
if I,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.620
in my horizontal axis, that is time.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.200
My vertical axis, this is velocity.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.450
And velocity is going to be
measured in meters per second.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.760
Time is going to be measured in seconds.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.710
Time is measured in seconds.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.180
And actually, I'm going
to do two scenarios here.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.480
So let's say that I have a
first velocity time graph.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.450
Let's just call it v one of
t, which is equal to three.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
And it would be three meters
per second, so one, two, three.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.500
So it would

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.200
look like that.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.840
That is v one of t.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170
And if I were to look
at the definite integral

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.300
going from time equals
one to time equals five

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.300
of v sub one of t dt, what
would this be equal to?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000
Well, here my function is above my t-axis.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.980
So I'll just go from one to

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.030
five, which will be around there.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.120
And I could just think
about the area here,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720
and this area is pretty easy to calculate.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.900
It's going to be three meters
per second times four seconds.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.710
That's my change in time.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.410
And so this is going to be 12 meters.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.000
And so this is going to be equal to 12.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.750
And one way to conceptualize this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.440
is this gives us our change in position.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.030
If my velocity is three meters per second,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.940
and since it's positive
you can conceptualize that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.710
as it's going to the right
at three meters per second.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.310
What is my change in position?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.450
Well, I would have gone
12 meters to the right.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.920
And you don't need calculus
to figure that out.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.410
Three meters per second times four seconds

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.240
would be 12 meters.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.470
But what if it were the other way around?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.300
What if I had another velocity function,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.390
;et's call that v sub two of t,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.650
that is equal to negative
two meters per second?

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.820
And it's just a constant
negative two meters per second.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.950
So this is

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.450
v sub two of t right over here.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.570
What would or what should

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.570
the definite integral from one
to five of v sub two of t be,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.660
dt be equal to?

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.840
Well, it should be equal
to my change in position.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.650
But if my velocity is negative,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.210
that means I'm moving to the left.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.050
That means my change in
position should be to the left,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.460
as opposed to to the right.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.370
And so we can just look at
this area right over here.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.710
When if you just look
at it as the rectangle,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.130
it's going to be two times
four, which is equal to eight.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.760
But you have to be very careful.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.760
Since it is below my horizontal
axis and above my function,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.730
this is going to be negative.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.210
And this should make a lot of sense.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.290
If I'm going two meters
per second to the left

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.960
for four seconds, or another
way to think about it,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.140
if I'm going negative
two meters per second

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.570
for four seconds, then
my change in position

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.350
is going to be negative eight meters.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.050
I would have moved eight
meters to the left,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.890
if we say the convention is
negative means to the left.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.660
So the big takeaway is,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.920
if it's below your function
and above the horizontal axis,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.900
the definite integral, and
if your a is less than b,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.210
then your definite integral
is going to be positive.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.620
If your a is less than b,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.840
but your function over that interval is

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.400
below the horizontal axis,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.450
then your definite integral
is going to be negative.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.780
And in the future, we'll also look

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.520
at definite integrals
that are a mix of both,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.450
but that's a little bit more complicated.
