After I left I think David--David is the mysterious person who is not here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He wrote the MapReduce system by hand. Is that correct? &gt;&gt;Yes. &gt;&gt;And you guys are now replacing that with--?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
&gt;&gt;We're switching over to Hadoop using a language called Pig or Pig Latin.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hadoop is a MapReduce system, and it has the advantage of handling all the details

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of distributing these mappers and reducers across a cluster of nodes, and we're actually

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
using Amazon's elastic MapReduce, which has hosted Hadoop to make our lives simpler.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So one of the cool things about Amazon--we talked previously in this lecture

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
about AWS--the Amazon Web Services.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
As Amazon has built-in not just machines but this whole Hadoop clusters

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that you can commission and pay for.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So you guys are moving to that direction and use those at Hipmunk now too for our log analysis.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's really cool, because you can just basically put in queries and say here's my data--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we actually store our data in S3 in these big text files, and we just say run this query

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
using 20 machines over all this data and you can basically say,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
how long do I want to wait. and Amazon will bring up all the machines,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
load your data in, run the job, output it, and then shut all the machines down.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yeah. It's pretty great. &gt;&gt;So you guys are going to be running MapReduce constantly though. &gt;&gt;Right right.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Like every 15 minutes or something? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's an interesting question of how to do that with EMR. I mean, you can do it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You just need to say that right.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Okay, so you're still kind of figuring out how that's--. &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And that's going to compute the hot pages for every Reddit?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's mostly user pages but there are are few other things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's stuff like your top links of this hour--that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt;Okay. Okay.
