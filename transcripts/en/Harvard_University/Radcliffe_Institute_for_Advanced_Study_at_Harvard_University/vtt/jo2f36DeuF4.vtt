00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.080
-I'm working about
judicial independence

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.350
and how corruption
gets inside the system.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.530
-It's been fascinating.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.210
This research just tugs you in.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.420
And you can't stop.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.270
-For me, the project's
been a ton of fun.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.850
Essentially just diving through
old historical newspapers

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.640
all day and seeing how they
thought about democracy,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.870
about money, currency,
all these themes.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.680
-I'm a journalist.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.160
And I'm working
here at Radcliffe

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.650
on a book about psychedelics.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.220
Teddy has been doing some really
indispensable work for me.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.030
His idea of a good
time is to find

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.665
an archive were no other
undergraduate has ever been.

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.000
-In the chapter
about human dignity,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.970
you mentioned that
there's Nussbaum's,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.570
sort of their capabilities.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.040
So we've met once a week.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.820
My role has been to look at
other philosphers' writings

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.140
on the same sort of ideas,
and to help edit the book.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.640
-If it's a genuine,
right, then it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
going to potentially, at least,
impose an obligation on me.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.280
They were just a fantastic
sounding board for the work

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.100
that I was doing.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.370
-In classes, we typically have
lectures of say, 300 people.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.580
And then sections which are
often say, 10 people large.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.410
And this has been an opportunity
to work with the professor

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.340
and to see something as big
as a book come together.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.790
-My goal was sort of to
do a literature review.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.850
I would read specific books
or specific parts of books,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240
summarize them,
sometimes translate them.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.010
I would share with
him what I'd learned.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.850
And he would see how that
connected to the research

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.350
that he'd done in the meantime.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.144
It involved a lot of people
from different social classes.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.810
-So in a way that was
a kind of reversal

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.470
of the traditional role
of professor and student.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.040
And she was actually
teaching me.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.331
And hopefully she was learning
something in the process

00:01:59.331 --> 00:01:59.870
as well.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.828
-And so sort of the idea
that even though there

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:05.180
are these new parties there,
the informal power structure of

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.680
[INAUDIBLE] was maintained.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.770
-Mike and I talk
a lot about things

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.300
even beyond the project, things
like the state of journalism,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.310
careers.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.400
That's a salient concern.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.010
I'm a junior.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.102
I'm approaching senior year.

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:25.950
-Being able to encounter
just really brilliant minds

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.540
and to be able to see
them work at a close range

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.360
and to collaborate on a
project is exactly almost

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.880
in its entirety what I want
to do as an undergraduate.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.510
It's also meant just
financial stability

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.680
for me, which has
been very useful.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.450
-Having Tianna as
like a real world

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.730
professional creative
writer, and being

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.330
able to enter in
conversation with her

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.890
with other students has
been like an experience I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.180
don't think is paralleled
anywhere else on campus.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.830
-Every week you got
to go to a place

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.650
and feel intellectually
awakened by the conversations

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.390
that you were having.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.260
-One of the gifts
of the Radcliffe

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.010
has been able to work
with my partners truly

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.290
as partners, and
not as students.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.510
And so we've been in
the work together.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.975
That's been phenomenal.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:12.785
-Yeah.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:13.920
-I think we're all--

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.040
-We're all trying to say that.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.290
