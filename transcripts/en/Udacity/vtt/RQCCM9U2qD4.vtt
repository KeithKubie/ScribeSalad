00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.910
So now that we've gone through
this exercise let's put these

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.719
pieces together.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.750
We showed three separate results
that being able to find the best, or

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.990
nearly the best,
let's you make few mistakes.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.550
Being able to make few mistakes let's
you do well on average per step.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.360
Being able to do well
on average per step

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900
gives you the ability to
actually find a nearly best arm.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.820
So, all these things
are actually equivalent.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.340
If you give me an algorithm for

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.640
doing any one of these, I can derive
something for doing the other two.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.700
Just kind of do it in a circle here.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.780
So, in a sense what
this is telling us is,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.420
that we kind of don't have to
pick among these three different

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.410
optimality criteria because they're
really all the same as each other.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.880
And you could sort of say, well and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.070
it must be that these are the right
ones to think about because

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.610
even if we don't think about this
doing well on average per step,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.050
we would have to solve it anyway if we
cared about any of these other things.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.740
So,
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.590
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.420
What I get out of this is the idea that
whichever of these is most convenient

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.180
for you to work with,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.239
you should just work with it because
the other ones are going to fall out.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.620
And there's other optimality criteria
that you could worry about, but

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.400
I don't know, it seems like a lot
of them come back down to these.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that a lot.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.310
You're really saying that they're
kind of in an equivalence class

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.060
of difficulty.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.220
Now interestingly,
the thing that we haven't done yet, and

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.600
that we need to do, is show that we
can solve any of these problems.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.380
I thought we just did.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.095
We put a lot of words on some
screens and there were some taus.

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:26.690
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, no.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.300
No, what we showed was that if you could
solve one, you could solve the other.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.790
If you could solve that one,
you could solve.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.570
But, we never said that any of
these are actually solvable.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.310
So, we need one more result to
kind of make this all doable.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fair, but
I was satisfied with proof by tau,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.230
but if you want to actually go and
ground it out.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but the taus were all
defined in terms of other taus.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.328
It never bottomed out.

00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:51.365
Right, what'd we'd really
like is something that says,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:55.055
here is an algorithm that will in
a polynomial number of trials find you

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.435
a nearly optimal arm.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.225
&gt;&gt; I don't know, Michael, it seems to
me this is pretty straight forward.

00:01:58.225 --> 00:01:59.325
It's taus all the way down.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.975
&gt;&gt; It can't be taus all the way down.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:01.865
&gt;&gt; Why not?
It's turtles,

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:03.215
they start with the same sound.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:03.875
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.055
I guess they're Greek turtles.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.115
&gt;&gt; Yes,
it's Greek turtles all the way down,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:08.365
which is what we've always suspected.
