yeah the uh it just I don't know it just
seemed<00:03:32.310><c> very</c><00:03:33.500><c> easy</c><00:03:34.500><c> to</c><00:03:35.190><c> solve</c><00:03:35.430><c> that</c><00:03:35.669><c> problem</c>

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 align:start position:0%
seemed very easy to solve that problem
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.509 align:start position:0%
seemed very easy to solve that problem
so<00:03:36.209><c> I</c><00:03:36.510><c> mean</c><00:03:36.930><c> maybe</c><00:03:37.139><c> it's</c><00:03:37.530><c> all</c><00:03:37.799><c> the</c><00:03:37.829><c> ruse</c><00:03:38.130><c> and</c>

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 align:start position:0%
so I mean maybe it's all the ruse and
 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.229 align:start position:0%
so I mean maybe it's all the ruse and
maybe<00:03:39.380><c> lapis</c><00:03:40.380><c> is</c><00:03:40.590><c> evil</c><00:03:41.250><c> as</c><00:03:41.579><c> fuck</c><00:03:42.120><c> but</c><00:03:42.569><c> I</c><00:03:43.760><c> um</c><00:03:44.760><c> I</c>

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
maybe lapis is evil as fuck but I um I
 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
maybe lapis is evil as fuck but I um I
have<00:03:45.450><c> my</c><00:03:45.480><c> suspicions</c><00:03:46.139><c> here</c><00:03:46.380><c> yeah</c><00:03:46.799><c> here's</c><00:03:47.160><c> my</c>

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 align:start position:0%
have my suspicions here yeah here's my
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.890 align:start position:0%
have my suspicions here yeah here's my
guess<00:03:47.400><c> because</c><00:03:47.849><c> they</c><00:03:48.150><c> do</c><00:03:48.209><c> not</c><00:03:48.480><c> build</c><00:03:48.750><c> her</c><00:03:48.870><c> up</c>

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
guess because they do not build her up
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.569 align:start position:0%
guess because they do not build her up
like<00:03:49.200><c> a</c><00:03:49.260><c> straight-up</c><00:03:49.620><c> bad</c><00:03:49.919><c> guy</c><00:03:50.130><c> she's</c><00:03:50.400><c> not</c>

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
like a straight-up bad guy she's not
 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
like a straight-up bad guy she's not
like<00:03:50.760><c> this</c><00:03:50.940><c> monster</c><00:03:51.419><c> is</c><00:03:51.510><c> looking</c><00:03:51.840><c> thing</c><00:03:52.019><c> or</c>
