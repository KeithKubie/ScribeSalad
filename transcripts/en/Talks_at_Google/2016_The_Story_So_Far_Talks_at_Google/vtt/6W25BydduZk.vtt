SASHA ARILANTO: OK.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.250
So just to get an idea of who's
in the room, how many of you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.430
guys have been to
SoulCycle before?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.300
Because it doesn't
sound like you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.180
guys have been to SoulCycle.

SASHA ARILANTO: Awesome.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.040
Also, a quick announcement
is that MK is in the room.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.840
A little bit starstruck.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.702
A little more starstruck
for MK being here.

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:24.160
I mean, I love
Julie and Elizabeth.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.409
ELIZABETH CUTLER: No question.

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.734
SASHA ARILANTO: So for those
of you who haven't been,

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.650
or for those of you who
just want a refresher,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.810
we're going to watch a quick
video from SoulCycle to get us

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.050
in the mood for today.

In those rooms, we're telling
people to follow your dreams,

to try something new and
go where your heart is.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.290

-SoulCycle is an
extraordinary place.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.380
-It's an exercise community.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.770
It's social and it's joyful
and you feel like a rock star.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.105
-It's therapy.

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:39.885
It's escape.

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:40.970
It's fun.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.429
-People come to us
for the workout,

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.886
but they stay for
the breakthroughs

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:45.070
that they have on the bike.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.570
-People get to
change their lives,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.430
their bodies, their attitude.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.680
-You lose yourself
in the rhythm,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.140
and you lose
yourself in the pack.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.480
And you work way harder than
you ever would on your own.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.770

because I get to be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.770

me to really describe it.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.110
It is joy.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.050
It is love.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.236
It is community.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:13.220
-You can have soulful moments.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.907
You can cry.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:14.490
You can laugh.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.604
-It makes you feel
better about yourself.

00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:18.270
It makes you feel
better about your day.

So it's 2016 right now,
and I'm really [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.400
And this is the SoulCycle
I know and love.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.610
I go there way too
often for my paycheck.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.150
But what was the
first SoulCycle like?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.754
It started 10 years
ago, which I think

00:04:01.754 --> 00:04:03.670
is something that people
don't really realize.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.150
I think that for a lot of
us, we got this SoulCycle.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.010
And I can't imagine that the
first SoulCycle was like this.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.150
So paint us a picture of
what that first early day

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.680
of SoulCycle was like.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.620
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Well,
it wasn't like this

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.310
but it wasn't so
dissimilar from this,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640
which is one of the things
that's kind of exciting,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.235
to see these early
seeds were there.

00:04:21.235 --> 00:04:23.610
I first want to say, thank
you guys so much for having us

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.109
here.

00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:26.070
This is an overwhelming,
amazing place to be,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.080
that you guys spend
all your days in.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
And I don't know if we really
realized that so many of you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.920
have ridden before.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.669
Which, thank you very
much for doing that.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.934
Otherwise, maybe we would
have made a shorter video.

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:37.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.640
But the first studio was an
old dance studio on 72nd street

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.670
in New York City near a
bunch of express trains,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.836
so we thought we could be
easy for people to get to.

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:50.880
We built it out of
Ikea, my station wagon.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.339
We had an online
reservation system

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:54.296
that took the friction
out of going to your gym

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:56.390
and waiting for an hour
for your favorite class.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.290
So you could sign
up for your classes

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.490
and plan your week around the
fitness that you wanted to do.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.750
And the wheel was there
from the beginning.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.750
We felt like we had
big aspirations.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.620
Like, maybe sometime
in the future,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.960
people will just see the
wheel and they'll just

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.501
think SoulCycle,
instead of us having

00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:14.430
to have the word
associated with the wheel.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.092
And it's exciting for us to
have seen that dream come true,

00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:20.050
as we've gotten bigger
and have the opportunity

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.550
for actual signage,
which we didn't

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.240
have in our first location.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.640
So not only could
nobody find it,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.590
but we couldn't really leverage
the foot traffic of New York

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.090
City.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.370
But we overcame that by loving
every single person that

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.430
came in the front door.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.120
Because we were pretty blown
away that you had found us,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.700
and really excited to
have you experience

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.590
what we thought it
was not just fitness,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.224
but providing an experience
that was different than fitness.

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:44.640
That you could
find something else

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.230
in that room, whether
it was burning calories,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.180
or whether it was
feeling stronger, or just

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.520
a real human experience.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.540
So I think that kind
of paints a little bit

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.860
of the early picture.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.590
JULIE RICE: Yeah.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.620
Early days were
really interesting.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.420
I mean, Elizabeth and
I were introduced.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.900
We had both been taking
classes at different gyms

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.560
around the city.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.550
And we had both been
talking to friends about,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.510
we have this idea.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.829
Exercise could be different.

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:11.370
It could be more
than just a workout.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.750
It could really
be an experience.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.390
And so we were introduced
by a mutual friend,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.270
and we went to lunch.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.436
And we always say it was
sort of the best blind date

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:19.990
that we'd ever been on.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.510
And when I left lunch that
day, Elizabeth called me

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.910
and she said, here's
what's going to happen.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.410
I'm going to go
look at real estate,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.290
and you're going
to research towels.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.080
And I thought, OK.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.794
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:30.210
And by the way,
I'll let you know.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.650
The first thing I did
when I got back to my desk

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.690
was I googled towels.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.065
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
She had a desk.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.970
JULIE RICE: By the way,
great-- Google, great service.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.082
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:41.650
Turns out you
actually rent them.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.640
You don't buy them.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.340
But that being said,
Elizabeth called

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.798
me a couple of days
later and said,

00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:48.600
you know, I found
something on Craigslist,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.308
which is where we
found our first studio.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:52.920
We certainly don't find our
studios on Craigslist anymore.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.909
And it was the back of
a lobby of a building.

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.200
It was a funeral home that
had been turned into a dance

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.270
studio that was now for rent.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.080
And we met there for
the second time ever.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.980
And we looked around.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.840
And it was tiny.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.300
It was 1,500 square feet all in.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.260
And our big purchase
with our seed money

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.120
was we sprung for a glass wall,
sort of a frosted glass wall,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.330
that we had some guys
come-- so it divided

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.380
the studio from the reception.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.630
And a plywood wall, which
was all we could afford,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.080
that then divided the office,
which was about as big

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.170
as our three chairs behind it.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.670
And we did.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.490
We made all these trips to Ikea.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.160
It took us three or four trips
through the Lincoln tunnel

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.540
to go to New Jersey.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.930
SASHA ARILANTO: And at this
point, were y'all working also?

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.830
Was it a seamless transition
from the old job to new job?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.102
Was it a side project?

00:07:42.102 --> 00:07:43.310
JULIE RICE: So I was working.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.101
I worked in the movie
business at the time.

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:51.590
And I was sort of getting burned
out on the type of culture that

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.280
was the entertainment industry.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.750
I had just moved from
California to New York City.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.890
And I was really missing the
social aspect of what I had,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.930
living on the west
coast, with exercise.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.750
There were certainly
a lot of great ways

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.940
to burn calories in
New York, but I really

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.740
missed what was a very
big part of my life

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.300
when I lived on the
west coast, which

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.010
was exercise and the people
that I knew and exercised

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.690
with really being my community.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.630
SASHA ARILANTO: And
when you started,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.970
this was both of
y'all's second career.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.970
You had children.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.340
You were married, I think.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.350
Arguably adults.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.300
So it wasn't like-- you
had responsibilities.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.350
So on one hand, I think
some people might think,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.419
oh, you had maybe cash,
you had experience.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.940
But also, you had a
lot of commitments.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.179
Was that scary?

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.720
Especially with people telling
you, this isn't going to work.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.892
There's no market for this.

00:08:43.892 --> 00:08:45.350
JULIE RICE: I mean,
let's be clear.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.720
Nobody thought this was going
to work, my parents especially.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.170

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.402
There was nobody who
thought this was working.

00:08:52.402 --> 00:08:54.235
ELIZABETH CUTLER: People
were like, you know

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.430
spinning is completely dead?

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.780
There's no reason to do this.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.696
JULIE RICE: It's true.

00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:00.380
But beyond spinning being
dead, the crazy thing for us

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.670
was that there was no
boutique fitness at all.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.900
There were yoga studios
in New York City,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.190
and people were not paying
per class for fitness.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.930
The real concept was, you belong
to a gym, you pay a membership.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.610
If anybody knows what
the gym model looks like,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.750
their profitability is not with
their group fitness programs.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.627
It's the add-ons that
you buy at a gym.

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:21.210
And so nobody really
thought that this

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.914
was a model that was something
that would really work.

00:09:24.914 --> 00:09:26.580
ELIZABETH CUTLER: But
we definitely knew

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.800
that it would work.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.710
JULIE RICE: We did.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.490
ELIZABETH CUTLER: No,
seriously, we totally

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.090
did know that it would work.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.464
JULIE RICE: It really has
informed our entire experience.

00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:35.950
Because we have always looked
at the pay-per-class model

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.420
as a challenge to
ourselves, right?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.930
We're only as good as
the last time you came.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.270
So we've always thought of
it as a mini-production.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.080
It's curtain up, curtain
down, every time you come.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.200
From the front desk person
who knows your name,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.824
or remembers that you like your
water at a certain temperature,

00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:52.164
or has your rental shoes in
your size waiting for you.

00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:54.580
And when you get there, you
think, god, that person really

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.620
knows me, right?

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.289
To the way that the
instructor engages with you.

00:09:58.289 --> 00:10:00.080
The way that you're
sent out into the world

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.038
high on endorphins,
feeling a little bit better

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:03.150
about yourself.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.890
And so we really, as we were
360 designing this experience,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.240
and thinking about
all the pillars

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.840
that we wanted to
put in to make sure

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.680
that this experience touched
you in many different ways.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.550
We knew that, if we
challenged ourselves

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.162
to deliver that every time, that
people would pay to come back.

00:10:19.162 --> 00:10:20.620
SASHA ARILANTO: I
have to say, too,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.650
that I was probably the
biggest skeptic of SoulCycle

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.490
before I went.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.910
And the other day,
Kamel knew my name,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.980
and he called me
a Kamellionaire.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.780
I told my mom.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.756
I literally told my mom.

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:35.880
Happier than someone with--

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.494
SASHA ARILANTO: It was like
a huge-- I felt really--

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:41.410
I don't know other people
who go to SoulCycle,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.826
besides the people
I already knew.

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:44.600
But I do feel part
of that community.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.660
But before, I was
a huge skeptic.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.744
I was like, that's stupid.

00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:49.201
There's this girl
in my down, and I

00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.460
was like, I can believe
she pays all of that money.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.460
It's just because her
dad works at Bain.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.994 --> 00:10:54.910
I've become that girl.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.350
And my dad does
not work at Bain.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.250
So once you have people in
the door, they transform.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.570
But before you have the
bang behind everyone saying,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.510
SoulCycle's the
greatest thing, how

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.460
do you convince
investors and customers,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.880
this is something you
should spend a lot of money

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.429
and your valuable time
in New York City to do?

00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:16.970
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
So it's two things.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.739
One is, we self-funded.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:20.280
So that we had to
convince ourselves.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.238
So that was a little bit
easier than convincing

00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:24.500
other people, who totally
didn't believe in us at all.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.960
Which is obviously a
unique position to be in,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.031
but it was not-- we
were super scrappy,

00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:31.530
and took out the garbage, and
only spent money on the things

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.210
that we needed to.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.001
And the people who
worked at the front desk

00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:35.420
also babysat for our kids.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.480
So there was a lot
of cross-pollination

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.330
going on there that worked
really, really well.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And then I think the
second thing is we really

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.824
realized early on you
value what you pay for.

00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:47.490
So if you're going
to pay for something,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.690
you're going to show up on time.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.450
You're going to
bring your-- you're

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.116
going to try to get
something out of it.

00:11:51.116 --> 00:11:53.080
And it elevates the
vibe in the room.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.432
And particularly when--

00:11:54.432 --> 00:11:55.140
You know, listen.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.205
People get so distracted.

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:58.330
There are so many things
biting at us all day long.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.455
I need this, I need that,
I need this, I need that.

00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:03.410
To spend 45 minutes not only
checking off your workout,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.320
but also having something that's
an experience for you that's

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.000
unplugged.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.280
And normally, we're-- we
have external central nervous

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.220
systems now, which is awesome.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.640
But I do think that
there is a place for this

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.920
in the kind of culture
that we're living in now.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.746
And it really is
a question of-- we

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:21.620
always talk about, it's
either two cocktails,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.810
inexpensive personal training.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.290
A friend of mine is
like, it's five coffees.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.750
I'm just going to drink my own
coffee that I make at home.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.400
And you just figure out
where your value system is.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.970
SASHA ARILANTO: And now that
you guys are head honchos,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.997
do y'all go all the time?

00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:35.580
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
We've always ridden.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.480
We made it for us.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:36.770
JULIE RICE: We are.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.280
I mean, we've always
been the user.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.071
In fact, I was watching
the video thinking,

00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:42.397
I'm so bummed that I didn't
get on a bike this morning.

00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:44.730
Truthfully, that's what I was
thinking during the video.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.920
It's always been for us.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.190
That we were
absolutely two people

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.750
that were looking for an
experience that did not exist.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.080
And that's why we created it.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.096
It continues to be for us.

00:12:55.096 --> 00:12:57.164
I ride usually about
five times a week.

00:12:57.164 --> 00:12:58.580
I always say, the
one thing for me

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.820
is I usually try to ride--
we have a studio attached

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.860
to our office.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.950
I can assure you, our
offices are awesome.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.560
They don't look like Google,
but they are terrific.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.140
And we have a great studio,
which is one of our big perks,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.140
is that we have a studio
attached to our office.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.130
But I always try to ride not in
the studio next to our office,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.387
because I say it's like
when you're home on Saturday

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:18.470
trying to get work done,
and then you realize, mm,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.219
you could clean your
closet because you've

00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:21.390
been meaning to for a while.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.162
And inevitably I
get lost at my desk

00:13:23.162 --> 00:13:24.870
if I don't work out
in a different studio

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.160
before I get there.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.800
SASHA ARILANTO: That's
how I feel, too.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.090
So I want to touch on something,
Elizabeth, that you mentioned.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.431
Is that you had a system that
was extremely innovative.

00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:36.180
That you can book.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.721
Y'all were the first
people, I think,

00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:39.600
to have a booking
system for a spot.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.100
Which, I think a
lot of people would

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.800
say if they could
book their yoga mat,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.470
they probably would get in
a lot less spiritual fights.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.390
I'm trying to think about
how innovative that is.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.750
Because in 2005 or
2006, for perspective,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.760
I was in seventh grade.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.890
I had a T-Mobile Sidekick.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.210
iPhones didn't exist.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.860
Apps literally did not
exist when y'all did this.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.594
What was the impetus for
that sort of innovation?

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:09.510
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Again,
it came down to need.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.290
And we decided, it is so
stupid that you are showing up

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.680
at a gym to sign up
on paper for something

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.900
that you could do online.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.580
And it was great
to do that early,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.050
because you barely were ordering
food online 10 years ago.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.922
And what we kind
of felt like was

00:14:23.922 --> 00:14:26.380
we wanted to have a place where
people could come and start

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.670
to seed a community.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.670
And really, it's kind of fun.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.380
If you're signing
up for classes,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.000
you can figure out what
bike you're going to be on,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.700
and you can be
messaging your friend,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.860
all right, I'm going
to be on this bike,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.880
and you're going
to be on that bike.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.110
And in that way, there's
kind of a community vibe

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.380
that starts to come out of it.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.480
And it's actually great.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.600
Because people come to our site.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.200
SASHA ARILANTO: And I wonder--
this is the Googler in me,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.210
and also the paranoia.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.620
How do you guys use that data?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.480
Because I feel like
you could get a lot.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.450
Like what bikes
people want to be in,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.060
what studios are popular.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.820
Does that data inform
business decisions?

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.230
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Well, we don't have

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.688
as many people
working at SoulCycle

00:15:01.688 --> 00:15:02.980
as you guys do at Google.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.830
So we have--

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.370
SASHA ARILANTO:
[INAUDIBLE] in the data.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.286
ELIZABETH CUTLER: We
have access to some data,

00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:08.890
but certainly not on the level
that you guys think about it.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.890
But look, I think
data is important.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.680
Because it helps you
sort of figure out

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.714
what people-- I don't
need to tell you guys

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:16.880
what's important about data.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.050
I mean, you guys invented data.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.258
JULIE RICE: What people want.

00:15:19.258 --> 00:15:22.010
Definitely we look at
our data to figure out

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.130
all sorts of things
about the business.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.710
We're not trying to be creepy
and look at personal habits.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.570
But we do use it to inform
business decisions, absolutely.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.440
SASHA ARILANTO: OK, cool.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.825
And this is sort of at
that level, too, of when

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:35.950
you're creating your brand.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.825
And something you
mentioned, that you created

00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:39.060
this product for yourself.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.530
And I think-- I brought two of
my friends, who are both males,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.270
to SoulCycle for the first time.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.540
And they said,
kind of hesitantly,

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.590
it's kind of a
girl's experience.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.730
And y'all are women.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.494
Did that--

00:15:50.494 --> 00:15:52.410
JULIE RICE: Did they say
that after or before?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.880
SASHA ARILANTO:
They said before.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.960
Yeah, after.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.237
After, they were like, uhh!

00:15:58.237 --> 00:15:58.820
They're dying.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.070
I look over, and I'm
really proud of myself.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.676
Because I'm hitting the
tapbacks, and they're flailing.

00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:06.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:08.890
It's another thing where
you have to get someone in.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.960
But do you guys see that as
a weakness of the product?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.990
Or it's fine?

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.432
Do you think you'll
ever make SoulCycle more

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.082
dude-friendly or bro-friendly?

00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:19.540
ELIZABETH CUTLER: There's so
many dudes in the classes now,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.130
though.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.160
When we first started,
it was a lot of women.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.940
It really was.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.080
But I think women
tend to bring guys.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.440
Women create communities
much more so than men do.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.390
JULIE RICE: I think the other
thing is, we created it for us,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.620
but we were very, very
sure in the beginning

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.822
that we were creating a
brand, not just a studio.

00:16:38.822 --> 00:16:41.030
And I think that even way
back in the beginning, when

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.940
we had no right to picture
the brand as the Nike swoosh

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.050
or anything like that, we did.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.792
And we were fanatical about
everything from the graphics

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:53.000
that we used to the colors
that we chose to the voice

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.340
that we wrote with.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.910
And we really decided
to plant a flag

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.000
and make sure that this brand
did have a real identity

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.640
and a real strong voice.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.240
And I think with
any great brand,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.839
it really stands for something.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.500
And you really can
hear it talking,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.849
and you can understand
what it feels like

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.599
and what you're supposed
to feel like when

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.730
you're there and in it.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.890
And so for us, we absolutely
took a point of view

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.640
on what this brand was
going to feel like.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.782
And even though it was
created by two chicks,

00:17:20.782 --> 00:17:22.240
I don't think that
there's anything

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.960
about being an
athlete or a renegade

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.278
or a rock star that doesn't
speak to every gender.

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.319
SASHA ARILANTO: For sure.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.693
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
And generation.

00:17:28.693 --> 00:17:30.054
JULIE RICE: Correct.

00:17:30.054 --> 00:17:31.470
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
It's fun to see.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.070
It's not just men and women.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.642
It's kids, it's older people,
it's everybody in between.

00:17:35.642 --> 00:17:37.350
SASHA ARILANTO: And
with that, though, it

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.650
does seem, though, that
standing in a SoulCycle,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.789
you can kind of get the
vibe of the type of people

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:42.330
who go there.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.080
Which may be because of price
or where these studios go.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.060
As y'all are expanding, do
you see that as a challenge,

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.840
to get a different clientele?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.940
One that-- maybe more
middle America than Miami.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.520
Do you think that that's-- how
is that affecting the vision,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.840
if at all, for y'all?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.910
ELIZABETH CUTLER: I think
this goes back to what

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.500
you're getting from the bike.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.400
Because for me, it's
a human experience.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.099
So I think we sell fitness.

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:11.140
That's our core business.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.230
But what's really
going on in that room

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.320
has a lot to do with where
you are in your life.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.220
And it doesn't matter
where you live.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.116
If you live in Kansas, it's
very much a similar experience.

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:22.490
Your sister can
be sick in Kansas

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.639
just like your sister can
be sick in California.

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:26.680
And if you're the one
who's being strong for her,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.670
and you're finding your
strength on that bike

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.240
to go back into the
rest of your life

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.790
and inspire those around you.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.350
Or just be your best person.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.390
There's so much value in
being your best person.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.370
I don't think that-- I think
that transcends demographic.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:45.136
I think it transcends
parts of the country.

00:18:45.136 --> 00:18:47.510
JULIE RICE: I think what we're
seeing as a macro trend is

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.120
that health is the new wealth.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.010
That people want experiences,
they don't want stuff.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.220
And I do think that if it was
something that 10 years ago we

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.470
might have thought about
when we started the business,

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.320
I really think that
people everywhere

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.020
are ready to feel good
and have better health

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.242
and be a little bit
less stressed out.

00:19:08.242 --> 00:19:09.700
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
And super strong,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.302
to your point of kicking
your friend's ass.

00:19:12.302 --> 00:19:14.010
SASHA ARILANTO: I
mean, you guys saw him.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.090
He's 6'2".

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.110
He's got little-- he
does curls for the girls.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.700
So we know that-- I was proud.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.530
But to that point of
how it transcends.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.780
It's that experience.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.000
It's not so much-- that
transcends demographic.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.650
I've noticed that SoulCycle
is very much experience-based.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.779
You never see before
and after pictures.

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:36.070
Maybe casually there's the
mention of how many calories

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.155
you burn.

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:40.360
And especially given
the Equinox partnership,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.750
which is all "Body by Equinox."

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.680
It's very results-driven, but
SoulCycle is very experience.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.430
Is that something
that's intentional?

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.490
Do you ever tout that,
the effect of SoulCycle

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.680
in terms of actual fitness?

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.030
Building strength, cardio?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.910
ELIZABETH CUTLER: The
proof is in the pudding.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.330
It's in people's experience.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.331
The letters that we get.

00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:04.121
We're so highly engaged
with our community,

00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:05.810
because we were so
desperate for people

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.130
to come in the beginning.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.160
So we respond to every single
email, every single tweet.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.720
And as a result, people
share their stories with us

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.730
very readily.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.790
And I don't think we're
tracking how many pounds people

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.740
have actually lost.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.410
But losing 72 pounds
is a big deal.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.180
Losing 98 pounds is a big deal.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.260
Losing 25 pounds is a huge deal.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.520
And consistently, you're
seeing this coming through.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.352
But the best part about
it is that it kind of

00:20:29.352 --> 00:20:31.310
goes back to what we were
talking about before.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.570
It's not the weight loss.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.146
It's the, I lost 25
pounds, but that's not

00:20:35.146 --> 00:20:36.020
what really happened.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.009
I'm happier, I'm
smarter, I'm clearer,

00:20:38.009 --> 00:20:39.050
I'm having a better life.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:39.790
I met somebody.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.540
I do this.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.660
My whole landscape of how
I interact with the world

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.927
has completely shifted,
and I just feel better.

00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:47.260
Who doesn't want to feel better?

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.800
JULIE RICE: And we consider
the fitness the baseline.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.550
We don't feel the
need to say, oh,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.760
you are going to look better.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.950
You're going to lose weight.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.400
You're going to burn between
500 and 800 calories every time

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:56.720
you come.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.960
And we can promise you that.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.460
That we can-- it's not that
there's no magic in that.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.290
But if you're doing the
workout for 45 minutes,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.250
you are going to lose
weight, look better, have

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.670
better cardiovascular health.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.780
There's no doubt about it.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.357
So it's one of those sort of,
what else are you getting?

00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:14.815
SASHA ARILANTO:
And that experience

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.900
is so driven by these
instructors, who

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.510
are celebrities.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:23.583
And I know, Julie, you were in
talent management before this.

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:26.260
So I imagine that you're
bringing some of those skills.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.110
What were you looking
for in the beginning?

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.095
And now, to this day, how do you
know if someone's going to fit?

00:21:31.095 --> 00:21:32.970
Because not all the
instructors are the same.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.780
They each have their own brand.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.071
But they're all very SoulCycle.

00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:36.860
JULIE RICE: Yes.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.400
Well, they're all trained
to teach SoulCycle.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.300
We audition hundreds
of people a month

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.000
now for our coveted
instructor positions.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.570
And we only take about 20
into every eight-week training

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.420
program that we do.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.432
So we see all kinds of people.

00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:53.890
We actually spend
a lot of time now

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.557
actually recruiting, not
just waiting for people

00:21:56.557 --> 00:21:57.140
to come to us.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.264
But we're out in the world
always actively looking.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.310
It's really about charisma.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.600
It's about being able to deliver
a certain kind of message.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.030
These guys are great DJs.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.440
We teach them the workout.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.870
We teach them
music appreciation.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.320
We teach them how to
create an emotional arc

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.430
that you, as a rider, come
through and experience.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.930
But I really think--
the first thing

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.220
I think about when I
meet somebody or think

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.310
about them as potential
SoulCycles is, do I

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.370
want to spend 45 minutes
with this person?

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.750
Is something that
they are saying

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.690
to me-- am I going to react
to this person in a way

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.570
that something that
they are saying to me

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.816
is something I'm actually
going to listen to?

00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:38.440
It's going to help
me to break through,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.050
and it's going to
help me to become

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.180
a better version of myself.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.130
Because let's be realistic.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.255
We all walk through the
world, and you meet people,

00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:46.226
and in one second you
say to yourself, mm,

00:22:46.226 --> 00:22:47.850
not listening to that
person's opinion.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.270
That person, put that back
here and use it for something.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.910
And I really think that
is the first thing.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.744
Are they charismatic
and credible

00:22:55.744 --> 00:22:57.160
in a way that they
are going to be

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.592
able to ignite this kind
of motivation in people?

00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:02.050
SASHA ARILANTO: And so as you
scale that talent management,

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:07.480
talent acquisition piece--
and y'all started as co-CEOs,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.710
and you're no longer
that position.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.614
How do you train
that into the people

00:23:12.614 --> 00:23:15.030
who are working for you, who
are now doing the recruiting?

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.620
And how do you trust them
to know what you've really

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.050
cultivated yourself?

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.910
JULIE RICE: We have a
great recruiting team.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.580
It's made up of quite a few
different types of people.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.070
Not everybody-- that's the
great thing about people, right?

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.310
So when you say that the
SoulCycle experience is--

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.530
they're all SoulCycle,
but they're all

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.720
with different people.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.310
And the person that
moves me is not

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.070
going to be the
person that moves you.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.040
And that's really why
having a team of people that

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.090
are out in the world looking at
potential instructors is great.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.820
Because what I like
and what gets to

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.410
me might be different than
what she likes and gets to her.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.162
So we look at these
auditions, then we really all

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:53.120
sit in a room and vote.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.828
It's awesome.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:57.790
It's the best day.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.010
It's the best day of
the month, for sure.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.850
But we all have really
different opinions.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.516
But I do think that
the common thread is

00:24:04.516 --> 00:24:08.670
that charisma and that
leadership ability

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.480
that we look for.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.770
And a lot of the
people on the team

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.360
have come from
talent backgrounds.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.570
You'd be really surprised.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.390
We're not looking for
people to come out

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.460
of the fitness industry.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.120
A lot of our scouts have
come right out of Hollywood.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.930
Most of our instructors,
at this point,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.980
come from dancing
backgrounds, choreography.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.850
Broadway shows are closing, and
who's free to teach on a bike

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.210
now?

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.539
And I think we're looking
in less likely avenues

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:33.580
for these type of people.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.454
SASHA ARILANTO: Yeah.

00:24:34.454 --> 00:24:37.890
And I can see that, too, to
the piece of-- I go to a class,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.900
they're all different.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.920
But I know my day
of the week based

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.670
on whose class I'm going to.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.050
You got Todd, this
crazy firefighter--

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.010
literal firefighter.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.510
And then you have a spunky
dancer the next day.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.410
That's got to be nice
to know that you're

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.140
reaching a wide demographic
with all these very

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.620
different instructors.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.070
ELIZABETH CUTLER: It's true.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.820
And the thing is, we
just wanted to create

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.144
fitness careers for people.

00:25:00.144 --> 00:25:02.310
Because before, people would
pick up one thing here,

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.030
and one thing there.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.510
And by the time they
got to their next thing,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.466
they were exhausted.

00:25:05.466 --> 00:25:07.340
You're never going to
have a good experience.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.580
And if we gave
people a home where

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.370
they had proper
benefits and great pay

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.870
and all that sort
of thing, and they

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.244
could take their inspiration,
just like you guys do here,

00:25:15.244 --> 00:25:17.187
and apply it to
their jobs, there's

00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:18.770
so much magic that
can happen, in that

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.300
you're really investing in
somebody's human potential.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.841
And that was something different
that we did in the beginning

00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:26.630
that I think has really spoken
to the DNA of the brand going

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.570
forward.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.940
SASHA ARILANTO: And with that
very transformative experience,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.610
I have to say, when
I started SoulCycle,

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.382
Cycle I was in a tough place.

00:25:36.382 --> 00:25:38.090
I was going through
a really bad breakup.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.340
I was making a lot of changes.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.970
I became a vegan.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.720
I meditated every
day of my life.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.460
And literally the only change
that has stuck is SoulCycle.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.975
The breakup didn't even
stick, to be honest.

00:25:52.725 --> 00:25:54.100
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
That's awesome.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.308
SASHA ARILANTO: So thank you.

00:25:55.308 --> 00:25:57.380
And I have to tell you,
you've changed my life.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:03.320
I think, how many company
starters can say, yeah,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.580
this girl told me her New Year's
resolution was to literally buy

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.089
more of my products.

00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:09.130
What does that feel like?

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.588
For someone to say,
hey, you helped

00:26:10.588 --> 00:26:12.990
me get over depression, or
over my eating disorder.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.500
I was going through
such a hard time

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.689
and your product
changed my life.

00:26:17.689 --> 00:26:19.230
JULIE RICE: Two
things I want to say.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.938
First of all, when
you asked before about

00:26:20.938 --> 00:26:23.270
the physical benefits
of SoulCycle,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.370
I think to your point of
something that sticks.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.870
Any exercise can
run around and say,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.550
we can change your
body in 10 days.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.780
Yeah, and on day 11 we
can also change your body

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.680
back to the way that it
looked before, right?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.700
So for us, it was really
about finding something

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.224
that we could make fun.

00:26:37.224 --> 00:26:38.890
We always say SoulCycle
is like slipping

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.770
the spinach into the ice cream.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.467
Our secret about
changing your body

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:45.050
and making sure you have results
is that if you love doing it,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.091
you keep doing it, right?

00:26:46.091 --> 00:26:49.090
So anything that you keep doing
for two or three or 10 years,

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.360
you're going to look
really, really good.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.830
But to the point of people
whose lives are changing

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.370
and getting healthier
and happier.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:04.620
For us, this whole thing, from
having a vision and a dream,

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.740
and putting some
words up on a wall,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.030
and building a front
desk out of Ikea,

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.410
and being users that
wanted this product,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.350
and watching our
first class sell out,

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.300
and then watching our
50th studio be built,

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.280
and getting thousands
of letters every year

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.739
about people that want this
thing all over the world, and--

00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:23.863
ELIZABETH CUTLER: And
working with the most amazing

00:27:23.863 --> 00:27:24.660
human beings.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.724
JULIE RICE: --who are all
really carrying the torches,

00:27:27.724 --> 00:27:29.890
and the people that are
scaling this and making this

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.202
happen every day.

00:27:33.202 --> 00:27:35.610
It's beyond, really, a dream.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.370
And then you add in
the fact that this

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.630
is a product that
is actually making

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.030
the world a little better.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.200
It's a privilege.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.600
It's really a privilege that
we don't take for granted ever.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.060
Vicky, who's here, who
did a great job getting

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.552
us prepped and un-nervous,
she gave us a page of,

00:27:52.552 --> 00:27:54.260
these are terrific
transformation stories

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.316
you can tell.

00:27:55.316 --> 00:27:56.940
We were literally
reading them while we

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.480
were getting our mascara put
on, and I was tearing up.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.010
She was like, stock tearing up,
you're ruining your mascara.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.230
But we're touched
every single day.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.005
There's barely a time
that I am in a studio

00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:11.380
that I don't bump into somebody
in the lobby who tells me

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.150
something new.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.269
And you really have
to step back and take

00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:15.810
a deep breath for
a minute and think,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.510
this is incredible that
we're such different people,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.695
and we're all being
touched by this in a way.

00:28:20.695 --> 00:28:21.820
That's what Elizabeth said.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.412
It's just such a
human experience,

00:28:24.412 --> 00:28:25.824
to feel strong about yourself.

00:28:25.824 --> 00:28:27.740
SASHA ARILANTO: I want
us to watch this video,

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.310
because I think it just really
captures how y'all are scaling

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.820
that life changing piece.

-If I had to tell someone
to go to SoulCycle,

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.650
I would tell them that
it's the best thing ever.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.330
-There's no judgment involved.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.550
You just do you.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.140
And you do yourself to
the best of the abilities.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.390
-For years at SoulCycle,
we've been riding and raising

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.430
money for charity.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.920
And we thought, if
we could get to kids,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.000
and we could start to
teach them the benefit

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.740
of a healthy lifestyle and
community, that we could really

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.368
change people's lives.

[ELECTRONIC MUSIC BUILDING]

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:30.450
-I've personally
had students tell me

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.750
how impactful the job
readiness program was.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.920
For years, they've
wanted to make a resume.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.950
And they were able to after we
spent a few minutes with them.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.160
-I have encouraged my mom
with making new choices.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.740
So we went to the grocery shop
together, and we bought fruits.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.930
And that's something
that I never do.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.250
-As a riding buddy,
we meet twice a month,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.780
and we ride together.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.860
After we ride, then we
usually chat and really just

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.500
connect about what's going
on in our daily lives.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.890
-She just encourages me,
helps me with my college

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.997
applications and my job.

00:30:00.997 --> 00:30:01.830
She gives me advice.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.870
So it was very helpful.

is when you see the kids
sink in to what's happening.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.910
When the music happens,
the lights go dark,

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.950
and they start to
lock into the rhythm.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.050
-When you get to ride in
a room with those kids,

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.489
it changes the air, the
molecules of the broom.

00:30:25.489 --> 00:30:27.780
It reminds us that we're
riding not only for ourselves,

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.900
but for each other.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.810
-You see them start
to kick in to what

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.830
they know they're capable of.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.070
-And then getting encouragements
from the instructor.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.570
She was like, you can do
anything you put your mind to.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.270
And it helps you push
yourself in life.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.452
-After class, I feel different.

00:30:41.452 --> 00:30:42.910
It makes me feel
good about myself.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.050
-I have the power.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:45.577
I can change the world.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.740
-I like the fact that
everyone knows my name.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.119
That was a big factor for me.

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.910
-When the teacher first
told me about this,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.830
I didn't believe I
would take it this far.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.800
I didn't think I would
be here right now.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.710
It really inspired me.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.060
-It does not take a lot
to change someone's life.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.090
And I feel so personally
lucky that I've

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.080
been able to help and contribute
and be part of this program.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.160
-Definite changes have happened.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.460
Truly, I think we've just begun.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.620
This was the spark.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.120
And now they're on the journey
towards finding themselves

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.656
and developing self-confidence.

00:31:20.656 --> 00:31:23.608
[ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:39.844 --> 00:31:41.330
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.976
SASHA ARILANTO: See,
it was worth it, right?

00:31:44.976 --> 00:31:47.246
Thanks.

00:31:47.246 --> 00:31:49.278
I have to tell you, when
I saw that video-- I

00:31:49.278 --> 00:31:51.530
think it was maybe MK posted it,
or it was just on the Facebook.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:52.410
It touched my heart.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.920
Like a little bit
for these kids,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.770
but also because I was
like, this is how I feel.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.310
It made me mad, too, because
those statistics are so

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.600
upsetting.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.600
About how people don't
get to have that fitness,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.410
and their children.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.720
It's a huge disservice.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.252
So I want to ask, what was
the inspiration for this?

00:32:08.252 --> 00:32:10.210
And then, one of the
questions that we actually

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.130
got from a Googler
before we start the talk

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.759
was, what's the long
term vision for this?

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:18.050
ELIZABETH CUTLER: So, like
they mentioned in the video,

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.210
we have always done
a lot of philanthropy

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.420
and money raising
inside the studios.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.570
For any cause--
pretty much any cause.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.250
We raise millions
of dollars a year.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.540
It's kind of amazing
that that gets to happen.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.320
And it's great for everybody.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.870
And we always had this
desire to have something

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.650
that was specific to SoulCycle.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.634
And there were some
kids in Los Angeles who

00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:43.550
were riding in the studios
and really becoming

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.820
a part of that community.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.700
And the community was benefiting
from it as much or more--

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.810
or equally, actually--
with these kids.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.750
And you started to see the
possibilities being planted

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.612
in them, where
they felt like, you

00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:03.610
know what, I can be healthy,
and I can have a future,

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.130
and I can go to school.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.930
These are people who just
have no access to anything.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.430
So we felt like this was
a great opportunity for us

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:17.190
to do something very personal,
where we could bring kids

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:22.280
from under-served neighborhoods
that were in their late teens--

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.890
juniors and seniors
in high school--

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.210
and give them the mentoring and
the skill set that maybe people

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.660
weren't talking to them about.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.170
And help them start to
frame things for themselves,

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.200
and give them access
to the studios.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.130
And it's amazing to see what
their retention rate is.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.760
These kids don't
have to do this.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.730
Why would somebody
actually-- really, you're 17.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.000
You're pretty cynical, maybe.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.080
It's very high--
97% attendance rate.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.250
And in fact, we had a
couple of kids get injured,

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.083
and they would just
come and they would just

00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:55.970
want to sit by the door
to hear the messages,

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.350
because it just touched them
and made them feel better.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.560
So just being in
that energy actually

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.940
moved the needle for them.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.830
And I think the
future for this is

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.420
for us to bring this to other
cities around the country,

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.544
and to continue to pilot this
inside of all of our studios.

00:34:10.544 --> 00:34:11.960
SASHA ARILANTO:
Before we do that,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.106
we're just going to do a last
lightning round of questions.

00:34:15.106 --> 00:34:17.070
Sort of an Inside
the Actor's Studio,

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.949
but it's Inside the SoulCycle
Studio, if you will.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.303
So you have to answer and
you can't think about it.

00:34:24.303 --> 00:34:28.750
If you were in an audition,
what's your audition song?

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.186
ELIZABETH CUTLER: For me?

00:34:31.186 --> 00:34:32.560
I don't-- probably
Justin Bieber.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.370
But I know that's Julie's.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:33.960
I know that.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.460
Sorry.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.080
I know that.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.705
I feel like I'm
stealing that from you,

00:34:36.705 --> 00:34:39.357
and I feel self-conscious
about that.

00:34:39.357 --> 00:34:41.440
JULIE RICE: I might use
"Helpless" from "Hamilton"

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:41.980
right now.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.699
It's an interesting choice.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.931
SASHA ARILANTO: Favorite studio?

00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:47.639
JULIE RICE: Favorite
studio-- oh, there's

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.722
no-- it's the best studio.

00:34:48.722 --> 00:34:50.310
It's the West 72nd Street.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.510
It's our original studio.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.690
ELIZABETH CUTLER: I love
all of the children equally.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.440
SASHA ARILANTO: Before
work or after work?

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:58.950
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Before.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.050
JULIE RICE: Only before.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.224
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Sometimes after.

00:35:02.224 --> 00:35:03.660
SASHA ARILANTO: Bit of both.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.870
Best cool down song?

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.130
"Return of the Mack."

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.760
That's my best cool-down.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.790
ELIZABETH CUTLER: I can't
answer that question.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.490
There's so much great
music out there.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.280
And that is what is so
awesome about SoulCycle.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.988
People are making new
music all the time.

00:35:17.988 --> 00:35:19.670
We get to listen to it in class.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.522
It's fantastical.

00:35:20.522 --> 00:35:22.730
You got one from "Hamilton"
you want to slow down to?

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.477
JULIE RICE: No.

00:35:23.477 --> 00:35:24.560
I always like "Landslide."

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:24.650
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
(SINGING) You're never

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.950
gonna be president!

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.661
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.270
SASHA ARILANTO: Front
row or side bar?

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.270
JULIE RICE: Oh, neither.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.830
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Second row.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:32.210
JULIE RICE: Second row.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.460
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Center.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.624
SASHA ARILANTO: Wow.

00:35:34.624 --> 00:35:38.029
And the last one is what
size weights do you use?

00:35:38.029 --> 00:35:39.320
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Three pounds.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.153
I'm getting to five.

00:35:40.153 --> 00:35:41.510
Melanie is here, our CEO.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.410
She did five pounds
for our Turn It Up 20.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.470
And I was like, damn.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.120
JULIE RICE: She's really
challenging us all.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.135
Two pounds for me.

00:35:48.135 --> 00:35:49.510
SASHA ARILANTO:
OK, well awesome.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.750
Thank you guys so much.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.750
We're going to do Q&amp;A right now.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.836
So whoever's bravest.

00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:58.710
AUDIENCE: Every time
I've contacted SoulCycle

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.840
for a customer
service issue, I have

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.620
been overwhelmed at the
amazing response I received.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.150
And that's part of my job here.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.830
I work on the
customer service team.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.400
I'm super impressed at the
way you guys can promulgate

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.860
your culture even through
your customer service agents.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.175
So I'm just curious what your
customer service philosophy is.

00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:17.550
JULIE RICE: Well,
that's actually

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.710
one of our core values.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.600
And we say that we are
a culture of "yes."

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.250
Even when the answer is no,
it's every employee's job

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.400
to find the yes in that no.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.990
And it's really the way
that we built the business

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.305
in the beginning.

00:36:30.305 --> 00:36:33.420
We made sure that even if you
hated the experience that we

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.350
delivered for you, we gave
you as many free classes

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.190
as we needed to to make sure
that you had a good experience.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.390
Or if you forgot your
wallet, we took 10 bucks out

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.522
of the register so that
you could take a cab home.

00:36:44.522 --> 00:36:45.980
There was nothing
that we would not

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.063
do in the beginning of
this little business, which

00:36:48.063 --> 00:36:51.720
was located in the rear lobby
of a building with no sign,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.660
to make sure that you
wanted to come back.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.820
And we've really fostered
that within the culture.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.420
And today, and that's
really the way that it goes.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.820
We run an in-house hospitality
and culture and training

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.500
school.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.664
That's really what SoulCycle
is, Right We are just

00:37:07.664 --> 00:37:08.830
a customer service business.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.520
We'd like to think that
whatever the product was

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.280
that we were delivering,
it would really

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.190
be about our customer service.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:19.665
Making our customers matter
is what we say our mission is.

00:37:19.665 --> 00:37:21.040
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Because you do.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.924
JULIE RICE: Yes.

00:37:21.924 --> 00:37:23.590
That's why it's Your
Soul Matters, which

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.830
is our e-mail address
that you write into.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.650
But we really do-- something
that we learned early on

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.420
is that there are so few
experiences that you have

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.280
in the world that are
transactional, where you really

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.600
leave thinking, wow,
somebody cares about me.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.600
And that is absolutely the
focus of our customer service

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.100
program.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.010
We have one very
exceptional employee.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.800
She was our employee number one.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.030
She spends her life as
a cultural researcher.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:54.290
She's all over, figuring
out the best ways

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.290
that we can continue to
innovate the way that we

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:57.160
serve our clients.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.952
And it's really an enormous
focus of our business.

00:38:00.952 --> 00:38:03.410
AUDIENCE: So I actually wanted
to ask you a little bit more

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.052
about some of the negative
connotations of SoulCycle.

00:38:07.052 --> 00:38:08.760
Just to be blunt, I
think a lot of people

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.750
see it as maybe something
for rich, white, hot girls.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.744
[INAUDIBLE] people are maybe
in a similar position as me,

00:38:15.744 --> 00:38:17.440
where I've been to
a lot of classes

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.960
and I actually love
SoulCycle so much,

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.160
but I'm a little
embarrassed that I go.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.759
I maybe don't want
people to know,

00:38:24.759 --> 00:38:27.050
because I don't necessary
like the surrounding culture.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.630
So I'm wondering if you've
thought about confronting that.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.790
Or what you think about
the negative side of it.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.450
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Oh my, god, OK,

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:33.770
can we just talk about
that for a second?

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.300
Because this came up at lunch.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.806
If you love something,
it's OK to love it.

00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:38.930
And it's OK to tell people.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:39.730
I love Google.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.890
I tell everybody
the Google thing.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.920
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.040
Nobody's embarrassed that
they're using Google.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.940
So it's so funny.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.684
I don't know where--
that seems to be

00:38:46.684 --> 00:38:48.350
a little bit of-- I
don't know, have you

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.795
heard that other places?

00:38:49.795 --> 00:38:50.420
JULIE RICE: No.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.440
No, I--

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.260
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Is that phenomenon

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.120
that's happening here?

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.810
Do we need to do some
turn around on this?

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.770
JULIE RICE: Look-- listen--

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.436
AUDIENCE: I definitely
felt [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.260
JULIE RICE: Listen, it's not
an inexpensive experience.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.850
There are a lot of
things that aren't.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.060
You could say the same
thing, right-- people

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.990
get their nails done.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.962
Are people embarrassed
about that?

00:39:11.962 --> 00:39:14.420
You're paying somebody how much
money to polish your nails.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.326
It's not actually making
your heart any stronger.

00:39:17.326 --> 00:39:18.950
You're not actually
any more confident,

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.634
and it chips in two days.

00:39:21.634 --> 00:39:25.120
But I'm not embarrassed, nor
are most of my girlfriends

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.010
that get their nails done.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.432
And so I think it's really--
you could look at anything

00:39:29.432 --> 00:39:30.140
through any lens.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.410
If anything, it
really is something

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.730
that's making people healthier.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.480
And so I don't think
that there's anything

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.820
to be embarrassed about.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.060
ELIZABETH CUTLER: It's
OK to love, everybody.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.130
It's really-- it's OK.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.600
It's OK to love.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.808
JULIE RICE: I don't think so.

00:39:43.808 --> 00:39:45.490
And we certainly--
really, it was

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.147
started from a place of
really wanting to create.

00:39:49.147 --> 00:39:50.480
That's why we have no lights on.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.060
It's why we ride in candlelight.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.752
It's why our instructors are
trained to give you motivation

00:39:55.752 --> 00:39:57.710
and inspiration, and not
tell you that you need

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.710
to work harder or go faster.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.600
It is really built from
a position and a lens

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.540
of love and no judgment.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.920
And it certainly was
never built in mind with,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.920
oh, this is how you should
look if you go there,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.295
or it's sort of
an elitist thing.

00:40:13.295 --> 00:40:17.200
It was absolutely built
in the antithesis of that.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.620
And so for us, I
guess we've never

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.870
really thought of it that way.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.470
Because for us, we think of
it as a place for everybody

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.500
to come and do
their best and just

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.556
feel great about what they're
able to do in the room.

00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:30.264
AUDIENCE: So at Google,
I think we really

00:40:30.264 --> 00:40:35.610
pride ourselves on 10x
thinking and moonshot thinking.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.206
How do we grow things 10x?

00:40:37.206 --> 00:40:39.830
How do we reach for [INAUDIBLE]
that we didn't think

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.530
was attainable.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.190
How do you guys view
that in SoulCycle?

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:48.100
Whether that's how are you going
to gain your next 10x of users,

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.670
or how are you going to expand
outside US values, or however

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.160
you guys are
thinking about that.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.420
JULIE RICE: We should
let Mel answer that.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.044
We don't think about
it at all anymore.

00:40:58.044 --> 00:40:59.650
But Mel is here, our CEO.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.391
And she could
answer that for you.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.980
We think about what song
we want to cool down to.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.771
How do you think
about that, Mel?

00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.604
MELANIE WHELAN: Look,
it's a great question.

00:41:12.604 --> 00:41:13.460
Are you serious?

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.168
JULIE RICE: Yeah!

00:41:14.168 --> 00:41:15.962
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Yes.

00:41:15.962 --> 00:41:18.420
MELANIE WHELAN: I joined Julie
and Elizabeth four years ago

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.692
as the CEO of the company.

00:41:19.692 --> 00:41:21.900
So I've been working with
these guys for a long time.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.020
I've been a total
fangirl since 2008,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.490
when they first set me up on
a bike at West 72nd Street.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.260
And I think one of the
things that has excited us

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.507
and has made us so successful
over the last 10 years

00:41:32.507 --> 00:41:34.340
is we've put one foot
in front of the other.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.881
And we have made sure that every
community that we have built

00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:38.870
has been authentic
and grassroots,

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.460
and every instructor and every
employee that we've hired

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.170
has been part of our
community in the way

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.211
that they're trained and
developed and supported.

00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:47.720
And so I think
these guys have done

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.420
a great job about thinking about
the moon and where that is.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.710
And I think we have some
really clear long-term plans

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.300
for the brand and
for the business.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.880
But what we have
done historically

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.040
is put one foot in
front of the other.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.956
And that's what we're
going to continue to do.

00:41:59.956 --> 00:42:03.330
To make sure that it's really
special if you ride with us.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.760
It's a really
special experience.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.660
And we want to make
sure that whatever we do

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.560
remains really special.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.970
So longer term, we're
focused on three things.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.250
We've talked about
this in our filings.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.896
We are focused on
international growth.

00:42:14.896 --> 00:42:16.770
We are going to take
that one step at a time,

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:20.921
and think about cities not
the global planet as a whole.

00:42:20.921 --> 00:42:22.670
And make sure that we
go into those cities

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.582
in a way that's authentic to our
brand and to those communities.

00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:28.540
We're really excited
about our retail business,

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.660
because we think there's
a lot of legs there.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.330
And we're also
excited about digital.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.538
And it's ironic to sit in
this room with these brains

00:42:34.538 --> 00:42:35.370
and say that.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.090
But we think we've got some
really cool ideas there as

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.850
well, and would love
to talk about that

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.215
with anyone in this room
afterward, any time,

00:42:42.215 --> 00:42:45.260
if anyone wants to
be a part of that.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.790
And then obviously, the
biggest growth platform for us

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.871
is just going to be
keeping the core on track.

00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:51.620
We think we've got a
lot of opportunities,

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.453
a lot of communities
we haven't touched yet.

00:42:53.453 --> 00:42:55.740
And we're just really
excited to keep going.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.740
SASHA ARILANTO: Awesome.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.000
Great question.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.982
Let's do you.

00:43:02.982 --> 00:43:06.180
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
thought of expanding

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.044
to different cardio
machines or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:10.044 --> 00:43:11.835
SASHA ARILANTO: So the
question, for anyone

00:43:11.835 --> 00:43:13.840
who couldn't hear, was, have
you thought about moving

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.048
to different cardio machines?

00:43:15.048 --> 00:43:17.320
So in maybe a different format?

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.440
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
We definitely have.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.120
SoulCycle itself is actually
a format that's-- the Soul

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.842
method, you could really
take it and apply it to a lot

00:43:26.842 --> 00:43:27.550
of things, right?

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.425
What we're trying to
teach you in those rooms

00:43:29.425 --> 00:43:31.730
is really about how to
become your best self,

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.310
how to become your own coach by
making your own internal voice

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.920
strong enough that you can
hear it when you're running

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.460
or swimming or on our bikes.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.950
That's really our
goal for you, is

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.380
to train your mind in a way
that's adaptable to whatever

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.060
you want to do.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.670
And so we've thought about it.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.440
We can't build SoulCycles
fast enough right now.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.696
It's a great problem to have.

00:43:51.696 --> 00:43:54.070
There are so many cities that
we're just dying to get to.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.560
And so we are going
to stay focused

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.960
on the SoulCycle for right now.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.480
But what Elizabeth and
I really love and do

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.680
a lot of day-to-day is
we're still super focused

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.390
on building this brand.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.120
And so we really
think that, by keeping

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.170
the brand itself
vibrant and evolving,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.630
and making sure that our
SoulCycle classes are always

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.760
evolving and continuing
to engage people

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.140
in new and exciting
ways, that at some point,

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.900
if it makes sense for
us to take the Soul

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.150
and put it on a lot of other
things, then we'll do it.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.110
We definitely will

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.460
SASHA ARILANTO: Soul power yoga.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.181
JULIE RICE: Soul everything.

00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:28.264
SASHA ARILANTO: All right.

00:44:28.264 --> 00:44:30.799
Let's do Erica.

00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:31.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.900
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.300
Sasha is actually taking
my first SoulCycle class

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:36.800
next week.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.360
And I was wondering what
your biggest piece of advice

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.670
is for me.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.173
I've never even done
Google Spin at Google.

00:44:43.173 --> 00:44:45.950
So I'm a little nervous, but
I'd love to know your advice.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.783
ELIZABETH CUTLER: I
want to try Google Spin.

00:44:47.783 --> 00:44:48.740
Huh.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.890
That sounds intriguing.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.680
The most important thing is to
get there early, let somebody

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.340
set you up.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.790
We have amazing people
who work in the studios.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.590
And once you clip in
and get on the bike,

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.790
follow the instructions
about where the break is

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.440
and how to get oriented.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.260
And then just let go,
and have the best time.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.017
Let your brain go, let your body
go, and just try to enjoy it.

00:45:09.017 --> 00:45:10.600
That's the best thing
that you can do.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.130
And then it's interesting.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.830
It's like any kind
of physical activity.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.231
Once you do it a
couple of times,

00:45:15.231 --> 00:45:16.730
you get into the
rhythm of doing it,

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.521
and it just starts to
become second nature.

00:45:18.521 --> 00:45:21.130
And that's when you can start
to really push yourself and find

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:22.954
something different
on that bike.

00:45:22.954 --> 00:45:24.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:24.340
ELIZABETH CUTLER: Yeah.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:24.570
Thanks.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.280
I'm excited for you.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:25.570
That's awesome.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.150
SASHA ARILANTO: We've got
enough time for one, maybe

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.470
two more questions here.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.939
Let's go right here.

00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:32.154
AUDIENCE: Can you build
a studio on campus?

00:45:32.154 --> 00:45:33.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.690
SASHA ARILANTO: We actually
got that question before today,

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:36.190
too.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.690
So we have many requests.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:39.690
AUDIENCE: Who would go?

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.150
I would go.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:42.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.907
AUDIENCE: I'll teach
the classes if you want.

00:45:45.907 --> 00:45:47.740
ELIZABETH CUTLER: I
feel it coming together.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.781
JULIE RICE: We might be
able to do it in exchange

00:45:49.781 --> 00:45:51.152
for some digital expertise.

00:45:51.152 --> 00:45:53.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.676
JULIE RICE: Let us know we
should discuss that with.

00:45:56.676 --> 00:45:58.470
SASHA ARILANTO:
[INAUDIBLE] time.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.970
OK.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.568
I think we saw a question here?

00:46:00.568 --> 00:46:03.200
Smiley face?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.100
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
regarding all the competition

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.680
that's come up since SoulCycle's
really hit its stride.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.680
There's reality TV
shows devoted to it.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.940
There are every sort of
spin-off you can imagine.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.450
What is your guys'
growth plan with growing

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.680
against that competition?

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.280
And how do you expect that
to increase or decrease?

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.780
ELIZABETH CUTLER:
Well first of all,

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.990
I just want to say that
genuinely, genuinely, there

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.980
is such a huge, mega-problem
out there that people are not

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.200
moving their bodies.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.670
We have so many
issues-- seriously,

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.740
global issues-- that people
should just start moving.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.780
That's all that matters.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.000
Of course, we want everybody
to ride at SoulCycle.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.020
But it is absolutely
just great that people

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.290
are-- this is a conversation.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.200
My parents drank and smoked.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.080
That was their fitness activity.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.610
How far can I lift my glass?

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.240
Yeah, I know.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.150
So you've seen that kind
of change in just 30 years.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.140
It's a pretty big
deal, actually.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.040
And it's amazing that
people are having

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.470
that kind of consciousness
and realizing, oh my god,

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:03.240
I have one body.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.530
I should take care of it.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.220
And the fact that people are
getting inspired by the work

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.090
that we do.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.340
We take our intellectual
property very, very seriously.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.910
And so bad actors
will be prosecuted.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.170
But that being said,
I think it's great

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.610
that this is happening.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.860
I think we both feel that way.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.097
I think we all feel that way.

00:47:22.097 --> 00:47:23.430
JULIE RICE: We learned early on.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.717
In the beginning, we used
to see imitators come out,

00:47:26.717 --> 00:47:28.550
and we would make
ourselves mental about it.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.360
And somebody once said to
us, high road, long view.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.790
And I still have a
sticker on my phone.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.650
I move it from phone
case to phone case.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:42.450
But I do think that we try
to make the decisions that

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.920
are best for us.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.779
And I think that in
business, in general,

00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:48.320
when you start to look around
at what other people are doing,

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.220
and you make
decisions, in your life

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.670
or in your business
or anything, that

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.490
are about comparing
yourself, or doing something

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.070
as a reaction to what
somebody else is doing,

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:01.540
then it's not going
to work for you.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.850
You stay in your lane, and
you make the decisions that

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.016
are right for your business.

00:48:05.016 --> 00:48:06.917
And so we really
do-- we appreciate

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:08.000
what's going on around us.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.530
As Elizabeth said,
it's a phenomenon,

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.696
and more people are getting
healthier because of it.

00:48:11.696 --> 00:48:14.770
But really, we put our heads
down and we stay in our lane,

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.076
and we just keep going.

00:48:17.076 --> 00:48:18.870
We created it for
us in the beginning,

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.380
and we continue to create the
stuff that we think is great,

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.879
and we hope other people are
going to think it's great, too.

00:48:23.879 --> 00:48:25.690
SASHA ARILANTO:
It's irreplaceable.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.620
There's not the competitor's
founders here at Google.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.530
So you guys have got
the special sauce.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.880
I want to say one
last thank you.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.290
And let's hear it.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.880
Have a round of applause.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.610
Thank you.
