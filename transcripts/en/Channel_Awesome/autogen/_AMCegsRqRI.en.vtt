00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
bit more motion in the animation there
 

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.940 align:start position:0%
bit more motion in the animation there
they're<00:19:54.660><c> not</c><00:19:54.810><c> quite</c><00:19:55.230><c> so</c><00:19:55.260><c> still</c><00:19:55.710><c> all</c><00:19:55.920><c> the</c><00:19:56.040><c> time</c>
