1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,160
I understand and agree with all your
thoughts and principles. However,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,750
however I interpret your concepts for
leaders leading men were mostly driven or

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:17,100
other leaders who have a desire to make
themselves better in maintaining the

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,990
status. Yup. So common misperception,

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,400
right? Is that, you know
the military and the seals,

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,520
I see this all time. Everyone thinks
that the military in the seals,

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,320
I think that we're leading
terminator robots, right?

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,880
And everyone is just driven
and they're going to get up.

9
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,900
They're going to do everything.
And it's,

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,110
I just talked about this on the
last podcast. It is a bell curve.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,370
It is a bell curve and there's a great
bunch of guys at the top of the bell

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,120
curve that are go getters. There's a
solid bunch of guys in the middle of it.

13
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,660
It is the lower guys that are bumps.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,300
And so this interpretation that the
concepts that I talk about are just for

15
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,910
leading these front,

16
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:01,230
running a personalities that
just make everything happen.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,230
N Not correct.
You know,

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,480
there are seals that don't want to work.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,790
There are seals that
want to take shortcuts.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,610
There are seals that want to
skate by then you get outside,

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,660
then you're working with Iraqi soldiers
that are unmotivated, untrained,

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,350
poorly equipped. We got to work
with these guys. We got bosses.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,360
I mean I've got bosses in the seal teams
that are either an egomaniac or that

24
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:28,140
are old, true risk averse. You could
have any of this stuff going on.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,720
You can have your guys
that are risk averse.

26
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,070
You can have guys that are too crazy.
You got all, you know what they are.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,150
They're humans, they're
individuals, they're human beings.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,120
And because they're human beings, even in
special operations, and sometimes it is,

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,770
especially in in special operations,
cause when you get in special operations,

30
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:50,820
you could guys that have huge
egos and attitudes and so,

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,970
oh you think that they just want to
do whatever you tell them to do? No,

32
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,860
they got their own idea.
They got to call their own method.

33
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,930
They got their own plan.
They got their own, what?

34
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,990
They think they're a tactical genius.
So you got to get around that.

35
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,150
So what does it mean?
It means you have to lead them.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,660
And it's the common theme that
I'm talking about all the time.

37
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,730
And what does that mean?
You've got to build relationships,

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,870
you've got to build the trust,

39
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,150
you've got to make sure they understand
why they're doing what they're doing.

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,610
You've got to make sure they
understand the strategic and back.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,170
You got to empower them. You gotta set a
good example. You gotta listen to them.

42
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,270
You got to take input, you got
to give them responsibility. And,

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,110
and when I say responsibility,
I mean real responsibility.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,160
You've got to build them up.
You got to make them better.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,850
You gotta show them and let them see.

46
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,370
Not In a, not in a, in your face way,

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,610
but you've got to subtly let them see
what self improvement means to them and

48
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,370
how they can better their position
and what drive we'll get them.

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,490
You got to give them ownership of stuff
and you've got to let that ownership

50
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:00,370
grow into extreme ownership where
they really want to own things.

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,640
You got to teach them to lead and you've
got to put them in leadership positions

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,020
and you've got to show your trust by
actually following them. Sometimes

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,900
and again, people ask me these
questions, you know how I'm a new leader?

54
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,800
How do I lead? I got a new person. How
do I lead them? It's the same answers.

55
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,380
It's the same answers all the time.
The principles of leadership.

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,810
Now the nuances are there.
Yes,

57
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,680
the nuances are there and I have to nuance
for echo that I got a nuance for this

58
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,840
guy over here and I got to New
Orleans for this group over here.

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,610
The the nuances are there, but the basic
principles are the same. Am I never,

60
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,740
am I going to?
Who am I going to be in charge of that?

61
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm not going to try and build a
relationship of trust with them. Who?

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,010
Who's that dancers? Nobody. You know?
Who is it that I don't want to set?

63
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,900
A good example for the answer is nobody.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,070
Who is it that I'm not going to listen to?
If you don't listen to people,

65
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,560
you alienate them. You don't want
to be part of the team. I mean it's,

66
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,910
if the things are universal,
and again,

67
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:59,320
there's nuances because you might have to
make adaptations. And you know, when we,

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,780
when we did battle
leadership with, uh, with uh,

69
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,430
Adolf von Shell and he talks about
distinctly these three different types of

70
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,230
commanders and how the boss gave them
each their own little adjusted order

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,590
because he was dealing with
their personalities. So yes,

72
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,820
you've got to deal with the personalities,

73
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,110
but that doesn't mean you're doing
something different from the principals.

74
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,063
So

75
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,290
when you get, sure, when you get
to the bottom of the bell curve,

76
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,360
you might see some people that
might need to be replaced.

77
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,730
They might need to be removed,
but I'll tell you what,

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,030
most likely they just need to be led.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,153
Mm.

80
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,090
The reason that our,
I think one of the reasons why it,

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,310
the perception is that all your
guys are robots and you know,

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,550
I'm going to give you an order. They
follow it. No questions that is,

83
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,510
is like movies, right? Like a few good
men membered Jack Nicholson. He's like,

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,220
people will follow orders or people die.
That was his thing.

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,220
And they say that kind of
stuff. Yeah. And but they do,

86
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,660
they do capture it in some Hollywood
movies where they show how mutinies take

87
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:11,930
place and how things go
wrong and how, you know, the,

88
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,770
the new lieutenant Vietnam is going
to get fragged by his own people.

89
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,740
That stuff's real. Yeah.
You know, that stuff's real.

90
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,260
So it's just, it, it's, it's
a misperception. The other,

91
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,320
the other misperception is because of
boot camp, a lot of military movies are,

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,470
they show up, they show a significant
amount of time in bootcamp,

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,710
but bootcamp is a matter of
weeks in a career. You know,

94
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,660
I think the Marine Corps
bootcamp is 13 weeks.

95
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,180
I think the army bootcamp is 10 weeks.

96
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,250
Bootcamp is a very short period of time
in your four year, six year, eight year,

97
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,530
10 year, 20 year career
bootcamp is, you know,

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,340
I talked about the indoctrinational
times in the military.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,580
They have very short periods of
time compared to your whole career.

100
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,390
And in bootcamp when your drill
instructor says dropdown and do pushups,

101
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,850
you drop down and do pushups in bootcamp
when you're Joan instructor says,

102
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,380
pickup that, you know, make your
bed, you make your bed when these,

103
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,111
and if you don't,

104
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,600
they yell at you and they yell at
you until you do make your bed.

105
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,700
So people get that idea that that's
the way the military is run. Yeah.

106
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,820
And that is like, you know, a great
example is full metal jacket than movie,

107
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,020
which is a great movie.

108
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,490
But the boot camp scene is half the movie.

109
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,110
But in reality, even if you are
a guy in, in Vietnam, you know,

110
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,500
boot campus 13 weeks and then you
went onto, into Vietnam for a year.

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,720
So it's a fraction of what
your real career is like. And,

112
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,390
and so people get that impression that
you're just going to be able to bark

113
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,560
orders. Everyone's gonna listen to you.
It just doesn't work that way. Yeah.

114
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,070
And there's actually, there's a
great, there's a great video. Um,

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,080
it's called Charlie
Company and V, uh, anyways,

116
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,050
I forget the name of the video,
but it's about a company in Vietnam,

117
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:58,400
Charlie Company. And maybe if you
remind me, I'll put it on the,

118
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,810
on the website. Um, it shows
two company commanders.

119
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,080
But anyways, to make a long
story short, these guys,

120
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,870
they don't like their
new company commander.

121
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,970
And at first they're resistant to
him and you know, he says, listen,

122
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,160
these guys could go to learn that there's
going to have to do. And I tell him,

123
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,390
and then it fast forwards a couple months
and they interview him again and he

124
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,380
goes, hey, you know, how's
everything going? He goes, you know,

125
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,410
they get it now and they realize that
they just had to listen to me and do what

126
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:28,160
I told them.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,210
And then they go out in the field with
the guys and the guys in the fueled,

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,040
they're supposed to be doing things and
they're just not doing, they're just,

129
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,190
they're literally calling back like, yeah,
where did we did, yeah, we did a patrol.

130
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,090
They didn't do it. Yeah,
we moved positions. They
didn't move positions. Yeah.

131
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:47,180
We're going to do another, you
know, another foot patrol tonight,

132
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,163
they're not doing it.

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,950
So he was under the impression that
everyone had like buckled to his will.

134
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,460
They were just completely
snowing him and he had no idea.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,370
So that's what happens in the military.

136
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,020
If you're don't lead your people and
you just order them around and you think

137
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,220
that everyone's just this, this, uh, this,
uh, well, how would they describe it here?

138
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,440
Men who are mostly driven or leaders who
have a desire to make themselves better.

139
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,010
I mean, if anybody in a
position with guys like that,

140
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,710
it's going to the leadership job,
it's going to be very easy.

141
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,950
You just tell them what to do
when they do it. Right. I mean,

142
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:26,240
I could give you example upon example
upon example of stuff in the seal teams

143
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:30,290
were what I had to do to get people
convinced that this was the right thing to

144
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:35,150
deal. You know, I mean, it
is like, you know, a classic
example is telling guys, okay,

145
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:39,080
we're gonna take Iraqi soldiers
on every operation. You know?

146
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,250
So these guys were saying, are you kidding
me? Well, they just didn't go, hey,

147
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,650
cool Jocko. We'll do exactly
what you tell us. No, they look,

148
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,320
what are you talking about raw taking
these guys out, why would we do that?

149
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,180
It's going to be risky. These guys
aren't trustworthy. They don't,

150
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,480
they're not trained. Right. They had
a million reasons why not to do that.

151
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,870
But how do you get them to do it?

152
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,980
You explain to them why you explained
to them the strategic importance.

153
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,050
You have built trust with them.

154
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,750
You tell them that they're going
to take ownership of the Iraqis.

155
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,910
I mean it's everything that I just said.
That's what you do.

156
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,290
That's a classic example.
So yes,

157
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,650
once again, you have, if you're
in a leadership position,

158
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,810
you have to lead.

159
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,930
You ever seen the movie saving
Private Ryan? Yes. Yeah.

160
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:28,610
There was a part in then and
that movie that um, that they,

161
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,050
they weren't down for the orders.

162
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,960
Remember that way it was kind of like
a little pivotal part where they were

163
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:36,500
going to go take a, a machine
gun nest and they were like, man,

164
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,320
we don't have to do this. So they all kind
of got together and said, hey, you know,

165
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,920
seems like unnecessary risks.
And he's like,

166
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,180
he kind of tripped out a little bit and
kind of forced them to do it and they

167
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:47,300
were like, all right, whatever.

168
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,030
Kind of reluctantly than one of the
guys died and stuff. But anyway,

169
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,280
that's an example of where the,
yeah,

170
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,200
and especially, you know when you were
just doing a talking about world war one,

171
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,590
that one portion of the book
where he says, you know what,

172
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,320
we got ordered to do this thing. I didn't
feel good about it but it was an order,

173
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:06,430
we're going to do it. So there's
examples from the past, especially where,

174
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,000
you know,

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,120
it's definitely was more like that in
the past and bobble on one obviously.

176
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:13,600
It was like that obviously it was like
that unfortunately it was like that. Yeah.

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,070
Because it caused people to continue,
you know,

178
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,140
to execute these operations that
we're just going to get people killed.

179
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,570
And you know, actually Lafe and I
were talking about that last week,

180
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,350
Pickett's charge, get
tickets, charge Gettysburg.

181
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,260
They sent the troops up and they got
slaughtered and they can, you know,

182
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,560
they're survivors came back
in, uh, Lee was, you know,

183
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:43,450
basically in tears like, Hey, I'm sorry
this happened. I, this was my fault.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
He took ownership of it and I hope
I'm getting the story right. Um,

185
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,720
but, but that's the,
that's the general, uh,

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,480
the general gist of the
story. But then the, you know,

187
00:10:56,481 --> 00:11:01,100
the big story was that the guys were like,
hey, we'll go again if you, you know,

188
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:05,540
cause you're such a great leader
will go again. And Life, you know,

189
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,240
was kind of like the know that's what
world war, you know, that's what,

190
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,860
that's what happened. That shows you
that guys were willing and I said,

191
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,710
you have about the differences in
world war one. They sent them again,

192
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,090
they sent them over and over. You
know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry,

193
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,340
and I did something that got you to
go, you know, a bunch of guys killed.

194
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:26,200
It's horrible in World War One. And like,
yeah, it happened going again. Yeah.

195
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,810
Oh yeah. And that happens again. We're
doing it again and again and again.

196
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:33,830
And it's just, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll,

197
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,060
I'll always just be horrified
by that and hopefully, um,

198
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,450
man progress's beyond that.
And again,

199
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,670
part of that is as a person
you have to question,

200
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,860
you have to be a rebel.

201
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,730
You have to question what people are
telling you and why they're telling it to

202
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:57,100
you. If my boss doesn't tell
me why I'm doing my operation,

203
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,570
it's and I continue to execute it, that's
my fault. I need raise my hand and say,

204
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,420
boss of what are we doing? Why are
we doing this? I don't understand.

205
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,520
You got to take that initiative because
if you're just blindly following orders,

206
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,400
I don't want somebody that's
blindly following orders.

207
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,220
I never want people that blindly follow
my orders. I want people that say, oh,

208
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,020
get boss, wait, why are we doing
this? Why is this happening?

209
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,910
Because I want people to,
I want think.

210
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:26,260
I want leaders underneath me that
know how to lead. And you know what,

211
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:30,670
when you build the trust and
you build the relationships,

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,050
those guys will do anything for you and
my guys. And my task is they do anything.

213
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean,
I know it.

214
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
They did over and over again did
operations that were crazy and hard and

215
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:48,250
dangerous and risky. Never
did anyone say odd. You know,

216
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,150
we're not doing this. They said, okay,
we understand. Well, what's the mission?

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,510
All right,
so you've got to build that road.

218
00:12:56,511 --> 00:13:00,250
It's against the same basic
principles of leading human beings,

219
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,870
and that's what you gotta do.

220
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:05,020
But to think that you're just going to
order people to do things, not happening.

221
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,070
Long answer to a, to a good question.
That was actually interesting perspective.

222
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:15,850
And I know it's a perspective that a
lot of people have. People always think,

223
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,120
well, you know, you led seals and
they're aliens, so that was easy.

224
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,320
But before you said, before you told
me, that's kind of what I figured. Yeah.
