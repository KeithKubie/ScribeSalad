00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:02.304
- [Presenter] I'm here with
Jeffrey Rosen, the head

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:04.902
of the National Constitution
Center in Philadelphia,

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:07.034
and what I wanna talk about
in this video, Jeffery,

00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:10.118
is how has the powers of the president,

00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:13.475
how have they changed over
time since the ratification

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:14.765
of the Constitution?

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.429
- [Jeffery] Well, they've hugely expanded

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.852
and it's so striking that the
Framers of the Constitution

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.626
were concerned that Congress
would be the most dangerous

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:23.731
branch and they were
so concerned about that

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:26.302
that they split Congress
in two and created

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:29.073
this bicameral legislature,
the House and Senate,

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:30.865
in order to divide its powers.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.968
They would have been stunned
to learn that the president

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.924
is twice as powerful as Congress today.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:40.943
They created a unitary
executive because they were less

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:44.178
concerned about Executive
than congressional tyranny

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.841
and it's really interesting
to think about why that,

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:47.923
why that happened.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.022
- [Presenter] What do you
mean by the president today

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:51.663
is twice as powerful as Congress?

00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:54.076
- [Jeffery] Well, I guess
that was a hypothesis,

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:57.826
but it's arguable that,
having assumed powers

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:02.596
to deploy troops without
congressional authorization

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.363
to target and kill
American citizens abroad,

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:08.926
to engage in Executive
orders without congressional

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.451
approval, critics of the
expansion of presidential power

00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.686
say that the president has
usurped congressional authority,

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:19.209
he's exceeded his power
under the Take Care Clause

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:23.415
of Article II, Section
3 of the Constitution

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.309
and that in this way,
presidential authority has hugely

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:30.498
expanded while congressional
authority has contracted.

00:01:30.498 --> 00:01:31.504
- [Presenter] I see.

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:34.915
And what are, I mean, what
are the dynamics that allowed

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:37.145
this to happen over the
last several hundred years?

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:38.976
- [Jeffery] Well,
there's a wonderful essay

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:41.052
on the National Constitution Center's

00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:43.636
Interactive Constitution by
William Marshall and it's,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.480
you can find it if you click
on Article II, Section 3,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.860
and William Marshall
is trying to figure out

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.682
what some of these dynamics
were, and he comes up with

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:54.236
a bunch of reasons why the
president has been so dominant.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.470
First, he says political
culture, the president

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.167
has become the focus of
national power and culture

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:03.334
in a way that he wasn't in a
pre-internet, pre-television,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.170
pre-radio age, and this
was the case even during

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:11.135
World War II when Justice Jackson

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.548
Steel Seizure Case that
we talked about before,

00:02:13.548 --> 00:02:16.323
talk about Executive
power having the advantage

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.216
of concentration in a
single head in who's choice

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.455
a whole nation has a
part, making him a focus

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:23.124
of public hopes and expectations.

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:26.992
But there's no question that
the focus on the individual

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:31.266
person of the presidency
has vastly expanded.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.521
- [Presenter] It's just this idea

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.958
that there's one person there,

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.943
people associate that
person, hey, they're our

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:38.133
Head of State, they put their
hopes and fears on that person

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.688
and that just gives them
inherently more power.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.695
- [Jeffery] It does and
you can call it culture,

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:46.160
you can call it celebrity,
but it's so striking that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.935
the Framers are so concerned
that the president not be

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.980
a king and they reject
Alexander Hamilton's suggestion,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.989
which again (chuckles)
we know from the musical,

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.843
that the president be elected for life.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.302
They wanna have four year terms
and then the, subsequently,

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:01.566
a Constitutional amendment is
passed, the 22nd Amendment,

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.687
to limit the president to only two terms,

00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:08.353
and despite all that, the
presidency has expanded so much.

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.686
It's not only the political culture.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:13.835
Marshall points to a
bunch of other reasons.

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.065
Executive branch precedence,
basically every president

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:20.440
has been successful in
asserting increasingly sweeping

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.833
exercises of executive power.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.945
This is a bipartisan phenomenon
from President Clinton

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:29.207
to George W. Bush, to President Obama,

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:32.329
the Office of Legal Counsel
in the Justice Department

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.204
has authorized increasingly
sweeping exercise

00:03:36.204 --> 00:03:39.443
of executive authority,
and we find presidents

00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:41.838
of both parties either
criticised or praised

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:45.131
for having established these
executive branch precedence.

00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:46.554
There's also just the expan--

00:03:46.554 --> 00:03:47.727
- And just to make sure.
- Yeah.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.241
- [Presenter] I wish
to understand, I mean,

00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.693
it's just this idea that even
if you were just president,

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:54.040
I come in into office, I
might even be more restrained,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.193
but then the next guy or, or
gal (chuckles) that comes in

00:03:57.193 --> 00:03:59.786
can cite you presidency
and say hey, he did it,

00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:02.356
why shouldn't I be able
to do it, so there's this,

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.528
it's never gonna go back.

00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:05.474
Precedent will never take you,
take powers away, (chuckles)

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:06.478
they'll only add to them.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.459
- [Jeffery] That's exactly
right and this really important,

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.049
but not so well known office,
the Office of Legal Counsel,

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.770
which several Supreme Court
Justices have been the head of,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.267
is, basically, a mini-Supreme
Court for the executive branch

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.552
and it issues opinions about
what the president can do

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.443
and those opinions are relied
on by subsequent presidents

00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:25.356
to justify the expansion
of executive power.

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:27.030
- [Presenter] Fascinating.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.234
- [Jeffery] Not all presidents
have taken this view.

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:32.913
I'm writing a book, now,
about William Howard Taft

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:34.984
who was the only president
who went on to become

00:04:34.984 --> 00:04:36.745
Chief Justice and he thought,
he had a very literalist

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.982
or judicial conception of the presidency,

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:40.659
he thought the president could only do

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.603
what the Constitution
explicitly authorized.

00:04:42.603 --> 00:04:45.313
He refused to take actions
that he thought weren't

00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:47.724
authorized by the Constitution,
and in this sense,

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.426
he gives us a vision of
what a more constitutionally

00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:53.132
constrained presidency would look like.

00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:55.247
- [Presenter] But even though he did that,

00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:57.517
as we were just talking about,
people who came after Taft

00:04:57.517 --> 00:04:59.369
could just cite people before
Taft (chuckles) and say--

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.029
- [Jeffery] Absolutely right,
and Taft's predecessor,

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.363
Theodore Roosevelt, had the
most sweeping conception

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:06.363
of the presidency.

00:05:06.363 --> 00:05:08.429
He said the president can
do whatever the Constitution

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:12.347
doesn't explicitly forbid and
his stewardship conception

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:14.702
of the presidency definitely
has been vindicated by time

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:17.241
and you'd have to say
presidents today are much more

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:20.180
Rooseveltian than they are the heirs

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.388
of William Howard Taft. (chuckles)

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:22.441
- [Presenter] Yep.

00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:23.703
What other dynamics are at play?

00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:25.464
We talk about political
culture that celebrity

00:05:25.464 --> 00:05:28.149
into one person, this precedent
that keeps expanding powers.

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:29.022
What else?

00:05:29.022 --> 00:05:30.967
- [Jeffery] Well, there's
the huge expansion

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:32.507
of the Federal government,
and the administrative state,

00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:35.042
and the growth of the executive agencies

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:36.604
in the post-New Deal period from

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:38.530
the Environmental Protection Agency,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.599
and even progressive-era agencies,

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.463
like the Federal Trade Commission
or the Federal Reserve,

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:47.225
and work place safety,
National Park management,

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.514
smoke stack emissions, college sports.

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:52.058
There's almost no area of American life

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:54.668
that these executive
agencies don't regulate.

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.647
The president, by appointing
the head of these agencies

00:05:57.647 --> 00:05:59.623
and having the ability to fire them,

00:05:59.623 --> 00:06:02.873
can issue executive orders
that have the force of law,

00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:04.872
even though they're
not passed by Congress,

00:06:04.872 --> 00:06:06.762
and that can lead to
really dramatic clashes

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:09.177
between the president's
use of executive orders

00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:11.263
and what Congress says
that it actually intended,

00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:13.781
as we've seen during the
Obama administration.

00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.704
So that's a big factor, as well.

00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:16.966
- [Presenter] Yep.

00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:19.406
And what other dynamics are there?

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:21.881
- [Jeffery] Well, the modern
world is moving a lot faster,

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.272
in an age of the internet
and instant communication,

00:06:24.272 --> 00:06:26.502
there are a lot more emergencies,

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:30.329
attacks are much more
sudden than they were

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.989
at the time of the framing

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:33.432
and have to be repelled more quickly,

00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:35.232
so just the speed of contemporary life

00:06:35.232 --> 00:06:38.758
has led to the president to
assert new emergency powers.

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:41.484
And then, finally, and I'm just
tracking William Marshall's

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.386
great essay, here, there's
the rise of partisan politics.

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:46.769
Because of Congress becoming so polarized,

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:49.505
often people in Congress
see their responsibility

00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:52.279
to support their party
rather than to take seriously

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.555
their Constitutional
or institutional duties

00:06:55.555 --> 00:07:00.215
as legislatures, so they may
be unwilling to, or check

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:03.148
the president's power when
their party is in the majority,

00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:05.343
they're just willing to write
the president a blank check

00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:09.176
when he happens to be a
member of their party.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.716
- [Presenter] And I can see
that when it's the same party

00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:15.055
in charge of Congress and the presidency,

00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:17.177
but what about when it's
the other way around?

00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:20.129
Obviously, in recent time
it seems like the, Congress

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.624
is being very effective

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:23.056
at limiting presidential power.

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:23.889
- [Jeffery] Well--

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.147
- [Presenter] Because
of partisan politics.

00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:26.634
- [Jeffery] You do have
either congressional inaction

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:30.283
or refusal to act on
presidential proposals,

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:35.040
but often, critics of
congressional inaction complain

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.207
Congress is refusing to veto
bills, for example, or sorry,

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.704
to override presidential vetos
or to refuse to pass laws

00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:45.263
on constitutional grounds.

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.551
Instead, they're filing lawsuits,
they're kicking things up

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:48.549
to the court.

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:51.022
When President Obama
issued his executive orders

00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:54.371
about immigration, there
was a lawsuit filed.

00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:57.552
So, increasingly, the judiciary
is becoming the arbiter

00:07:57.552 --> 00:08:00.217
about disputes between
Congress and the president.

00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:02.451
The Framers expected a
much more direct clash

00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:05.017
between the president and
Congress and thought that both

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:08.225
of those branches of
government would make decisions

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:10.206
on constitutional grounds
and would directly

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:11.376
check each other.

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:13.394
- [Presenter] It's this idea
that instead of Congress

00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:16.631
passing legislation and then
the president either signing

00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:19.688
them or vetoing them, that
when you have this gridlock,

00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:21.957
that the president starts
taking more executive orders,

00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:24.069
and then Congress take
the president to court

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:25.012
(laughter)
over them.

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:26.517
- [Jeffery] That's very well stated

00:08:26.517 --> 00:08:29.437
and that's definitely not
what the Framers intended.

00:08:29.437 --> 00:08:31.645
- [Presenter] This is
really, just to go over them

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.577
once again, when you just
have one person in charge,

00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:36.099
and this is, it starts with Washington

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.436
who was this huge personality,
obviously American hero,

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:44.474
and so that, by itself, put a
lot of power in the president.

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:47.594
Then every president
comes along and maybe does

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.122
a little bit more (chuckles)

00:08:49.122 --> 00:08:50.725
than the ones that came before it.

00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:52.475
And then anyone can cite that president,

00:08:52.475 --> 00:08:54.166
hey, he pulled it off, why can't I?

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.338
As you mentioned, the
Federal Government is far,

00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:59.467
far, far larger than
it was in the time of,

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.913
when the Constitution was written

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:04.514
and in the time of
Washington, and just the speed

00:09:04.514 --> 00:09:06.759
with which things are
happening, it's necessary

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:09.863
for a president to, whether
it's in war, or regulation,

00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:12.093
or other things, to just be
able to take action quickly.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.362
And then finally, partisan
politics, I guess,

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:16.481
that one could, it seems that
could be debated either way

00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:18.591
depending on which parties
are in power where,

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.481
but it is fascinating, it
does seem like this has been

00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:23.222
a very clear trend over time.

00:09:23.222 --> 00:09:24.221
- [Jeffery] It's true.

00:09:24.221 --> 00:09:26.805
Those are all great reasons
offered by William Marshall

00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:28.525
in his interactive Constitution essay.

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:30.917
There's one other factor
and that is the fact

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:32.662
that both branches, the
president and Congress,

00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:35.320
are not evaluating their actions
on constitutional grounds

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.517
the way they used to.

00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:39.692
The president has the veto
power under Article I, Section 7

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:43.859
and at the time of the framing,
the presidents often issued

00:09:45.153 --> 00:09:48.044
vetos on constitutional grounds.

00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:51.063
President Andrew Jackson
who vetoed the re-chartering

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:53.645
of the second bank of the
United States vetoed it

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:57.279
on the grounds that he could veto any bill

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.675
that he considered
unconstitutional and he sided

00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:02.228
with Thomas Jefferson's view that the bank

00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:04.275
was unconstitutional,
rejecting the view of Hamilton

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:06.532
and George Washington that is was okay.

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:09.433
But nowadays, presidents
tend not to issue vetos

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:12.162
on constitutional grounds
and Congress tends not to

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:15.147
debate bill in constitutional
terms and as a result,

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.876
critics on both sides of the aisle say

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:21.791
both branches are exceeding
their constitutional powers

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:24.867
and failing adequately to check
the constitutional excesses

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:25.998
of the other branch.

00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:27.220
- [Presenter] That's fascinating,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.111
something I never fully appreciated that,

00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.612
what you mentioned is historically,
Washington, and Adams,

00:10:31.612 --> 00:10:33.966
and Jefferson, they viewed
their veto as kind of like

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.827
a light Supreme Court, a
little bit, like is this

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:38.029
constitutional or not, and
that's why I'll veto it.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:39.946
But then later presidents
started to say, no,

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:41.818
if I just disagree with it,
I just think it's a bad law,

00:10:41.818 --> 00:10:43.014
I will veto.

00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:45.290
- [Jeffery] Absolutely, and
this idea that the Supreme Court

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.465
is the sole authority,
arbiter, of constitutional,

00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.891
of the constitutionality of laws

00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:53.356
would've surprised the Framers.

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:55.120
They had a theory of departmentalism.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.646
They thought that all three
branches had an obligation

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.331
to evaluate the constitutionality of laws,

00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:02.586
that Congress, when they passed a bill,

00:11:02.586 --> 00:11:03.901
the president, when he signed it,

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:05.266
and the courts, when they reviewed it,

00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:06.814
and only when all three branches agreed,

00:11:06.814 --> 00:11:08.199
could a law go into effect.

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:11.566
But that, now, we tend to punt
all constitutional questions

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:14.051
to the Supreme Court and
that has left something

00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:17.563
of a vacuum on the side of the
president and the Congress.

00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.637
- [Presenter] Well, thanks
so much for this, Jeff.

00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:20.470
- [Jeffery] Thank you.
