00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.700
What we have drawn over here
is five different triangles.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.530
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.660
is figure out which
of these triangles

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.360
are congruent to which
other of these triangles.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.110
And to figure that
out, I'm just over here

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.466
going to write our triangle
congruency postulate.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.840
So we know that
two triangles are

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.300
congruent if all of their
sides are the same-- so

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.940
side, side, side.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.170
We also know they are congruent
if we have a side and then

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.960
an angle between the sides
and then another side that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.170
is congruent-- so
side, angle, side.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.980
If we reverse the
angles and the sides,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.110
we know that's also a
congruence postulate.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.650
So if we have an angle
and then another angle

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.080
and then the side in
between them is congruent,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.360
then we also have two
congruent triangles.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.280
And then finally, if we
have an angle and then

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000
another angle and
then a side, then that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.790
is also-- any of these
imply congruency.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.565
So let's see our
congruent triangles.

00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:53.690
So let's see what we can
figure out right over here

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.350
for these triangles.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
So right in this
triangle ABC over here,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.910
we're given this length 7,
then 60 degrees, and then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.460
40 degrees.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.834
Or another way to
think about it,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:07.480
we're given an angle, an angle
and a side-- 40 degrees, then

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.760
60 degrees, then 7.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.950
And in order for something
to be congruent here,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.300
they would have to have an
angle, angle, side given--

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.200
at least, unless maybe
we have to figure it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.270
out some other way.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.790
But I'm guessing
for this problem,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.590
they'll just already
give us the angle.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.190
So they'll have to have an
angle, an angle, and side.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.220
And it can't just be any
angle, angle, and side.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.260
It has to be 40, 60, and 7, and
it has to be in the same order.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.850
It can't be 60 and
then 40 and then 7.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.710
If the 40-degree side
has-- if one of its sides

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.610
has the length 7, then that
is not the same thing here.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.777
Here, the 60-degree
side has length 7.

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:41.610
So let's see if any of
these other triangles

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.220
have this kind of 40,
60 degrees, and then

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190
the 7 right over here.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.730
So this has the 40 degrees
and the 60 degrees,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.939
but the 7 is in between them.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.604
So this looks like
it might be congruent

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:53.780
to some other triangle,
maybe closer to something

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.280
like angle, side,
angle because they

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.550
have an angle, side, angle.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.060
So it wouldn't be that one.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.320
This one looks interesting.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.842
This is also angle, side, angle.

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:03.300
So maybe these are congruent,
but we'll check back on that.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.870
We're still focused on
this one right over here.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.190
And this one, we have a 60
degrees, then a 40 degrees,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.340
and a 7.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.110
This is tempting.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.074
We have an angle, an
angle, and a side,

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:15.740
but the angles are
in a different order.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.450
Here it's 40, 60, 7.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.629
Here it's 60, 40, 7.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.170
So it's an angle,
an angle, and side,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.460
but the side is not on
the 60-degree angle.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.270
It's on the 40-degree
angle over here.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.040
So this doesn't
look right either.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880
Here we have 40 degrees,
60 degrees, and then 7.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.870
So this is looking pretty good.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.670
We have this side
right over here

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.310
is congruent to this
side right over here.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.754
Then you have your 60-degree
angle right over here.

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:49.670
It might not be obvious,
because it's flipped,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.125
and they're drawn a
little bit different.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.170
But you should never assume
that just the drawing

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.770
tells you what's going on.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.860
And then finally, you have
your 40-degree angle here,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.220
which is your
40-degree angle here.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.924
So we can say-- we can
write down-- and let

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:05.340
me think of a good
place to do it.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830
I'll write it right over here.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.345
We can write down that triangle
ABC is congruent to triangle--

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:16.040
and now we have to be very
careful with how we name this.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.415
We have to make
sure that we have

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:21.280
the corresponding
vertices map up together.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.210
So for example, we started
this triangle at vertex A.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.030
So point A right
over here, that's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.660
where we have the
60-degree angle.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.030
That's the vertex of
the 60-degree angle.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.490
So the vertex of the 60-degree
angle over here is point N.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.490
So I'm going to go to N.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.630
And then we went from A to B. B
was the vertex that we did not

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.990
have any angle for.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.170
And we could figure it out.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.919
If these two guys add
up to 100, then this

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.840
is going to be the
80-degree angle.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.510
So over here, the
80-degree angle

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.360
is going to be M, the one that
we don't have any label for.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.060
It's kind of the
other side-- it's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.960
the thing that shares the 7
length side right over here.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.239
So then we want to go to
N, then M-- sorry, NM--

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.780
and then finish up
the triangle in O.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.226
And I want to
really stress this,

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.600
that we have to make sure we
get the order of these right

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.110
because then we're referring
to-- we're not showing

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.490
the corresponding
vertices in each triangle.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.990
Now we see vertex
A, or point A, maps

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.940
to point N on this
congruent triangle.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.600
Vertex B maps to
point M. And so you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.540
can say, look, the length
of AB is congruent to NM.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.546
So it all matches up.

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:30.920
And we can say
that these two are

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.500
congruent by angle,
angle, side, by AAS.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.570
So we did this one, this
one right over here,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.720
is congruent to this
one right over there.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.390
And now let's look at
these two characters.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.600
So here we have an angle, 40
degrees, a side in between,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.650
and then another angle.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.290
So it looks like ASA is
going to be involved.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.540
We look at this one
right over here.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.672
We have 40 degrees, 40
degrees, 7, and then 60.

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:02.130
You might say, wait, here are
the 40 degrees on the bottom.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.775
Then here it's on the top.

00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:04.520
But remember, things
can be congruent

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.970
if you can flip them-- if
you could flip them, rotate

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.430
them, shift them, whatever.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.970
So if you flip
this guy over, you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.250
will get this one over here.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.875
And that would not
have happened if you

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.240
had flipped this one to
get this one over here.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.010
So you see these two by--
let me just make it clear--

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.810
you have this 60-degree angle
is congruent to this 60-degree

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.580
angle.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.830
You have this side
of length 7 is

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.740
congruent to this
side of length 7.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.810
And then you have
the 40-degree angle

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.100
is congruent to this
40-degree angle.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.070
So once again,
these two characters

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.040
are congruent to each other.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.600
And we can write-- I'll
write it right over here-- we

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:46.900
can say triangle DEF is
congruent to triangle--

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.500
and here we have to
be careful again.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.880
D, point D, is the vertex
for the 60-degree side.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.610
So I'm going to start at H,
which is the vertex of the 60--

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.020
degree side over here-- is
congruent to triangle H.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.200
And then we went
from D to E. E is

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.390
the vertex on the 40-degree
side, the other vertex that

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.480
shares the 7 length
segment right over here.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.300
So we want to go
from H to G, HGI,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.400
and we know that from
angle, side, angle.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.840
And so that gives us that
that character right over

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.940
there is congruent to this
character right over here.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.340
And then finally, we're left
with this poor, poor chap.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.439
And it looks like it is not
congruent to any of them.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.480
It is tempting to try to
match it up to this one,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.710
especially because the
angles here are on the bottom

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.668
and you have the 7 side
over here-- angles here

00:06:34.668 --> 00:06:36.697
on the bottom and
the 7 side over here.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.030
But it doesn't match up,
because the order of the angles

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.590
aren't the same.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.410
You don't have the same
corresponding angles.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.201
If you try to do this
little exercise where

00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:44.660
you map everything
to each other,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.576
you wouldn't be able to
do it right over here.

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:49.030
And this over here-- it might
have been a trick question

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.738
where maybe if you
did the math-- if this

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:52.620
was like a 40 or a
60-degree angle, then

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.485
maybe you could
have matched this

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:56.860
to some of the other triangles
or maybe even some of them

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.830
to each other.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.220
But this last angle, in all
of these cases-- 40 plus 60

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.697
is 100.

00:07:02.697 --> 00:07:04.780
This is going to be an
80-degree angle right over.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.905
They have to add up to 180.

00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:09.210
This is an 80-degree angle.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.140
If this ended up, by the math,
being a 40 or 60-degree angle,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.390
then it could have been a
little bit more interesting.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.600
There might have been
other congruent pairs.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.360
But this is an 80-degree
angle in every case.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.650
The other angle is 80 degrees.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.680
So this is just a lone--
unfortunately for him,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.994
he is not able to find
a congruent companion.
