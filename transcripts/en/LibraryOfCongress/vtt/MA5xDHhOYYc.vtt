00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.250
&gt;&gt; Susan Vita: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.820
As one of my colleagues said,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.180
"Monday morning,
early in December.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.270
Is anyone going to come?"

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.810
So it's really fabulous
to see every --

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.610
all of these seats filled,
and so much just excitement

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.350
from the conversations
that are going on.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.000
I think this is -- bodes well

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.870
for what we're going
to do today.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.190
And I wanted to welcome you
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.550
You are the perfect
audience, patrons and lovers

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.420
of the arts and the humanities.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.520
And this is the oldest
cultural institution

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.890
in the entire country.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.610
And so I think it's a
perfect venue for a spotlight

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.950
on arts education symposium.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.710
I am pleased to recognize the
District of Columbia Commission

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.430
on Arts and Education.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.660
I am pleased to --
sorry, to recognize the --

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.430
it for its work developing
and promoting local artists

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.610
and organizations,
providing grants, programs,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.590
education activities
that encourage diverse,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.190
artistic expression, and
learning opportunities

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.440
for all District of Columbia
residents and visitors

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.340
to experience the rich
culture of our city.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.940
The Library of Congress,
as I said,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.050
is the oldest cultural
institution in the country.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.160
It's more than two
centuries old,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.710
and I thought I would tell
you a few things about it,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.560
and why it's a good place
to have this symposium.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.350
It features 883 miles
of shelving,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.400
houses 155 million total items.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.130
It holds 33 million
books written

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.290
in 460 different languages.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.680
It's home to 68 million
manuscripts, 25 million pieces

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.690
of music, more than
5 million maps,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.210
over 3.4 million recordings,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.750
and more than 13.5
million photographs.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.660
We receive and add
approximately 12,000 items

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.710
to our collection every day.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.900
And -- so basically, what I am
-- why I'm telling you this is,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.860
I'm trying to emphasize the fact
that people say library books.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.260
Well, forget that.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.390
We do have much more than books,

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.310
and so many of these things
can be used by the people

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.380
that you're helping
to inspire artistic

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.220
and expression in
the humanities.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.580
Here's -- this is just a
whirlwind listing of a sample

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.490
of what you could
encourage people to use.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.830
Children's books -- we have
the smallest children's books.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.130
It's "Old King Cole."

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.660
It is about the size
of a period.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.410
And we have the largest book.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.510
It is a five-by-seven book
featuring color images

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.810
of Bhutan.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.670
So it's -- imagine that it's
as tall as I am, and I'm not --

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.970
it's a lot wider
than I am, thank God.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.160
The oldest written material

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.820
in the library is a
cuneiform tablet dating

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.400
from 2040 B.C. Comic books --

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.440
we have the world's largest
collection of comic books,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.110
more than 140,000 of them.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.680
And we also hold the
world's most extensive

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.340
newspaper collection.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.850
The oldest original newspaper
is from December 29th, 1659.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.590
We have the papers
of 23 presidents.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.260
Before people started putting
them in their own buildings,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.470
we -- this is the
place where they came.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.080
So we have George Washington --

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.730
everything from George
Washington

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.230
up through Calvin Coolidge.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.620
We have the Gutenberg
Bible, which is one

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.110
of three perfect vellum
copies in the world.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.250
More than 50 million
visual materials,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.190
including the most comprehensive
international collection

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.120
of posters in the world.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.970
And the most comprehensive
visual record

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.410
of the Civil War -- can you
imagine how important the Civil

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.100
War is, in humanities and the
arts, and fact that we have all

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.740
of this material on the
Civil War, of photographs,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.340
and band music, and
all sorts of things?

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.010
The Library's Packard Campus
for Audiovisual Conservation

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:31.760
in Culpepper has 60 -- sorry,
6 million items, including more

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.840
than 3.6 million sound
recordings, and more --

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.350
almost 2 million films.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.020
And the most comprehensive
collection --

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.890
I'm the chief of the -- I
forgot to introduce myself.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.370
I'm Susan Vita, the Chief
of the Music Division here

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.380
So let me say a couple things
about the music collection.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.280
We have more than 25 -- it's
the largest music collection

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.580
in the world.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.870
We have more than
25 million items,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.570
including 8 million
pieces of sheet music,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.240
which include all sorts of --

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.560
you can really learn a
lot of things about --

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.780
when you just look
at sheet music.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.940
Basically, what ads
were people --

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.910
you know, were important
in that time?

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.230
What were the clothes

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.810
that people were
wearing, from the covers?

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:34.330
We have -- they depict the
sinking of the Titanic,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.970
and the Triangle Shirtwaist
Fire, 400 songs about baseball,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.020
more than 13,000
World War I songs.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.870
The collection includes
an extensive assemblage

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.850
of original manuscripts
by composers

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.770
of the American musical theater,
and the largest collection

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.120
of any one kind of musical
instrument in the world,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.420
and that is the flute.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.760
So let me just talk a second
about the musical theater,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.030
and the connections, and
how you can use the Library.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.040
If you, for example, were going
to encourage somebody to look

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.960
at "On The Town," we have
Leonard Bernstein's collection.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.250
He's going to be --
everybody's going

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.070
to be celebrating his
100th anniversary in --

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.400
starting at the end
of this year,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.550
but next year, particularly.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.680
And so we have his collection.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.130
So you could see music in
his hand here, and also,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.890
we have Oliver Smith's
collection.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.940
Oliver Smith was -- this
is from "On The Town."

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:49.540
This is -- we have his original
drawings of sets, and this is --

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.210
I mean, when -- might be more
fun to be here right now.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.710
This is the -- it looks like
it's Coney Island, right?

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:00.590
So anyway, we have
things that link,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.450
and that shows people how
you can use original source

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.320
material, and get ideas
about other things.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.760
The archive of folk culture
is the largest repository

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.090
of traditional cultural
documentation,

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.650
and one of the largest
in the world.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.000
It contains the largest
collection

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.830
of American Indian
music and spoken word,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.890
and the earliest ethnographic
field recordings made anywhere

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.660
in the world.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.600
Veterans history collects
the stories of veterans,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.650
and to date, more than
100,000 of them are here.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.280
The Story Corps Project is a
nationwide grassroots initiative

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.020
to record the oral
histories of people like you

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.590
and me, ordinary citizens.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.160
How many stories
are probably buried

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.880
in the Story Corps archives?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.490
I just -- since 1931, the
Library has provided books

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.170
to the blind in Braille,
and now on sound recordings,

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.590
the talking books and
digital playback equipment.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.850
And we have the world's
largest collection

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.670
of cartographic materials,
more than 5-1/2 million items.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.400
And one of the really
interesting parts of that is,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.270
it's got the largest collection
of fire insurance maps of cities

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.570
and towns in the United States,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.740
and they are amazing
just to look at them.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.780
They're very easy --
they're big-enough scale

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.080
so that they're easy to read.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.510
You can go back and see where
your grandfather was, you know,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.380
born, and lived, and
that kind of thing.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.560
It's just very interesting.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.320
So basically, you can kind of
tell that I'm pretty much in awe

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.080
of the embarrassment of
riches that we have here.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.450
And the only thing that
is disappointing is

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.900
that it's not used enough.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.620
So I'm encouraging all of you
to think about that as you go

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:08.790
about your own studies,
and creations,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.670
and also as you encourage
the people

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.300
that you serve to do the same.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.090
And now, it is my pleasure

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.090
to introduce Rhona Wolfe
Friedman, from the commission.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.820
Her passion for the
promotion of the arts

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.770
and humanities is the reason why
this symposium has come about.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.800
And if you know Rhona, you know

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.690
that she's a very difficult
person to say no to.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.160
And she will throw herself

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.330
into producing the best
possible program to motivate you

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.520
to go out and do good.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.600
So get ready for a
wonderful experience,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.900
because Rhona planned it.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.700
Rhona?

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:57.600
[ Applause ]

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.900
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Good morning.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.060
It's wonderful to be here
in the Montpelier Room

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.890
on the sixth floor at
the Library of Congress.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.870
The commission is delighted
to partner with the Library

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.690
to present this arts
education symposium.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.710
The symposium would not
have happened, though,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.780
without the vision and
efforts of Susan Vita,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.240
the woman you just heard,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.310
the Chief of the Library's Music
Division, and Lee Ann Potter,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.980
sitting up front, the Director

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.760
of Educational Outreach
for the Library.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.180
Lee Ann worked diligently
for months

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.930
to make sure this
symposium would take place.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.730
Thank you to both.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.810
[ Applause ]

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.730
And a special thank-you to
commission staff, Jeffrey Scott

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.170
and David Markey,
who were great help

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.260
with organization and logistics.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.880
I'd also like to
recognize Arthur Espinoza,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.010
our executive director,
and Kay Kendall,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.880
the chair of our commission.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.390
I'm now honored to
introduce Jane Chu.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.760
Jane Chu is the Chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.820
She has a background in arts
administration, philanthropy,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.910
and is an accomplished
artist and musician.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.400
Jane is the daughter of Chinese
immigrants, born in Oklahoma

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.220
and raised in Arkansas.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.460
She's a pianist with
undergraduate

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.240
and graduate degrees
in music and piano.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.630
Ms. Chu also holds
a master's degree

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.630
in business administration,
a Ph.D.,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.300
and three honorary degrees.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.590
She has vast experience
in arts education,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.500
and arts administration.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.350
Prior to coming to the NEA,
Ms. Chu served as the president

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.390
and CEO of the Kaufmann
Center for the Performing Arts

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.440
in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.620
At the NEA, under
Ms. Chu's guidance,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.280
the NEA has awarded more
than $377 million in grants

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.760
to nonprofit organizations
and artists.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.730
Also, Ms. Chu launched the
United States of Arts Project

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.420
that demonstrates the
importance of the arts

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.980
in our communities and lives.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.920
In 2015, Ms. Chu launched
her signature initiative,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.900
Creativity Connects, to
investigate the current state

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.550
of the arts in our nation, and
explore how the arts connect

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.050
with other industries.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.030
It is no wonder that under
Ms. Chu's leadership,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.350
the NEA ranks first among small
agencies for the best places

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.230
to work in the federal
government in 2016.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.510
With great honor and
pleasure, I welcome Jane Chu.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.990
[ Applause ]

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.290
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Thank you so much.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.590
It's really wonderful
to be here.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.810
Thank you, and I want to
thank the Library of Congress

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.550
and the D.C. Commission
on the Arts and Humanities

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.050
for inviting me to speak today.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.880
Arts education is a topic
that's very dear to my heart,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.730
and it's not just because I
majored in music, or I majored

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.930
in arts education, specifically
music education, in college.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.760
But it's because I have
known about the power

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.560
of what the arts
can do for students,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.050
that not only honors the
appreciate of art, but it spills

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.970
over into so many areas
of our daily lives.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.160
My father was a college
professor, not in music,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.820
but when he died when I was
nine, it was the piano lessons

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.200
that I was taking as
a kid that soothed me.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.190
It was music that helped me
express myself beyond the use

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.890
of just linear, everyday
conversations,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.460
and as a nine-year-old, I really
didn't have the full vocabulary

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.080
to be able to express my grief
over the loss of a parent.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.980
And perhaps many
nine-year-olds don't have that.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.720
But I didn't have enough
words, since my parents,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.000
who were from China, spoke
Mandarin at home, and I,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.580
who was born in Oklahoma
and grew up in Arkansas,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.630
spoke English at school.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.500
But the arts were there for me.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.900
So throughout my whole
growing-up years, I participated

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.430
in as many arts activities as
I could find, from music camps,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.060
and singing in choirs,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.200
and acting in theater
productions,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.090
to drawing every day.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.240
And to this day, as an adult,
I still draw every day.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.240
So through my growing-up years,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.150
I became intellectually
interested in it, to the point

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.330
where I majored in
music in college.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.620
So participating in the arts
gave me another vocabulary set.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.930
It's another language
that allowed me

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.130
to express what I felt.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.440
Playing the piano soothed me.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.130
It became my refuge.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.530
Drawing allowed me to create,
and also live in the moment,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.520
where I was so immersed
in the creative process

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.610
that time stood still.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.540
The arts helped me navigate

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.880
through those bok choy corndog
moments, because I had the power

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.260
to be able to make each
of us feel like we belong.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.740
That's what the arts do, even
when we're standing in the midst

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.300
of living with multiple
perspectives,

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.440
and different opinions.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.790
The arts give us tools
for self-expression

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.690
when words alone are not enough.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.290
They help channel our
emotions, no matter how messy

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.590
or confusing, into
something beautiful,

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.780
rather than something
destructive.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.800
The arts help to empower us
to imagine new possibilities

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.080
for what we might achieve.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.300
So everybody who
has participated

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.620
in the arts has likely
experienced these effects,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.870
and all of you, I'm sure, have.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.950
But there is a growing body of
research about arts education

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.360
that confirms what we
instinctively know,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.920
that children and
teenagers who participated

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.780
in arts education
programs were associated

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.340
with more positive academic and
social outcomes than students

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.130
who did not participate
in those programs.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.750
And this was especially true for
youth who came from households

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.610
with very few social or
economic opportunities.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:18.220
Eighth graders from
low socioeconomic homes

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.570
who were active in the arts

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.480
in elementary school showed
higher test scores in science

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.240
and writing than students who
were not active in the arts.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.440
High schoolers from
low socioeconomic homes

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.030
who were active in the
arts were more likely

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.520
to complete a calculus
course than students

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.150
with no arts-rich experiences.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.400
And across the board,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.820
arts-engaged students showed
higher overall grade point

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.630
averages, and these higher GPAs
were found with all students

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.980
who participated in the arts,

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.330
regardless of where
students came from,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.350
regardless if they came
from low socioeconomic homes

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.940
or high socioeconomic
homes, versus students

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.390
who did not participate
in the arts.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.880
And high school students
who earned few

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.830
to no arts credits
were associated

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.180
with being five times more
likely not to have graduated

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.150
than students who
earned many arts credits.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.790
The arts-rich students in high
school were more likely to go

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.010
to college, more likely to
enroll in four-year colleges,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.120
more likely to get
a bachelor's degree,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.910
more likely to earn
mostly As in college,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.890
more likely to involve
themselves in the community.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.700
More likely to read the
newspaper at least once --

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.430
or one time in the day,
more likely to participate

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.750
in student government and
service clubs, volunteer, vote,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.080
especially those from low
socioeconomic backgrounds.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.120
And by the way, you can
find all of this research,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.900
along with hundreds of other
arts education studies,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:54.740
online at artsedsearch.org,
and today, I'm drawing mostly

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.060
from the work of
Dr. James Catterall.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.670
But you get the idea.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.710
There's a very strong
relationship between children

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.080
and teens who have high
levels of arts engagement

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.990
and positive outcomes for
their lives, versus those

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.820
with low levels of arts
engagement, especially those

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.600
who are challenged with fewer
social and economic resources.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.060
So what this means is that,
by closing the gaps in terms

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.060
of who has access to arts
education and who does not,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.940
we're also helping to close
the broader achievement gaps

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.990
that exist in our
educational system.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.770
So if we're serious about
evening the playing field

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.640
for youth who come from low
socioeconomic households,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.270
then we need to get serious

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.280
about providing equal
access to the arts.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.990
Because the arts are not a
matter of, it's nice to have,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.040
but only if there's
room in the budget.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.360
They are a necessity that's
going to help all children

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.620
across the United States
reach their full potential

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.710
in their every moments, and
for their successful futures.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.400
I know that the D.C.
Commission on the Arts

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.320
and Humanities understands this,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.550
and I want to applaud
their efforts

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.250
to bring the arts to
all D.C. students.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.850
Because the D.C. Commission
is one of the main supporters

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.320
of the D.C. Arts and Humanities
Education Collaborative,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.590
and this Collaborative
is the newest member

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.660
of the Kennedy Center's
Any Given Child Program.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.060
It's the first member to
span grades K through 12,

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.880
to help communities expand
access to arts education,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.260
and we're really looking forward
to seeing the results here

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.770
in Washington, D.C. Because
this program is going to work

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.310
in tandem with a
collective impact grant

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.280
from the National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.780
and part of this work brings
together parents, and teachers,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.470
students, administrators,
along with the D.C. Commission

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.970
and the Kennedy Center.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.900
To develop an arts education
agenda for Washington, D.C.,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.570
as well as specific
measurable goals

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.560
for how the agenda
will be achieved.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.440
We envision a day when all
communities make arts education

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.280
a priority, just
as D.C. is doing.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.070
And over the past five
decades, the National Endowment

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.130
for the Arts has
invested 244 million

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.650
in arts education projects
across the United States,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.870
and these projects range
from in-school performances

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.880
and artist residencies.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.480
Afterschool arts
programs for students,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.830
professional development
for teachers,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.840
collective impact projects such
as the one I've just mentioned

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.140
with the D.C. Arts

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.470
and Humanities Education
Collaborative collective

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.050
impact group.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.160
We must thrive, and we must
strive to empower every child

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.820
in this country with an
excellent arts education.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.600
Forty percent of our arts
education grants are awarded

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.650
to organizations in
high-poverty communities,

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.500
and we're also launching a
statewide data infrastructure

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.980
project in every single
state that helps identify

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.030
which communities have fewer
arts education opportunities

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.280
for students, so
we can help there.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.580
And this is in cooperative

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.840
with the education
commission of the states.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.910
So you get the idea.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.700
We believe it's a big
job, and I do want

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.990
to introduce Ayanna Hudson.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.290
Ayanna, would you stand?

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.920
Ayanna's our Director
of Arts Education.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.510
And if you have any questions --

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.800
[ Applause ]

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.560
-- yes, she deserves
that applause.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.320
If you have questions about arts
education, or grants related

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.890
to that, e-mail Ayanna,
and she will guide you

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.190
through that process.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.510
You can e-mail her at three
in the morning if you want to,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.040
and she'll -- you're welcome.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.540
She will -- oh, and
there's Nancy Daugherty.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.840
Didn't see Nancy.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.580
Nancy also, please
stand as well.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:51.150
Our -- we have a wonderful team,
and so feel free to connect

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.560
with them throughout the day,
because they're here for you.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.070
This is a big job.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.040
Providing equal access to
the arts requires input

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.100
at every level -- parents,
teachers, local, state,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.140
national leaders,
principals, superintendents,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.350
and so I'm hopeful that
we're going to reach a day

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.170
where the country embraces
the arts as a fundamental

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.780
and indispensable part of
our children's success.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.520
Because arts education
is not about --

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.500
just about children learning how
to finger a B flat on a trumpet.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.680
That might be nice, but it's
not just about learning how

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.640
to pirouette, although
that might be nice.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.790
Or teaching children
how to use watercolors

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.470
to paint a picture of a tree.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.230
That might be nice.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.140
Arts education is about giving
students a tool belt of skills

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.210
that allow them to reach
their full potential,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.000
where children can achieve
academically and socially,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.490
and where they can imagine a
world beyond what they might

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.060
know, and dream of new
possibilities for themselves,

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.500
and where they can express their
ideas beyond the use of linear,

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.280
everyday conversations.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.350
And they can develop
self-confidence, and discover

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.510
that they really do belong,
and communicate with others,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.340
and reach those who have
perspectives different

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.620
from their own, and
innovate, and create.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.650
Because we know that whenever
we create, we move away

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.450
from being stuck, and we open
the door to solving those old

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:29.160
and tired problems in new, and
positive, and meaningful ways.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.820
The United States has always
been a nation of innovators

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.740
and visionaries, and
instilling the arts

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.230
in our students will help ensure

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.530
that this legacy
remains in place.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.640
So I want to thank
everybody here today

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.590
for recognizing the
importance of arts education,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.260
and for working so hard to
ensure a promising future

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.220
for all of our children.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.020
Thank you.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:03.880
[ Applause ]

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.620
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Thank you, Jane,

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.810
for a very inspiring
and lovely speech.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.570
I'd like to now -- to start
us off with our first panel.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.950
Our introduction to this
will be Arthur Espinoza,

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.540
the Executive Director
of the D.C. Commission

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.510
in the Arts and Humanities.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:26.400
[ Applause ]

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.700
&gt;&gt; Arthur Espinoza:
Good morning.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.000
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.300
&gt;&gt; Arthur Espinoza: It's Monday,

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.020
and there's so many
beautiful people in the room,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.640
all gathered for one great idea.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.040
I'm so excited about this.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.720
As we said before, we
weren't really sure

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.100
if this would fill up, and
I'm so excited that it has.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.250
So thank you, and
welcome to all of you,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.850
on behalf of the Commission
on the Arts and Humanities.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.050
And I certainly want to
thank our colleagues here

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.080
from the Library of
Congress for their help.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.420
We appreciate your
coordination in this event.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.310
In particular, Susan
Vita, and Lee Ann Potter,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.210
as we've recognized
before, thank you so much.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.400
Much appreciated.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.840
If there's any standing
room over there --

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.140
I'll do a little housekeeping.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.030
There's some extra seating
back over here, as well,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.710
so I want to make sure that
everybody is comfortable,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.710
can see, and can hear clearly.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.010
We're in for a lot today,

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.740
and we hope that you'll
find good things out of it.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.710
I'd also like to thank the
Library of Congress for opening

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.470
up what is the -- a
little bit of information

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.430
about the treasure
chest of this building.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.050
It is just amazing to hear Ms.
Vita talk about all the things

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.650
that one can access here, which
I think we all know about,

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.160
but we forget about sometimes,
or we don't always have time.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.550
So I do ask that you all
consider your opportunities

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.690
there, and how that may be
able to help inform your work.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.440
I'd like to recognize, as we
did already, Chair Kay Kendall.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.740
She's the chair of
the commission.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.040
If you don't mind standing,
just so everybody can see you --

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.340
also, Gretchen Wharton,

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.850
one of our commissioners,
and Haili Francis.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.770
And if I missed any
commissioner,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.100
I hope you'll forgive
me, but welcome.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.400
We're glad to have you here.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.810
Thanks also to the staff,
as we mentioned before.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.330
Dr. Jeffrey Scott, David Markey,

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.630
and Inissa Salei
[assumed spelling]

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.210
in our arts education
department, thank you all

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.440
for your hard work on today,
and putting it together.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.310
And of course, thanks
to Dr. Jane Chu.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.560
Those remarks were really
inspiring and wonderful,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.640
and thank you for being here,
and leading us with your work

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.520
at the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.290
And it's really an honor
to work alongside them.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.240
As a state arts agency, we have
this opportunity to partner

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.330
with the NEA to carry out their
initiative, along with our own,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.670
and we're really
pleased to work with them

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.310
and all the staff from the NEA.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.890
They're always such great
partners to work with,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.000
so welcome to all of you
that are here from the NEA.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.810
I think I saw a few, but I
know there's probably others,

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.910
and great to see you.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.510
I also want to repeat a little
bit about what Dr. Chu said.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.770
I think you heard very well
the value of arts education,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.900
and the value of how that starts

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.220
to change our society
and our community.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.820
We know these things
that are critical

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.610
to what we're doing
are really critical

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.440
to the communities
that we live in.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.100
And they're also, to
business, very valuable.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.920
Things such as creative
thinking, and critical skills

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.090
that you have to help
inform your work,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.410
whether you stay
in the arts or not.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.740
Now, we hope that everyone
here continues to have

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.910
that lifelong experience
with the arts,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.720
but we know that it also
helps bring valuable skills

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.020
to teamwork.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.330
And in a workplace,
in a business setting,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.890
that's a really valuable
asset for us to have.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.190
And the arts help us learn that.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.620
We're going to hope that
today is going to provide you

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.330
with a lot of information
about how you can move forward

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.940
with your own practice.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.770
Whether you're interested
in trying to find ways

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.070
to empower students, or
whether that's simply the work

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.630
that you're doing to find
equitable participation

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.890
in the schools, and help us
break down those barriers

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.190
that exist within the
communities that we all live in.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.470
We know these are important
aspects that we want to address,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.660
and the arts really
do help us do that.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.450
Of course, student success
and achievement is critical,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.730
and it's also critical
for our mayor.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.120
Mayor Bowser, here in
the District of Columbia,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.290
has been very supportive of
the efforts that we carry out,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.420
and that you all carry
out, in arts education.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.230
I want to thank her for
her continued support

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.660
of the commission, and
for her continued support,

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.530
especially, of arts education.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.540
We appreciate all that
she's doing to support us.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.900
I do hope that they'll be some
great insights, and we're going

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.980
to get going now
with our first panel.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.590
There's been a lot of
talking, and so now we're ready

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.860
to start listening to others,
who are going to invite us

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.520
to think a little
bit more deeply.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.030
Helping us do that is our
special guest, and our moderator

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.700
for our first panel, Senior
Vice President for Education

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.360
at the John F. Kennedy Center

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.490
for the Performing
Arts, Mario Rossero.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.790
I don't say that very often.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.090
You know that?

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.890
You probably say
it all the time.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:38.340
[ Applause ]

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.640
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Good
morning, everyone.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.940
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.240
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: It's
great to join you.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.540
I feel like this is always one

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.750
of those arts education
family reunion moments.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.240
I have one of the best
jobs in the world.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.100
I get to lead all the education
efforts at the Kennedy Center

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.420
for the Performing Arts,
which is both local,

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.720
regional, and national.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.410
I am inspired by my colleagues
who've done such a great job

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.960
to set the table, I think, for
today's conversation, but first,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.330
I just wanted to thank
Rhona and the commission

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.110
for the invitation to
join everyone today.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.890
So you may or may not know

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.990
that this past May was the 100th
birthday of President Kennedy.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.980
And so, for the Kennedy
Center, many know us

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.620
for the world-class
performing arts on our stages,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.530
but we also uplift the ideals
from President Kennedy's legacy

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.990
of service, justice, freedom,
courage, and gratitude

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.390
through the arts,
through the memorial

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.340
that the building
really is to him.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.230
But, you know, the Kennedy
Center's really more

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.860
than just a building,
or an address.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.550
It's also this idea,
and it's an ideal

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.430
that the arts are
really for everyone.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.170
And so, as the nation's
cultural center,

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.240
we really feel a responsibility
on our shoulders to make sure

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.510
that we're fighting alongside
all of our colleagues

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.300
in this room, to make
sure that those barriers

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.850
to access are removed, and
that the highest-quality arts

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.800
and arts education experiences
are available to all.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.650
And so, it's my team's
charge to really make sure

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.150
that we lock arms with
our colleagues here

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:07.080
and across the country, and we
take a lot of time to identify

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.600
and know what the problems
and challenges in the field

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.680
of arts education and arts
learning are, as well as some

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.250
of the best practices.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.820
And we're really lucky to
have the support and resources

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.190
to create some model programs
that can try out some solutions

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.930
to those problems, right?

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.120
Because everybody in this
room, we stand on the shoulders

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.840
of a history of work and effort

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.810
to really tackle
this problem, right?

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.050
And I always like to acknowledge
everyone who's spent the last

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.610
20, 30, 40, 50 years
really working at this,

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.660
and I think it takes everyone
working together in lockstep

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.160
to address these arts
education challenges, right?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.390
And it's really a cross-sectoral
challenge, but I am inspired

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.160
and excited that we
can do it together.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.420
And I think the voices
that we're going to hear

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.520
from today give us a
range of perspectives.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.490
And what we're going to hear
about is not just about equity,

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.830
access, and innovation in
the arts, and arts education,

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:04.650
but it's also rooted in some
exemplars, some best practices,

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.200
really looking at the
evidence, and some demonstration

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.540
of the power of the arts.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.270
So if you'd join me in
some round of applause,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.680
I'm going to welcome our
panelists up to the stage.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.300
So I'm going to talk a little
bit, and buy them some time

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.690
as they make their way up,

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.110
but we can maybe have a
continuous round of applause.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.050
First we have Dr.
Alexander Panteyat,

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.980
who's joining us
from Johns Hopkins.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.280
So Alex, come on up.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.040
We have Christopher K.
Morgan from Dance Place,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.320
local arts organization, my
good friend Nathan Diamond

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.730
from D.C. Public Schools,
who leads the arts charge

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.970
for the district, and
we have Asha Gardner,

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.770
from Split This Rock.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:52.070
[ Applause ]

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.090
So before we jump into our
conversation on innovation,

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.570
access and equity in the
arts, we always believe

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:01.020
that it is a good idea to
start with the arts, right?

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.280
So we're thrilled that Alex was
willing to play a piece for us.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.600
So we're going to start
with a piece of music.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.550
This is "Meditation"
from the opera, "Thais."

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.850
Take it away.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:35:42.510
[ Music ]

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:56.720
[ Applause ]

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.020
Thank you.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.320
What a beautiful piece.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.840
So before we get started,
just a couple logistics.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.270
My goal is to really
have a great conversation

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.660
with everyone, but
leave time at the end

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.960
for some audience questions.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.980
So as you listen, think
about anything that might be

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.760
on your mind that you want
to go a little bit deeper in.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.090
So please consider that.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.180
Also, everyone's bios are
in your program books,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.550
so you might go a little bit
deeper to find out about folks.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.400
And I was also asked to make
sure everyone has their cell

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.640
phones on silent, just before
we start our conversation,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.940
so thank you for that.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.430
So Alex, I'm going
to start with you.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.350
Thank you so much for
that beautiful piece,

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:32.570
and for sharing your
artistic talents as well.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.430
But we love this idea
about especially the arts

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.690
and sciences overlapping,
and we actually find a lot

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.930
of connections between
all the art forms

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.230
and health and wellness.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.890
But I know you've got a
particular interest and focus

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.160
in music and wellness
and health.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.220
So I wonder if you might give
us a little bit of context

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.250
about your work, and
some of the findings,

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.870
and things you're finding
interesting right now

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.630
in your work.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.120
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alexander Panteyat:
Thank you very much

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.420
on the introduction, Mario.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.440
It's my pleasure to
be here this morning

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.030
in front of this full room.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:08.070
I do have a sense that I'm
preaching to the choir,

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.180
but it's nevertheless
very important.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.870
As I think you could tell, music
is very near and dear to me.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.290
For my patients'
sake at this point,

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.600
I hope I'm a much better
physician than I am a musician.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.360
But I've been playing the
violin since I was seven,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.040
and so exposure to
music education,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.720
including in public school,
in elementary school --

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.130
I still remember
my orchestra days,

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.170
playing "William Tell Overture."

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.850
I think it's played a -- I would
say a central role in my life,

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.500
but what I want to say
a few words about now is

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.470
that the research
over the last five

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.100
to seven years has
actually provided evidence

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.190
for the importance
of music education.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.160
And it's linked to success
throughout the lifetime

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.910
of a person, and particularly
academic achievement.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:08.360
So there was a hypothesis put
forth by Dr. Aniruddh Patel

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.210
from Tufts University, and
published in "Frontiers

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.680
of Psychology" in 2011,
and it's easy to remember,

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.420
because the acronym of
the hypothesis is OPERA.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.360
And that really, I think, sets
up a useful framework for some

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.900
of the research that
has been done

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.840
in the last five to six years.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.290
The OPERA hypothesis
proposes that benefits --

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.640
possible benefits of music
are driven by plasticity

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.770
in the speech processing
parts of the brain,

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.050
and brain networks for speech.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:44.560
And this plasticity occurs
when five conditions are met,

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.440
and so that's the acronym.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.490
And they are O for overlap, P
for precision, E for emotion,

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.130
R for repetition,
and A for attention.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.130
There is anatomical overlap
in the brain networks

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:03.820
that process sound features
used in both music and speech.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.210
For example, the amplitude
of the sound waves,

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:10.600
as well as the periodicity with
which the sound waves appear.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.940
P stands for precision.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.680
Music places higher demands
on these shared networks

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.870
when compared to speech
-- the demands of speech,

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.240
in terms of how precise
the timing needs to be.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.450
E, for emotion -- the
musical activities

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:31.320
that engage this network can
elicit very strong emotions.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.810
I don't know how many of
you have had the experience

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.490
of feeling chills, or
shivers up and down your spine

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.210
when you're listening to a
pleasurable piece of music.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.210
And of course, one
size does not fit all.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.850
It's very individual,
but we can agree that --

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.590
and it's been scientifically
demonstrated

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.220
in the last six years or so

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.680
that powerful emotional
centers are activated

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.270
when we're listening to music.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.130
R stands for repetition.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.670
The musical activities that
engage this network connected

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.670
to speech are frequently
repeated as we're listening,

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.640
and as we're practicing
an instrument or singing.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.340
And that repetition
is crucial to success.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.680
And finally, A for attention.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.210
Musical activities that
engage the network I'm talking

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.410
about are associated
with focused attention,

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.530
and of course, you
have to pay attention

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.480
as we're learning a
musical instrument.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.130
So according to the
OPERA hypothesis,

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.110
when these conditions
are met, neuroplasticity,

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.220
long-term changes in the
brain drives these networks

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.810
to function with higher
precision than is needed

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.170
for ordinary speech
communication.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.860
However, since speech shares
these networks with music,

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.530
speech benefits in
a secondary way,

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.620
the processing of speech itself.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.130
And so the OPERA hypothesis
has been used to account

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.920
for superior encoding of speech

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.770
in musically-trained
individuals,

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.670
which I won't have time to
go into in detail today,

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.720
but I'm happy to
answer questions about.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.020
And this suggests mechanisms

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.620
by which musical training
could improve the linguistic

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.920
reading abilities.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.760
So I'm just going to run
through literally the headlines

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.660
of studies published in
the last five, six years,

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.170
and there's one particularly
relevant study by Nina Kraus

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.780
from Northwestern
University in Chicago,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.110
which I think is inspiring,
that I want to focus

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.410
on for a couple of minutes.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.260
So thus far, studies
have shown that babies --

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.580
one-year-olds who have music
lessons with their parents tend

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.680
to smile more and earlier,
and communicate better.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.610
Music training can improve
white matter connectivity.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.840
The highways in our brain
that connect the thinking,

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.660
gray matter areas, and enable
rapid millisecond-level

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.700
processing, they are
actually strengthened

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.870
as a result of musical training.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.170
Not just listening.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.460
It needs to be active musical
training participation.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.420
So I could go into details
if you're interested,

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.100
as far as how long it takes.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:03.410
It's not immediate, you know,
but after as little as one year,

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.210
sometimes -- one
year to 15 months,

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.020
the musical training changes
are seen in the brain.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.610
Where are the changes seen?

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.910
Well, the corpus callosum,

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.800
which is the main white matter
highway connecting the two

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.310
hemispheres, the two
halves of the brain,

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.110
that's actually made thicker,
strengthened as a result

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.490
of musical training over time.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:27.030
And, the arcuate fasciculus,
which on the left side

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.300
of the brain for most people,
serves as the main connection

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.310
between the areas
understanding language

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:37.320
and producing language
in the brain as well.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.100
Blood flow in the brain in some

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.950
of those speech areas
I mentioned

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.190
in the OPERA hypothesis
is increased,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.640
real-time practically,

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.610
as a result of musical
training and exposure.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.340
Executive function, going from
point A, to point B, to point C,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.070
multi-tasking, so
crucial in our world --

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.320
that actually improves
as a result

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.140
of musical training over time.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.910
The gray matter -- not
just the white matter.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:04.200
Certain areas in the cortex,
the outer part of the brain,

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.460
are actually made
bigger as a result

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.260
of musical training
and exposure.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.530
Verbal memory and childhood
literacy is actually improved

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:18.650
over time as a result of classes
exposing people to music.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.990
And this was not just for kids.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:25.100
Over the course of our
lifetime, as we age,

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.950
there is now several
studies that show

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.940
that the brain plasticity
is benefitted

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.370
by musical training
throughout the lifetime.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.380
And in fact, this is now
beginning to be thought

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.700
as a protective measure,
playing a musical instrument,

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.140
against cognitive aging,
mild cognitive impairment,

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.720
dementia of the Alzheimer's
type and others.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.590
But what I want to just
emphasize a little bit more --

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.660
that's Dr. Nina Kraus's
work that I mentioned --

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.270
is that it actually may --

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:58.140
musical training in school may
actually help reduce academic

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.540
achievement gaps.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.530
An August 2014 report from
the American Psychological

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.240
Association stated that learning
to play a musical instrument

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.250
or to sing can help
disadvantaged children

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.430
strengthen their reading
and language skills,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.790
which may reduce
academic achievement gaps.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.750
These findings involved hundreds
of children participating

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.750
in musical training
programs in both Chicago

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.970
and Los Angeles public schools.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.060
The positive role that
musical training can have

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:28.560
for youth living in impoverished
areas was presented by Dr. Kraus

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.930
in 2014, at the American
Psychological Association's

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.240
annual convention.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.810
Kraus's research concluded

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.800
that musical training can
enhance the way children's

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:43.190
nervous systems process sounds
in busy or chaotic environments,

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.490
like a classroom,
or a playground.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.570
After just two years
of musical training --

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.510
not one, because she looked
at one and also two years.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.010
After two years of
musical training,

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:58.500
the children's brain
responses to sounds were faster

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.480
and more precise than in
students who had other types

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.780
of enrichment classes.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.970
So this was not just
a comparison

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.850
of music classes to nothing.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.810
The improved neural
function caused

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.490
by music training may
lead to enhanced memory

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.880
and attention span, which in
turn can make it easier for kids

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.630
to stay focused in the classroom

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.850
and improve their
communication skills.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.220
Other separate studies
over the last five

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.530
to six years have shown
that arithmetic performance,

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.730
achievement in verbal
skills, language learning,

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.480
and even second, foreign
language acquisition,

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.740
which I would argue is
increasingly important

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.170
in our globalized world.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.080
That actually can be
made easier by music.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.200
You heard before that music
is a language all its own.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.280
Well, there's actually
now neural --

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.680
anatomical neurobiological
truth to that.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.020
And we know that with each
additional language acquired,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.290
it becomes easier to acquire
the subsequent language,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.810
even if it's not
connected in any way

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.290
to the languages
you already know.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:05.220
So research has shown that there
are differences in the brains

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.600
of children raised in
impoverished environments

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.420
that affect their
ability to learn.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.220
While more affluent students
do better in school than kids

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.410
from lower-income backgrounds,
we are starting to find

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.040
that musical training can
alter the nervous system

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.430
to create a better learner and
help offset this academic gap.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.040
And so I'm happy to talk
more, but I want to make sure

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.480
that other panelists
have enough time.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.820
So I just want to conclude by
saying that evidence is mounting

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.520
that musical training
boosts brain power

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.010
and cognitive function
in children and adults.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.720
Neural enhancements
that are gained

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.020
through musical training early

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.490
in life can extend throughout
the lifespan and into old age.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.360
And hopefully, these
findings can inspire parents

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.560
and policymakers to advocate
for musical training in school

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.170
as an enjoyable and fulfilling
outlet that also has the power

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.390
to boost our brain strength
and improve reading,

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.690
writing, and arithmetic.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.100
There are data actually that
need to be expanded upon

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.060
that all aspects of the SAT
are improved by between 20

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.780
to 30 points when comparing kids

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.680
who have had music classes
regularly throughout school

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.980
to those who have not.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.030
So it seems that musical
training keeps our brain --

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.310
helps keep our brain
sharp as we age

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.670
and could be an integral part
of rehabilitative programs

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.540
for older adults, as well,
coping with cognitive decline.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.840
All right.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.140
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Thank you, Alex.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.250
I think that's a
great [applause] --

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.770
starting with the evidence is
a great place to start, right.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.370
And I know everybody in this
room, we are all interested

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.360
but also charged with
measuring the impact

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.280
and telling the stories
of our work, right.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.680
And so often we're looking
at, you know, the intervention

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.510
in the classroom or with
kids, and we're tracking that.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.820
But I love holding those
outcomes against the science

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.120
as well, because that seems

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.210
like that would make an
even more powerful argument.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.430
When we were prepping
for this conversation,

00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:59.730
Alex and I had a brief chat

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:02.080
about the Kennedy Center's
work with Renee Fleming.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.170
She's got a really deep interest
in music and wellness, right.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.770
And so we've done this
Sound Health initiative.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.700
And a project called
Music and the Mind.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.440
But she literally --
she had this, you know,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.590
opera diva in an MRI singing
an aria, and they're, you know,

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.440
checking her brain
waves as this is going.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.300
And we saw the visualization.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.910
And the most sort
of stark outcome

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.610
to me was not when
she was singing.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.210
It was her preparation
to be creative.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.450
That's when her brain lit
up with the most activity,

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.600
the preparation to
create, which I thought was

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.900
so interesting, right.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.060
And it really resonates once
you think about it, because it's

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.540
that -- it's -- you're
getting ready.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.840
Your brain is getting ready.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.740
You're preparing for
that moment of creation

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.670
or that act of making, right.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.970
Really exciting.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.270
So thank you for
starting us off.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.990
So we also -- you know, on
this panel we have experts

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.290
from different art forms.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.720
So we know that every art
form really makes an impact

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.020
on students.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.700
And we all sort of
find at least one,

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.300
but maybe sometimes
multiple ways

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.100
to express ourselves
and to communicate.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.400
So Christopher --

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.700
&gt;&gt; Christopher K. Morgan: Yes?

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.000
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: -- I'd
like to turn to you next.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.520
I would love to hear a
little bit about Dance Place

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.990
and the role in the community.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.270
And then just sort of talk
about your work and how it fits

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.570
into this conversation.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.870
&gt;&gt; Christopher K.
Morgan: Absolutely.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.170
Aloha, everyone.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.470
My name is Christopher.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:17.770
My sign name was given to me

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.890
by some Polish deaf
students 20 years ago,

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.660
so this is my sign name.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.790
My pronouns are he and his.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:28.310
And as a native Hawaiian, it's
important for me to connect

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.340
to my ancestors and bring
things into this space.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.570
So I want to recognize that
we're on colonized land

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.740
that was stolen hundreds of
years ago from native tribes.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.560
And also to brig my
ancestors into the room.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.860
I offer you this.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.160
It's very non-secular.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.510
It's about the meeting of twos,
land and sea, sky and water.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:50:00.230
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:05.250
Aloha, probably the only
Hawaiian word you know.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:08.370
[Speaking in foreign language]
And that's the foundation

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:12.090
of equity, recognizing
as many things

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.380
as I can sense in one moment.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.580
And that's the foundation
of bridging to youth

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.320
and just people in general.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.310
And so for me, you know,
the dance person always has

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.560
to get a little interactive.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.550
I'd love to ask for you
just sitting in your chair

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.250
to point -- when you
think of the future or --

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.950
yeah, I'm just going to leave
it at that, the future --

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:39.780
would you point toward
the future for me?

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.080
Nice, I love arts people.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.260
It's always a more mixed
answer than if I were

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.030
in like a corporate environment.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.330
Can you do that one more time?

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:47.630
I just want a better survey.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.930
Try and keep the same answer,

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:50.230
if you don't mind,
that you did before.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:51.530
Point toward the future.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.830
Okay, oh, and someone
made a dance out of it.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.130
It's not static.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:55.430
It's moving.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.000
So great, just anecdotally,
what I tended

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.670
to see was forward and up.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.370
And so one of the gifts

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:07.020
that dance has given me is
peripheral vision, right?

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.890
If I'm dancing with people in
a line like the Rockettes --

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.940
okay, I've never been a
Rockette, but I dreamed of it.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.760
If I'm dancing with
people in a line,

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.780
I have to use my peripheral
vision to sense that we're,

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.980
if it's needed, in unison.

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.220
And we use that all the
time as laypeople in driving

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.110
and other daily skills.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.370
But one of the things that
I think is interesting

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:32.820
in some cultures, the future
is neither forward or up.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.420
It's back here, because
you can't see it yet.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.220
It has not been revealed
to you yet.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:43.410
However, there is so much that
we have as humans, our senses,

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.520
our intuition, or
instinct, our gut --

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.350
in Hawaiian it's [speaking
in foreign language] --

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:53.180
that allow us to
sense the unseen.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.540
And for me, a lot about equity

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.520
and access is trying
to tune into that.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.400
How do we sense -- and
sense is so related

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.030
to the word sensitive
-- how are we sensitive

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.330
to the needs of others?

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.040
Words we use a lot in our work

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.910
as arts educators,
arts advocates.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:11.210
How do we do that?

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.760
How do we connect to that?

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.630
And so much of that is about
tuning in and listening,

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.280
and all art forms are
really good at that.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.170
And that's why so much of that
evidence about how it spans

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:24.350
out into other aspects of
our lives, the scientific,

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.970
the educational data, all
of those things pay off,

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.770
because it's allowing
us to tune into others.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.310
So a little bit about
Dance Place.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.530
I'm the Executive Artistic
Director of Dance Place.

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:35.830
It's based here in Washington,

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.110
D.C. It's a 37-year-old
institution.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.630
And we've been in our location

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.230
in Brookland/Edgewood
for 31 years.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.600
Our Founding Director
Carla Perlo

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.360
and her Co-Director Deborah
Riley recently retired,

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.210
and I became the Director
after a national search

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.080
for a new director just
this past September.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.960
So I'm pretty new to this role.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.210
Obviously, I'm not
new to the arts.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.590
But Dance Place, in addition
to being a presenting theater

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.780
that hosts over 45 weekends
of performances each year

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.580
from international,
national, and area companies,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.240
and having a school, and having
youth enrichment programs,

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.490
has been an anchor
in our neighborhood.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:17.260
When Carla and her board at the
time bought their building in --

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.250
31 years ago, it became
kind of a galvanizing force

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.550
for that neighborhood.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:25.210
And we all recognize
the problems

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:27.370
that come with gentrification.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.690
We've been pretty fortunate

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.110
in the Brookland/Edgewood
neighborhood

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.840
because of a history
of high home ownership

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.950
in that neighborhood, and as
well as some pockets of land

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.630
that were empty, a lot of
the development that happened

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.080
in the last five to 10 years

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.670
in particular didn't
displace too many people.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.610
I fear and think it might
be coming in the future

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.370
as development increases.

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.660
But to-date, it hasn't
been too jarring.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.950
So what's happened in
our neighborhood is

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:56.970
that our community has continued
to mix both economically,

00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.120
racially, and in all kind
of definitions of diversity.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.460
So that's presented Dance Place

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.830
with some wonderful
opportunities

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.970
in our different programs
to engage the community,

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.290
to bring them in, and see
what happens as a third space.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.070
What can we do when we
bring these different

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:14.490
communities together?

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.660
When Carla and the
original Dance Place staff

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.990
and faculty were there 31 years
ago, couple of youth knocked

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.380
on the door, and they just
needed a place to hang

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.720
out until their parents
got home,

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.020
and they needed a bathroom.

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.630
It was a little cold outside.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.900
That literally became
the foundation

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.760
for our Energizers program.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.890
Our Energizers program serves
youth between six and 12,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.560
as well as our Junior
Staff program.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.460
Our Junior Staff manager
is here today, Naomi.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.880
Hi. Thank you.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.900
She was not expecting that.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.080
And so these programs
are offering life skills

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.810
and arts curriculum to
help empower these youth,

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.590
just like a lot of the
work that you all do does

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.980
and give them a good place
to be and some good skills.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.770
That program expands
every summer to 75 kids

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:06.260
from about the 25 that we
serve during the school year.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.950
And those kids get five weeks

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.200
of programming throughout
the day that's based

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.080
on a similar curriculum.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.390
And then our Junior
Staff program,

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:14.790
they work with us
throughout the year.

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:17.380
They have different jobs and
roles within the community

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.280
at Dance Place and
on our arts campus.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.550
So this is how -- what our
programming looks like.

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:25.390
But as I just started this
work, I'm really interested

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:27.940
in thinking a little bit more
about this mixed neighborhood

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.480
that we're in and the
challenges that it presents.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.710
I literally had some
teenage boys yell at me

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.770
when I asked them to leave
our arts park at 9:30 p.m.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.730
because our building was closed,
and it was time to go home.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.070
And they yelled at
me, "You're new here.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:45.220
You don't know what
it's like here."

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.520
And I hear that.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.640
I recognize that, and
I understand that.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.300
And at the same time, how do
we create an environment that's

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.100
embracing of them, and
embracing of these challenges,

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.410
and also trying to get them to
anchor themselves and go home

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.420
at night when that's
appropriate?

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.920
I -- you know, and there's a lot
of reasons why I don't want them

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.220
out on the street at night.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.700
It's not necessarily
just for what they do.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.440
It's for what might
happen to them.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.870
So these are the challenges
that we're facing there.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:15.600
And how can we continue to
bridge our curriculum in ways

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.090
that bring those different
socioeconomic groups together?

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:22.020
I've anecdotally noticed in
our tuition-based program,

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.530
which grew to be serving about
500 youth in the last two years

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:28.140
from about 300 just
two years ago,

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.080
that most of our tuition-based
programs racially look a certain

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.560
way because of new
communities that have moved

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.860
into that neighborhood.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.320
And our Youth Enrichment
programs racially look a

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.620
different way.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.350
And so how do we curricularly
start to bridge that

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:44.710
and create a foundation
for their futures

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.350
that recognizes how incredibly
mixed our world is that we live

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:52.170
in and provide tools
within which in one

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.820
or two sentences they
can recognize the history

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.780
of where we are, the
diversity in the room,

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:02.990
and how hopefully we can
sense one another sensitively.

00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:04.790
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank you.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:07.480
[ Applause ]

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.310
Christopher, you make
me really think --

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.580
I mean, I think this already,
but you, I think, articulated it

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.200
in a very special way which
is, you know, arts education --

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.330
I'm always a champion of working
from an asset model, right.

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.840
And so the struggle -- instead
of like, "Oh, woe is me,

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.140
the struggles that we have,"

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.440
think about the power
that we have.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.960
And so I think uniquely
arts education,

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.060
among other subjects -- we
think about literacy, math,

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:36.160
etcetera -- arts education
is really so well-poised both

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.310
out of necessity, but out of
its ability to not just be

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:42.770
about curriculum and
instruction, right.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:46.520
Not just about what you learn
in the artform, but isn't it

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.830
about listening, right?

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.240
Isn't it about community?

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.750
Isn't it about bringing
things together, right,

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:55.530
recognizing past,
present, future?

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:57.420
It has the ability to do
all these things and sort

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.180
of knit them together in
a way that I think really,

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.660
especially within a school,
within a neighborhood,

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:07.600
within a program, it's got
this sort of superpower, right,

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.750
this ability to bring
all these perspectives

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.050
and things together.

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.080
And I don't know that
everyone looks at the sort

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.270
of other curricular
areas in the same way.

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:17.560
So I appreciate your
articulation of that.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.010
So Nathan -- I've known
Nathan for a little while.

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.930
We both were in Chicago Public
Schools fighting the good fight

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.580
in arts education.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.440
I think we're the
two visual artists --

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.740
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond: Yeah.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: -- up here.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.680
So Nathan leads the
charge in the team

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.970
at D.C. Public Schools
for arts education.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:37.690
So I know you've got some
particular initiatives

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:38.990
that we're going to dive into,

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.750
but I thought you might
just take a moment to sort

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.300
of continue the conversation and
talk about the work of equity

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.910
and access in your role
and with your team,

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:52.060
and then transition us
to your specific program.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.360
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond: Absolutely.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.630
So as Mario said, I'm
the Director of Arts

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:57.930
for D.C. Public Schools.

00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:00.360
So in that role, I oversee
curriculum and instruction

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:05.360
across the district and across
all disciplines in the arts.

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.060
He also mentioned
I'm a visual artist.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:11.090
My background is in photography,
and design, and printmaking.

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.090
But I am actually going to talk
about a music initiative today.

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:15.390
And so that should be --

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:16.690
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
I'm just trying

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:17.990
to represent all artforms.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:19.290
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:22.140
And it -- you know, it's
been great to listen

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.080
from Dr. Chu's remarks
all through about the idea

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.700
of how we approach the
arts as a language.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.760
This is a real challenge,
I think, in education --

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.860
in the education sector
because literacy has very

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:35.230
specific connotations.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:40.030
And we are really pushing in
my office to broaden the scope

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:42.780
of what we talk about when
we talk about literacy

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.260
in public education, expanding

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.480
that into visual literacy
and music literacy.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:53.650
And so the role, I think -- you
know, this idea of equity --

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:55.060
these three words,
equity, access,

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.790
innovation could not be
more kind of gift-wrapped

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.570
for the work that
we're doing right now

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.740
because Chancellor
Wilson, the new Chancellor

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.300
of D.C. Public Schools, has a
really intense focus on equity

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.940
and how we are approaching
our schools for what they need

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.800
and what the communities need,
not just sort of even strokes.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.610
But what actually do we
need to give each student

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:21.420
and each school so that young
people can be successful

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.320
in D.C. Public Schools?

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:29.690
And for us in the arts, that
comes in a few different forms.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.660
It's about exposure
and opportunity.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.690
And I think those are things
that sort of everybody

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.770
in this room really
addresses quite frequently.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.670
But I think bigger
than that, what we look

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:42.290
at is how are we empowering
students to use their voice?

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:46.900
And so we talk a lot about
the use of a student's voice.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:51.470
And how do we transition from
a skills acquisition model

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.790
where we area sort of
building students' capacity

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:56.310
up to do certain things
as they get older?

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.270
And more, how are we
handing them these tools,

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:02.110
giving them space to use
them, to experiment with them,

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:05.290
to understand them on their own
terms, and then guiding them

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.840
from there as they get older?

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.200
And so it is really about
how we are being strategic

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.000
in that process from
pre-K through 12th grade.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.550
I think critical is, you know,

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.960
literacy in the traditional
form is always

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.740
about how do we get students
to express themselves?

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.600
How can they write
their ideas down?

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.900
How can they speak eloquently?

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.260
How can we be sure that they
can sort of operate in society?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.810
But as we know, the arts
do that incredibly well,

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:35.180
and they reach students who
are challenged to be reached

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.830
by traditional forms
of literacy.

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:42.620
And so one of the things
that we hold dear is

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.880
that if we are not equitably
-- equity and access --

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.310
if we are not equitably
reaching all of our students,

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.520
there are voices
missing from our culture.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.150
There are voices
missing from our society.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.250
And if we know -- which we do --

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:02.190
that a lot of the issues
of success in schools --

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:03.760
as Christopher was
talking about,

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.820
even in the way he
sees differences

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.570
in his populations -- we know
there are a lot of things

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.250
that fall along socioeconomic
lines.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.530
And so it is clear to us --
we can look at the research

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:19.600
and know the groups of voices
that are actually missing

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.790
from our culture that
aren't being expressed.

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:25.320
And so to us the arts
is such a critical place

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.710
where we have the potential
to start that change.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:31.880
And Dr. Chu spoke about
that eloquently earlier.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:37.630
So how we're doing this, we have
-- three years ago when I --

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:39.880
three and a half years ago
when I came into this role,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.070
I was asked to really look
at what the curriculum

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:46.950
of DCPS arts is and how
do we write a curriculum

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.250
for the future?

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:54.050
And so to Mario's point, the
arts don't live comfortably

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:55.350
in the world of curriculum

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.560
and instruction the way
traditional content areas do.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.990
This has a lot to do with
the way we evaluate and test.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.080
You guys know.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.380
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Choir.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.680
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond: Yes, exactly.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.100
And so what we set about doing
was changing what a curriculum

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.010
looks like, can it both meet
the needs of a district --

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.720
can it look like what a
district needs it to look like,

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.450
but also realistically
communicate what it is

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.400
that actually happens
in an arts classroom?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.670
What value the arts add
to a student's life?

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.010
And so we created what's called
the Framework for Arts Learning

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.430
which is rooted in six themes.

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:30.810
And those themes span
from pre-K through 12,

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.780
and they are universal
themes that we

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.590
as human beings explore
throughout our lives, identity,

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:39.680
interaction, language,
determination,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.610
creation, and transformation.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.910
It is those six words
that anchor all

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:45.430
of the work that we do.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:48.800
And the idea is that while
those are incredibly complex

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.050
and deep things that
we all struggle

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.730
with throughout our lives, if we
can start young people looking

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.510
at those things developmentally
as a five-year-old

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:00.320
that we are giving
them the opportunity

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.100
to really explore what it means
to be human and what they would

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.030
like to discover and understand.

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:08.270
&gt;&gt; Can you say those again?

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:12.610
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond: I certainly
can, identity, interaction,

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:17.620
language, determination,
transformation --

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.040
I'm sorry, creation,
and transformation.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.850
The tricky part about
this is those are --

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.640
these are very lofty goals.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.930
And the question always comes
back to but how does that get

01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:33.570
to a student who
is five years old?

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.480
Do we start talking to
them about transformation?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.080
And so I think what that
looks like then is we

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.440
as the adults are putting
these sort of larger concepts

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.440
of development at the
forefront of our planning,

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.250
but that doesn't mean that we
aren't also bringing skills

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:54.030
development and structure to a
young person to get them there.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.760
So it is really about how
we are being intentional

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.380
that by the time a student
leaves D.C. Public Schools we

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.560
want them to understand
what those concepts mean.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.020
But we don't start there.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.970
We start there in our thinking,
but not with young people.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.380
What it means for young
people is that when they are

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.090
in an arts classroom, the
first thing they should feel is

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:16.090
that what they are doing is
meaningful and matters to them,

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:19.060
that it is connected to
their life, that they feel

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.760
that they have a place
in what is happening.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.100
That's our entry point.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.300
We need to get them
engaged in what's going on.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.660
From there we can -- it's --
you know, when you have somebody

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:32.490
who is engaged and ready to
learn, it is much easier to say,

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:33.790
"Let's build some skills.

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:35.930
Let's have some kind of
intentional instruction,"

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.000
because now there's a
desire for that instruction.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.740
And then I think the most
critical thing that we infuse

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.290
into every piece
of curricular work

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:48.140
that we do is students
must have an opportunity --

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.440
I call it playtime.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.850
Technically, I don't
call it playtime.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:52.300
That's what we call it.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.440
What I call it is like their
opportunity to experiment,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.280
to come to terms with the new
things that we are asking them

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.100
to come to terms with before --

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.920
this is the really
important part --

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.080
before we decide to judge
them, before we assess them,

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.280
before we grade them, before
we say, "This is high-stakes."

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.660
We give them that space
to play so that we

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.680
as educators can watch and
understand where they are,

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.060
where their learning is, and
make sure that they have --

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.360
back to that equity piece --

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.150
they have what they need to
be successful as individuals.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:23.820
And then lastly,
I think they're --

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.000
you know, in that
assessment role, in that time

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.330
when we're really looking
at how far can you take this

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:30.370
as a young person, we ask them

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:32.650
to use those skills
in unique situations.

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.200
We pose unique problems and
ask them to use those skills

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.470
to solve those problems.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:39.940
So what this looks
like in practice --

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.130
I said I was going to get to
an initiative about music,

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:45.910
which I am -- is a program
that we launched at the start

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:49.080
of this year called D.C. Keys.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.700
D.C. Keys.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.000
&gt;&gt; Keys?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.300
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond:
Keys, piano keys.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:57.370
And so this came from an
earlier idea that I had --

01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:00.530
that I was working on in Chicago
and then brought here was

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:02.410
about a middle school initiative

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:05.330
to begin ideas of
music production.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:08.540
How do we not just involve
kids in traditional ensembles,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.480
but how do we get them involved
in the idea of production

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.780
and digital production.

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.670
And how do we start to bridge
the relationships between what's

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:19.480
in their headphones and what
happens in their music class?

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.550
Which both in my role in
Chicago and my role here,

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:22.910
there was a really
large disconnect

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:24.210
between those two worlds.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.660
And so how do we start
to create bridges?

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.060
And to me the first step in
that was starting to look

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.070
at how the music that
they are listening

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:32.370
to is actually produced.

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.670
Like how do you start
to get involved

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:36.260
in that creative process?

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.840
It was an early process,
and a --

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.080
like I said, it grew out
of something in Chicago,

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.570
but it really --
I'm a visual artist.

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:49.240
This is not my -- what I would
call my native discipline.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.620
And so it wasn't until two
years ago when I was hiring

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:57.550
for a music position, and
ray Muller who's -- he's --

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:01.130
I'm going to have somebody wave
to Ray Muller over there --

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:03.360
who came in, and in
his interview the --

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.200
what he said to me
changed everything.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.030
He said, "We need to teach
kids that music is a language.

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:12.740
It is not something
to be repeated.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.640
And they are not just there

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.780
to play something that's
already been written.

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.390
It is there for them to write."

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:20.880
And so I hired him.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.800
And then I was telling
him about this initiative

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.230
that I had been working
on that was struggling --

01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:28.560
admittedly struggling.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.570
And he said, "Well, we shouldn't
start in middle school.

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:31.950
We should start in
kindergarten."

01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:33.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.550
&gt;&gt; Nathan Diamond:
And that was it.

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:35.850
Like that -- you know,

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.150
it was that instantaneous
[applause] -- absolutely.

01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:39.700
It solved so many
problems that I --

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.000
you know, that I
was struggling with,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.220
but that I hadn't
identified which was, one,

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.520
music will be a language.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.820
We'll just start it
from the beginning,

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.120
so it will be no different.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.300
That's just how it
will always be taught.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.380
To how do we make sure that all

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.330
of our students have
instrumental instruction

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.780
which is incredibly
costly, and there's a reason

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.920
that it often lives in high
socioeconomic neighborhoods.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.740
But in D.C. now we can say with
12 keyboards in every school

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.400
which means the keyboards
that we have,

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.110
24 students can be
playing at any one time.

01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:10.640
All of our elementary students,
25,000 kids, are learning

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.160
to play the piano as we speak.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.460
&gt;&gt; Wow.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.460
&gt;&gt; [Applause] And so it solves
that issue of are we ensuring

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.540
that our young people are
learning an instrument

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.040
and learning to perform?

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.930
And the last piece is
that it bridges the world

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.230
of analog and digital.

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.760
Right, it bridges
the traditional

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.070
and the contemporary.

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:34.430
The keyboard is the one
that both lives like a piano

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.510
but can be plugged
into a computer.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:39.160
And so then we can
start this process,

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.460
which the curriculum is rooted

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.780
in composition and
improvisation.

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.800
So our students,
starting in kindergarten,

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.690
at the end of every
year will compose.

01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:52.170
You know, we need to shift our
ideas of what composition means,

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.880
right, that it's a whole new
definition of composition.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.400
But we are asking them to use
music as a language every year

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.610
that they are in
music education.

01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:05.580
The big headline of that, the
piece that matters most to me,

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.470
is that as a system we
are creating young people

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:13.170
who see themselves as
creative producers of culture,

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:16.430
not just consumers of
culture, which is, I think,

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:18.330
also a big shift in
what we're doing.

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:21.950
We're not just trying to make an
audience for later on in life.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.250
We're actually trying
to make the people

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.960
who create culture
later on in life.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.050
And we don't do this
on our own, either.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.000
I think critical
to this process is

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.070
that we have worked very closely
with Washington Performing Arts,

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:36.580
many of whom are here
in the audience today,

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:41.570
as partners to engage kind of
the broader music community

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.870
and to have access to things

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:45.380
that as just a public school
system we don't have access to.

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.060
And so they have supported
us in this process.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.910
They have worked
with our teachers.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:53.330
And they have stepped up to
say that they will be there

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:56.080
when we figure out what it is
we actually need from them,

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.590
which I think is
even more important.

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.530
It's sort of like the blank
check side of it, which is like,

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:03.120
"We are here for you, and
you know what it is that" --

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.970
you just call.

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.510
To the point where at --

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.610
this year they have actually
changed their capital arts

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:12.080
programs to meet the needs
of our new curriculum.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.850
With an organization that works
in so many of our schools,

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.780
that's a critical relationship
that we have, that we can start

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.720
to mold how the two
organizations work together.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.440
So to wrap up, I really
want you to hear this.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.160
And so I have a student here
with us, Jose Andre Montano

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.080
who is from School Without
Walls at Francis-Stevens.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.710
He is a sixth-grader there.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:39.220
He is a jazz pianist.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.800
He is a composer.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.480
He is just an incredible
musician.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.700
And he really -- his work
exemplifies what I am talking

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:55.080
about, which is how does music
act as an individual voice?

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.350
How do you create it so
that it is your voice?

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:02.930
And so I'm going to turn it
over to Jose Andre to perform

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:06.500
so that you can hear
what it is that drives us

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.330
in my organization to do
the work we're doing for all

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:13.150
of the young people in
D.C. Public Schools.

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.510
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: [Applause] All
right, let's hear it for Jose.

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:29.230
[ Applause ]

01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:30.530
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
Microphone?

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:31.830
Hello, hello.

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.130
Hi, everyone.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.190
My name is Jose Montano.

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:40.210
Thank you for admitting me
into the Library of Congress,

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:44.030
for inviting me to play for you.

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:46.280
It's an honor to
play for all you.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.200
And that I'm very happy
to be here with you.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.120
So I wanted to show you --

01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:01.990
I wanted to play a song
that -- I really liked it.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:09.290
And to all the people that
are here, listen to me.

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:14.710
I wanted to show you
like how to do --

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:19.500
like Nathan was talking about
-- how to do like [inaudible]

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.560
and how to make a new
composition, right.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.060
So I will show you
some music for you.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:34.600
And this song is called
"In a Sentimental Mood."

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.510
Hope you enjoy it.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:17:54.510
[ Piano Playing ]

01:17:54.510 --> 01:18:03.320
[ Applause ]

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.620
Thank you.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.510
Thank you very much.

01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:17.650
[ Applause ]

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:18.950
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Thank you, Jose.

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:21.670
We're going to actually invite
you to join us up on stage, so.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:23.810
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
Okay, of course.

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:25.250
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: While we
do that, could we get a round

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:29.510
of applause for Jose's mom and
dad who always support him?

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:34.710
[ Applause ]

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:38.230
&gt;&gt; Christopher K. Morgan: Why
don't you sit next to him?

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:39.530
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank you.

01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:40.830
I feel really lucky.

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:43.610
Jose's had a relationship
with us at the Kennedy Center

01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:46.540
for a number of years, and I
just got to see you perform

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.320
with Renee Fleming
a couple weeks ago,

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.110
and I think he stole
all the attention.

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.400
This kid is a rock star.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.550
We'd love to bring you into
the conversation, Jose.

01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:01.190
And just if you could talk
a little bit about music

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:03.970
in your life and the
importance of it.

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:08.050
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: Okay,
music, I think, is important

01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:11.530
for me because I think
music, it's a feeling.

01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:22.610
It's a feeling for me, and it
brings you a lot of feelings --

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:29.110
it's really hard to explain,
but it's important for me

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:30.910
because -- for school.

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.310
It helps me improve my
education at school.

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:45.910
It helps me to get new
things I never got before.

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:50.690
And that makes me really
happy because at --

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:57.040
that inspires me to still
doing what I'm doing.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.690
And as you can see, in
the song I just played,

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:05.150
it brings you that
feeling, right?

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.450
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Yes.

01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:08.510
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
It has to be like --

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:12.290
it's really hard to explain.

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:13.590
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
You're doing great.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:14.890
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: You have

01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:18.700
to transmit the music
while you're playing.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:23.160
And then when I finish
answering your question --

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.070
when I finish answering
the whole question,

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:30.550
I will show you the same song,
but little bit more faster

01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:36.540
so you can see the difference
how you can transmit a little

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.840
bit more better your music.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.140
So yeah.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.430
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Great,
and I wonder if you might --

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.700
I know you write songs
on your own, you compose.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.400
Is there one that you're working
on now or a new title of one

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.070
that you're working on?

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:50.370
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: Oh, yeah.

01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:53.380
I already have some
compositions.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.800
And a couple days ago
-- like on Friday --

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.320
yeah, on Friday I composed a
new composition that it's called

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.570
"For My Friend Collin."

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:10.020
It's for my friend from school
that is one of my best friends.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.730
And a couple days ago
I composed a song,

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.780
but it's a surprise for him.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.280
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Okay, great, awesome.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.010
Well, we won't ask any more so
that it can stay a surprise.

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:21.670
Jose, I'm hoping that
you'll stay with us onstage

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:25.160
for a few minutes, and maybe we
can end with your next piece,

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.570
if you're going to show
us another way to do it?

01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:28.870
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: Yep.

01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:30.170
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
So a few minutes

01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:31.470
of patience would be great.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.770
I'm going to --

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:34.070
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
That's all right.

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.370
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank
you, because to your right,

01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:36.700
we have Asha who has
been patiently waiting.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.070
I'm so glad you joined us, Asha
Gardner from Split This Rock.

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:43.960
And Asha, we'd love to hear
you jump into the conversation.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.770
We know you are born and
raised in D.C., right?

01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:48.070
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Mm-hmm.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.620
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Spoken word
is a big part of your life?

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.920
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Yes.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.220
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
And you kind of grew

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.520
up through the program --

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.820
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Yes.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.120
&gt;&gt; Mario Rosser: -- as
well as working in it now,

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.420
so welcome to the conversation.

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.720
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Okay, hi, guys.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.020
So I'm Asha Gardner.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.320
I do work with Split This Rock.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.650
I am a product of Split This
Rock nonprofit organization.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:07.370
For the past seven
years, since I was 15 --

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.670
I'll let you guys do the
math yourselves, you know --

01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:15.130
I've been working in
arts programs with youth,

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:19.940
worked all over the city with --
I don't know -- Split This Rock.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.050
I started off in high
school, you know.

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:26.500
In high school, you
go to this wild place

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.170
where it's like, "I
know what I think.

01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:29.470
I know what I want.

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:30.890
I know what I need.

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:32.980
And I have to voice it," right.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:37.920
But in schools there can be
a very definite structure

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.210
as to how one can
present those needs,

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:42.990
or how one can communicate
their feelings,

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:45.200
or tell your teacher
what you went

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.930
through at home the
other day, you know.

01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:49.470
And I felt for a while that --

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.010
felt like there was
this like disconnect.

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:53.760
You know, I felt like my
school had counselors.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.060
My school had deans of students.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.880
My school had vice principals.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.510
But there was no language
to use between us that would

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.870
like effectively get my
point across, you know,

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:08.220
to let them know that, you
know, "My heart hurts today.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.040
And I'm sorry I'm not paying
attention as much," you know.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.520
And I found a really great
sponsor in my building.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.380
She was actually the
librarian, that was as my mom,

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.810
so that's why she was like the
best person in the building.

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:25.780
But I kind of -- I found home
in the library, you know.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.450
And there was a space
where while I was sitting

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:32.020
and like looking through all
these books and everything,

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.610
this space where I could be
like, "I trust you, you know.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.430
You're an adult in this
building I can trust,

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:41.470
like aside from the fact
that, you know, we're related.

01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:44.690
Could you please like, you
know, listen to me talk

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:46.860
about the things I'm going
through just for a second?

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.380
You know, with my
friends and other things?"

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.340
You know, she would
listen to me all the time,

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.220
but she would always in the
conversation be like, "You know,

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.660
this is not what I'm here for.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.960
You know, I'm a librarian.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.170
You know, this is what
I'm supposed to be doing."

01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:01.850
And she challenged me one
day, and she was like, "Well,

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:03.310
start a club, you know.

01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:05.840
You and all your friends come
here, and you sit around,

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.080
and you talk about all your
problems, and you cry together,

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.440
and you laugh together.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.990
So why not make it a
real club, you know?"

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:16.370
And we were like, "Wow,
that's a really great concept.

01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:18.940
What kind of club can
we start to like talk

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.460
about our emotions and things?"

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:24.850
And you know, this
over -- I don't know --

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:28.180
the spirit of art
was in the building

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.240
because Split This Rock
was making their rounds,

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.530
and opening up their new youth
programming with D.C. Slam Team,

01:24:34.530 --> 01:24:38.500
and bringing back all of their
big movements in the city.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.850
And she offered us this
opportunity to be like,

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.040
"Start your own poetry
club," you know.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.920
And I was like, "What
are poetry clubs?"

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.470
You know, I'm thinking like
Shakespeare, and Robert Frost,

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:53.420
and like Emily Dickenson sitting
around together like, "Heh, heh,

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.100
heh, this is so cool," you know.

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.210
And I really like not,
you know, entertained.

01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:02.990
And honestly, it
didn't seem like a --

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:04.630
you know, what we were
trying to get around to.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.230
It felt limiting, you know.

01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:07.530
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Yes.

01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:08.830
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: And this idea

01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:10.130
of spoken word poetry
came about, right.

01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:12.700
And she brought these
artists to the building

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.080
to present their program to us,

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.500
to kind of like give
us a buy-in,

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.790
like this is why you
should house our program.

01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:21.890
And there was an
artist, Rasheed Copeland.

01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:28.400
And he came in, and he did this
amazing poem about his sister.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.710
And I watched myself, my
friends -- we were theater kids,

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.200
so you can -- we're a little
giggly and a little like,

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.650
you know, we can't sit still.

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:37.950
We can't help ourselves.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.660
And for that three minutes --

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.650
his poem was no longer than
three minutes -- we were stuck.

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:45.240
You know, we were
encapsulated in his world.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.220
We were feeling his emotions.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.400
We understood his
relationship with his sister

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.010
by the end of the poem.

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:55.210
And we sat around together --

01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:57.450
more so me, because I kind
of dragged all my friends

01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:58.750
into this poetry
club business --

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:03.150
and we were kind of
like, "We can do this."

01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:06.970
And at the time in our
high school as, you know,

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:10.370
minority students over in
Woodrow Wilson Senior High

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:12.570
School, there wasn't
a big place for us

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:14.290
in our musical theater program.

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:17.060
It was unfortunate,
but we had --

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.380
we felt like we had
all of this art in us

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.680
and no place to put it out.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.610
And we were like, "Spoken
word sounds like nothing

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:25.770
but monologues to me, you know.

01:26:25.770 --> 01:26:27.940
This sounds like something
I can do, you know."

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.840
And personally, I was
jazz-trained in singing.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.760
A lot of my friends
were trained in singing.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.100
And we found all these places

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.990
where all these different art
forms can meet in lyricism --

01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:40.320
simply lyricism, you know.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.450
Call it spoken word, call
it poetry, call it rap,

01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:44.060
call it what you may, you know.

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.410
But it's this spoken form of
expression, you know, that says,

01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:51.250
"This is what I'm feeling, and
this is what it feels like.

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.720
And let me let you feel
it, too," you know.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.510
So we started this poetry club,
and spoken word was our thing.

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:01.020
We taught ourselves how
to do spoken word poetry,

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.910
and we prided ourselves,
you know,

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.650
in how far we had come with it.

01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:09.140
And this new era --
this new lane opened up.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.160
It went from spoken
word poetry --

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.300
so we went from poetry
on the page, Shakespeare,

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.070
all that good stuff, to like
this cool like modern twist

01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:19.850
on it, you know, more vocal,
more, you know, active,

01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:23.040
to this competitive part, right.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.750
Mind you, we're theater kids.

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:26.050
We don't do sports.

01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:29.460
We don't have a sports team that
we can like fit into, you know.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.920
So we're like, "Competition,
you say?"

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.490
You know, and so slam
poetry came into play.

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:40.130
And what slam poetry is is
basically -- I don't know --

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:44.440
individual students, groups
of students, teams, whatever,

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.370
get together in a community
setting like an open mic,

01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:50.880
but instead of everyone just
going up onstage and just,

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.230
you know, delivering their
emotions or their pieces,

01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:57.050
we add a little bit
of points to it.

01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:00.670
You know, we say how much
effort did you put into it?

01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:02.740
Did you really believe
the words that you said?

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.710
Have I heard that poem before?

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:07.220
You know, little -- all
these things start to matter,

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.720
you know, and we start to
hold ourselves accountable

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.910
for the artists that we're
building ourselves into.

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:15.100
And we liked that challenge.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.400
You know, we felt
we had been waiting

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.220
for that challenge
for a very long time.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.270
So Split This Rock started,

01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:24.430
the Louder Than a
Bomb DMV competition.

01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:26.440
Louder Than a Bomb was
actually a competition started

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.730
out in Chicago amongst
Chicago city public schools.

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:34.740
And it created this cool
place for all the kids

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.330
from different areas
of the city, right.

01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:40.090
So if you can imagine, for D.C.
it would be something like --

01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:44.070
well, what it is something
like is people from Southeast,

01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:48.190
Northeast, Northwest, you
know, everyone coming together

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:50.810
for a weekend -- one weekend.

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.060
So every high school being
present, every demographic,

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:58.440
every corner, ever thought
and belief, every walk of life

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.660
from your city is
present, you know.

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.680
And they're all in your
age range, you know.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.160
And you guys are
expressing yourselves,

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.010
exchanging your thoughts,
and how --

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:09.720
what your view is on your
life, you know, in the city.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.550
And you guys look around like,
"Wow, we're not so much --

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:15.060
you know, we're not as different
as we thought we were."

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.690
And we have elders --
I call them elders --

01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:18.990
the teachers, the sponsors.

01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:22.980
To be given that
term with respect

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.980
because you guys
harness an environment.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.760
You guys are responsible for
this environment, you know,

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.740
where students come, and
they are very vulnerable,

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.260
and they are exposing a very
large part of themselves

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.810
that in most cases if they
didn't have art would be silent,

01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:41.100
you know, would never be brought
to the surface, you know.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.800
And you guys are delegating,
you know, and helping them,

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.850
and holding their hands,
and letting them know, "Hey,

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:49.190
I saw a kid who did
a poem like yours.

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:50.490
I think you might like them.

01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:51.790
Go check them out," you know.

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:53.090
And look, there's a bond --

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:54.880
a cross-town bond
started you know,

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.470
turns into a friendship
that lasts forever.

01:29:57.470 --> 01:30:01.570
So kind of talk more on
what I feel like, you know,

01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:07.880
arts brings -- arts programming,
it's this opportunity, you know,

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.830
for students to apply, to
challenge themselves, you know,

01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:17.610
to try community, you know, step
outside of their comfort zone,

01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:18.910
because I like to
think that a lot

01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.370
of times artists aren't
always the most --

01:30:21.370 --> 01:30:23.870
I don't want to say
normal people, you know.

01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:28.440
We aren't always -- we don't
always like fit in all the time.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.160
And that can be very --

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.050
you know, it can put you
in a very isolated place.

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:36.930
It can be socially
traumatic to a degree.

01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:40.730
Emotionally on the long term as
you build yourself into an adult

01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:44.810
and go down your line as --
to adulthood or whatever,

01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:47.540
you have all of these
issues, you know,

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.390
because you never solved
your problems, you know.

01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:53.620
And we're having this
opportunity to start solving

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.300
and addressing some of these
issues while they're fresh,

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.600
you know, and they're young.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.630
And there are people, there are
sponsors, there are teachers,

01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:04.570
there are program directors,
there are teaching artists

01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:09.390
who are responsible for making
sure that that process goes

01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:12.720
as less rocky as
possible, you know.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.270
So what I do now is I
am a teaching artist

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:16.570
in these schools.

01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:18.500
So I've gone through
the programs.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:22.950
I've done the slams, and
performing, and spoken word.

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.570
And now I've seen the
opportunity to go back

01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:28.890
and teach, you know, my
students what I know.

01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:32.710
I felt like I made it -- I
got so many opportunities,

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.250
and I made it so far
in my personal life

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:41.120
by just expressing myself, you
know, by feeling these limits

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:46.250
of -- and bounds just fall off
of me, that I felt the need.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.890
I don't know why.

01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:52.270
There's a student in D.C.
who isn't in a program.

01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:55.020
Honestly, on a realer note,

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.050
I am from D.C. I'm
third-generation Washington,

01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.460
D.C., Washingtonian.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:03.880
And I've grown up with
students, with young people,

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.180
with young adults from
all over this city,

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.090
from all over the
country who do have --

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:14.870
come from all areas of the
economic ladder, from all areas

01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:18.510
of religions, and walks of
life, all colors of skin.

01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:23.210
And regardless of
any of those things

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:27.030
or how they differentiate, one
thing we all share in common is

01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:29.830
that it's critical
that we have something

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:32.380
to do with our free time.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.430
So easy for us to
get in trouble.

01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:38.060
It's -- I mean, not kind
of like funny trouble.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.560
I mean, the kind of trouble
that doesn't allow us

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.850
to come home ever
again, you know.

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:47.880
And as a youth in the last
two years, I've had --

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:52.530
I've lost friends, you know,
in the streets, and around,

01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:54.060
in front of their
homes, you know,

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.470
in front of their neighborhoods.

01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:59.070
And I think to myself oftentimes
like if they had programs,

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:02.240
you know, if they had a
sponsor, if they had a mentor,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.390
if they had somebody who
could keep their mind

01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:07.060
and keep them busy
on something else,

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.140
would they still
be here, you know?

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.020
And so I feel that's
the severity

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.320
and that's like the demand.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.720
And that's what we do here.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.520
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Thank you for that.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:24.650
[ Applause ]

01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:28.290
I really love what you said
about the cross-town bond.

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:30.290
So having spent 12 years
in Chicago, I know Louder

01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:31.950
Than a Bomb really well.

01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:34.390
And I just -- what I want
to paint for a picture

01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.720
for the room is if you
haven't been to one

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.630
of these poetry slam
competitions,

01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:44.550
it is the most supportive house
of kids that you've ever found.

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:48.680
Like I've been in auditoriums of
2000 high schoolers in Chicago

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:53.190
from every neighborhood,
and they are only supportive

01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:57.010
of whoever is onstage, even
though it's a competition.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:58.880
And that's why I've
like adopted the --

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.270
like I use the snap all the
time, because it's a way

01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:04.450
to show support when someone
is onstage struggling,

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:08.240
but also sort of -- I don't
want to call it a milder round

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.940
of applause, but it's
like a low hum of support

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.730
that you can let people know
that you've got their back.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.190
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Well, so
snaps are like a cool thing.

01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:16.260
So when you're -- someone is
onstage, and they're performing,

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.430
right, and you get really moved,
because that's what we aim

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:21.950
to do is like move you
guys out of your seats

01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:23.250
and like, "Oh, my God.

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:24.550
That was great!"

01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:25.980
It's like -- it's kind
of disrespectful to step

01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.190
up in someone's home and
be like, "Oh, my God!

01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:29.490
That was so awesome!

01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:31.160
I"-- and they're still,
you know, talking.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.580
So we have this thing
in our communities.

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:36.270
We have these little
mannerisms we do to --

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.810
so we let people know that
like, "You are appreciated.

01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:40.110
You are being received.

01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:41.680
I am listening."

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.190
So snapping is one thing
we do, you know, the snap.

01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:46.960
Another thing, if you're
ever in a poetry area,

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.800
you can do like a
sweet chocolate noise.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.330
It's like if you have the last
piece of chocolate on the bar,

01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:53.600
you put it in your
mouth, you're like, "Mmm!

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.480
Yeah." We like the sweet
chocolateness [sic].

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.820
Also a new thing that the
community's adapted is

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.260
awkward giraffe.

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.310
So you can like throw your hand
in the air and be like, "Yes!"

01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:04.350
You know, little things.

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:06.560
So there are these cool
little mannerisms we have

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.220
in the arts community that
are teaching people how

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.740
to like appreciate their
neighbors, you know,

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.710
and how to respect, you
know, someone who's speaking.

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:17.160
You know, all of these -- the
parts of -- I don't know --

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.850
being a citizen, you know, being
humane in the world, you know.

01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:22.150
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Yeah, really lovely.

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:23.950
Thank you.

01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:27.460
[ Applause ]

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.380
Rhona, I think we
need to find some kind

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.240
of cross-collaborative
project for us to work on,

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.020
because these guys
are such rock stars,

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.400
and I feel like we
could tackle anything.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:39.890
We're going to get to a
couple Q&amp;A in a moment.

01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:42.310
I just -- I'm going to start

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:44.510
to once again knit
together this conversation,

01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:46.350
which I think is
already really connected.

01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:48.130
But you're hearing from, you
know, different perspectives

01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:53.340
about really the necessity of
the arts in everyone's lives.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:57.180
And I was thrilled
that Jane Chu talked

01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:59.770
about our Any Given Child
program here in D.C.

01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:02.500
that has really been
a work-in-progress

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.160
for many, many years.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.160
We have a unique window of
opportunity for every sector

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.480
of the community to
come together and say,

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.800
"How do we prioritize
arts education in D.C.?"

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.780
And part of the work to do that
is to look honestly at the data

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:23.380
which -- and data
is a listening tour,

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:24.960
hearing communities,
hearing voices.

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.260
It's looking at numbers.

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:29.610
It's looking at maps of the
city and analyzing the gaps

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:30.910
and the saturation points.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.530
And it's also looking at
research and best practice.

01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:35.940
So it really kind of marries
these things together.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.660
So I would urge everyone to
kind of keep that on your radar

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.740
and watch that progress,
because it's a real outcome.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.740
It's something that's happening
right now that takes this kind

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.370
of conversation and puts it
into an actual structure.

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:53.040
And I think, you know, if I add
anything to this conversation,

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:56.030
you know, I get so
inspired, but I also laugh.

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:57.460
When I worked in -- I've worked

01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:59.470
in school districts
my whole life, right.

01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:02.720
Well, when I worked at central
office, they mostly needed me

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.940
to be the creative individual,
right, bringing a different kind

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.010
of solution to a
problem, and then put

01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:09.700
that creativity into
a structure.

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.570
But now at a performing
arts organization,

01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:12.960
they only need my structure.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.590
But for those of us that are
sort of the structure-heads

01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:20.930
in the house, that is
important, too, you know.

01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:24.310
When I hear Nathan talk,
when I hear Asha talk

01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:28.690
about the systems, the networks,
the role of mentors, that --

01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:31.560
the building of those
constructs is also an artform

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.210
and really critical,
because you need all

01:37:33.210 --> 01:37:34.990
of us working in concert, right?

01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:38.100
So couple of minutes
for questions.

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.250
Anyone have something
that they want to direct

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:44.620
to the whole panel or
to somebody individual?

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:47.700
Feel free to raise
a hand or stand up.

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.000
&gt;&gt; Mario.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.930
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Oh, great,
so we have a couple mics.

01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:53.290
Yes, Jenny?

01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:54.590
So if we can get a mic to come

01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:58.170
around to second
row in the middle.

01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:03.030
Thank you so much.

01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:04.420
Great.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:07.190
&gt;&gt; Hi, so first of all,
thank you, and especially

01:38:07.190 --> 01:38:11.280
to our youngest members of
the panel for your eloquence

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.470
and for really walking the walk.

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.770
Thank you for that.

01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:18.650
We've talked a great deal about
teachers, about institutions,

01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:19.980
about individual artists.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.640
But I would love to hear what --

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.200
how you feel parents can be
more involved in the equation,

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.610
because I think many of us who
have children or have children

01:38:29.610 --> 01:38:33.280
who are friends with children
in public schools, especially,

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.730
wonder what their role is and
how they can be really active.

01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:38.240
And your mention of
your mom having this --

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.830
these two roles sort of reminded
me to insert that question

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:43.270
into the conversation.

01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:44.570
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Great, thank you.

01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:47.690
Who wants to tackle this one?

01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:50.120
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner:
Well, I don't mind.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:55.600
Parents -- I think parents are a
necessary to all of the process,

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.980
to -- that they bridge
the gap between the arts

01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.650
and the education, you know.

01:38:59.650 --> 01:39:01.130
They are the story.

01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:03.840
They are the emotion, the reason
that the kid is, you know,

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.000
expressing themselves
in the first place.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.240
And I think the most
crucial part to that,

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.130
which we lack frequently, is
presence of those parents.

01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:16.510
If you know your student
is involved in a program,

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:20.930
urge yourself -- you know, urge
your student to be, you know,

01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:22.810
open to you being there.

01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:24.320
You know, show up.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.220
You know, leave them a note,
let them know that you're proud

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.570
of them just for like, you know,

01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:30.290
preparing themselves
for the day.

01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:34.690
There's so many ways a parent
can put a foot, a hand,

01:39:34.690 --> 01:39:36.740
a finger, you know,
in the child's

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.550
like developmental process.

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:40.630
And it doesn't stop at home.

01:39:40.630 --> 01:39:44.250
It's a constant process until
they leave the nest, you know.

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:51.570
And I think not just all along
the way, but with students --

01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:54.420
I'm sorry, teachers,
I think, it's --

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.000
sometimes what we do is keep the
parents away from certain parts

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.340
of the project because
it can be scary

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:02.670
to have the parents around.

01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:04.070
You never know how
they're going to react.

01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:08.040
I've dealt with a few scary
parents already in my, you know,

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.330
teaching years, you know.

01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:13.120
And I can, you know,
resonate with that.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.960
It can be very terrifying,
but you have to be open --

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.260
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: That's right.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.560
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: -- you know,
because those are the people

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.260
that made the student that you
love, and that you're watching,

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:22.900
and who's watching
over you, you know, so.

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.950
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Yeah, I hear
really carving out that role

01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:26.250
and including them as well.

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.550
&gt;&gt; Asha Gardner: Definitely.

01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:28.850
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Yep,
you can add to it, Alex.

01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:30.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alexander Panteyat: I can
just share a personal example.

01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:33.680
I'm from the Ukraine and
started lessons at age seven,

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.980
as I think I mentioned.

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.680
And for the first five years
I took lessons, my grandma was

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.800
in there every lesson writing

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.000
in a red notebook
that I still have.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.300
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
That's awesome!

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alexander Panteyat: Very
large, hard-to-read handwriting,

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.900
taking notes on what
the teacher said.

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.230
And then I was required
to review it

01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:52.660
when I came home
and as I practiced.

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:56.740
So that was definitively
formative for me, and --

01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.040
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Oh, my God.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.340
That's beautiful.

01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alexander Panteyat:
-- feel very lucky.

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.940
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Okay, one
more response from the panel,

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.800
and then we'll go to
our next question.

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.150
&gt;&gt; Christopher K. Martin:
I was just going to say,

01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:07.040
from an institutional
standpoint,

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.840
what are the mechanisms
that we can put in place

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.370
when it's difficult
for parents to show up?

01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:13.490
So how do we find
ways to support them?

01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:15.320
How do we sometimes
gently require it,

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.220
because sometimes there
can also feel like arts --

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:22.310
after-school arts programming
can start to feel like daycare.

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:23.870
And there's a drop-off/pick-up
mentality.

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:25.630
And so institutions
like public schools

01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:27.630
that often have sign-out
systems for young people

01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:30.630
because of protecting them,
can we institute that so

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:33.230
that the parents have to come in
and, just as brief as that is,

01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:35.420
have that point of
contact and engagement?

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.450
And then also when we start
looking at young people

01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:41.410
that become deeply invested
in their artistic practice

01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:44.030
and are considering
that for their futures,

01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:46.430
how do we support them in
the tough conversations

01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:48.760
with their parents that
sometimes are fearful

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.600
of what a future in
the arts looks like?

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.010
The future in the
arts looks like this.

01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:54.390
It's bright, and
beautiful, and supportive.

01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:56.770
It's not easy, but it's viable.

01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:58.550
And so I've -- totally
understand,

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:01.180
my parents were not
sold on it for years.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.890
Even when I was making
money as an artist,

01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:04.460
they still were not sold on it.

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.370
And if I had had advocates
that helped supported

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.880
that conversation -- so we
as institutions can, I think,

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.120
partner in a lot of ways
to help smooth that,

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.610
as well as inviting
them in and trying

01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:15.530
to get them to be present.

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:16.830
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank you.

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:18.130
&gt;&gt; Christopher K. Martin: Yeah.

01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:19.430
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Great.

01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:20.730
Another question, looks like
you're already ready over here.

01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:24.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have two
questions, if that's okay.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.710
And the first question
is directed

01:42:26.710 --> 01:42:28.510
to Jane Chu if she's still here?

01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.970
&gt;&gt; No, she's not.

01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:31.270
&gt;&gt; She's not?

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:32.570
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Nope.

01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:33.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, maybe somebody
can ask here because I wanted

01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:37.370
to know -- the first question
is I wanted to know the status

01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:39.760
of the National Endowment
of the Arts,

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.290
because when 45 was elected, I
think he announced he was going

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:45.770
to get rid of the National
Endowment of the Arts.

01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:48.840
I know I was signing
petitions to keep it,

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.180
the National Endowment
of Humanities,

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.360
the Public Broadcasting
Corporation.

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.660
If any of you can
answer that question.

01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:58.810
The second question I
guess would be directed

01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:05.500
to Mr. Alexander, okay, it was a
beautiful presentation you gave

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.420
on the effects of
music on the brain.

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:11.000
And I wanted to know if you've
done any studies on the effect

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.410
of music and the arts,

01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:16.730
but particularly music,
on autistic children?

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.260
Not necessarily Asperger's,

01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:22.070
but kind of in the
medium of the spectrum.

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.370
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Great.

01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:24.680
So I know we can
address question two,

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.260
so we're going to
focus on that one.

01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:29.250
And maybe there can be a sidebar
after the panel with colleagues

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:31.200
in the audience about the second
-- or about the first one.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.270
So Alex, you want to take that?

01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:34.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Alexander
Panteyat: Absolutely.

01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:37.640
So there are already a number
of studies that indicated

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:43.240
that group music-making can be
incredibly pro-social for kids

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.790
on the autism spectrum.

01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:50.500
And your -- the timing of your
question for me is very apt.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.530
I am exploring a research
study at Johns Hopkins,

01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:57.940
my institution, as we speak with
the Kennedy Krieger Institute

01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.840
and several other partners.

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.250
So we have an interested
music therapist,

01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:04.420
and we are actively
exploring that now.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:09.230
Until now, my work as a movement
disorders neurologist has

01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:12.990
focused on the other end
of the spectrum, aging.

01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:17.070
So I've done a study called
Parkinsonics using group

01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:20.500
choir-based singing to
improve communication --

01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.840
get the voice louder and clearer
in patients with Parkinson's,

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.470
and we're submitting
that for publication

01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:26.770
in the next few weeks.

01:44:26.770 --> 01:44:29.250
And just to give
everybody a broader context,

01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:33.350
I've been very fortunate
to help establish and lead

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:36.690
at Johns Hopkins our Center for
Music in Medicine where we seek

01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:41.140
to make music and rhythm an
integral part of healing illness

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.930
across the age spectrum.

01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:45.230
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Great.

01:44:45.230 --> 01:44:46.990
And you know, it's interesting,
performing arts organizations,

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:49.260
definitely across the District,
but across country also,

01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:51.370
are really thinking about --

01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:53.220
for performances how to
create more relaxed settings

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:57.620
so that whether it's an
autistic child or other barrier

01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.510
to really participating
as an audience member,

01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:00.850
that there's more
relaxed performances

01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:03.550
that are really built
to welcome all folks in.

01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:05.870
So unfortunately, we're just
-- we're right about at time

01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:07.900
and we are going to
end with a performance.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:11.500
So I wonder if you might
just indulge me on one second

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.940
because I always -- I'm
always fiercely taking notes

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.980
because I look for themes
from these conversations.

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:18.910
So usually, I end up
with like five bold words

01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:20.210
but I have about 30 [laughter].

01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:22.510
So I try to get them down to 10.

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:24.060
So this is what I'd
like to leave you

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:26.730
with before we leave
with another song.

01:45:26.730 --> 01:45:31.450
So this crosstown bond, I love.

01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:35.060
Meet in lyricism -- come on.

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.510
I think voice was just
across this whole panel.

01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:43.770
Evidence, ancestors,
language, tools, literacy,

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:46.770
producers of culture, trust.

01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:50.720
And then I love -- I
think this was Asha --

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.440
finding a home in the library

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.050
which I think we
did today, right?

01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:57.880
So can we do a beautiful
round of applause

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.680
for this wonderful
panel, please?

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:06.040
[ Applause ]

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:09.160
And we'd like to give a
thunderous round of applause

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.640
for Jose who's going to
play one more piece for us.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.440
So thanks again.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:35.670
[ Applause ]

01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:38.730
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] with the mic.

01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:40.030
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
Hey again.

01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:41.330
I'm back.

01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:43.570
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
All right [laughter]!

01:46:43.570 --> 01:46:44.870
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: Okay,

01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:48.700
so I would play one
more piece for you.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.770
It's one of my compositions
actually.

01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:53.330
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Great.

01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.590
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano: So this
one is called [Inaudible].

01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:57.970
Hope you enjoy it.

01:47:02.510 --> 01:50:02.490
[ Music ]

01:50:02.490 --> 01:50:04.290
&gt;&gt; All right!

01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:18.140
[ Applause ]

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.890
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero:
Thank you, Jose.

01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:23.250
&gt;&gt; Jose Andre Montano:
Okay, before I say --

01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:29.040
before I say bye to everybody
-- before I'm leaving,

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.230
I will give a quick message
to everybody that is here.

01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:37.340
This -- it's a really
important message.

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:46.540
And it's going to help you and
it's going to change your life.

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:49.450
So this -- be brave always.

01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:55.790
When you are scared,
it's not going to help

01:50:55.790 --> 01:51:00.650
and you're not going to do a
lot of things in your life.

01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:05.230
You always have to
practice, rehearse,

01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:10.360
be good with the
people and be brave.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.090
The birth and the music
is very important for you

01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:20.850
because it's going to -- it's
going to help you to get a lot

01:51:20.850 --> 01:51:26.960
of things and it's going
to help you to your life

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.060
because maybe you're going
to have some challenges

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:35.990
and that important things
is going to help you to get

01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:37.710
that challenge out of your way.

01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:39.100
So stay with this phrase.

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.950
Be good. Be brave.

01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:43.250
Brave -- sorry.

01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:45.460
And rehearse all.

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.390
God bless you and thank
you very much to everyone.

01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:51.190
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank you.

01:51:51.190 --> 01:52:01.590
[ Applause ]

01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:02.890
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
So we're going to --

01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:04.190
&gt;&gt; Mario Rossero: Thank you.

01:52:04.190 --> 01:52:05.490
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Thank you again, Jose.

01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:06.790
Marvelous!

01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:09.720
So we're going to take about a
30-minute pause but I don't want

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.620
to call it like a break-break

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:16.380
because when Sue was speaking
earlier and enticing you a bit

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:20.470
about all of the treasures
and magical things that are

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.520
in the collections of
the Library of Congress,

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.640
we have a few of them next door.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.930
So in the room right next
door, colleagues of ours

01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:30.200
from the American Folk
Life Center which is part

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:33.800
of the Library of Congress,
as well as our Music Division,

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.660
as well as our Prints and
Photographs Division --

01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:38.330
they brought some examples

01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:41.590
of the Library's
artistic collections.

01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:44.580
And I really, really hope you
will take some time to stop

01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.920
by next door, take a look.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.850
The restrooms are right

01:52:48.850 --> 01:52:50.730
around the corner near
where you came in.

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:54.270
And please be back in
your seats right at 11:30

01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:55.820
so that we can get our
second panel started.

01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.120
Thanks.

Now, we're just about ready

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.320
to start with Panel Two.

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.330
But before we begin,
I just wanted

01:53:06.330 --> 01:53:08.950
to acknowledge the former Chair

01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:11.420
of the Arts Commission,
Anne Ashmore-Hudson.

01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.720
Can you just say hi?

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.520
Thank you.

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:17.100
[ Applause ]

01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:20.590
It was through Anne that
the Arts Education policy

01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:25.530
that we started 10 years
ago came to fruition.

01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:28.060
So thank you.

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:31.970
And now, without further
ado, we will start Panel Two.

01:53:37.090 --> 01:53:40.230
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Okay, hello again.

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:42.090
You always hope that
after coffee

01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:43.770
and stretch time,
folks come back.

01:53:43.770 --> 01:53:45.360
So thank you for coming back.

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.660
Appreciate it.

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.170
So I'm Lee Ann Potter.

01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:52.040
I direct Educational Outreach
here at the Library of Congress.

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.290
And a couple of months
ago when Rhona

01:53:54.290 --> 01:54:00.570
and I started brainstorming,
what this symposium would do --

01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:04.650
we agreed that it should answer
essentially four questions.

01:54:04.650 --> 01:54:06.170
Well, maybe three questions.

01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:07.870
I'll get to the fourth.

01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:09.970
We thought about why.

01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:11.500
We thought about how.

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.800
We thought about what.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.230
We thought about all
those good questions.

01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:17.530
And as far as the why
goes, what we were thinking

01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.790
about was why Arts
Education matters.

01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:23.820
And I think our first panel
certainly did an excellent

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.600
addressing the why.

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:29.530
Our hope with regard to
the what was that some

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:32.890
of you would be thinking,
"What does the Library

01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.920
of Congress have to do
with Arts Education?"

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.490
It's not immediately
the first place we think

01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:39.280
of when we think of the arts.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:41.940
So our hope was that when
you had a chance to see some

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.780
of the items from the
Library's collection and hear

01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.510
from Sue earlier about what else
is in the Library's collection

01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:51.720
that the what does the
Library of Congress have to do

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.130
with Arts Education would
become much more clear.

01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:55.710
I hope that happened.

01:54:55.710 --> 01:54:57.890
By the way, did any of you
happen to see anything next door

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.910
that you weren't
expecting to see?

01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:01.860
Good, that was kind of the hope

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:05.870
that you'd see some things you
hadn't expected would be here.

01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:09.280
The next question is
really the question

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.490
that our second panel is going
to focus on this morning.

01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:17.200
And that question is the how.

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:21.000
So how do these amazing
resources that live

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.710
in the collections of the
Library of Congress --

01:55:23.710 --> 01:55:27.830
how can they be incorporated
into Arts Education in ways

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:31.630
that are truly meaningful
and truly inspiring?

01:55:31.630 --> 01:55:36.490
And so we have a marvelous
panel and I'm going to start

01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:39.670
by introducing you to
a colleague of mine.

01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:43.050
Ray White is a senior
music specialist

01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:45.050
in the Library's Music Division.

01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:47.840
And he is actually -- you know,
when I say that this is a panel,

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.320
I got to be honest with you.

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.190
It's really not so much a
panel as it is a performance,

01:55:53.190 --> 01:55:55.830
a panel and a performance.

01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:59.210
So our first performer
is my colleague Ray White

01:55:59.210 --> 01:56:02.270
and Ray is going to do
a performance for you

01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:06.790
that I hope will get you
thinking much the way a

01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:09.480
classroom teacher
is often thinking

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:12.150
about how do we get young
people to understand

01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:14.160
that creativity doesn't
just happen,

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.020
that it really is a process.

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:19.800
And that rough drafts really
do play an important role

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.320
in creativity.

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:23.310
So with that, and that's all
I'm going to say about that.

01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:25.110
So Ray, it's your turn.

01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:31.170

01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:33.100
&gt;&gt; Raymond A. White:
Thank you very much.

01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:34.400
What I'm going to offer

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.900
up in the next few minutes
are materials that are housed

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:41.810
in the Library's Music Division.

01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:44.220
And they're among
our great treasures.

01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:49.360
And they do demonstrate the
creative process at work.

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.290
Now, perhaps many of you may
be familiar with the song,

01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:57.000
"My Favorite Things" from
the <i>Sound of Music </i>.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.840
And perhaps the sound that runs
in your brain when you hear

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:04.200
that is Julie Andrews
singing it.

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.510
But suppose she sang this

01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:13.470
which Oscar Hammerstein wrote
before he wrote what you

01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:15.270
probably remember.

01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:44.510
[ Music ]

01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:48.040
[ Laughter ]

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:51.270
Oscar Hammerstein was on
his way where he was going

01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:54.100
but he was not there
yet [laughter].

01:57:55.650 --> 01:58:01.600
Also from the same show,
there's the famous song called

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.060
"Do Re Mi" and Oscar started out
with this idea that he was going

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.090
to find some word to make each

01:58:11.090 --> 01:58:16.060
of those syllables
into a phrase.

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:20.510
And this was before
he quite arrived.

01:58:20.510 --> 01:59:04.510
[ Music ]

01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:08.370
[ Laughter ]

01:59:08.370 --> 01:59:10.250
You sort of have
to figure out that

01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:13.860
when you get so -- it's sewing.

01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:15.160
We [inaudible] -- I don't know,

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.000
who would necessarily
have thought of that.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:27.750
Now we shift gears to Irving
Berlin whose materials also

01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:29.310
reside here at the Library.

01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:33.510
And one of the things
that his materials for

01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:38.940
"God Bless America" demonstrate
that depending on the time

01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:43.610
and circumstances of
someone's creativity,

01:59:43.610 --> 01:59:46.000
their creative product may vary.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.380
Now the short story about
"God Bless America" is

01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:52.180
that it was originally written
during the closing months

01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:54.600
of World War I.

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:58.170
It was part of an
all-soldiers revue called <i>Yip,</i>

01:59:58.170 --> 02:00:03.560
<i>Yip Yaphank </i>which was at Camp
Upton at Yaphank, Long Island.

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.620
And this was going to be
the last song in the show.

02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:08.260
So he wrote this thing
called "God Bless America."

02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:15.960
Well, he ultimately decided
it was too anthem-like

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.000
to be the end of this vaudeville
show so he put it aside

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.130
and he came back to it
in 1938 and revised it

02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:26.150
when circumstances had changed.

02:00:26.150 --> 02:00:28.970
But this is what he first wrote.

02:00:33.510 --> 02:01:04.090
[ Music ]

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:10.490
Now, okay in 1918, the
idea of left and right

02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:16.400
as political orientations
were not in common parlance.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:23.270
And all he meant was guide her
to the right path which is fine

02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:25.770
but guide her to the right
of the light from above.

02:01:25.770 --> 02:01:30.680
And then he decided 20 years
later when he was fixing it up,

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.320
it became "Guide her through
the night with the light

02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.120
from above," which is just
plainly better poetry.

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:41.700
So there went that change
but the song keeps on going.

02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:43.510
And it continues like this.

02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:55.040
[ Music ]

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.500
Now, the part you were running

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.940
in your head was probably the
mountains and the prairies

02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:02.930
and the oceans white with foam.

02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:05.670
Well, that didn't
exist in the early one.

02:02:05.670 --> 02:02:09.180
Make her victorious because
the United States was

02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:13.480
in a war at the time.

02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:21.430
But on land and foam [laughter]
-- foam has to rhyme with home.

02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:23.310
I get that part.

02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:28.700
But then he in 1938, went
back in the mountains

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:30.800
and the prairies and the
oceans white with foam.

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.250
Okay, that's an acceptable line.

02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:38.570
And -- but then -- so we
got the foam and the home

02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:42.610
and then he finishes
up with this end

02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:45.640
which I find a little
bit musically awkward,

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:46.940
dare I say it.

02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.740
Ready?

02:02:48.740 --> 02:03:01.670
[ Music ]

02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:06.110
Now, I would say again, I
don't think there's anything

02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:10.450
at all wrong with writing
something that's clumsy

02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:14.760
or awkward or inelegant or
whatever you want to say

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.590
in the creative process as long

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:22.120
as the creative process
continues along [laughter].

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:26.560
And it gets where it's
ultimately going to go

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.260
which points out to me

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:35.170
that music writing is
part art and part craft.

02:03:35.170 --> 02:03:38.060
And our last example is
also from Irving Berlin,

02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:43.210
his 1946 show, <i>Annie,
Get Your Gun </i>.

02:03:43.210 --> 02:03:45.920
Now if you met -- if you've ever
seen that show or know anything

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.070
about it, you know it's
about Annie Oakley,

02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:54.220
the 19th century sharpshooter
and her friends Buffalo Bill

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:56.970
and Charlie and Frank Butler
and they want to get her

02:03:56.970 --> 02:03:58.550
to join the Western Show.

02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:00.860
So these three guys sing this
song, "There's No Business

02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:05.690
Like Show Business" telling
her how great show business is.

02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:07.640
And so as the song goes on

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.960
and the verses progress then
she kind of joins in with them.

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.670
And then when they
get to the reprise,

02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:14.100
she sings it all herself,

02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:15.640
"There's no business
like show business.

02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.170
Let's go on with the show."

02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:22.640
Well, there were a lot of
words that Irving Berlin wrote

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.300
for this song that didn't make
it to the final stage either.

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:30.400
And bear in mind that the
ones that we're going to share

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.070
with you now are
in that category.

02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:35.620
Before we do though, I would
like to introduce my colleague,

02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.760
Stephen Yusko, who has joined us

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.380
at the piano for
this performance.

02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:41.180
Thank you, Steve.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.040
[ Applause ]

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:47.390
So imagine, if you
will, these three guys

02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:49.850
and then Ethel Merman
belting out,

02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:51.650
"There's No Business
Like Show Business."

02:04:51.650 --> 02:06:32.510
[ Music ]

02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:39.040
[ Applause ]

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.850
Thank you very much.

02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:43.150
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Oh,
that was marvelous.

02:06:43.150 --> 02:06:44.450
Thank you, Ray.

02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:48.270
Terrific! So our
next two panelists

02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:50.320
and I'm going to
kind of this way.

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:54.970
Our next two panelists represent
organizations that are part

02:06:54.970 --> 02:06:58.470
of the Teaching with
Primary Sources Consortium.

02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:59.770
And for more than 10 years,

02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:02.250
the Library of Congress has
been receiving appropriations

02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:07.070
from Congress that have been
directed to the Library for us

02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:10.360
to redistribute as
grants to organizations

02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.810
to develop curriculum

02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:13.970
and to make available
professional development

02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:16.440
opportunities for teachers.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:19.070
Today, we have 29
different organizations all

02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:21.510
around the United States who
are receiving grant funding

02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:23.720
from the Library with
all kinds of programs.

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.810
Not all of them are specifically
connected to Arts Education

02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:32.200
but two of the programs that
are represented here today are.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.340
Erin Elman is going to
be our first speaker.

02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:39.410
And Erin is currently the
Dean of Continuing Studies

02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:41.770
at the University of the
Arts in Philadelphia.

02:07:41.770 --> 02:07:44.080
And I'm going to let
Erin take it from here.

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:45.380
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: Okay, oh.

02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:48.480
So I'm going to actually do
a little bit of a PowerPoint.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.840
How do I move this?

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:52.140
Just -- [inaudible], okay.

02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:53.700
Move it over here.

02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:55.000
Hello, everyone.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.300
&gt;&gt; Hi.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:58.330
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: I want to just
say how inspired I have been

02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:00.540
and Ray, that was a really
tough act to follow [laughter].

02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:01.840
I don't sing.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.400
I'm a visual artist.

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.930
But I'll just start up by saying

02:08:06.930 --> 02:08:09.260
that I am really
honored to be here.

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:12.700
I'm going to -- I've been so
inspired by the first panel

02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.010
that I think I'm
going to shift things

02:08:14.010 --> 02:08:16.430
up a little bit in
my presentation.

02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:18.530
So I may not get through
all the slides but I think

02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:20.600
that you'll enjoy it more.

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.450
So just to give you a context
of who we are at the University

02:08:24.450 --> 02:08:27.180
of the Arts, we're in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:31.340
We are a small private art
institution that houses all

02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:34.020
of the arts -- visual,
performing and creative writing.

02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:36.400
We're actually the only
university in the nation

02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:39.040
to devote ourselves
exclusively to the arts.

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.680
There are 1800 students
that are studying graduate

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:44.470
and undergraduate programs.

02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:45.940
And I represent the Dean

02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:48.000
of Continuing Studies,
so what's that?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.730
That's another 2900 students
that are the learning continuum

02:08:53.730 --> 02:08:57.380
from very young people that
do out-of-school programs

02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:00.980
on Saturdays and credit-bearing
programs in the summer

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.380
for high school students.

02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:05.120
We also have enrichment
programs for adults.

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.280
But we also have about a
thousand in-service K-12

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:12.990
teachers that come to
us to study programs.

02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:15.230
The Summer Music
Studies Program --

02:09:15.230 --> 02:09:19.650
which Johanna actually teaches
in -- is part of that program.

02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:22.370
And we also have a Professional
Institute for Educators

02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:25.880
and those two, the music program

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:29.230
and the professional institute
programs, we have non-matric

02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:32.410
and matric courses
for educators.

02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:35.590
And so in that program
is the Teaching

02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:37.200
with Primary Sources Program.

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.650
And just to give you a
little bit of a history --

02:09:39.650 --> 02:09:44.320
back in 2010, we saw an
RFP for an organization

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.620
to deliver opportunities
to develop curriculum

02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:51.290
and professional development
experiences for K-12 teachers.

02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:53.250
And my colleagues saw
it and said, "Anne,

02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:54.980
we have to apply for that.

02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.280
We're just perfect."

02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.300
And I said, "Yes, but
we're really at capacity.

02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:01.060
How much more can we
do with 2500 students?"

02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.290
And she said, "But
how can we not?"

02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:04.600
And I said, "How can we not?"

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.640
And so we were thrilled
when we're selected

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.860
to be part of a consortium.

02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.000
And what was really
exciting to learn was

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.270
that the other consortium
members which were

02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:15.440
from across the United
States working in a lot

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.810
of different disciplines,
a lot of them history,

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:21.810
actually they themselves had
requested an arts-based partner

02:10:21.810 --> 02:10:24.820
because nobody in the consortium
was doing work in the arts.

02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.780
And they thought that
was really important.

02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:28.490
So you can -- I just -- this is

02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:29.960
when we start [inaudible]
a little bit talking

02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.470
about what we heard before
and so when Christopher said,

02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:35.540
you know, to think
about the future,

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.790
a lot of cultures
think about the past.

02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:41.240
We actually adapted as our
logo, "Look back, see further"

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.130
for our work with teaching
with primary sources

02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:45.860
because we really -- that
was sort of what emerged

02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.160
when we're trying to think

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:49.930
about how do we encapsulate
this work that we're doing?

02:10:49.930 --> 02:10:55.810
And so, really we set about
creating a comprehensive program

02:10:55.810 --> 02:10:59.320
where we can help educators, K
through 12 and service teachers

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:01.740
and librarians, really figure

02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.830
out how they can bring the
arts into their teaching.

02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:07.290
And for us, it was a little
bit of a journey as well.

02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:09.220
So where we stand right
now, what we've developed

02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:11.300
and we give you an overview and
I'm going to sort of break it

02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:14.210
down a little bit, is
that we offer courses.

02:11:14.210 --> 02:11:16.380
They're available for
free for non-credit.

02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:18.310
We also offer three
graduate credits.

02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:21.340
And our matriculated students
can also take these programs.

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:23.320
And we have two different types
of courses which I'll break

02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:25.810
down a little bit later
which is an overview course

02:11:25.810 --> 02:11:28.360
and discipline-specific courses.

02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:31.120
We also create some
curriculum guides that come

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.940
out of our professional
development.

02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.580
We test them and we develop

02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:36.880
through our professional
development.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.160
And we're going to have some
examples of those on tables

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.650
when you leave so if you want to
grab one, you're welcome to it.

02:11:42.650 --> 02:11:44.960
We also try to provide
everything as much

02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:48.530
as what we do online for
free to a national audience.

02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:51.310
And so we have two vehicles
for our web presence

02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:52.690
which I'll talk about later.

02:11:52.690 --> 02:11:54.720
And then we have a coaching
program which I want

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:56.020
to mention now because I'm going

02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:57.600
to mention the coaches
throughout the program.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.320
So one of the things
and it's really --

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.790
and thinking really
to be thoughtful

02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:05.600
about how these programs
live and build and grow,

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.000
the consortium and the
Library of Congress decided

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.270
that it was really important
to develop high level educators

02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:15.510
that are really embedded
in these materials

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:17.360
so that they could bring
them back to their schools

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.210
and their school districts
and the language we developed

02:12:19.210 --> 02:12:20.840
around them is coaches.

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:23.690
And so we have people
who take numerous courses

02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:26.680
that we then put them
through their own professional

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:29.750
development experience so that
they can then become leaders

02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:31.050
in the field.

02:12:31.050 --> 02:12:34.290
So here's where I'm going to
go back to the previous panel.

02:12:34.290 --> 02:12:35.980
So why the arts as
primary sources?

02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:39.620
So thank you, panel one, for so
beautifully illustrating that.

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:42.460
So I'm thinking -- I'm taking
notes during the first panel.

02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:45.870
So of course, Susan and
Dr. Chu really talked

02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:48.390
about how important the arts are

02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:50.990
and actually noted
some key studies.

02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:53.810
But also, you know, Mario
talked about the arts

02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:55.600
as a superpower like
I loved that.

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.010
Well, I'm going to use that.

02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:58.890
And that they have
their own language.

02:12:58.890 --> 02:13:02.400
And then, you know, Asha talked
about how as a young person,

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.100
the arts was how she
connected through school.

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.880
And we also, I mean,
thank you so much, Nathan,

02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:10.160
for those six themes
because I think

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.460
that those themes are actually
embedded in the work that we do.

02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.550
And it was the way that you
articulated them really maybe

02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:18.730
will help us focus a little
bit more in the future.

02:13:18.730 --> 02:13:20.030
And of course,

02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:23.750
those performances show us how
we can be transformed and moved

02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:25.050
through the arts and
we're all having our own

02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:26.890
personal experience.

02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:28.290
And so that's what
we're trying to do.

02:13:28.290 --> 02:13:31.750
We're trying to say to
teachers across disciplines

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:34.670
so it's important to note that
I think that maybe some people

02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:36.380
when we talk -- when I
talk about this program,

02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:38.830
people think, "Oh, only art
teachers take your courses."

02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:40.130
Well actually, no.

02:13:40.130 --> 02:13:42.280
We have lots of elementary
school teachers.

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:44.760
We get gym teachers
that take our program.

02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.060
We get librarians.

02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:47.670
We get discipline-specific
teachers.

02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:49.880
So I'd say about 40%
of our participants

02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:53.300
in our program are arts
teachers but I guess,

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:55.920
what's really important is that
they get to hear the perspective

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.790
of the other teachers
about how disconnected

02:13:58.790 --> 02:14:01.250
and siloed the arts can feel.

02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:02.550
And they get an opportunity

02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:05.820
to understand how they can
bring history or science or math

02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:07.360
into their classrooms.

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:10.530
And so, we and the other
thing that we've learned

02:14:10.530 --> 02:14:12.640
as we've grown in our program
is that in the beginning,

02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.750
we started to think
about primary sources

02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:17.590
in the arts as the products.

02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:19.480
But what we actually would --

02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:20.780
Ray just illustrated is

02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:23.180
that it's actually the
stuff behind the scenes

02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:25.840
that can teach us a lot
more about the arts.

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.590
So we can look at, you
know, choreographic notes

02:14:29.590 --> 02:14:31.970
that the Library has a
beautiful collection of

02:14:31.970 --> 02:14:36.640
or musical notation or notes
from a dramateur or sketchbooks

02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:37.960
or notes of an artist.

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:41.940
And so those are all the reasons
why we think it's important.

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:43.890
So the way that we
developed our program is

02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:45.700
that we have two
different types of courses

02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:47.000
and I've listed these here.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.300
I'm not going to
go through them.

02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:50.800
I'm hoping that the PowerPoint
will be made available later

02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:52.580
so that people can
go back to it.

02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:54.770
But we have these
overview courses

02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:57.130
and these discipline-specific
courses.

02:14:57.130 --> 02:14:59.030
And the overview
courses generally are

02:14:59.030 --> 02:15:00.330
about 40 to 45 [inaudible].

02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:03.240
It depends and they're very
field trip and lecture-based.

02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.600
We don't do that much hands on.

02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.900
We do a little bit.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.290
And then the discipline-specific
course is do more

02:15:08.290 --> 02:15:09.970
of a focused study
in the discipline.

02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:11.480
So I'm just going to just
talk a little bit first

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.280
about our overview of courses.

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.830
So in those courses
-- oh, by the way --

02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:17.930
all of our courses run five
days, Monday through Friday,

02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:21.510
about 8:30 in the morning
until about 6:00 at night.

02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.990
They're super packed
and energizing.

02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:26.380
We get teachers from
across the country,

02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:29.320
people from San Francisco,
people -- because they're free,

02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.020
sometimes teachers will
use it as an opportunity

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:32.320
to get to Philadelphia.

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:35.390
We can help them find, you
know, low-cost accommodations.

02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:38.160
But we spend the first day
really introducing primary

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.750
sources and copyright
and why is it important

02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:42.050
to teach the primary sources.

02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:43.490
And I think what
we were surprised

02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:45.560
to learn is how many people

02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:47.710
that take our classes
don't actually know

02:15:47.710 --> 02:15:50.720
about the digitized collections
of the Library of Congress

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:55.810
in any subject matter, let alone
the Library, let alone the arts.

02:15:55.810 --> 02:15:57.720
So that's really sort of
an opportunity for them

02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.460
to get comfortable
with their searches

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.990
and understands a little
bit about the framework.

02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:06.280
Then we also talk about
this wonderful tool which is

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:09.560
in the guides that we're handing
out and online in our website.

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:12.100
And we're -- it's
sort of this --

02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:15.660
a framework for observe,
question and reflect.

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:16.960
And it walks you through it.

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.340
And there's one specifically
for prints and photographs

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:21.890
but there's more general
ones and we use that.

02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:25.470
We use that as an examples
and we have some --

02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:28.970
always have great lecturers
come in that talk about the arts

02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:31.670
and primary sources and
make those connections.

02:16:31.670 --> 02:16:34.520
And you know, we're in
Philadelphia so there is no lack

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:37.090
of amazing collections.

02:16:37.090 --> 02:16:41.680
And we utilize as many
of them as possible.

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:44.780
Then we ask our teachers
to share out and they post

02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:47.670
so there's an opportunity for
them to do their own reflection.

02:16:47.670 --> 02:16:50.770
And then they create primary
source sets through one

02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:52.860
of the Library of Congress
tools which I'll talk

02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:56.030
about a little bit later
which they can utilize later.

02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:59.420
So very briefly, this was a
course we developed last summer.

02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:02.690
So how many of you
have heard of STEAM?

02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:05.210
Okay, yeah, I got the
right audience here.

02:17:05.210 --> 02:17:08.060
So I don't have to
tell you what it is.

02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:13.250
So we decided to say, "Well,
what kind of STEAM objects,

02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:17.440
collateral art products are
available to the Library

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:22.710
of Congress that can be tied
to all different disciplines?"

02:17:22.710 --> 02:17:24.340
And so we were so lucky.

02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:25.970
How many of you know
that the Library

02:17:25.970 --> 02:17:29.130
of Congress actually has
teachers in residence?

02:17:29.130 --> 02:17:30.430
See, they do.

02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:31.730
And they're great.

02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:33.830
And one of the past ones
is Trey Smith who was --

02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:35.800
he has a science focus.

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:37.780
And I met him while I was
here at the Library for one

02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:39.080
of my consortium meetings.

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.690
And I said, "Well, okay.

02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:41.990
We'll have to work with him."

02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:45.510
So he did a presentation
and it was wonderful.

02:17:45.510 --> 02:17:48.530
And he did some analysis
on and he really --

02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:49.960
even though he's a scientist,

02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.800
he was able to find
examples of STEAM objects.

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:55.490
And then we invited in --

02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:58.770
we talked about teaching
artists today and so we invited

02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:01.370
in two teaching artists
who came in.

02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:02.670
One was Ben [Inaudible].

02:18:02.670 --> 02:18:04.660
You could see his
image on your left.

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:06.500
I think that's right.

02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:11.980
Yup. He's a muralist but he
works with science and STEAM

02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:14.910
as motivation for
students kindergarten

02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:17.010
through 12th grade
to think about ideas.

02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:18.800
He's had exhibitions
in Washington, DC.

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.190
He's worked with NASA.

02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:23.730
And he came in and talked about
his practice and his work.

02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:28.170
And then we also had another
teaching artist named Aster

02:18:28.170 --> 02:18:30.140
[Inaudible] who not only
talked about her work

02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:33.310
but she actually did a
project with teachers.

02:18:33.310 --> 02:18:35.290
And then we also
brought in an artist

02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:37.040
who brought us to her studio.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.480
So this artist, Diane
Burko, was fascinating.

02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:41.370
For 35 years, she's
been flying all

02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:43.960
over the world photographing
climate change.

02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:45.610
She was really ahead
of her time.

02:18:45.610 --> 02:18:47.360
And she's taken those
photographs and turned them

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.400
into prints and paintings
and she lectures.

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:52.840
She's been invited to the White
House to talk about her work.

02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:58.150
And so we had all these artists
in as we also visited lots

02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:59.770
of primary source locations

02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:03.340
as we keep visiting the
Library's collection online.

02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:08.360
And so that's an example of
one of our overview courses.

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:09.660
I won't talk about this one

02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:10.960
because it's not
very [inaudible].

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:12.440
It's just a little
plug, if anyone wants

02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.190
to join us this year,

02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:18.290
we're developing another new
overview course called City

02:19:18.290 --> 02:19:20.360
as the Primary Source and we're
looking at urban planning,

02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.780
architecture and cartography.

02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:27.550
And we're reaching out to
people across those disciplines

02:19:27.550 --> 02:19:29.630
to develop that curriculum.

02:19:29.630 --> 02:19:32.870
In our discipline-specific
courses, we do a deep dive in.

02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:34.250
So again, it's five days.

02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:37.120
And what that looks like is that
first day is that, you know,

02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:38.420
what's a primary source?

02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:39.720
How do we use it?

02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:41.020
What's online?

02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:42.320
What's in the collection?

02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:43.620
What's really different
about this class is

02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:47.830
that the participants will
actually study one particular

02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:51.080
discipline and they will
actually create studio projects

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.380
in that discipline.

02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:54.230
So it's important to
note, they're not artists.

02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:56.550
And so they're drawing
or painting

02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:58.600
or screen printing
for the first time.

02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:00.670
And so the idea is that
they're doing projects

02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:02.130
that they could model
with their students

02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:04.950
who may not have comfort
in those disciplines.

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:07.610
And then on day five, they
actually develop a lesson plan.

02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:08.910
They share it out.

02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:10.210
And we have an exhibition.

02:20:10.210 --> 02:20:14.380
So two courses that you can
grab these educator guides.

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:15.830
They both have guides.

02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:19.240
One was photography and identity
so identity was mentioned today

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.370
as an important factor
for art making.

02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:25.660
And we have, we used
the first library,

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:27.830
one of the first libraries in
America, the Library Company

02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:32.470
as a place to look at
real early photographs.

02:20:32.470 --> 02:20:33.810
And then they actually create --

02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:36.340
so that middle image
are a portrait.

02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:38.310
They're daguerreotype images

02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:41.690
that they make themselves
in their class.

02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:45.490
And then on the left side
is the Library of Congress

02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:48.280
and the Library Company image.

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:49.580
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay, Erin.

02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:50.880
You've got about a minute.

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.180
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: Yeah, okay.

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:53.830
So just -- I'm just going
to go quickly and say

02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:57.100
that we also create
these guides.

02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.600
And I really -- I didn't --
I brought 50 of each of them

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.200
so maybe if you want
to grab one,

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:03.080
they're available free online.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:06.510
So you could download them
or you could contact us.

02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:10.860
But these are materials that
you could see an example of it.

02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:13.760
They go through the exercise
of analyzing primary sources.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:16.240
And we have our web presence.

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:19.860
So I think just to conclude,
what I wanted to say was

02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:21.710
that this is an important
moment and preaching

02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:23.890
to the choir is important
for two reasons.

02:21:23.890 --> 02:21:27.740
One is that it lets us be agents
of sharing with our colleagues

02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:31.210
and our co-workers that may not
have access to some language

02:21:31.210 --> 02:21:34.090
and vocabulary around
what we all do.

02:21:34.090 --> 02:21:36.680
But it also gives
us some resources

02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:39.090
to do what we do a
little bit differently.

02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:43.510
So thank you all and I was
very proud to be here today.

02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:51.090
[ Applause ]

02:21:51.090 --> 02:21:52.390
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: So I
mentioned the Art Teaching

02:21:52.390 --> 02:21:53.920
with Primary Sources Consortium.

02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:56.210
And our next speaker
comes from another one

02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:58.840
of our consortium
member organizations

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.580
and that is the National
Association --

02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:05.970
or excuse me, I've got
the NAFNE in my head.

02:22:05.970 --> 02:22:08.250
You know how acronyms
do that to you?

02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:13.950
Yeah. So anyway, Johanna Siebert
is here today to talk with us

02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:16.810
about a really special project
involving the new national

02:22:16.810 --> 02:22:21.440
standards for music that were
recently developed by NAfME.

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:22.870
&gt;&gt; Johanna Siebert:
Thank you, sure.

02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:24.670
Excuse me, the National
Association

02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:27.280
for Music Education [laughter].

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.790
We're encouraged
to say N-A-F-M-E.

02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:32.430
Because you know, you just think
NAfME could certainly be used

02:22:32.430 --> 02:22:34.650
in a lot of ways, couldn't it?

02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:36.200
So I will slip back and forth

02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:38.110
between the two, I
think, as I talk.

02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:39.410
You know, so but thank you.

02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:40.710
Thank you very much.

02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:42.010
Thank you for having
us here today.

02:22:42.010 --> 02:22:44.510
I'm the project director
for this project

02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:46.300
that you're going
to hear about today.

02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.030
And let's get used
to this a moment.

02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:49.330
Here we go.

02:22:49.330 --> 02:22:52.680
And so, in our collaboration
with the Library of Congress,

02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.540
good friend, colleague
and director at NAfME,

02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:57.270
Lynn Tuttle, wrote a proposal.

02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:59.080
And you can see on the screens,

02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:02.010
pretty much about what
it is we wanted to do

02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:03.980
through the largesse
of the grants available

02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:05.780
to us through the TPS here.

02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:08.770
And so looking at this
three-year program we just

02:23:08.770 --> 02:23:12.840
completed in this past
summer, units of study,

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.140
curricular units,

02:23:14.140 --> 02:23:16.440
not a curriculum itself
[inaudible] course

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.820
in general music.

02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:20.720
Right now, I mean, as we
speak, I'm receiving emails

02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:23.250
with draft units for
a band and orchestra

02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:25.060
and [Inaudible] is writing them.

02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:26.680
And on the third year, we'll
be looking at composition

02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:29.200
and theory as well
as popular music

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:32.310
and how we can access
the multiple resources

02:23:32.310 --> 02:23:34.090
that we actually
just got done looking

02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:36.500
at as well as many, many more.

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:42.240
Behind the whole idea of these
new national standards is the

02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:46.240
idea of building student
artistic literacy.

02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:47.540
We've heard that
word this morning

02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:49.330
and many of you were nodding.

02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:52.720
Many of the things that have
been said already have just

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:55.150
really validated the standards

02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:58.350
and the collaboration we now
have here at the Library.

02:23:58.350 --> 02:24:02.700
This idea of music literacy
and for children is huge.

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:06.020
It's not just knowing about
music but it's about being

02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:08.830
in the music or on
any other art form.

02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:11.730
And so as we think about all
of these, we still know we have

02:24:11.730 --> 02:24:15.520
to keep bringing in all that
knowledge and skills in the past

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:17.880
because as we heard this
morning, there is a lot

02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:19.520
of skill base especially
in music

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.960
and let it be taught
sequentially.

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.570
So we can't lose that.

02:24:22.570 --> 02:24:24.150
And kind of, that's what a lot

02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:26.190
of our teachers are
very comfortable with.

02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:28.900
So as we've been
working on these,

02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:31.350
we've kind of been
learning as we go.

02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:35.840
As we see this shift to a
process-based literacy piece,

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:39.260
you're looking at the four major
processes that we talked about.

02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:42.190
We heard about creating and
how there are steps to this.

02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:44.890
And we heard about
composing and improvising

02:24:44.890 --> 02:24:46.550
and [inaudible] arranging.

02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:48.730
Whether we're talking
to pre-K level --

02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:50.820
sure, switch the order
of opening routines

02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:53.240
or if we're talking about
those college-bound seniors

02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:55.450
who are going to major in
music, what are all the things

02:24:55.450 --> 02:24:56.750
that they would be doing?

02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:58.380
We talked about performing
which to music,

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:01.170
it's what we're known for.

02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:02.660
It's what we do.

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.580
They're responding as our
focus area for this unit

02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:08.040
but we also heard this
morning about another process

02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.360
and how important personal
connections from students

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.190
through the arts to other arts
to other areas in our lives

02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:18.900
and to other disciplines
are supremely important.

02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:22.140
So to show you all of the things
that we need to think about,

02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:24.020
we have five separate
sets of standards

02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:25.690
within this new arts standards.

02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:28.410
And so we talk about
general music from pre-K

02:25:28.410 --> 02:25:34.120
up through Grade Eight, grade
by grade with successive ideals

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.300
of what we believe literacy
would look like in those grades.

02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.580
Traditional and emerging
ensembles, those big chorus,

02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:42.580
those bands, orchestras
and [inaudible] --

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:46.990
all of the different kinds of
ensembles you can think of.

02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:49.250
We talk about comp and theory
or composition and theory,

02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:51.230
the writing and analyzing
of music.

02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:52.680
Harmonizing instruments --

02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:57.810
that's making the bridge between
student's music of their lives

02:25:57.810 --> 02:26:02.040
and student music that they're
playing in school, you know,

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.370
via guitars, ukuleles,
keyboards,

02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:05.670
other harmonizing pieces.

02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:08.660
And of course, bringing
in music technology.

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:15.010
As these were rolled out in
2014 and continued to be now,

02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:18.050
we found that teachers
really needed

02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:20.030
to have some extra resources.

02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:23.390
So during that period and even
as I say, up to this date,

02:26:23.390 --> 02:26:28.350
we are focusing at NAfME
on how we can help that.

02:26:28.350 --> 02:26:29.650
In order to understand
a little bit,

02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:32.280
I'm walking you very
briefly through our standards

02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:34.110
because it would just
take another three days.

02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:36.700
But you can see laid
out here, the processes

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:40.170
that we are talking about
creating is just that.

02:26:40.170 --> 02:26:42.710
And starting at their pre-K
level, would be a kind

02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:44.270
of writing or talking
that I heard

02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:46.510
about this morning is
exactly what we need.

02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:49.650
And having students be able
to go through those four steps

02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:52.610
in an order is often
how we make sure

02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:54.530
that they are writing,
they're refining.

02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:57.240
When students perform,
they do just that.

02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:58.540
We hope they're analyzing

02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:01.070
and interpreting the music
they choose to perform.

02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:03.750
Okay, they rehearse and
evaluate it themselves

02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:06.110
and refine what they do
so that they are ready

02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:08.970
for the last day to
present it, okay.

02:27:08.970 --> 02:27:11.260
Of course, with the facilitation
of a teacher and then guided

02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:13.570
by the teacher but eventually
taking this process on.

02:27:13.570 --> 02:27:17.220
And the responding is a little
bit different even though the

02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:19.150
little [inaudible]
looked the same.

02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:22.380
These components talk a lot
about how students respond

02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:26.830
to the selection, analysis,
interpretation and evaluation

02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:28.860
of other people's music --

02:27:28.860 --> 02:27:31.610
whether it's music that they're
listening to in a performance

02:27:31.610 --> 02:27:35.060
or another composer's music, not
necessarily what they're going

02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:38.280
to create themselves
as performers.

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:40.680
What you see across
the bottom is the walk

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:42.350
that talks about connecting.

02:27:42.350 --> 02:27:45.410
We talk about how we relate to
things and how we interrelate

02:27:45.410 --> 02:27:47.800
to things through
music for students.

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:50.360
So you've seen really the
whole gamut of what we have

02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.740
and how using these,
we hope are going

02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:54.330
to help us develop students

02:27:54.330 --> 02:27:57.690
into that music literate
performer and thinker.

02:27:57.690 --> 02:28:01.830
Well, as we focus on responding,

02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:04.040
the idea is that if we
help students understand

02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.980
and evaluate how the
arts convey meaning.

02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:10.180
And we can see here the
definitions of what it looks

02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:13.330
like in those [inaudible]
not necessarily successive

02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:15.490
or linear components.

02:28:15.490 --> 02:28:18.720
But the ideal again is
how do we get to this?

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.450
What are the things that
we're using for this?

02:28:22.450 --> 02:28:25.770
The problem that we've
had is that in ensembles,

02:28:25.770 --> 02:28:28.810
in harmonizing music
in some classrooms,

02:28:28.810 --> 02:28:31.670
they don't lend themselves
to the study of responding.

02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:34.790
And we need to find ways to make
that happen for our teachers.

02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:38.360
[Inaudible] say heavily
based on skills, instruction,

02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:41.050
development, maintenance
and all of those things.

02:28:41.050 --> 02:28:43.940
And so where does the talk time
come to and respond to music?

02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:48.020
If the goal of a class
is to perform something,

02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.320
where are they basing that on?

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.010
So how do we help teachers find
this time to realize by focusing

02:28:53.010 --> 02:28:56.100
on responding, we can help
them all be better performers?

02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:59.340
And as we think about
assessment in any field,

02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:02.950
[inaudible] course this
morning, I think of 120 students

02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:05.900
in a course I used to observe as
a music supervisor and I think,

02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:08.760
okay, how are you knowing
what each one knows?

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:11.940
So how can we get to that after
some of the responding too?

02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:16.500
These are typical
problems that we've had.

02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:21.540
Again, through working with the
resources here from the Library

02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:23.700
of Congress, we're
working to be able

02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:26.310
to take the responding
components that we've looked at

02:29:26.310 --> 02:29:29.510
and now, after students have
responded and had the chance

02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:32.900
and the opportunity to
listen deeply and to think

02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:36.000
about how music came to
be written and performed,

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.130
now apply that in your
performing strand, if you will,

02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:41.880
so that students
are relying on --

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.680
I like to call reference points.

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:45.800
You know, as I go to
interpret a piece of music, oh,

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:47.720
this is how so-and-so
interpreted that.

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:49.630
And now I have these in my head.

02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:53.180
It is their toolbox
that I can draw upon.

02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:56.190
So by using the mission
statement of the Library

02:29:56.190 --> 02:29:59.110
of Congress, we find that these
two fit very well together.

02:29:59.110 --> 02:30:03.140
By addressing the learning
and knowledge and history

02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:05.980
and the relevance of all
of what we've been talking

02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:08.270
about this morning and
seeing in the room next door

02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:11.300
and throughout the building,
we target at how students use

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:16.750
that creatively and how they
use it also in performing,

02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:20.540
composition and analysis.

02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:24.020
The [inaudible] writing
teams has been in this way.

02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:26.450
We've looked at music
through [inaudible]

02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:29.320
through the past year so
we have units in those.

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.560
We have units at [inaudible]
in the five levels you see.

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:35.120
Those are gradually
progressing levels.

02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:38.260
We don't necessarily
focus on a grade level

02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:40.230
because those ensembles
don't meet that way.

02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:43.940
They often [inaudible] choirs
or as a ninth-grade band

02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:47.350
or as an ensemble that's all
built on audition students.

02:30:47.350 --> 02:30:49.860
And it can look very different
from one district in the country

02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:52.370
to another, from urban to rural

02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:53.930
to suburban settings,
[inaudible].

02:30:53.930 --> 02:30:57.570
Using the responding
standards, we've been able

02:30:57.570 --> 02:31:01.620
to guide instruction via the
inquiry models that are part

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:03.090
of our grant proposal and using

02:31:03.090 --> 02:31:04.820
that through the
Library of Congress.

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.990
We have our own essential
questions embedded

02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:08.880
within the national
standards as well as

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:11.710
and during understandings.

02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:14.360
So I'll talk to you and
make sure you keep me

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:15.660
on my time, okay?

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:16.960
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: I must
say, you're getting close.

02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:18.260
&gt;&gt; Johanna Siebert:
Getting close?

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:19.560
Real close, working on it here.

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:20.860
So this is one of the
grade two units, okay.

02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:23.500
It takes about our objectives
through I can statements

02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:24.800
because this is what students

02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:27.260
and schools are using
throughout the country.

02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:29.170
This is a dance unit
or a movement unit.

02:31:29.170 --> 02:31:31.900
So the essential questions, how
are music and movement alike?

02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:34.430
How -- why does music
make me move or dance?

02:31:34.430 --> 02:31:37.040
And you can see our performance
standards listed as well.

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.290
So this opening activity

02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:41.850
that a teacher would lead
would be reviewing some skills

02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:43.150
and how do we move?

02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:44.450
What are different ways to move?

02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:47.770
She would -- excuse me,
extend it by asking them

02:31:47.770 --> 02:31:49.280
to add new movements
to the piece --

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:51.120
a sense of think
about how they walk.

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:54.530
And again, in vocabulary ready
for students at that age.

02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:57.630
The opening activity and
Jan's going to help me

02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:59.140
in the back, right, Jan?

02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:00.440
I like it.

02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:02.510
By clicking on one of
the jukebox recordings

02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:04.020
that she used as
an introduction.

02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:06.320
So thanks, Jan, go ahead.

02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:26.080
[ Music ]

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:27.380
Good, thank you, Jan.

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:29.080
So we'll keep it short
so you can hear that.

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.550
But you can imagine second
graders reacting to that.

02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:33.800
Sometimes, we should be the
one reacting to that [laughter]

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:36.120
at the same time what
that would be like.

02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.060
And you could see
also and I'm going

02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:39.360
to [inaudible] to click ahead.

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.600
I'm looking -- they lead back
to -- thank you very much.

02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:45.810
Okay, the questions that she's
asking through various types

02:32:45.810 --> 02:32:49.090
of prompting and inquiry,
kind of those things.

02:32:49.090 --> 02:32:51.280
And she was using a
visual thinking model.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:55.240
In chorus, it looks a little
bit different because in chorus,

02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:57.430
we talk a lot about
what could this be like?

02:32:57.430 --> 02:33:00.160
So this intermediate level
now, for the most part,

02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.330
it's usually middle
school students.

02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:04.200
It depends on when they
start chorus in the district

02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:05.720
like yours or somewhere else.

02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:09.400
And so all of the units there
focus on multiple things

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:12.790
so at this level, we focus on
folk music and we just saw a lot

02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:14.410
of materials next
door about that.

02:33:14.410 --> 02:33:18.650
At the high school level,
they all focused on spirituals

02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:21.320
so that we know students will
be singing spiritual sometimes

02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.890
throughout their
high school career.

02:33:22.890 --> 02:33:25.690
They use the Socratic
[Inaudible] Model.

02:33:25.690 --> 02:33:27.850
Okay and then it
includes outside work.

02:33:27.850 --> 02:33:29.440
I'm not going to
click on the link now

02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:31.070
because I think what I'm
going to make sure is

02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:33.360
that you have access
to this PowerPoint

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:34.660
and that would be
embedded for you.

02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:37.650
So I think what we're
showing you is

02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:39.280
that through what we talk about,

02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.190
these processes become
interdependent much

02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:46.260
as literacy is dependent upon
many other things as well.

02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:49.810
So as we look at the
processes you see here, okay,

02:33:49.810 --> 02:33:52.190
we know to truly
build understanding

02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:55.130
that we want students to be able
to transfer what they've learned

02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:59.310
to new situations and new
learnings and experiences

02:33:59.310 --> 02:34:01.760
so that their learning
continues to grow.

02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:05.300
It shows us more and more the
rigor of what we can accomplish

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:08.030
by going through stages like
this and connecting some

02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:10.730
of those responding artifacts,

02:34:10.730 --> 02:34:13.970
lessons that in turn
will help students focus

02:34:13.970 --> 02:34:15.270
on their own performance

02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:17.400
and make all their
ensemble work even stronger.

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:22.510
We piloted the units and you
can see on the screen that one

02:34:22.510 --> 02:34:24.140
of these we were worried
about was that time

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:27.170
that this would take in
choruses and live ensembles.

02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:28.600
And the person's
testament here talked

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.640
about how she could fit these
right into her daily routine.

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.610
And the unit showed that.

02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:35.700
It showed how music [inaudible]
that the students loved it.

02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.930
And one of the comments they
made, you will understand

02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:41.250
because you just heard
the run-run-run example.

02:34:41.250 --> 02:34:42.550
They often talked about like

02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:45.370
in that old school music sound
thinking that's how we all

02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:47.720
learned music were through
scratchy recordings.

02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:49.610
Everything so a little discovery

02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:53.080
that gets taught too
at the same time.

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.770
These units we've made
available to everybody.

02:34:55.770 --> 02:34:57.720
Much as my [inaudible]
it's just talking

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.860
about having people
enroll in those courses.

02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:05.060
We recently presented our
grade eight general music unit

02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:07.990
at the National Social
Studies Conference.

02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:10.030
I've asked a colleague
who was presenting with me

02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:12.120
and we were meeting
in a poster session

02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.800
and she's got a little
notebook out and she was saying,

02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:15.100
"What else would you like?"

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:16.400
I don't know, well.

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:17.700
She started to take down
requests for different periods

02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:21.060
of time that a Social Studies
teacher wanted units on so

02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:22.560
that they could connect
it to music

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:24.430
because they knew that's how
students would learn and listen.

02:35:24.430 --> 02:35:26.490
And they were doing it already.

02:35:26.490 --> 02:35:27.960
So I guess we have a
few more things to think

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:31.520
about [laughter] this next third
year as we start writing these.

02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:35.270
The units are available at that
website or just go to nafme.org

02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:37.210
and watch the headers
that go by and click on it

02:35:37.210 --> 02:35:39.840
and you'll see the
curricular units

02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.720
that you can link on and use.

02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.070
Anybody can use these.

02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:45.500
You don't need to be
member nor a music teacher.

02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:48.350
So I hope you do, okay.

02:35:48.350 --> 02:35:50.180
I guess we'll wait for
questions for a little while.

02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:51.480
So I hope to hear from you.

02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:53.280
Thank you very much.

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:59.050
[ Applause ]

02:35:59.050 --> 02:36:00.350
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Excuse me.

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:01.810
Thank you, Johanna.

02:36:01.810 --> 02:36:04.250
Both of those projects,
at U Arts

02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:07.540
and with the National
Association for Music Education,

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:10.290
you guys are doing such
important work and reaching

02:36:10.290 --> 02:36:14.230
so many teachers, emphasizing
that the Library's collections,

02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:17.350
as you all know, come in
a wide variety of media.

02:36:17.350 --> 02:36:20.210
I'm really glad you played that
part from the National Jukebox.

02:36:20.210 --> 02:36:21.510
I'm just curious.

02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:22.810
How many of you know
about the National Jukebox

02:36:22.810 --> 02:36:25.720
on the Library's website that
includes historic recordings?

02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.510
But now you do, see?

02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:30.870
You know, there's
like 38 million things

02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:32.170
on the Library's website.

02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:33.470
&gt;&gt; Johanna Siebert: I
only listen [inaudible].

02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:35.200
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: I am
telling you, the sheet music,

02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:38.610
the sound recordings, really
-- I hope that after this,

02:36:38.610 --> 02:36:41.750
you all spend some time doing
some exploring and realize

02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:43.830
that -- and this is a
really important part,

02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:45.630
that because this is
the Library of Congress,

02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:47.960
this is our National Library.

02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:51.440
All of these resources
are ours collectively.

02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:53.750
We should be making
good use of them.

02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:57.940
Okay, so with that, not only
can the Library's collections be

02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:01.380
tremendous teaching tools but
the Library itself can too.

02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:04.420
How many of you have never
spent time in the Library

02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:05.770
at Jefferson Building?

02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:07.070
&gt;&gt; I've gone [inaudible].

02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:09.340
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay
but some of you, all right.

02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:12.360
So as you know, this
building that we're

02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:15.260
in today is not the most
beautiful of the Library

02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.560
of Congress buildings.

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.860
The building next door,

02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:20.640
the Thomas Jefferson Building
is really quite extraordinary.

02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:23.820
And our next panelist
is Kathy Tuchman.

02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:28.650
Kathy works with our
Visitor Services Office here

02:37:28.650 --> 02:37:33.480
at the Library and has developed
a really extraordinary tour

02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:35.300
that's a touch history tour.

02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:36.650
And some of you had
a chance to visit

02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:39.510
with our little [inaudible]
in the next room to share

02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:41.350
with you the discovery card.

02:37:41.350 --> 02:37:42.810
And that's all I'm going to say.

02:37:42.810 --> 02:37:44.800
Kathy, it's your turn.

02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:46.100
&gt;&gt; Katharine Tuchman:
Well, thank you.

02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:49.120
Oh, I'm just going to move my
stuff over here real quickly.

02:37:50.130 --> 02:37:51.430
So my name is Kathy Tuchman.

02:37:51.430 --> 02:37:55.740
I'm with Visitor Services Office
of the Library of Congress.

02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:57.480
In this past year-and-a-half,

02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.550
I've had this fantastic
opportunity to work

02:37:59.550 --> 02:38:03.950
on two projects and a lot of you
may have been able to see some

02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:05.590
of the projects I
was working on.

02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:08.890
The first one is the
Explore the Building Cart

02:38:08.890 --> 02:38:11.230
which we had earlier.

02:38:11.230 --> 02:38:16.170
The Visitor Services
received this fantastic box

02:38:16.170 --> 02:38:17.890
of original materials
that we used

02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:20.190
in our construction
of the building.

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:23.510
My colleague, Megan White and
I worked on this cart together.

02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:25.170
We went from researching
everything

02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:30.800
from how bricks were made to how
the pouring methods of granite

02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:33.660
and marble so that --
that way we could interact

02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:36.290
and have all the answers or
try to have some of the answers

02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:38.520
at least for our visitors.

02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:41.030
What is the Cart Program,
you might want to know.

02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:44.340
The Cart Program is a way for
visitors to come to the building

02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:46.760
and interact with us in
a totally different way

02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.700
where they can get hands
on, feel the original pieces

02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:53.220
of the building and
they can ask questions.

02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:54.520
A lot of times, people come up

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:57.570
and tell me they were a
third-generation carver.

02:38:57.570 --> 02:38:59.700
They wanted to share
their experiences as well.

02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:02.730
So it's a really
fantastic experience.

02:39:02.730 --> 02:39:05.540
Docents are trained
on the cart material.

02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:07.530
They have gone through
a training program.

02:39:07.530 --> 02:39:11.650
They have a wonderful manual and
so we're there to support them.

02:39:11.650 --> 02:39:13.560
The other project that
I was lucky to work

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:16.210
on this past year was
their Touch History Program

02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:20.460
which is our tour for the
blind and visually impaired.

02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:24.320
We at the Visitors Services
have fantastic tours.

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:28.960
We offer constituent public
reserved tours throughout

02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:30.260
the day.

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:33.830
Our docents go through
a 10-hours-a-week,

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:37.520
15-week training program
for a total of 150 hours.

02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.000
And with that is just
to share with you

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.050
that this is a well-developed,
well-researched tour.

02:39:43.050 --> 02:39:46.100
It's not just drawn
together quickly.

02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:49.350
The docents that are chosen

02:39:49.350 --> 02:39:53.030
to do Touch History have been
docents for at least one year.

02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:56.060
They are not completely
new to the program.

02:39:56.060 --> 02:40:00.040
The Touch History, we enhanced
verbally our normal tour.

02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:02.300
So we give great history.

02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:07.230
That's similar but then we go
into more descriptive ability

02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:09.240
with the building, give
people an opportunity.

02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:12.510
We also reached out to the
architect of the Capitol

02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:15.010
and let them know that we
were working on this project.

02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:17.070
And they were incredibly
generous with us.

02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:18.470
We have the best.

02:40:18.470 --> 02:40:19.920
And so many of you saw.

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:21.850
I have an original brick here.

02:40:21.850 --> 02:40:23.200
A lot of people don't know

02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.620
that the Jefferson Building
really is a brick building --

02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:29.030
22 million bricks went to the
construction of this building.

02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:31.290
But you don't really see them
so people don't realize that.

02:40:31.290 --> 02:40:32.590
So I have a brick.

02:40:32.590 --> 02:40:33.890
You can feel it.

02:40:33.890 --> 02:40:35.190
It's quite heavy.

02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:38.640
The -- and also a piece of the
granite because the exterior

02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:41.120
of the building, we have
like a cross-section.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.130
So you have -- the
granite is on the exterior.

02:40:43.130 --> 02:40:45.810
We have the marble -- the
brick plaster and then,

02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:47.110
of course, the marble.

02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:48.410
If you've been in the building,

02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:49.830
you've seen that
we are a marble.

02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:53.570
That is just like the icing,
like the -- on the cake there.

02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:55.210
It's marble cladding.

02:40:55.210 --> 02:40:56.720
And this allows visitors

02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:58.020
when we're doing a
Touch History Tour,

02:40:58.020 --> 02:41:00.070
I can hand these
to our visitors.

02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:01.370
They can feel them.

02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:03.590
They can interact with
them, feel the coolness,

02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:05.760
the smoothness of the surface.

02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.350
Depending on their visual
ability, they can maybe want

02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:12.310
to reach up and look
at it closely.

02:41:12.310 --> 02:41:14.900
The tour allows that
for our visitors.

02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:20.420
The -- I want to back up a
little bit also because I want

02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:23.900
to talk a little bit
about the ceiling.

02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:25.530
The architecture of this
[inaudible] was fantastic.

02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:27.800
I have some original
pieces of the marble mosaics

02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:31.000
which I didn't bring over with
me on -- but the architect did.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.830
If you've been in our
building, you'd see three

02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:35.070
of our alcoves are
mosaic ceilings.

02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:38.960
And the architect put
them on a wooden base

02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:41.660
so that we can hand
these out when people --

02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:43.530
let our visitors feel this.

02:41:43.530 --> 02:41:48.110
Get a real sense of what this
-- the incredible artistic --

02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:50.750
artistry that was involved
in doing these ceilings.

02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:54.590
So that's just a little bit
about the why and how we did it.

02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:57.250
We also besides working
-- I researched.

02:41:57.250 --> 02:41:58.710
I went to a lot of museums

02:41:58.710 --> 02:42:00.230
to see what they were
doing throughout the --

02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:04.240
you know, in New York
and here in Washington.

02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.410
We researched online to see what
best practices are the museum

02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:09.850
world are doing in
tactile tours.

02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:14.550
Luckily, we have a fantastic
PEO DP division here,

02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:18.600
our equal opportunity disability
programs and we worked

02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:22.060
with Lorena Bradford from
the National Gallery of Art

02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:25.740
and had a wonderful
review with her.

02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:27.040
So let me tell you about --

02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.320
I told you that we
do a descriptive.

02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:35.780
So let me -- if I can,
this is going to be fun.

02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:37.480
Let me give you a
little bit of a tour

02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:38.780
of going into the building.

02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:42.360
If you've never been in our
building, this will be exciting.

02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.980
So the Jefferson -- the Library
of Congress was created --

02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:48.290
let's back up, 1800, correct?

02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:51.600
And our first 97 years
were spent in the Capitol.

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:55.520
That's where we are -- we began.

02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:58.460
Then we are -- the
Librarian at that time wanted

02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:01.380
to see us expanding our services
and wanted a larger building.

02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:04.760
So they -- Congress
appropriated the funds

02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.400
to build the Jefferson Building.

02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:07.930
So let's talk about
the Jefferson Building.

02:43:07.930 --> 02:43:09.440
You walk up the grand staircase.

02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.320
You come into the building,
into the first alcove

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.090
which is the Alcove of Minerva.

02:43:14.090 --> 02:43:15.980
Minerva -- there
are four alcoves

02:43:15.980 --> 02:43:17.390
that surround the great hall.

02:43:17.390 --> 02:43:18.910
The first one is Minerva.

02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:20.210
You walk in there.

02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:22.000
There are the eight
pairs of Minerva,

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.630
goddess of wisdom
and defense of war.

02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:27.240
From there, we walk
through the arch --

02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:29.500
one of the three arches
into the Great Hall.

02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:32.370
The building is fantastic
in its symmetry.

02:43:32.370 --> 02:43:35.130
What's done on one side is
equally done on the opposite.

02:43:35.130 --> 02:43:37.640
If it's on the left, it
will be equal on the right.

02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:39.400
I love this building.

02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.220
So we're now standing
in the Great Hall.

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:42.520
Let's align ourselves.

02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:43.820
We're in Great Hall.

02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:45.120
We hear lots of sounds.

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:46.420
It's really noisy.

02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:48.820
The Great Hall is called that
because it's pretty large.

02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:52.710
It's 50 feet across and it's
about 43 feet from front

02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:55.080
to the next set of arches.

02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.590
It's 75 feet to the ceiling.

02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:58.890
So it's quite large.

02:43:58.890 --> 02:44:01.780
From where we're standing,
if we were to look up,

02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:03.690
we can see up to
the mezzanine level.

02:44:03.690 --> 02:44:07.160
And there is a marble
banister that runs all around.

02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:10.100
So this, the mezzanine
level is available

02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:11.400
to us, the sound of it.

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.710
So it's quite loud.

02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:14.820
Right and on the left-hand
side of the Great Hall,

02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:16.530
we have the Grand Staircases.

02:44:16.530 --> 02:44:17.830
These are fantastic.

02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:20.080
They're about nine feet wide.

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:22.380
There's -- they go up
to the second level.

02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:25.410
And of course, on the
sides of the staircase,

02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:26.720
they could have left them plain.

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:28.140
But why would we do that?

02:44:28.140 --> 02:44:29.990
This is 1897.

02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:31.850
Why did we want to do that?

02:44:31.850 --> 02:44:35.340
So we have these fantastic
sculptures going up the sides

02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:36.780
and they are called putti.

02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:39.930
A lot of people refer to
them as cherubs but putti.

02:44:39.930 --> 02:44:41.850
And they're like little babies.

02:44:41.850 --> 02:44:45.210
We have four and then it has
a landing and then four more.

02:44:45.210 --> 02:44:47.450
So we have eight on the
right, eight on the left.

02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:50.300
I'm going to talk
about four on my left

02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:51.880
if we're in the building.

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:54.070
&gt;&gt; Do you [inaudible]?

02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:55.370
No?

02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:56.670
&gt;&gt; Katharine Tuchman: No.

02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:57.970
That's [inaudible].

02:44:57.970 --> 02:45:01.300
Yeah, when you're going up the
side, the putti or in little --

02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:04.560
what I would call like a
window, like a little house.

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.560
There are four of them,
and they're aligned

02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:07.860
up next to each other.

02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:11.220
The first one is sitting there
on his knees facing us directly.

02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:13.990
In his right hand he
has a rake and a hoe,

02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:16.030
in his left hand he
has a watering can.

02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:18.430
And we can actually see
the water coming out of it.

02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:19.730
So he would be our what?

02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:22.240
So our gardener, correct?

02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:27.460
Next going up to would be
our -- he has an angle to us,

02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:28.760
this next little [inaudible].

02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:31.180
He would be facing the left.

02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:33.340
His left hand is
reaching out of his house,

02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:34.640
trying to get to the gardener.

02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.300
And in his right hand, behind
him, is a butterfly net.

02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:40.600
And he, of course,
is our entomologist.

02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:42.880
So we're showing
with the [inaudible]

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:45.010
that different occupations,

02:45:45.010 --> 02:45:47.990
different hobbies are
all represented here.

02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:50.540
And this is a fantastic thing,
especially with kids, to come

02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:52.880
and they can interact and
try to show them which --

02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:54.800
you know, what do you think
this [inaudible] does?

02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:59.040
Look at the -- look
at the clues.

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.340
But with the touch history,

02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:03.180
I like to give a little
bit more description.

02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:06.040
The last two, one would be,
of course, sitting there --

02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:08.390
the last [inaudible] would be
sitting there with his book

02:46:08.390 --> 02:46:11.370
on his lap, his head is
down, and he's studying.

02:46:11.370 --> 02:46:14.720
He's our scholar, because we, of
course, have to have a scholar.

02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:19.970
And last but not least on this
group would be our printer,

02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:22.900
because where would we be at the
library without the printing.

02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:26.350
So we have those on either
side of the building, going up,

02:46:26.350 --> 02:46:30.250
and it's a great opportunity to
be expansive in our description

02:46:30.250 --> 02:46:32.840
with our visitors who
have visual impairments,

02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:34.740
and also with kids when
they come into the building,

02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:36.350
we can bring the building
to life with them.

02:46:36.350 --> 02:46:40.840
Last thing I want to
mention about the Great Hall.

02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:43.760
Did I mention that you
can park about 10 cars

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:45.640
in the floor of our Great Hall?

02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:47.750
That's kind of a fun
thing to mention.

02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:49.720
Gives you a sense of the size.

02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:54.840
Across from us, I told you about
the staircases, but directly

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:56.950
across from arches
that we're standing at,

02:46:56.950 --> 02:46:58.900
we have three more arches.

02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:01.400
And I need to mention the
two -- the middle arch,

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:06.370
we have the scholars, the
young and the old scholar,

02:47:06.370 --> 02:47:07.930
those are important to mention.

02:47:07.930 --> 02:47:09.230
They stand six feet in height.

02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:12.580
The young scholar was
on our left hand side,

02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:15.250
he's actually leaning
into his left arm,

02:47:15.250 --> 02:47:17.760
he's got his left leg crossed
behind him, and he's looking off

02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:20.740
to his right and his
paper that he's holding.

02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:23.360
And, of course, he's learning.

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:26.780
And on the right hand
side is our older scholar.

02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:28.790
And we know he's older
because has a beard,

02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:31.940
his skin is a little bit looser.

02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:34.040
And he has a tablet.

02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:37.190
And of course when the building
was built they might have been

02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:39.820
implying that the young scholar
had the newer technology,

02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:42.790
the paper, and the older
scholar had the old technology,

02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:44.400
it's a little tablet.

02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:45.930
But as I like to say
to my tourists today,

02:47:45.930 --> 02:47:50.770
that the older scholar really
has the latest technology,

02:47:50.770 --> 02:47:52.070
correct?

02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:53.370
[Inaudible].

02:47:53.370 --> 02:47:55.130
But to finish a bit of our
tour -- oh, did I hit that?

02:47:55.130 --> 02:47:59.800
To [inaudible] our tour, I would
take us to our left hand side,

02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:02.820
out of the Great Hall, into
the Hall of the Education,

02:48:02.820 --> 02:48:04.120
into the hall of family.

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.500
And I like to mention this hall
because this one, you come in,

02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:10.500
it's about 70 feet
long, 20 feet wide,

02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:15.600
and it's about 26
feet tall, about.

02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.680
It's got an archway,
which is where some

02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:19.960
of these beautiful
mosaics come in.

02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:22.230
And our mosaics are
not only decorative,

02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:24.570
but they also have
information in them.

02:48:24.570 --> 02:48:27.990
In our ceiling, since this
is the hall of the family,

02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:29.820
we have great educators.

02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:32.530
And in 1897 the librarian,

02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:36.140
the very first name
is Howe, H-O-W-E.

02:48:36.140 --> 02:48:39.740
Has anybody ever heard of
Howe, Samuel Gridley Howe?

02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:41.230
Some of us have.

02:48:41.230 --> 02:48:43.650
Samuel Gridley Howe was
the first superintendant

02:48:43.650 --> 02:48:46.150
of the Perkins School
for the Blind,

02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:47.890
which is important to note.

02:48:47.890 --> 02:48:50.350
Next to his name is
Guiadette [assumed spelling],

02:48:50.350 --> 02:48:52.710
which was the first
superintendant

02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:54.010
for the School for the Deaf.

02:48:54.010 --> 02:48:56.710
So in 1897 both the blind

02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:58.890
and the deaf were
listed in our building.

02:48:58.890 --> 02:49:00.500
I think it's important.

02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:02.060
There's also -- I have

02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:05.390
to mention this alcove is the
listing of all the librarians

02:49:05.390 --> 02:49:08.310
of Congress that we have, which
I love to mention on our tour.

02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:11.930
And our visitors are allowed
to go up and feel this.

02:49:11.930 --> 02:49:13.770
We're -- when the
building opened

02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:17.160
in 1897 we had only one
woman's name in the building,

02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:20.920
it was 1897, and that was
Sapho [assumed spelling].

02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.640
As of last year we now
have a second name,

02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:28.970
Dr. Carla Hayden is
engraved in our building,

02:49:28.970 --> 02:49:30.740
so it's really fantastic.

02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:34.590
So I hope you enjoyed
my little brief tour,

02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:37.060
and the wonderful opportunities
that we have to engage

02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:38.730
with visitors in a
whole different way.

02:49:38.730 --> 02:49:41.950
And if you didn't get to see the
cart, it's -- we still have it.

02:49:41.950 --> 02:49:43.750
So thank you very much.

02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:51.060
[ Applause ]

02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:52.360
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Thank you, Kathy.

02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:55.130
So the Thomas Jefferson building
that Kathy has been telling you

02:49:55.130 --> 02:49:59.270
about welcomes about 1.5
million visitors a year.

02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:02.580
And a few thousand of those
visitors make their way

02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:06.060
into our Young Readers
Center, which is also a part

02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:07.360
of the Library of Congress.

02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:10.580
And every Friday
morning at 10:30,

02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:14.670
if you want to see something
pretty spectacular, you can come

02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:17.990
to infant and toddler story
time at the Library of Congress.

02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:20.200
And it's unlike any
other program

02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:21.500
that happens here
at the Library.

02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:23.340
And you might say it's
a little bit louder,

02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:27.070
and some might describe as
being a little more chaotic.

02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:31.340
But late this summer,
early this fall,

02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:34.810
I was over in our Young Readers
Center, and my colleague,

02:50:34.810 --> 02:50:37.800
Sasha Dowdy, and our
intern at the time,

02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:39.530
Erin Durham [assumed
spelling], who is a student

02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:42.590
at the University of
Maryland, they were practicing

02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:45.520
for the upcoming story time.

02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:48.350
And, you know, story time
always involves songs,

02:50:48.350 --> 02:50:50.270
and there's always a
little bit of movement.

02:50:50.270 --> 02:50:53.900
But this was the first story
time that we were experimenting

02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:58.190
with bringing some musical
instruments into story time.

02:50:58.190 --> 02:51:01.790
And it was really
quite something.

02:51:01.790 --> 02:51:04.400
When you're used to see
a little bit of chaos,

02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:07.370
and suddenly a violin
is involved,

02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:09.800
three year olds are mesmerized.

02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:12.100
And so I thought it
would be kind of fun

02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:14.560
to mesmerize you guys
for a little bit today,

02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:17.920
and so I invited Sasha,
and I invited Erin to come

02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:21.960
and share a little bit of
musical story time with you.

02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:35.030
&gt;&gt; Hello. Thank you, Lee Ann.

02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:36.330
All right.

02:51:36.330 --> 02:51:37.630
So this book that
we're presenting

02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:40.510
to you today is called <i>Mole
Music </i>by David McPhail.

02:51:40.510 --> 02:51:58.270
[ Music ]

02:51:58.270 --> 02:52:00.390
Mole lived all alone
underground.

02:52:00.390 --> 02:52:03.510
He spent his days
digging tunnels.

02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:06.040
[ Music ]

02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.350
At night he at his
supper in front

02:52:08.350 --> 02:52:11.510
of TV and then went to bed.

02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:14.140
[ Music ]

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:17.140
Mole liked his life, but
lately he had begun to feel

02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:19.510
that there was something
missing.

02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:24.180
[ Music ]

02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:27.050
One night on the television
a man played the violin.

02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:30.510
He made the most beautiful
music mole had ever heard.

02:52:30.510 --> 02:52:40.380
[ Music ]

02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:44.510
I want to make beautiful music,
too, Mole said to himself.

02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:49.090
[ Music ]

02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:53.510
So the next day he sent away
for a violin of his own.

02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:56.130
[ Music ]

02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:59.510
Every day Mole checked
his mailbox.

02:52:59.510 --> 02:53:02.040
[ Music ]

02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:04.270
No violin.

02:53:04.270 --> 02:53:06.520
[ Music ]

02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:10.510
Finally, after nearly
three weeks, it arrived.

02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:13.050
[ Music ]

02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:15.510
Mole was so excited!

02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:20.560
[ Music ]

02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:24.510
He picked up the violin and
drew the bow across the strings.

02:53:24.510 --> 02:53:28.140
[ Music ]

02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:29.660
But instead of beautiful music,

02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:32.410
all he made was a
horrible screeching sound.

02:53:32.410 --> 02:53:34.800
[ Music ]

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.580
Mole tried again.

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:39.060
[ Music ]

02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:44.060
The violin still screeched,
but not quite so horribly.

02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:46.430
Mole kept at it.

02:53:46.430 --> 02:53:49.050
After about a week he
could play one note.

02:53:49.050 --> 02:53:51.080
[ Music ]

02:53:51.080 --> 02:53:52.380
Then two.

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:54.060
[ Music ]

02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:58.510
And before a month went by,
he could play an entire scale.

02:53:58.510 --> 02:54:02.050
[ Music ]

02:54:02.050 --> 02:54:04.030
Mole continued to practice.

02:54:04.030 --> 02:54:06.040
[ Music ]

02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:09.510
He learned to put the notes
together in a simple song.

02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:14.500
[ Music ]

02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:16.510
Years went by.

02:54:16.510 --> 02:54:20.060
[ Music ]

02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:23.510
Mole got better and better.

02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:26.300
[ Music ]

02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:28.800
He was happier than
he had ever been.

02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:32.200
During the day as he dug tunnels
Mole hummed the music he would

02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:34.000
play at night.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:41.440
[ Music ]

02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:43.150
Now Mole played even better

02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:46.510
than the man he had
seen on TV so long ago.

02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:54.120
[ Music ]

02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:55.800
Sometimes he wondered
what it would be

02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.510
like to play his
music for people.

02:54:59.510 --> 02:55:05.220
[ Music ]

02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:08.510
He imagined himself playing
before a huge audience.

02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:15.040
[ Music ]

02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:18.510
He imagined that he played
for presidents and queens.

02:55:18.510 --> 02:55:23.400
[ Music ]

02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.170
He even imagined that
his music could reach

02:55:26.170 --> 02:55:30.510
into people's hearts, and melt
away their anger and sadness.

02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:34.270
[ Music ]

02:55:34.270 --> 02:55:38.510
Why maybe his music could
even change the world.

02:55:38.510 --> 02:55:44.510
[ Music ]

02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:46.510
Mole laughed at himself.

02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:50.040
[ Music ]

02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:51.620
How silly I am, he thought,

02:55:51.620 --> 02:55:54.050
imagining that my music
could do all that,

02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:56.510
when no one has ever
even heard it.

02:55:56.510 --> 02:56:04.040
[ Music ]

02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:06.510
Mole played one more song.

02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:20.510
[ Music ]

02:56:20.510 --> 02:56:23.820
Then he put down his
violin and went to sleep

02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:27.030
and dreamed beautiful
peaceful dreams.

02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:29.040
[ Music ]

02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:30.840
The end.

02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:34.510
[ Music ]

02:56:34.510 --> 02:56:47.350
[ Applause ]

02:56:47.350 --> 02:56:50.380
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: So we have
about three and a half minutes

02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:52.540
for questions [laughter].

02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:53.840
You guys are fabulous.

02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:55.150
That was just great.

02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:58.030
Don't you want to
come to story time?

02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:59.330
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:00.630
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay.

02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:03.090
It does look like we've
got a question over here.

02:57:03.090 --> 02:57:05.770
[Inaudible] got a mic for you.

02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:11.640
&gt;&gt; Hi. Hi everybody.

02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:12.940
Thank you so very much.

02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:15.820
This was a wonderful panel.

02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:19.140
Just a wonderful day, really.

02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:22.750
Question for you all, this is a
question that we've been talking

02:57:22.750 --> 02:57:26.110
about as a community very
recently, what does it mean

02:57:26.110 --> 02:57:30.320
to be a national organization
serving local audience?

02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:33.080
Maybe some of you
could illustrate a bit

02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:36.690
of how you're working
specifically with D.C.,

02:57:36.690 --> 02:57:38.950
family engagement,
empowerment, you know,

02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:42.240
today's conversation is about
equity, access and empowerment.

02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:45.610
How are you as [inaudible]
organizations empowering young

02:57:45.610 --> 02:57:48.400
students and their families
to take full advantage

02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:51.260
and incorporate the
amazing amenities

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:55.980
and offerings here,
nationally, to D.C.?

02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:57.280
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Great question.

02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:01.930
And actually, I'm very
happy that you asked it.

02:58:01.930 --> 02:58:05.490
So story time that happens here
at the Library is not something

02:58:05.490 --> 02:58:08.070
that we live stream,
it's not something

02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:10.760
that we make a big deal out of.

02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:12.960
And like I said, one of
the reasons why I wanted

02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:15.140
to invite Sasha and
Erin to do this

02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:18.600
for this particular event was
to really stretch the reach

02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:21.310
of that program, hoping that
maybe there's an opportunity

02:58:21.310 --> 02:58:23.590
for some mimicking to go on.

02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:25.190
I know certainly that programs

02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:26.790
like that are happening
all over the country.

02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:28.100
And what we want
to be doing more

02:58:28.100 --> 02:58:31.700
of here is showcasing
some of that.

02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:33.260
As you know, we're being
live streamed today.

02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:36.530
And the opportunity to extend
the reach of programs here

02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:38.700
at the Library by using
those technologies is one

02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:40.430
of the ways we're
trying to do that.

02:58:40.430 --> 02:58:43.330
But that balance between
figuring out, are you local --

02:58:43.330 --> 02:58:44.860
are you serving a
local audience,

02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:46.400
are you serving a
national audience?

02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:49.240
I'm not sure it's neither/or,
I think it's a both/and.

02:58:49.240 --> 02:58:52.140
I think there's an
opportunity to really recognize

02:58:52.140 --> 02:58:55.670
that those local audiences,
and those -- I mean, frankly,

02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:57.060
we have a [inaudible]
here at the Library

02:58:57.060 --> 02:58:58.440
in our Young Readers Center.

02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:00.660
And some of the opportunities
that we're able

02:59:00.660 --> 02:59:03.790
to make available to those young
people, we're trying to figure

02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:06.530
out very deliberately
how do we capture this

02:59:06.530 --> 02:59:10.290
and make this available to
a much broader audience.

02:59:10.290 --> 02:59:12.310
What we've done this year,
something sort of new

02:59:12.310 --> 02:59:14.870
with that group, is
asking colleagues

02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:17.690
from around the Library to come
to each one of their meetings

02:59:17.690 --> 02:59:20.040
and share with students some
of the resources that are

02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:22.660
in their collections, so that
the kids have a better sense

02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:24.360
of the enormity of the place.

02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:27.150
And we need to do that with
a much broader audience.

02:59:27.150 --> 02:59:28.530
I mean, it's both.

02:59:28.530 --> 02:59:31.150
It's both/and.

02:59:31.150 --> 02:59:33.230
&gt;&gt; Katharine Tuchman: I would
say in Visitor Services we reach

02:59:33.230 --> 02:59:35.940
out quite a bit with a
lot of our tours to invite

02:59:35.940 --> 02:59:37.310
in the different school groups.

02:59:37.310 --> 02:59:43.030
And when we do specific
tours in the exhibitions,

02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:45.610
like when we had the Magna
Carta was here, we had reached

02:59:45.610 --> 02:59:47.840
out quite a bit to a lot
of D.C. public schools

02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:49.560
and invited them in.

02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:53.070
And it was in docent
led tour where the --

02:59:53.070 --> 02:59:54.560
so we do do a lot of --

02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:56.340
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yeah, and
that million and half visitors,

02:59:56.340 --> 02:59:57.640
you know, they're coming from --

02:59:57.640 --> 02:59:58.940
&gt;&gt; Katharine Tuchman: Yes.

02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:00.240
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: -- all over.

03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:01.540
&gt;&gt; Katharine Tuchman: Yeah.

03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:02.840
And our tours are
available to everyone.

03:00:02.840 --> 03:00:04.140
&gt;&gt; Johanna Siebert: I guess
one of the things I think

03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:05.440
about it is, you know, and again
I based a lot of what I talked

03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:07.790
about today on the
national standards.

03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:11.100
And how the responding units
being built from those,

03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:14.390
you know, through resources
here were meant to connect

03:00:14.390 --> 03:00:16.090
to students no matter where.

03:00:16.090 --> 03:00:18.370
And so looking at things
like that, when you think

03:00:18.370 --> 03:00:20.490
about how can teachers
personalize it,

03:00:20.490 --> 03:00:22.800
either to perhaps a
culture of a community,

03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:24.110
if you're looking
for specific music's.

03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:26.370
If you're looking for
intercultural types

03:00:26.370 --> 03:00:27.850
of activities, too, how can

03:00:27.850 --> 03:00:29.790
that teacher take either
the responding units we're

03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:32.370
providing, or through
the different processes

03:00:32.370 --> 03:00:33.790
that I mentioned and make

03:00:33.790 --> 03:00:35.390
that just a little more
appropriate, perhaps.

03:00:35.390 --> 03:00:37.560
And, again, by the
levels, you know,

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.330
where do we bring our parents
in so that [inaudible] some

03:00:39.330 --> 03:00:40.770
of our visiting artists.

03:00:40.770 --> 03:00:43.430
When they bring in things and
talk about the music's at home.

03:00:43.430 --> 03:00:46.730
So I would suggest that
they're meant to be interpreted

03:00:46.730 --> 03:00:50.890
so very widely when they were
written, the standards that is,

03:00:50.890 --> 03:00:54.200
it was meant to reflect a
national look, which is hard

03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:56.270
to do in a document, isn't
it, because we look different

03:00:56.270 --> 03:00:59.660
from one state and look
[inaudible] to the next.

03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:00.960
But then how do we go

03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:03.060
about personalizing
them would be the goal.

03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:04.360
So perhaps --

03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:06.650
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: And I
think for us it's really

03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:10.240
that we do attract educators
from across the country

03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:12.640
to our programs that are
all summer intensives,

03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:14.210
they happen in July.

03:01:14.210 --> 03:01:17.940
But the guides are meant to
be brought back to communities

03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:19.900
and to people who don't
have the opportunity

03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:21.220
to come study with us.

03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:23.430
And what we're hoping
to do is encourage them

03:01:23.430 --> 03:01:27.190
to not only explore the Library
of Congress's collection,

03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:29.060
but to then find ways in
their own communities,

03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:32.590
because no matter where you live
there's a historical society,

03:01:32.590 --> 03:01:35.350
or there's a cultural
center or museum.

03:01:35.350 --> 03:01:39.130
And a lot of museums do
have materials that they --

03:01:39.130 --> 03:01:41.570
what we find is that when we
tell people we're bringing

03:01:41.570 --> 03:01:44.020
educators, they're
so over the moon.

03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:47.190
A lot of cultural institutions
don't know how to engage

03:01:47.190 --> 03:01:49.950
with educators, but they
have curriculum and materials

03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:51.250
and methods, they
just don't know how

03:01:51.250 --> 03:01:52.770
to like sort of publicize that.

03:01:52.770 --> 03:01:55.400
And so we're encouraging
educators

03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:57.070
from across the country
to engage

03:01:57.070 --> 03:01:59.510
with the cultural institutions
in their own communities,

03:01:59.510 --> 03:02:02.210
as well in using what we
know is on the Library

03:02:02.210 --> 03:02:05.550
of Congress website is a
springboard to then replicate

03:02:05.550 --> 03:02:07.160
that in their own communities.

03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:08.460
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: That's good.

03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:09.810
That's good.

03:02:09.810 --> 03:02:11.590
Any other questions?

03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:15.590
All right, then.

03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:19.810
[Inaudible] we could use some
tap dancing, and, you know.

03:02:19.810 --> 03:02:23.360
And I'll start by simply
saying, thank you all.

03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:24.970
Thank you all for coming today.

03:02:24.970 --> 03:02:28.260
Our hope is that the
conversations will continue,

03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:30.130
that some of you will
stick around and have lunch

03:02:30.130 --> 03:02:33.290
over in our cafeteria and visit
with each other and trade cards

03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:36.650
and come up with approaches
that you might -- yeah, great.

03:02:36.650 --> 03:02:37.950
And there is a question.

03:02:37.950 --> 03:02:39.250
Yay.

03:02:39.250 --> 03:02:40.900
&gt;&gt; So I just [inaudible] say

03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:45.530
that cultural organizations
are struggling [inaudible]

03:02:45.530 --> 03:02:51.220
with teachers and that you all
have some program or something

03:02:51.220 --> 03:02:53.130
to help with that
[inaudible] that --

03:02:53.130 --> 03:02:55.440
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: Well, we don't
have any specific resources

03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:01.390
exactly to connect with
cultural organizations.

03:03:01.390 --> 03:03:05.370
What we have is a guide of how
you can find materials that work

03:03:05.370 --> 03:03:07.500
with particular curricular
areas.

03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:10.140
But we also have our
website, which have resources

03:03:10.140 --> 03:03:13.910
and lesson plans, and you can
call and connect with the people

03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:16.860
that are on our team that can
actually give you some prompt

03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:20.470
and tell you how to walk into a
cultural organization and say,

03:03:20.470 --> 03:03:23.190
this is what my curriculum
is, whatever I'm teaching,

03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:25.760
what do you have in
your collections.

03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:28.670
And we give you some tools to
start with what's on the Library

03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:31.490
of Congress collection, so
that you know what's there.

03:03:31.490 --> 03:03:34.560
And then you could say, well,
what can my students look

03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:36.370
at that might be relevant
to our own community?

03:03:36.370 --> 03:03:37.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.

03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:38.970
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: That's good.

03:03:38.970 --> 03:03:41.790
That's good.

03:03:41.790 --> 03:03:44.190
&gt;&gt; Can I just add onto that?

03:03:44.190 --> 03:03:45.490
Sorry. [Inaudible] --

03:03:45.490 --> 03:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: Yeah.

03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:48.090
&gt;&gt; So -- yes, thank you.

03:03:48.090 --> 03:03:49.390
I just wanted to add onto that,
especially when we're talking

03:03:49.390 --> 03:03:54.720
about equity and access, and how
educators can benefit from all

03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:56.700
of these tools, but
then actually take them

03:03:56.700 --> 03:03:58.530
down to the local level.

03:03:58.530 --> 03:04:01.310
The D.C. Collaborative has been
working with Nathan Diamond

03:04:01.310 --> 03:04:05.580
and the D.C. Arts team for
some time to find ways how we

03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:08.330
in the private sector, all
the cultural institutions here

03:04:08.330 --> 03:04:10.680
in the District that are
serving D.C. students,

03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:13.730
can make curricular connections

03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:16.960
to that arts education framework
Nathan was talking about.

03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:20.800
So D.C. Collaborative members,
through our Arts and Humanities

03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:22.510
for Every Student
field trip program,

03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:24.450
and as well as after
school programming and out

03:04:24.450 --> 03:04:28.180
of school time programming that
they provide are now looking

03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:30.630
at those -- for curricular
alignment.

03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:33.500
So -- and we do professional
development opportunities.

03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:36.060
And I would absolutely
welcome a field trip for us

03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:37.690
to come up to Philadelphia --

03:04:37.690 --> 03:04:38.990
&gt;&gt; Please do.

03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:40.700
&gt;&gt; -- to learn best practices,
so that we can share that out

03:04:40.700 --> 03:04:45.220
with educators here
in the District.

03:04:45.220 --> 03:04:46.880
Thank you.

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:48.180
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay.

03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:50.700
So once again, thank you
all for coming this morning.

03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:53.770
Thank you for the conversations
that you've started

03:04:53.770 --> 03:04:56.040
and the conversations
that you will continue.

03:04:56.040 --> 03:04:59.260
I also want you to
-- yes, I will.

03:04:59.260 --> 03:05:00.560
Thank you.

03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:01.860
Good suggestion.

03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:04.500
It's like Julia works
here [laughter].

03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:06.920
She's reminding me that after
lunch I ought to really head

03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:08.350
over to the Thomas
Jefferson building.

03:05:08.350 --> 03:05:10.000
Now that you have it visualized,

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.320
you should go see
it, if you haven't.

03:05:12.320 --> 03:05:13.620
Good suggestion.

03:05:13.620 --> 03:05:16.650
I also want to do a shout
out to some of my colleagues

03:05:16.650 --> 03:05:19.440
who have been really incredibly
helpful in the planning

03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:22.620
of this event, and in the
execution of this event today.

03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:24.420
So Michael Appledorf [assumed
spelling], I don't know

03:05:24.420 --> 03:05:26.360
if he's still around, or Colena
Black [assumed spelling],

03:05:26.360 --> 03:05:29.300
and Vivian Awumai [assumed
spelling], and our teacher

03:05:29.300 --> 03:05:31.650
in resident, Matt Poth
[assumed spelling].

03:05:31.650 --> 03:05:33.200
And I know Deanna Bella
[assumed spelling] is around,

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:34.500
and Steven Wesson
[assumed spelling],

03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:36.790
and Phoebe Coleman [assumed
spelling], thank you all.

03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:38.850
Thank you all for being here
and for all that you did

03:05:38.850 --> 03:05:40.650
to help contribute to today.

03:05:40.650 --> 03:05:45.870
[ Applause ]

03:05:45.870 --> 03:05:47.780
Thank you, Rhona.

03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:50.550
My goal for this
was that everybody

03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:52.730
in the room would know a little
bit more about the Library

03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:55.530
of Congress then you knew when
you got here this morning.

03:05:55.530 --> 03:05:58.020
And that you might start
thinking of some ways

03:05:58.020 --> 03:06:00.870
that your organization or
that the teachers or students

03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:03.280
that you work with might
benefit from the Library

03:06:03.280 --> 03:06:06.230
and it's collections in ways
you've never imagined before.

03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:08.620
And get to know us,
because we're a lot of fun,

03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:10.210
and we got some really
cool stuff.

&gt;&gt; Erin Elman: They are fun.

03:06:11.510 --> 03:06:12.810
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: All right.

03:06:12.810 --> 03:06:14.110
Very good.

03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:15.410

03:06:18.010 --> 03:06:21.760
And on your way out you can snag
a really terrific publication

03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:23.330

publication is online as well.

Thank you.

03:06:32.480 --> 03:06:33.920
Well, we're going
to have network --

03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:39.470
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Get a mic
or John's going to yell at you.

03:06:39.470 --> 03:06:40.770
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Is this working?

03:06:40.770 --> 03:06:42.080
No. Well, next --
[laughter] thank you.

03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:43.790
Next door is the cafeteria.

03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:45.090
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Yeah, right over here.

03:06:45.090 --> 03:06:46.390
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: The
restrooms are down the hall.

03:06:46.390 --> 03:06:49.980
And we hope you'll all
come join us for lunch --

03:06:49.980 --> 03:06:52.240
pick up some lunch -- thank you.

03:06:52.240 --> 03:06:54.740
Pick up some lunch and
just sit at the tables.

03:06:54.740 --> 03:06:58.930
And anyone who wants to network
can just discuss these ideas.

03:06:58.930 --> 03:07:00.950
Are you going to be available?

03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:05.810
And talk to our panelists, talk
to Lee Ann, talk to myself.

03:07:05.810 --> 03:07:09.380
And thank you, Lee Ann,
again, and Susan Vita,

03:07:09.380 --> 03:07:11.420

03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:12.720
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: This is true.

03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:14.020
Thank you.
