00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.480
A huge debacle at a zoo in the tiny country
of Denmark has managed to overshadow even the Sochi Olympic screw ups.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.000
 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.709
[MUSIC]

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.540
Hey humans, Trace here for DNews -- Zookeepers
at the Copenhagen Zoo killed an 18-month-old

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.980
reticulated giraffe this weekend. Marius the
giraffe was an inbred QUOTE "surplus" animal

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.220
who would never have been allowed to breed
in captivity -- because his genes were already

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.230
overrepresented in the captive population.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.320
Their solution was to let him live for a little
while, and then euthanize him. Once killed,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.260
the zookeepers demonstrated how they would
carve the meat for use in the zoo, and then

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.310
fed it to the lions. The world outside of
Denmark, however, sort of... exploded. There

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.880
were protests, death threats and terrible
responses. There were offers to adopt Marius,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.800
who in-spite of being inbred, was a healthy
male. However, that's actually AGAINST ZOO

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.970
RULES! The European Association of Zoos and
Aquariums said in a statement today they "fully

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.650
support the decision of the zoo to humanely
put the animal down." And the Association

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.850
of Zoos and Aquariums here in the United States
also stresses they value a QUOTE "healthy,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.320
genetically diverse, and demographically varied
population." In order to be an accredited

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.409
AZA or EAZA member, zoos have to abide by
each organization's rules. In the US, there

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.409
are 22 sections to the animal disposition
section of the AZA Species Survival Plan.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.290
And in there, it says specifically euthanasia
is one appropriate action.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.920
EAZA regulations specify young animals who
are unable to go to better facilities and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.470
will not provide for the genetic future of
the species should be euthanised. It's rare,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.610
but it happens. AZA regulations go so far
as to limit the donation of zoo animals to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.640
private owners too! Rather than robbing a
better genetic specimen from the limited spots

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.119
available in the zoos of the world, the zookeepers
made a very difficult decision.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.959
Arguably, the zookeepers chose to turn this
part of the life cycle of a wild animal into

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.110
a demonstration -- which some would call a
spectacle. And that in itself might be the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.959
cause of the vitriol, but as the zookeepers
see it, the problem isn't the death of Marius

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.099
the giraffe, but the overblown negative response.
Death threats for this? Really?

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.250
In their statement, the EAZA said, "More than
7000 people attended Copenhagen Zoo yesterday

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.010
and left far better informed about wildlife
than when they entered, including the real

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.379
threats to the future of giraffes."

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.430
Did the Danish zookeepers and the EAZA do
the right thing for the survival of the species?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.770
One expert told PhysOrg they felt the Disneyfication
of animals has led people to forget ALL animals

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.520
are FOOD for their predators. The giraffe
meat was fed to the lions, because they are

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.190
one of the only animals which would kill and
eat an adult giraffe in the wild, and it showed

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.849
interested zoo patrons a glimpse into the
the real-life Lion King.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.110
