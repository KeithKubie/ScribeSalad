TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:02.880
I'm Timothy Jordan for
The Developer Show.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.800
Today, we're at Flutter
Live, taking place

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.854
at the Science Museum in London.

00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:08.520
Now, if you didn't
already know, Flutter

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.260
is Google's UI
toolkit for creating

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.610
fast and beautiful native
apps for iOS and Android

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.410
from a single code base.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.890
The full keynote
is linked below.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.390
But if you just
want the highlights,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.960
here they are: the
Flutter Live Top Five.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
Number one on today's list
is Flutter version 1.0.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.240
See what I did there?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.680
As we heard in
the keynote, there

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.290
are developers around the
world, shipping apps written

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.470
with Flutter to hundreds
of millions of users.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.240
So the primary focus
of this release

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.850
is bug fixes and stabilization.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
But it also includes a few
new things, like Dart 2.1

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.680
and previews for Add to
App and Platform Views.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
The number two slot goes to
Square for their new Flutter

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.127
SDKs.

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:53.460
Now, they're making it easy
to accept payments for goods

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.820
and services with Flutter, both
in person with a Square payment

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.320
reader, as well as from
inside your mobile app.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.320
Number three is Flare.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.190
Two Dimensions
launched Flare today.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.130
It's a tool that allows you to
create vector animations that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.700
can be embedded into an existing
Flutter app as a widget.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.410
It's a really tight
integration that

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.990
supports ongoing collaboration
between designers

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
and developers throughout
the build process.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.780
Number four is codeMagic.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.630
It's made by Nevercode, and
they make continuous integration

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.480
and continuous delivery
tooling for mobile apps.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.360
With codeMagic, you can select
a GitHub repo with a Flutter

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.640
project and quickly
create continuous

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.170
build flows that runs tests and
generates binary app bundles

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.090
that you can upload
directly to the Apple App

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090
Store and the Google Play Store.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.820
OK, number five.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.940
We'll end our list
with Hummingbird.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.580
This is an experimental,
web-based implementation

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.650
of the Flutter runtime,
which is really cool when

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.800
you think about it.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.950
You can write your app
in Dart, and in addition

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.300
to compiling to
date of arm code,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.420
you can also target
JavaScript, which

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.080
enables your Flutter code to
run on the standards-based web.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.900
Well, that's it: your
Flutter Live Top Five.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.580

And on your way there, take
a moment to share this video

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.740
with your friends.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.690
They'll thank you for
it, and we'll thank you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.220
by doing more of them.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm Timothy Jordan for
The Developer Show,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.280
and I'll see you next time.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.330
