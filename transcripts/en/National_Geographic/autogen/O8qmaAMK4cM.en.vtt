if the world warms by six degrees from a
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249
if the world warms by six degrees from a
distance the oceans may appear bright

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
distance the oceans may appear bright
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.640
distance the oceans may appear bright
blue but they are marine wastelands

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650

conquering armies natural disasters
 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.109
conquering armies natural disasters
become common events

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119
 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.150
some of the world's great cities are

some of the world's great cities are
 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.139
some of the world's great cities are
flooded and abandoned

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149
flooded and abandoned
 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.460

this could be our world +6 degrees

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.510
warming's of six degrees over longer

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
warming's of six degrees over longer
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.370
warming's of six degrees over longer
time periods have been associated with

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380
time periods have been associated with
 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.320
time periods have been associated with
some of the most devastating mass

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330
some of the most devastating mass
 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.790
some of the most devastating mass
extinctions which have ever taken place

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
extinctions which have ever taken place
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280
extinctions which have ever taken place
so it's certainly fair to assume that if

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290
so it's certainly fair to assume that if
 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.230
so it's certainly fair to assume that if
temperatures soar by 6 degrees within

temperatures soar by 6 degrees within
 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.970

less than a century that we're going to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
less than a century that we're going to
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.020
less than a century that we're going to
face nothing less than a global wipeout

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.389
six degrees of warming has been called

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
six degrees of warming has been called
 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.680
six degrees of warming has been called
the doomsday scenario our lives would

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690
the doomsday scenario our lives would
 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.799
the doomsday scenario our lives would
never be the same again
