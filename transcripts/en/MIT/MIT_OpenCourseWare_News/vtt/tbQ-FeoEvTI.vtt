00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.200
In the year 2000, an MIT faculty committee
on lifelong learning proposed a program that

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.520
was as straightfoward it was revolutionary.
"The idea is simple: just to publish our teaching

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.110
material, our course content, online, on the
internet, and make it widely available to

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.321
everyone who could use it for free." OpenCourseWare
 - OCW - is MIT's web-based initiative that

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:39.180
offers open access to the core teaching materials
syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and exams

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.950
from 1800 courses free of charge for educators
and learners worldwide. "The idea that we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.100
came up with, OpenCourseWare, was really a
revolutionary idea, particularly at the time.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.540
Because in 1999, it was the heyday of the
dot-com era, and everyone was thinking of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.670
a for-profit model. Although we considered
it, we felt that for MIT, the right thing

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.270
to do the right model, is to give away the
teaching materials." "Some faculty thought

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.960
it was the dumbest idea, that MIT was giving
away our intellectual property to the world

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.729
for free, and no one would use their textbooks
anymore, no one would come to classes anymore,

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.280
et cetera, et cetera, and other people thought
it was the best social good they'd ever heard

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
of. Through the generous support of the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Andrew W.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520
Mellon Foundation and the Ab Initio Corporation,
MIT has published materials from virtually

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.249
all MIT undergraduate and graduate courses
on the OCW site, representing thirty-three

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:46.299
academic disciplines. In addition to the core
teaching materials, the site includes animations,

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.469
simulations and more than one thousand hours
of classroom instruction on video. "It's important

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.909
to keep in mind, that we are not offering
an MIT education through OpenCourseWare. So

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.299
for example, you don't register for credits
and you don't get a degree. A true MIT education

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.600
is something where students come on campus,
they live here, and they learn with fellow

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.319
students and with the faculty." More than
ninety percent of the faculty and hundreds

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.651
of other MIT community members voluntarily
share their knowledge and teaching materials

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:29.340
on OCW, demonstrating to the Institute's widely-held
commitment to openness. "A core value of MIT

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.860
for a long time has been public service. We
should be in the business of disseminating

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.219
this knowledge to help the world. In a sense,
that's what books do, right. So this is, if

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:46.239
you want, is the modern equivalent of that."
In the four years since the site's launch,

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.640
OpenCourseWare materials have been accessed
by 35 million individuals from more than 220

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.580
countries and territories world-wide. Rogelio
Morales, a PhD candidate at the Central University

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.140
of Venezuala, is a metalurgical engineer,
and a license commercial diver. For Morales,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.140
OCW is a valuable resource for new information
that improves underwater inspections and testing.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.049
"I often download information from different
topics and give it to our professors. Sometimes

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.739
we discuss the information. Other times, they
use the slides from the OCW site in class.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.049
It's a great resource." "I want to be part
of OCW because I believe in the spirit of

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.800
the thing. I think the concept is dead-on
right, and we don't feel proprietary about

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.549
it. We want you to know what it is. We want
you to be able to tap into it at some level,

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:46.549
even if it's a fairly static level. And that's
reason enough to do it, as far as I'm concerned.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.200
At the University of San Carlos, Guatemala's
center of education for more than three hundred

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.430
years, Professor Waleska Aldana Segura teaches
a course for physics instructors. "When you

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.999
try to teach certain subjects and you don't
have labs or equipment or any kind of visualization,

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:07.519
the students end up lacking the expertise
necessary for their future success as physics

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.969
professors. The fact that MIT provides the
materials without cost is simply extraordinary."

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.389
"I think the most wonderful thing about this
is that MIT was, in a way, almost, to most

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.500
people outside MIT, like the Forbidden City.
They had no idea what happened inside. And

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:36.200
with OCW, the bridge was lowered. They now
see MIT in a completely different way. Triatno

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.970
Yudo Harjoko, head of the architectural department
at the University of Indonesia at Depok, was

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.810
amazed at the university as renowned as MIT
would give access to virtually all of its

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.140
educational information Harjoko believes that
there is great value in MIT's free and open

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.790
sharing. "It's not simply the information
that's valuable, but also the glimpse OCW

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.270
offers into how MIT has structured its teaching
and research." The reach of OpenCourseWare

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.040
goes far beyond the site itself. Other organizations
have now translated nearly six hundred OCW

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.110
courses into other languages, including Chinese,
Spanish, Portuguese, and Thai. These translations

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.200
have been accessed by fourteen million visitors
to date. There are also more than one hundred

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.260
mirror sites, locally hosted versions of the
OCW site, in low-bandwidth areas. The majority

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.980
are located in sub-Saharan Africa. "I travel
to Africa and I felt the people they were

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.340
very receptive to OCW, and the mission of
OCW, which is to spread knowledge around the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.750
world. Many of the universities in Africa
don't have books or the budgets are really

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.840
low compared to the United States, and so
whatever little help they can get with setting

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.780
up the curricula, or just more information
about a subject - it really helps." "Another

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.360
area that many of us had an aspiration for
was that OpenCourseWare would not be just

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.870
something that MIT does, but by setting an
example and a model, it would become something

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.610
that many other institutions would also do.
Not just in the areas that we are good at,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.340
like science or engineering or management,
but in all kinds of fields of knowledge. And

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.580
today that over two hundred and fifty university
around the world who are doing their own OpenCourseWare.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.110
And I think that the dream that, in fact,
OpenCourseWare would be truly very very broad-based

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.050
movement that would impact knowledge, information
and education worldwide - I think it's coming

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.460
to fruition even as we speak now. OpenCourseWare
has grown from a bold experiment to a global

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.400
movement with the complete MIT curriculum
now available on the site, OpenCourseWare

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
has reached an important milestone, but is
only at the beginning of the journey. MIT

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.360
will continue to enhance and update OCW materials,
develop new programs and features, and collaborate

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.590
with others seeking to share their own knowledge,
helping to create a truly global network of

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:11.260
Open educational Resources. "I came from a
family, in fact we were refugees in Hong Kong,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:18.400
someone financially restricted, with very
few options and when I grew up I remember

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:26.440
my father, valuing education, would bring
home old second-, third-hand volumes of MIT

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.110
books. I remember flipping through these books,
and seeing the dome, the picture of the dome

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:38.740
on the front cover, and just aspiring one
day to go to MIT. And the fact that today

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.940
I'm a professor at MIT so forth, that's a
testament to the fact that MIT has an impact

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.020
way behind its immediate borders. And I think
that's at the heart, in some sense, of the

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:57.050
idea of OpenCourseWare. That institutions
like MIT has a responsibility, has an opportunity,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:06.480
to impact students way beyond our immediate
walls in Cambridge. MIT OpenCourseWare: Unlocking
