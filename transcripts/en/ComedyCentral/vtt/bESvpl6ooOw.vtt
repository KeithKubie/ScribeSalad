00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.607
- It's time for our next
game, Tatscrewed, Tatscrewed.

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:05.940
(applause and cheering)

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:10.050
If you get a tattoo,
you have to be prepared

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.050
to live with it forever.

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:13.879
It's not gonna come off.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.974
They have to burn it off with
lasers and it fuckin' hurts,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.383
I'm told, but thanks
to the perfectly named

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:21.394
f**knobadtattoos Tumblr, we
learned that some of the people

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.691
who chose to get tattoos
have very poor judgment.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.329
Comedians, I'll describe two awful tattoos

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.121
and for 250 points, you
let me know which one

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.067
you think is real.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.778
Okay, first one.

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:32.891
Donkey Kong swinging off a man's nipple,

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:36.201
or Sonic the Hedgehog running
into a guy's butt crack.

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.534
(laughing and cheering)

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:43.589
(imitates ringing)

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:44.422
Emily.

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.256
- It is definitely Sonic
the Hedgehog running

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:48.024
into a guy's butt crack,
'cause that's my dad.

00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:49.941
- Okay, let's find out.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:54.067
No, Donkey Kong, awesome,
swinging off a man's nipple.

00:00:54.067 --> 00:00:56.196
- Awesome, that's so great.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:57.925
- That's a good one.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.008
I'd get that.

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:02.399
- And I'd get the monkey as well.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.049
(laughing)

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.882
- All right, next one.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.736
Knuckle tattoos spelling out Sorry Mom,

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.788
or a tramp stamp reading I Hate You Dad.

00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:12.697
(bell rings)

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:13.530
Tim.

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:18.483
- I think the second is
so sitting on the edge

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:20.882
of something that you
wouldn't say on telly,

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:23.375
that it has to be the first one.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.125
S-O-Er-Er-E M-Uh-Uh-M, Sorry Mom.

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:29.151
- Okay, let's find out.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:29.984
Let's find out.

00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:31.206
Sorry Mom.

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.456
(applause)

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:40.327
I feel bad for the guy that's
got to get an HJ with Mom

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:41.327
on the hand.

00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:46.490
Could you use the, actually
sorry's not any better.

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.182
Just skip this.

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:51.099
I'll do it.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.782
- But actually that hand has YMOM on it.

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.289
- [Emily] Why Mom.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.539
(laughing)

00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:00.381
- Why, Mom?

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.505
Add a point to Tim Minchin.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.877
All right, next one, a
lower back tattoo that says

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:08.587
Ass: It's What's For Dinner,

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.439
or an above the breasts tattoo that says

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.189
Stop Staring Bitches.

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:15.859
- [Both] Stop Starring.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.703
- Well, okay, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:18.536
(bell rings)

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:20.134
Yes, Emily.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:21.685
- An above the breasts tattoo that says

00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:22.885
Stop Starring Bitches.

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:25.096
- Okay, let's find out.

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:26.363
Yes, so it does.

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:28.802
(groaning)

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:31.529
(applause)

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.696
- That is such a bad idea, oh, my god.

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:44.648
- Now, I like to think that these eyes

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:49.786
are judging you for bad spelling, but--

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.302
- Does this turn you on?

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:55.564
- Hold on, what are we looking at?

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:57.590
The nipples are below
the shirt line, are they?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.316
- The think the nipples are
very below the shirt line.

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.963
- Listen, everyone knows that--

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:04.446
- Hey, are the eyes on the nipples?

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:05.630
- [All] No, no, no.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.542
- [Rhys] Everyone knows
the nipples are the eyes.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:08.625
That's weird.

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:13.011
- Stop Starring Bitches.

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.201
Stop Starring.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:21.739
- How does one star, and is it--

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.563
- I'll tell you what, I
would give that one star.

00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:27.211
That's how you one star.

00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:29.461
(applause)

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:33.854
Next one, Fred Durst's head
above two crossed rifles,

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:36.216
or Dave Matthews nude on horseback?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.250
(laughing)

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.905
(bell rings)

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:41.657
Ridin' along on a horseback.

00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:43.932
- It's definitely Dave
Matthews nude on horseback.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.428
- [Host] You think so,
okay, let's find out.

00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:46.320
- [Rhys] Hold on, hold on.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.352
- What?

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.486
(groaning)

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:51.378
- [Rhys] That's a shame.

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:53.628
(laughing)

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:57.724
(applause)

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:08.048
- Wild guess, they got
this tattoo for the nookie.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.448
- Really, because I think
that tattoo would create

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.880
a Limp Bizkit.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.395
(laughing)

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:13.801
- I was confused by the question.

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:15.902
I think it's unfair 'cause it wasn't clear

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:18.430
if the second one was Dave Matthews nude

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.260
tattooed on a horse's back.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510
(laughing)

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:26.874
Was it a besotted horse?

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.183
- It was a little unclear
in the presentation

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:31.016
but unfortunately--

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:32.310
- [Tim] It doesn't matter
anymore, does it, because--

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.606
- It really doesn't, because
right now what everyone's

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:36.486
thinking is I don't care which one it was,

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.153
I just wish it was not this one.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.062
All right, last one, matching
thigh tattoos of Obama

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:47.812
and bin Laden, or a
Despicable Me ass tattoo.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:50.667
(bell rings)

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:51.978
Tim.

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:55.061
- Oh, please let it be the first one,

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:56.830
but it's the second one.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
- [Host] You think it's the second one?

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:58.913
- Yeah, oh god.

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:03.254
Oh I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:05.240
We did it.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.643
- I just want to remind
you want country you're in.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.949
Show us.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:11.866
- [All] No.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:17.172
- Oh, my god.

00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.184
Oh, my god.

00:05:22.184 --> 00:05:23.017
- I know, it's gonna be okay.

00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:24.185
I know, I know.

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:27.369
Tim, come here, I know,
I'm sorry, I know, I know.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.358
I know, I don't know, Tim.

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:30.567
- I don't understand what they're trying,

00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:34.151
it's good, people should have
more nuanced views these days.

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:35.536
Just a little balance sometimes.

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.533
- I got a Green Card for this.

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.866
(laughing and applause)

00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm not staying here.
