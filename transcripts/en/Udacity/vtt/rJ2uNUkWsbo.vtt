00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The is JavaScript.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Down here you see more than a dozen classes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that all have had plenty of security issues.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is the correct answer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One may wonder why is it that issues end up in a small number of places

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that such large parts of the code remain without any issues.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For JavaScript this is pretty clear.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This piece holds the JavaScript interpreter,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which interacts through many, many interfaces with the system.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
All of these are possible attack vectors.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's no surprise that JavaScript holds these many security issues.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Plus an interpreter is notoriously hard to get right.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
HTML layout may come as a surprise.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
After all, this is just the rearranging of appropriate user interface elements on the screen.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Why would there be security issues related to that?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The reason is cross-site scripting.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As soon as you layout multiple sources on one page,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it may be that one sources tries to access elements of the other source,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
using your screen as a tunnel.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
These issues are right here within HTML layout.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The document object model also allows accessing and manipulating individual elements.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This again is an open door for security issues

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
as well as for content base. I don't really know.
