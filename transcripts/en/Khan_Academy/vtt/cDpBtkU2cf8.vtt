00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.179
So, I have several groups of
these ball-looking things.

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.470
And let's think about how
many balls are in each group.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.230
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 12.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.430
And what I want to do is
think about the different ways

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.110
of dividing these 12 balls into
different numbers of groups.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.750
So, for example, I could
view these 12 balls as one,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.110
so that's 1 group of 3, 2
groups of 3, 3 groups of 3,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.460
4 groups of 3.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.990
So I could view 12 as
being 4 groups of 3.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.870
And the way that
we would write that

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.710
is that 12 is equal
to 4 groups of 3.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.480
Or another way of reading this
is that 12 is equal to 4 times

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.240
3.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.930
If I have 1, 2, 3, 4 groups,
and in each of those groups

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.660
I have 1, 2, 3,
objects, I'm going

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.460
to have a total of 12 objects.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.940
But that's not the only
way we can get to 12.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.900
We could also view
it as 3 groups of 4.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.230
So, let's look at that.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:25.430
So we could have it as 1
group of 4, 2 groups of 4,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.090
3 groups of 4.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.890
So now we could view 12
as being 3 groups of 4.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:46.410
Or we could say-- let me get the
right tool out-- that 3 times 4

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.030
is equal to 12.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.260
So, whether we're doing
4 times 3 or 3 times 4,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.140
they're both going
to be equal to 12.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.380
4 groups of 3 is
12, 3 groups of 4.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.990
But we don't have to stop there.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.610
We could also view
12 as, well, we

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.740
could view it as 2 groups of 6.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.960
Let's look at that.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.130
So this is 1 group
of 6 right over here.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.140
So, that's one 1 of 6.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.430
That's another group of 6.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.750
So, once again, we could
view this as 2 times 6.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.910
2 times 6 will also get us a 12.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.500
Well, what about doing
it as 6 groups of 2?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.640
Well, we can draw that
out, too-- 6 groups of 2.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.410
So that's 1 group of 2.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.805
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:36.740
Let me do it in
this purple color.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.050
We have 1 group of 2, 2
groups of 2, 3 groups of 2,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.620
4 groups of 2, 5 groups
of 2, and 6 groups of 2.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.720
So once again, this
is all different ways

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.270
of writing 12, something
equivalent to 12.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:02.200
We could write 6 times 2--
6 groups of 2-- 6 times 2

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.670
is also equal 12.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.750
But we don't have to stop there.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.470
We could also literally
view 12 as 1 group of 12.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.840
So how would that look?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.020
So 1 group of 12.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.820
So this whole thing is
just 1 group of 12 here.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:34.080
So we could literally say
1 times 12 is equal to 12.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.600
We have one entire group of 12.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.154
1 times 12 is equal to 12.

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:41.070
And we could think of
it the other way around.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.470
We could view this
as 12 groups of 1.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.990
Let me draw that.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.200
So 12 groups of 1.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.798
This is 1 group of
1, 2 groups of 1,

00:03:50.798 --> 00:04:03.680
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, and 12-- 12 groups of 1.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.070
So we could also write 12.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.820
12 groups, and in
each one, I have 1.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.541
Well, that's still
going to get me to 12.
