[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.610
CHRIS EDWARDS: I was
24 when I started

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.470
my career in advertising.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.560
It was 1993, and I took a job at
Arnold as a junior copywriter.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.990
And my father, Ed
Eskandarian, he

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.990
was the CEO and
owner at the time.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.520
And let me tell you, it is not
easy being the boss's daughter,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.530
especially when
deep down, you've

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.160
always known you were his son.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.700
I first verbalized this when
I was around five years old.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.860
I came out to my grandmother.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.560
I just didn't know
that's what I was doing.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.040
Neither did she-- surprise!

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
We were at her summer
cottage on the Cape.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.400
And my older sister Wendy and I
were sitting in the family room

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.031
coloring, and Gram was
getting dinner ready.

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.280
And she was coming from the
kitchen to the dining room

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.510
with platters of
food, passing by us.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.890
And on her last
pass, she said, "come

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.230
on girls, dinner's ready."

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.590
And my sister sprang
up immediately

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
and followed her to the table.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.480
I didn't flinch.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.780
I honestly did not think
she was talking to me.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.660
So I kept coloring.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.330
And a minute or so later,
she came over to me

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.200
and she said, didn't
you hear me calling you?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.240
And I said, no.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.260
And she said, I
said, come on girls.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.370
And I looked at her like
she was insane, and I said,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.700
I'm not a girl.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.770
And she said, yes--

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.250
yes, you are.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.070
And I said, no, I'm not.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm a boy.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.140
And she said no you're
not, sweetheart.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.400
And I said, well,
then I'm going to be.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.110
I'm also a Taurus,
just so you know.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.680
And she just-- she said,
you can't, darling.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.140
And she smiled
sympathetically at me

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.480
and walked back
into the kitchen.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.090
And I remember being
left there thinking,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.740
you know, whatever, Gram.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.170
You know, I'm going to make
this happen with or without you.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.280
And I was wracking my
brain, trying to figure out,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.550
how could she possibly
make this mistake?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.000
Are other people
making this mistake?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.510
So I started trying
to figure out,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.240
and according to my
five-year-old brain,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.200
the only difference
between boys and girls

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.840
was that boys had short hair
and girls had long hair.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.670
So I told my mom,
I want my hair cut

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.240
like daddy's, problem solved--

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.950
so I thought.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.400
It wasn't until the
following summer,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.626
when I realized I was
lacking certain equipment.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.000
I was back at Gram's-- that
seemed to be where everything

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.170
happened.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.150
But this time, I was with Wendy
and my younger cousin Adam.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.810
And we were out on the
back deck having popsicles.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.380
And Adam nudges me, and
he says, watch this.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.100
And then he turns to the side,
and he pees in a perfect arc,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.660
right over the deck rail.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.390
And I was like--

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.580
you know, oh my god.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.707
You know, how did you do that?

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:16.540
You know, when I pee,
it goes straight down.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.740
So I actually thought it
was some kind of magic trick

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.490
that he was doing.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.400
I think I said, do you
have a squirt gun in there?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.790
Like, what-- and my sister
is like, duh, he has a penis.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.140
And I'm like, oh,
yeah, of course.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.070
And I'm thinking,
what is a penis?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.770
And how come I don't have one?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.780
But it was very hard
being six years,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.030
trying to rationalize it.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.140
So I figured, OK, well, maybe
mine just hasn't grown yet.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.180
I'm sure it'll grow.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.290
I'm kind of sure--

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.230
you know, kids grow in heights
at all different times.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.070
I'm sure it'll grow.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.060
Well, that never happened.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.670
And I began to realize something
was terribly, terribly wrong.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.700
And every night I would pray
that somehow, some way, my body

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.480
would turn into a boy's body
and everybody would finally

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.339
realize they were all wrong
for thinking that I was a girl.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.260
My body changed all right,
just not the way I had hoped.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.410
Puberty hit and my body betrayed
me in the worst possible ways

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.780
that I could ever imagine.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.290
And I knew then
that I was stuck.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.240
I was stuck in this body
that I hated, and stuck being

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.460
a girl for the rest of my life.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.970
I became deeply,
deeply depressed.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.650
My whole personality changed.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.800
I was no longer the fun
loving kid I used to be.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.190
I was angry all the time,
snapping at everybody.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.170
I'd hold it together
at school, so I

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.760
wouldn't lose all my friends.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.330
But I'd get home and
I'd take it out--

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.600
take it out on my family.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.390
In junior high
and high school, I

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.190
knew I was attracted to girls
so I thought I must be gay.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.550
This is actually a very
common mistake, at first.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.760
A lot of people think
being transgender

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.940
is like an extreme
form of being gay.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.650
It's hard for
people to understand

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.980
that gender identity
and sexual orientation

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.670
are two completely separate
and unrelated things.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.440
One way to understand it
is, sexual orientation

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.070
is who you go to bed
with, and gender identity

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.380
is who you go to bed as.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.240
But I didn't know any
of that at the time.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.050
All I knew was, oh, my
god, I think I'm gay.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.480
And that was traumatizing
enough for me.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.400
I mean, this was the early 80s.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.710
Nobody was openly
gay-- certainly nobody

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.370
in white upper class
suburbia where I grew up.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.470
I mean, there was definitely no
Gayblers, I can tell you that.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.380
There weren't even any
celebrities that were out--

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.140
you know, there was no
Ellen, no "Will and Grace,"

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.470
no "Modern Family."

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.511
George Michael was still in
the closet, for God's sake,

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.510
and those were the Wham!

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.009
Years.

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.210
So he's bopping around on
stage in white Capri pants,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.370
singing wake me up
before you go, go--

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.130
and girls everywhere actually
thought they had a chance.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.710
The problem was, when I looked
up the definition of the word

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.490
gay-- and I did, that's how
I am, I'm very thorough--

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.870
all it said was basically,
someone who's attracted

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.300
to someone of the same sex.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.580
It didn't say
anything about feeling

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.040
like you were in the
wrong body or wanting

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.480
to become the opposite sex.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.770
So then I figured, oh great,
I'm this freak, and I'm ashamed,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.840
and there's no way
I am ever going

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.030
to tell anybody how I really
feel inside-- especially not

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.840
my family.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.927
I couldn't bear the thought
of humiliating them,

00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:15.760
and the thought of them
being ashamed of me.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.750
It got to a point
where I could not

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.450
envision a future for myself--

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.940
one in which I'd
be happy, anyway.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.870
So senior year of high
school, I made a decision.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.660
I decided I would go to college,
party it up for four years,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.228
and then kill myself
after graduation.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.810
Now the first part
of the plan was easy.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.310
I had already
gotten into Colgate,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.721
which was ranked the number
one party school in the US

00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:47.220
that year.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.440
So I majored in psychology
and minored in keg stands--

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.110
or maybe it was the
other way around.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.920
But graduation came
and went, and I just

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.690
couldn't bring myself
to follow through

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.620
with the rest of the plan.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.360
So where did that leave me?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.180
Well when you get to
a point in your life

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.340
where you don't want to live it
any more, you have two choices.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.690
You can either end it,
or you can change it.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.030
And since I couldn't
bring myself to end it,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.330
I knew I had to change it.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.880
Lucky for me, I had three
things going for me.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.790
The first was a loving
and supportive family--

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.190
and this is, sadly, something a
lot of trans kids do not have.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.370
And it's a big reason why
the suicide attempt rate

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.890
for trans youth is near 50%--

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.549
five oh.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.270
Now, I'm not saying, when
I finally told my parents,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.090
they were like, well, let's
go get you some surgery,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.330
and take care of it!

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.840
I've described their reaction
as cautiously supportive.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.110
It was a lot to take in,
back then in the early 90s.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.220
Very little
information out there--

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.770
certainly no success
stories to point to.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.620
There was nobody that they
could look at and say, oh,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.540
well that person did it
and they turned out fine.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.130
You know, Chris will be fine.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.440
There was nobody.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.280
And surgery was nowhere near
where it is today, especially

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.840
going from female to male.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.410
It's a lot harder to add
than it is to subtract,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.580
if you know what I mean.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.420
So they were scared.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.280
They were scared I was going
to go through all of this,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.830
publicly, only to end up
worse off-- losing my friends

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.700
and becoming like
a social outcast,

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.500
and not being happy with my
body after going through it.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.640
I remember a few weeks
after I had told them,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.400
my dad had been processing it.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.570
And he said to me,
very hopefully,

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.500
do you think you could
just stay the way you are?

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.830
Maybe keep it-- keep it inside
and go as you're going now,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.905
and maybe just
consider this handicap?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.540
And I looked at him and I
said, this is my identity.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.860
It's not something that I
can compartmentalize, put

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.450
on a shelf, and forget about.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.740
It's who I am every day.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.260
And if I have to keep
living my life as a girl,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.800
I'd just rather
not live it at all.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.960
And he hugged me, and he said,
that we would get through this

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.720
together as a family.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.230
And it was that feeling
of finally not being alone

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.550
in this anymore that gave
me the hope and the courage

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.030
to take the next step.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.470
Which brings me to the second
thing I had going for me--

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.220
some damn good therapy.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.940
Finding the right
therapist was very hard,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.240
because there weren't
many that had experience

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.085
with gender identity issues.

00:11:12.085 --> 00:11:16.330
But I found one, and
having the right therapist

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.630
was critical to my getting
through my transition

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.330
as successfully as I did.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.980
Anyone who knows me--

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.840
Matt knows me a little bit--

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.020
knows that I am a worrier.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.570
I worry about everything.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.760
It's in my DNA.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.380
And to give you an
idea, in high school

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.450
I was voted most
likely to get an ulcer.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:46.480
So you can imagine, when it
came to something as pivotal

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.840
as changing my gender in
front of every single person

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.287
I knew, I was
consumed with worry.

00:11:51.287 --> 00:11:52.870
You know, worry
about, what are people

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.060
going to think, or say, or do?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.380
It was paralyzing.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.155
And I figured, my
therapist is just

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:01.780
going to tell me,
well, you can't worry

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.350
about what you can't control.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.180
But she didn't.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.970
Instead, she said
to me, well, you

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:14.870
can actually control how
other people treat you.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.620
And I looked at
her, and she said,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.400
the way you act
can actually shape

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.880
the way other people react.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.070
And it clicked something in me.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.320
It was like unlocking
the secret inner power

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.170
I didn't know I had.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.900
And it was that power
that gave me the balls

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.900
to change my life, which
is why I hold my therapist

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.550
in such high regard.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.760
Doesn't mean, I didn't want to
kill her at times, especially

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.200
in the beginning.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.650
I remember the very first
session I had with her.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.610
I walked into her office
in Central Square,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.290
and she opened the
door and she was

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.130
exactly what I pictured a
Cambridge therapist would

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.785
look like.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.420
Medium length, straight
brown hair, graying,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.520
parted in the middle, big round
glasses, turtleneck sweater,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.940
chunky necklace,
corduroys, sensible all

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.280
weather walking shoes, Subaru
Outback parked in front.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.360
Anyway, I go in there,
and we sit down,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.890
and she's staring at me
and I'm staring at her.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.710
And we're just having a
staring contest until finally I

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.805
was like, OK, where
should we start?

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:34.930
Where do you want to start?

00:13:38.142 --> 00:13:39.850
I don't know, wherever
you think is best?

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.974
Where do you think is best?

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:42.130
Oh, my god.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.540
I mean, you go--

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.420
you go to a therapist because
you want a professional

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.970
to tell you what to do.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.780
But she was all about the
questions-- every session,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.260
constantly challenging
my feelings

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.440
and understanding
about gender and I

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.010
will say, as annoying as it, it
was actually a very good thing.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.870
My initial plan was to move away
and go and transition somewhere

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.557
where nobody knew me.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.140
And she got me to
realize, I was going

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.110
to be a lot of support to get
through something like this.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.460
And to move somewhere where
I had no family, no friends,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.230
and try to do this in secret--

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.250
while it might sound appealing
short term, in the long run,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.470
it could end up being much,
much more stressful and harder

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.220
to do.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.410
So she was the one
who opened me up

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:37.650
to the idea of staying in Boston
and transitioning at Arnold.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.380
Which leads me to
the third thing--

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.430
I worked in advertising.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.020
So I was able to take the
branding and marketing

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.550
principles that I was applying
to my clients' business,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.615
and use them to rebrand myself.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.690
And before I get
to that, there's--

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.400
I think there's a big myth
out there that someone decides

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.290
they're transgender
and boom, they

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.870
show up to work the next
day in a wig and a dress--

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:13.516
or in my case a haircut and
a coat and tie or something.

00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:15.670
But that's not the case.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.150
While some people choose
to go about it that way,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.580
everybody handles
their transition very,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.140
very differently.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.580
And to understand
my strategy, you

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.120
have to understand one more
thing about my personality.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.930
I am not type A. I'm type A+--

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.390
maybe even A++.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.700
I am a strategizer, a planner--

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.800
I plan out everything.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.890
So when it came to something
as important as my transition,

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.940
you can bet your ass I planned
the shit out of that thing.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.170
It was like nine months
worth of planning.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.330
OK, so what did I do?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.650
Well, in advertising
what we always

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.470
do is, we take a look
at the landscape,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.120
see what's going on around us.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.390
So let me paint the
picture for you.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.560
At this point, it's 1995.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.410
Transgender isn't even
a word at this point.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.580
The word that was out
there was transsexual--

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.130
very, very negative
connotations to that word.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.184
Don't use it.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:27.100
But that was the only
word that was out there.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.830
And the only points of reference
people had to that word

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.030
was from the media--

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.150
movies like "The
Silence of the Lambs."

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.440
Anybody seen this?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.480
You may remember
Hannibal Lecter,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.640
but the villain that they
were chasing, Buffalo Bill,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.520
was a frustrated
transsexual who was mental,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.790
and skinned women so he could
sew a female body together

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.250
for himself.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.420
Nice.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.170
Even comedies like "Ace Ventura,
Pet Detective," spoiler alert

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.230
for those of you
haven't seen it,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.750
Lois Einhorn is actually Ray
Finkle, a mentally unstable

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.312
transsexual.

00:17:11.312 --> 00:17:13.770
And then of course, there are
these stellar guests on Jerry

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.832
Springer as seen in this episode
entitled "Tranny-licious."

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.560
I had my work cut out for me.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.819
When it came to
changing perceptions,

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.440
I didn't only have
to rebrand myself,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.020
I had to rebrand an
entire category--

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.320
which, I'm sure you guys
know, is not an easy task.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.440
So what was my brand
message going to be?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.580
Well, that was easy.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.320
Basically, I wanted
to prove to people

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.960
that I am not a whack job
like the media might portray--

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.340
that I'm normal.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.300
And I'm still the same person
on the inside, just a little bit

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.470
different on the outside.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.900
So because I was the first
and only person at this point

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.510
to publicly go through
a gender transition,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.370
I knew it was up to me, based
on what my therapist had taught

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.970
me, that the way I act can shape
the way other people react--

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.530
it was up to me
to set an example.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.840
So I decided right
away I was not

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:30.530
going to be meek, or ashamed, or
secretive about my transition.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.670
Instead I was going to
be open and honest--

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.320
an educator, you know,
willing to answer questions

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.840
and volunteer information.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.430
I'm an over-sharer
to begin with,

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.880
so that was really just an
extension of my personality.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.190
The other thing about my
personality that came in handy

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.030
was my sense of humor.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.840
So I made a point to
use my sense of humor

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.390
to put other people at ease.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.610
The last thing I wanted
was for coworkers

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.550
to avoid me out of fear of
saying the wrong thing, which

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.090
is a tendency we all have
to do in awkward situations.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.450
I wanted them to know, if
they got the pronoun wrong,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.200
I wasn't going to
bite their head off--

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.980
just show them I wasn't
so sensitive about it.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.520
And the first time
I did this was just

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.650
an involuntary reaction,
I couldn't help myself.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.850
I was walking down the
hall toward the AV suite,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:26.760
and the editor happened to be
explaining to her intern what

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.340
all of the adapter cables were.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.740
And she held up the 90s
equivalent of this one

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.700
and said, this is
a female to male.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.230
And I was right outside her
door and I just leaned in

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.330
and I said hey, stop
talking about me!

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.921
And they laughed
and it got around.

00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:48.420
And you know, the summer outing
was a couple of weeks later,

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.590
had a field day with that.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:54.657
So I found that it
really did help.

00:19:54.657 --> 00:19:55.740
I was told it helped, too.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.390
I know this is going to be hard
for a lot of you to imagine,

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.170
but there was no
real internet yet.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.730
You couldn't Google anything.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.200
There was no Google.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.310
So what was formerly
a disadvantage to me

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.470
as I was growing
up and struggling

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.320
to understand what
was going on with me,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.690
and what transgender was--

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.140
it was now an advantage
to me, in that

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.300
I had virtually complete
control over the information.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.130
I would share only
what I wanted people

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.470
to know, and tell
the story my way.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.730
So how was I going to do that?

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.130
Well, I knew the best
way would be for it

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.870
to come from me personally.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.710
Nobody can tell my
story like I can.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.920
And because of my father's
position at the company,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.680
I decided OK, the
first thing, I really

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.642
should tell the executive board.

00:20:55.642 --> 00:20:57.610
I could do a whole
talk on that alone.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.830
But I-- out of respect, I
wanted them to know first.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.250
I did not want
gossip trickling up.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.320
OK, so let's say I tell
the executive board.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.880
What about the rest
of the hundreds

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.290
of people at the agency?

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.630
How are they going to find out?

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.210
I didn't want the board
sending out a memo,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.210
and I was not about to stand
up and call an agency meeting

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.110
and announce it.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.690
And this is where my background
really came in handy.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.680
The big thing at the
time in the business

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.480
was evangelism marketing.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.920
And evangelism marketing is
basically encouraging people

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.610
to take a role in
actively spreading

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.330
the word on your behalf
in a positive way.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.160
Today you'd call
it word of mouth.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.250
It's cooler, doesn't
sound religious,

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.990
but back then it was called
evangelism marketing.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.930
We had just won Volkswagen.
It was a big thing.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.730
And so at Arnold, the big
push was turning consumers

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.600
into brand evangelists
for our clients.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.980
And it hit me, well, why
not turn my coworkers

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.370
into brand evangelists for me?

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.710
And that's what I did.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.470
Before I told the
board, one by one

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.450
I came out to 12 of my
closest friends at the agency,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.230
told them my story
in great detail,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.660
coached them on how to
tell it to other people,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:33.270
had them practice on me,
which was a very good idea.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.380
And then I told them the
date of the board meeting,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.540
and that once it was over
to just go forth and start

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.280
spreading the word.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.950
So the board meeting was a
Monday from 4:00 to 6:00 PM.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.610
And I would say by 11:00
AM the next morning

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.170
the whole agency knew.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.120
The whole advertising
community knew.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.520
People I went--
people outside knew.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.820
It was crazy.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.810
And I can see a lot of
you look nonplussed.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.560
But just remember,
there was no texting.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.230
There was no Snapchat.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.790
There weren't even
any smartphones.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.820
So think about it.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.850
6 PM, workday's over--

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.034
11 AM, two hours
in, everybody knows.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:24.200
Give me some fucking credit.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.530
That was fast, right?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.230
It was a good strategy.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.200
So how did it go over?

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.260
Well I can tell you, it
took all the strength

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.170
I had to force myself to go
into work that next morning

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.490
after the board meeting.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:46.140
I just-- I got drunk the night,
that night after it, and--

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.930
that wasn't why, though.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.750
I just was so nervous to go in.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.530
But I knew if I didn't, people
would think I was ashamed,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.330
and the gossip would just start.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.412
So I forced myself to go in.

00:23:58.412 --> 00:23:59.870
So I was going to
go in, I was just

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.330
going to go in really early--

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.870
8:45, early for a
creative person.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.400
I just wanted to slip into
my office and not see anyone.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.270
I knew there'd be nobody on
the creative floor before 9:00.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.900
And I was right.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.720
So I just sat
there in my office,

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.270
waiting for the unknown.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.560
And about 20 past
9:00, the first person

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.550
showed up at my door
with tears in his eyes,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.150
to tell me how brave
he thought I was.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.770
And then after him, the head
of print production came by.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.042
She's like, all business,
all frazzled all the time,

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:38.250
you know, one of those types.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.060
And she shows up at
my door and, knowing

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.800
I'd be changing my name she
said to me, when you know,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.910
let me know how you want me
to do your new business cards.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.960
I couldn't believe it.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.580
It was like a
parade outside my--

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.850
it was hugs and well
wishes all day--

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.370
so many stories, a lot
of them in the book.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.670
I'll tell you one of them.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.820
This is my favorite one.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.000
One of my buddies who
worked in the art studio

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.220
gave me a bar mitzvah card.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.540
Neither of us is Jewish.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.790
But on the cover it
said, congratulations,

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.740
today you are man.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.150
And because he's
crafty, you know,

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.960
works in the studio
on the inside,

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.610
he customized it to include
all of these guy tips

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.120
he thought I should know.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.150
Like, always look straight ahead
at the urinal, none of that.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.540
I don't want to imply that
everybody acknowledged it

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.140
with me.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.730
That certainly isn't the case.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.280
Most people treated me
like they always did,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.080
which is all I wanted anyway.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.324
But there were-- and there
were some negative reactions.

00:25:46.324 --> 00:25:47.990
I'd be naive to think
there wouldn't be.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.980
But none of them were to
my face, which was great.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.950
And I think having your dad as
the CEO helps in that regard.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.351
But honestly the day could
not have gone better.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:11.361
OK, so I made the announcement,
and then you know what I did?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:11.860
Nothing.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:23.530
I wanted everyone to have time
to sit with it, think about it,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.250
talk about it, get it all
out and get used to the idea

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:32.870
before I made any changes and
started socially transitioning.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.900
So no changes until
I gave it time.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:41.600
And that includes which bathroom
I was going to be using.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.500
Even back then, 20 years
ago, the only thing

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.730
that people at the board and
other people freaked out about

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.130
was my using the men's room.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.980
So I told the board, I thought
this might be an issue.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:04.120
They wanted to send out a memo
and I said absolutely not.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.250
For the first two
weeks, I am not

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:12.160
going to use the men's rooms
or the ladies rooms at Arnold--

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.290
for two weeks, so
don't worry about it.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.440
Probably like, well,
what did you do?

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.330
I would have killed for that set
up, that you guys have there.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.780
That would have
been very helpful.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.480
But there were no gender
neutral or unisex restrooms

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.570
on the eight floors that we had.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:34.250
So what I did, my office--

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.560
I had an interior
office at the time--

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.740
and it had a support beam kind
of right when you walked in,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.890
so there was this
little alcove thing.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:48.200
So I had facilities come
and put a curtain up there.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.955
And then I just had this
bucket, and I would go behind--

00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:54.050
no I didn't, come on.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.180
Come on!

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.850
Come on.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.760
What I did was, I would--

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.670
whenever I had to go, I
would take the elevator down

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.940
14 floors, go out the back,
the lobby, around the corner

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.160
two blocks to Rebecca's
cafe, where they

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.910
had a gender neutral bathroom.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.640
Inconvenient, yes,
especially when

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.090
you have a bladder the
size of a grape like I do.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.060
I've had to pee for
the last 10 minutes.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.120
But I knew it was better
for me and everybody

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.320
else in the long run, just
to get used to the idea.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.450
And I needed to psych
myself up for the idea.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.600
By the way, ladies, it
is a total step down,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.620
the men's room.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.450
You're not missing anything.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.520
But, you know,
when I finally did

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.180
go in there, the first few
times, yeah, people talked.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.360
But it died down really quickly
because there really isn't--

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.410
wasn't anything to say.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.284
You know, I didn't have
outdoor plumbing yet,

00:28:50.284 --> 00:28:52.250
so I was using the stalls.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.100
And unlike guys blatantly
bringing in reading material,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.640
I wasn't making a
day of it in there.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.040
One guy I saw go in with
a Harry Potter book.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.740
Really?

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.030
The theme of my
transition was gradual--

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.970
that was my whole theme.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:14.260
So the physical changes
were all gradual.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.030
I'd always had
short hair, but it

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:20.020
was more of a gender neutral
kind of a nondescript haircut.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.130
I could have just gone
and gotten a buzz cut--

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.330
it was the summer, it was hot
as shit, I'd always wanted one.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.410
But I knew if I made a
drastic change like that,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.760
people would just start talking.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.300
Did you see Chris
got a crew cut?

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.425
It makes his ears look big.

00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:37.008
Uh, he should've--
you know, whatever.

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:38.460
Whatever it is,
a drastic change,

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.790
it would just give people
more fodder to talk.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.270
So instead I cut my
hair shorter and shorter

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.340
in stages over a few months.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.250
Same thing with growing a beard.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.830
I'm Armenian on both sides.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.020
I was on testosterone.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.010
There was hair
growing everywhere.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.770
So if I wanted to grow a beard,
I could have grown a beard.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.670
but-- would I have liked to?

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.980
Yes.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.540
It would have covered up
my newfound acne problem.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.670
There's nothing like going
through male puberty at age 26,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.820
being at CBS, fighting off
all the junior high kids

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.950
for the last tube of Oxy10.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.080
So a beard would
have been nice, but I

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.081
knew if I grew a beard, again,
that would give people more

00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:25.580
to talk.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.590
Oh, there'd probably be
an over under on how long

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.881
it would take, the whole thing.

00:30:28.881 --> 00:30:31.310
So I held off on that.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.450
And the creative department,
anything goes, you know,

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.260
wardrobe code-- dress code,
which actually kind of drew me

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.560
to the job-- to the occupation.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.220
I was wearing jeans,
sneakers, button downs anyway.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.110
So unless there was a
client meeting where

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.620
I had to wear a coat
and tie or something,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.030
my wardrobe changes
were relatively minor.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.105
So all in, by year
two of my transition,

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.730
people were coming
up to me and saying,

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.860
I have no idea what
you used to look like.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.610
And I liken it to--

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.620
it's kind of like when
someone loses a lot of weight.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.400
So if someone loses 25 pounds
and you haven't seen him

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.160
in a year, and then you see
him, and you're like, holy shit!

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.120
Oh, my god!

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.870
But if they're losing two pounds
a month and you're with them

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.480
every day, you kind of don't
notice it while it's-- while

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.230
it's happening.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.650
It's kind of that phenomenon.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:31.670
And finally there's the
surgical part of the transition.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.400
General rule of thumb--

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.720
a lot of you probably
already know this--

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.660
you should never,
ever ask somebody

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.720
who's transgender
whether they've had

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.600
or plan to have surgery.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.020
It's none of your business,
which makes it invasive,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.970
but it's also offensive.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.116
And if you see activists in the
media, they say it's offensive,

00:31:54.116 --> 00:31:54.740
it's offensive.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.750
But no one ever
takes the extra step

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.910
to explain why it's offensive.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.530
Does anyone know
why it's offensive?

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.970
Want me to tell you?

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.240
OK, I'll tell you.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.980
Your gender is not defined
by what's inside your pants.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.610
Your anatomical sex is defined
by what's inside your pants,

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.540
your genitals.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.320
Your gender is defined by
what's inside your brain.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.360
So by asking somebody who's
transgender the surgery

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.410
question, what you're
implying to them

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.140
is that you don't believe
they're the gender

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.250
they affirm they are
unless they have surgery

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.270
to physically alter their body.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.930
Does everyone understand that?

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:45.460
And the fact is, a lot of trans
people never have surgery.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.530
It's individual
decision, everybody

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.850
is different-- it could be
for a number of reasons.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:54.140
A lot of times it's because
you can't afford it.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.900
Now insurance-- at least
in Massachusetts, insurance

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.720
is covering it.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.440
So hopefully that
will be a non factor.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.780
It could be a number
of-- fear, the pain,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.492
it's a lot to go through,
maybe you can't get--

00:33:05.492 --> 00:33:07.700
you don't have the support
or you can't get time off.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.991
Or maybe you're just happy
with your body the way it is

00:33:09.991 --> 00:33:11.330
and it doesn't bother you.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.620
So that is something
you should avoid.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.870
Now if someone like me
is yammering on about it,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.450
then by all means, get
in the conversation.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.360
But you just take your
cues from that person.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.340
For me, my personal
decision was,

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.850
I knew I wanted to have
surgery right from the get go.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.500
It was the only way I was going
to feel complete as a man.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.490
And there was a
time period where--

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:44.980
of five years-- five years
where I had 22 surgeries.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.810
That's one every three months.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.150
The deluxe model
does not come easy.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.030
I can tell you that right now.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.140
But it was worth it.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.000
And that was while I
was managing the largest

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.730
account at the agency.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.240
So I was really happy that
I listened to my therapist.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.130
What was I going to do, make up
22 different stories about why

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.469
I'm out of the office for
weeks at a time, had I gone

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.820
and tried to do this secretly?

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.310
I mean, there was no way.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.639
So it was actually
much less stressful,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.626
for me and everyone
else on my team--

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.000
I had a lot of
people on my team.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.040
And it was great for
them, because they

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.260
knew it was not a
big secret, they

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.290
knew the parameters of
when I could be reached

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.000
and when to leave me alone.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.960
And they actually used
it to their advantage.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.110
They would call
me to present work

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.590
when I was most doped
up on painkillers,

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.139
and God knows what I approved.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.570
I've got to tell you,
I felt bad for Ron.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.100
I had one long term goal when
I set out on this journey,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.770
and that was not to let
my transition define me.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.160
I just wanted to get through
it and be the man I always

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.580
knew myself to be.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:08.220
It took time, and all successful
rebranding campaigns do.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.500
But I think I
achieved that goal.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.950
I am not my parents'
transgender son.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.810
I'm just their son.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.460
My friends don't introduce me
as their trans friend Chris,

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.010
you know--

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.250
just Chris, or
Eddie, or Pee Head,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.810
or whatever they're
going to call me.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.880
And at Arnold, I
wasn't Chris Edwards

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.710
the transgender
creative director.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.010
I was just a creative director.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.590
Well, an EVP group
creative director.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.840
I don't want to
sell myself short.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:42.400
But the word transition
means going from one place

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.030
to another.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.770
And I was here.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:50.360
So for me, if I had to check
a box, I would check male.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.930
I would not check transgender,
or trans man-- some people do.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.140
It's up to you how
you define yourself.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.220
I define myself as male.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.580
Does everyone understand that?

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:11.480
So then came my departure from
Arnold to write this book.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.960
So now I'm kind of back in
this transgender spotlight.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.630
I really felt strongly that
I needed to share this story.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:25.850
My hope, in writing this book,
was that people would read it.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.490
It would be a fun, easy read.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.310
I've been-- from the Amazon
reviews, I'm being told it is.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.575
People are reading it
in one day, six hours.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.450
And as an ad guy,
my goal has always

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.140
been when I do spots, or
videos, or ads of any kind,

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.530
it's to engage and entertain
and wrap that message

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.860
that I want people to walk
away with in something fun

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.540
and engaging.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.560
And that was my--

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.627
what I sought out to
do with this book.

00:36:53.627 --> 00:36:55.460
And the hope was that
people would walk away

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.330
having read it, feeling
empowered and inspired,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.020
because it's a
universal message.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.380
But also walk away with
a better understanding

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.750
of what it means
to be transgender,

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.380
which will hopefully lead
to wider spread acceptance

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.147
as well.

00:37:10.147 --> 00:37:12.230
And that was the goal of
me speaking here with you

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.710
guys today.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.638
So thank you for having me.

00:37:15.638 --> 00:37:17.105
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.880
I am happy to take any
questions you might have--

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.830
anything.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.440
As I said, I've
written a memoir.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.830
It's all out there, all out
on the table, so nothing--

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.160
if you manage to ask something
that is inappropriate,

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.260
which I highly
doubt, I'll tell you

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.170
and we'll make it
a teachable moment.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.330
AUDIENCE: I recently
did a project where

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.840
I was looking for inclusive
images that reflected

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.840
all people, instead of
the straight white males

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.210
that get so much screen time.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.860
And I encountered a challenge
with transgender people,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.510
where I couldn't
answer the question

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.550
about where cross-dressing fit
in on an inclusive spectrum.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.730
Can you give some guidance
to whether cross-dressing

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.280
is something that is
generally considered positive

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.920
for the transgender community,
or whether it's insulting?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.710
Because I could
never figure it out.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.850
CHRIS EDWARDS: I think it
depends on who you ask.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:26.050
But for me, I'd like
people to understand

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:31.250
that cross-dressing is not
related to being transgender.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:37.840
It's something that people
do for other reasons.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.260
They don't-- cross-dressers
don't necessarily feel that

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.090
they are the wrong gender,
they just enjoy exploring being

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.520
the other gender
every now and then.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.370
That's pretty much
what it means to me.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.910
That's the easiest
way that I define it.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:59.080
But I do find that
it confuses people

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.870
who don't understand gender
identity, and it clouds things.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:08.350
So I wish people did
understand better,

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.890
because it is very different.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.180
Does that help?

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.564
Sort of?

00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:14.396
Hi.

00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:15.770
AUDIENCE: Hey,
Chris, great talk.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.100
CHRIS EDWARDS: Thank you.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.558
AUDIENCE: Let me know if this
is an inappropriate question.

00:39:18.558 --> 00:39:21.840
Do you think there's more
stigma for transitions

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.550
that are male to female,
rather than female to male?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.740
Do you have any insights?

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.340
CHRIS EDWARDS: So by
stigma, do you mean that--

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.570
what do you mean by stigma?

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.403
I'm just trying to--

00:39:34.403 --> 00:39:35.800
AUDIENCE: That's
a good question.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.482
I feel like-- maybe I
could phrase it as--

00:39:39.482 --> 00:39:40.940
CHRIS EDWARDS: Are
not as accepted?

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.770
AUDIENCE: People might question
the motives more deeply on male

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.390
to female, than female to male?

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.002
Maybe that's a good
way to phrase it.

00:39:49.002 --> 00:39:51.210
Again, let me know if this
is an inappropriate topic.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.510
CHRIS EDWARDS: No, it's not
an inappropriate question.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.460
I just don't know if
I'm the authority on it.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.040
But what I would
say is, I do feel

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.550
that you probably-- a lot of
people ask me, do more men

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:08.180
transition to women, than
women transitioning to men?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.310
Because that's
pretty much what you

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.590
see the most of in the media.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.550
And there's a saying--

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.260
let me make sure
I get this right--

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:27.000
female to male, pass
better on the streets,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.320
male to female pass
better under the sheets.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.810
This is a saying
that is out there.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:39.900
And what that means
is, it's a bit easier

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.160
to be a woman transitioning
male physically, to pass.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.070
And just so you guys
know, the term passing

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.290
can be considered
offensive by some people,

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.990
because that word implies
you're pulling something

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.960
over on somebody--
you're faking.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.197
So a lot of trans people
are bothered by that term.

00:40:58.197 --> 00:41:00.280
Like if you say, oh, my
god, you pass really well,

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.180
I'd never be able to tell.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.850
Some people would
be offended by that.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.830
I'm not, but some people are.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:12.380
So adult men who
transition female,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.890
it's very hard
sometimes to pass.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:20.510
Your body is already developed,
and your features are set.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.830
And it's very hard for
some people to pass.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:33.980
So I think that is why trans
women are targeted more

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.660
with violence.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.243
It's terrible.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.772
I would hope--

00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:40.730
I would think, and people
have said this to me,

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.271
if I'm walking down
the street, you'd

00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:43.670
just think I was a short guy.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.650
You wouldn't necessarily jump
to, he's trans, he tran--

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:47.750
you know, you wouldn't.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.450
But-- and I'm thankful for that.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:58.250
But I think that for people
who are challenged by passing,

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.927
that stigmatizes them in a way.

00:41:59.927 --> 00:42:00.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.480
And I realize that
my question has

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.157
kind of a gender binary
assumption built into it,

00:42:05.157 --> 00:42:05.990
which is obviously--

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.680
CHRIS EDWARDS: That's
a whole nother--

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.210
AUDIENCE: A whole lot
of discussion, exactly.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.560
I just wanted to
acknowledge that.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.340
But thank you for the answer.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.300
CHRIS EDWARDS: Sure.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.000
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, when you

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.150
told the boards about
your transition,

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.340
were they concerned that
any of your customers

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.380
might react weirdly?

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.330
I can see that in a
creative community,

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.210
people were much more accepting
because, like anything's

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.780
possible.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.654
CHRIS EDWARDS: Right.

00:42:27.654 --> 00:42:30.840
AUDIENCE: But outside businesses
and German, Volkswagen--

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.360
I'm German, I can say that--

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.480
they might be a little
stiff and say, what?

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.300
I don't-- what?

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.290
I don't get it.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.380
Let's go somewhere else.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.171
CHRIS EDWARDS: Yep.

00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:39.930
That's a good question.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.840
The answer to that was--

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.460
is, when I told them,
it did not come up.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:52.790
And at the time, I was
not like a big shot

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.110
person who had all this
client facing time.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.420
I was two years in as a writer.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.380
So I had some clients that
I would meet with in person.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.630
A lot of them were on the phone.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.220
And the account directors who
came to see me when they heard,

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.740
would come in and say, OK, how
should we tell the clients?

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.780
How do you want to
go about doing it?

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.450
No one said to
me, oh, no, you're

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.790
going to-- we're going to
lose business because of you.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.924
Now granted, I wasn't
working on Volkswagen.

00:43:21.924 --> 00:43:24.090
So I don't know how the
Germans would have taken it.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.620
But I think being
a creative person,

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.590
you do have that flexibility.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.830
People are a little
more accepting.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.540
Since the book came
out, I get e-mails

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.820
from a lot of
people, some of whom

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.850
are transgender and looking
for my humble advice.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:45.770
And one of-- a lot of them work
at very conservative companies

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.230
and are asking me
for guidance there.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.245
And so I was very lucky
that I worked in a liberal--

00:43:52.245 --> 00:43:57.180
I'm in a liberal state, and
I work in a liberal industry.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.560
And I had job security,
which a lot of trans people--

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.700
most of them do not have.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.830
But the one thing I
had going for me was,

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.650
I knew I couldn't get fired.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.670
My dad's not going to fire
me, so that was something

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.279
that I had going for me.

00:44:12.279 --> 00:44:13.570
Does that answer your question?

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:13.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:14.180
Thank you.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.763
AUDIENCE: Where did
you find resources

00:44:15.763 --> 00:44:17.600
about being trans especially?

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.100
Like, I know at
least my coming out

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.860
story is so much defined
by using the internet

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.840
at like, 2:00 AM on bad days.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.960
But considering not only
was there not the internet,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.820
but trans was only really being
used in academic journals--

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.695
CHRIS EDWARDS: Right.

00:44:30.695 --> 00:44:33.200
AUDIENCE: --like, '93,
where did you find resources

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.650
to help understand
yourselves and help

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.980
find resources to help you
transition and accept yourself?

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.950
CHRIS EDWARDS: That's
a great question.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.110
And part of me is struggling
because, to answer it,

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.150
I'm going to give away
something in the book.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.550
But do you want me
to give it away?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.570
Yeah, all right.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:54.680
So there was nowhere, OK.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.440
I would go to the
library, sneak around,

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.450
try to figure out
the card catalog.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:01.292
I don't know if you
even know what that is.

00:45:01.292 --> 00:45:02.750
And then you'd get
there, and you'd

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.208
get to where it's supposed to
be, and the book's not there.

00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:08.150
And it would be some
type of medical journal

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.830
that just had a definition.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.080
It didn't have anything.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.760
So I couldn't find anything.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:20.420
So what I did was, in "The
Silence of the Lambs," Lecter,

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.980
when he's telling Starling
the history of Buffalo Bill,

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.370
he mentions three places where
there are gender clinics.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:31.100
So I looked those up.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:37.670
I think I was able to go in the
library and find phone numbers.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.350
And I was living at
home at the time.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.660
So I'd be so scared.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.200
I'd have to do it when no one
was around, get on the phone

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.270
and call these places
and say, can you

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:52.640
send me some information
from your clinic?

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.050
So my therapist at the
time, who is not the one I

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.280
was talking to you about--

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.810
this was a different
one that I saw

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.520
first, who had no experience.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.651
She says, send them to my
office and you can pick them up.

00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:05.150
Don't worry.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.370
I mean, I don't want an envelope
that says, Center for Gender

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:10.010
Reassignment, you know, and my
mom gets the mail and is like,

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.820
what?

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.130
So I had it sent to her office.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.270
And she'd call me to tell
me I could pick them up

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.340
when they came in and
I went to get them.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.260
And the envelopes
were all opened.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.610
And I'm like, who opened these?

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.620
She goes, I did.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.090
I'm like, bitch.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.365
And she's like, well,
I figured, if we're

00:46:31.365 --> 00:46:32.740
going to talk
about it, we should

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.260
know the same information.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.970
And I was like, you whore.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.430
So I am in the car.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.330
I am so mad.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.441
And I get home.

00:46:41.441 --> 00:46:43.690
And I'm just about-- and I'm
trying to rationalize it.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:46.660
I'm like, OK, it's a federal
offense, what she just did.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.770
But I understand if she's
trying to be helpful.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.620
Then I pull the packets out.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:57.640
And she has taken the liberty
of highlighting everything

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.660
negative, or risky, or scary.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.780
And keep in mind you
guys, there was--

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.310
you couldn't print anything out.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.200
That was all I had.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.070
So whenever I photocopied
it, her highlights

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.810
are there for
everyone else that I'm

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:15.700
trying to share something with.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.630
The only other information
I had was a great article

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:23.590
that was in an issue
of "The New Yorker."

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.730
And I saved that and
I photocopied that.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.330
And that was a tool
that I used when

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.430
I was telling people and
coaching people on how

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.480
to tell other people.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.890
And I'd say, give them
this article, and use that.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.940
But it was tough.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.710
It was tough.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.890
Nowadays, there is so
much information out

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.120
there it's crazy.

00:47:46.347 --> 00:47:47.930
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a second question?

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.052
CHRIS EDWARDS: Yes.

00:47:49.052 --> 00:47:50.510
AUDIENCE: Thinking
back of when you

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:54.740
were a little child, five years
old and your grandma said,

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.360
sorry, kid, you can't be a man.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.235
CHRIS EDWARDS: Right.

00:47:57.235 --> 00:47:59.480
AUDIENCE: Would you-- my
daughter is 3 and 1/2,

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.150
almost four, and I was thinking,
if she came up to me saying I

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.850
want to be a boy, I
would put it off as, OK,

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:08.030
she's saying this like,
I want to be a fish, or--

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.590
you know, it's just one--

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.090
CHRIS EDWARDS:
There's a difference.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:17.050
There's a difference between
saying I want to be, and I am.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.130
OK, so this is a big thing now.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.820
There's a lot of people--

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.760
both sides on, are kids
transitioning too young?

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.930
What's going on here?

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:32.540
And you look for persistence,
insistence, and consistency

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.700
with kids.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.090
And if a child is saying I
am a boy, I am-- it's not,

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:38.930
I want to be a boy.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:39.890
Why do you want to be a boy?

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.710
Well, boys get to play
football, and I love football.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.530
I mean, it could be
a number of reasons.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:48.500
But when it's I am, and they're
very adamant and insistent,

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.960
and it doesn't change?

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.130
That's when you know, OK,
something might be going on.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.394
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:55.394 --> 00:48:56.780
CHRIS EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.710
Hi.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.410
AUDIENCE: You tell a really
compelling personal story,

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.850
and I find it very fascinating.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:05.130
I also find it very political.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:08.610
You look at what was done
at South Carolina's HB2,

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.040
for example, and the way
they spoke about it-- it's

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.380
very different than your
story about knowing at age 5

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.860
that something is seriously
wrong, fundamentally

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.020
wrong with you.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.240
Although not knowing how to--

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.830
CHRIS EDWARDS: I wouldn't say--

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.371
I would never say
to someone, there's

00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:23.080
something mentally
wrong with you.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.330
AUDIENCE: I didn't say
mentally, I said fundamentally.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.705
CHRIS EDWARDS:
Oh, fundamentally.

00:49:26.705 --> 00:49:29.580
I didn't hear the fun.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.350
I missed the fun in fundamental.

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:32.490
OK.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.160
AUDIENCE: So how
would you tackle that?

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:41.460
How would you reach those people
who are so very opposed to--

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.837
caricature or--

00:49:42.837 --> 00:49:43.920
CHRIS EDWARDS: Stereotype.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.780
AUDIENCE: --stereotype
of what you went through?

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.238
CHRIS EDWARDS: This
is the problem.

00:49:47.238 --> 00:49:48.090
So--

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.506
AUDIENCE: You were
in advertising.

00:49:49.506 --> 00:49:51.060
You have some tools
for this, right?

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.550
CHRIS EDWARDS: Yeah,
well, here's the thing.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.430
I am not an activist.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.420
That's not my deal.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.920
So I'm on the board of greater
Boston PFLAG, and I help--

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.790
the way I help the caused
by sharing personal stories.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.910
To me, that's how you
change minds, right?

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.170
It's very different.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.270
It's very hard to hate someone.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.740
Like, could you hate me
after you heard my story?

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.330
It's very hard, when someone
shares that personal thing,

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.100
and for someone to hate them.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:24.090
And it's-- I find that people
retain the message and learn

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:27.660
better relating to
somebody's personal story,

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.070
rather than sitting them
down and saying, OK,

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.690
here's a gender 101 class,
or read this pamphlet.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:38.460
And so for me, that's how
I help-- sharing my story,

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.450
writing this book.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.340
I would send them my book.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.910
But I'm not going to be the one
out there lobbying with signs.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.360
That's not me.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.090
There are plenty
of other people who

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:50.690
do that for the
community, but that--

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.370
that isn't me.

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.930
And a lot of people
ask me that question.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.720
But I think that
you just have to do

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.960
what you feel comfortable
doing, and I am not

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.910
comfortable doing that.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:07.510
So I try to help in other ways.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.190
So there's-- and I'm involved in
organizations that are involved

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:12.010
in all of that.

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.030
And I help them
with their websites.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.630
And I do all kinds
of stuff for them.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:21.020
But this is, for me, being
on the front line, that's--

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.450
the activism is not
really my thing.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.480
But it is unfortunate,
because that's--

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.900
these ignorant people
that are making these laws

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.060
they're dropping it
down to the bathroom

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.640
and how oh, they're
all perverts!

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.260
All the trans
people are perverts!

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.468
And they're going to molest
everyone in the bathroom.

00:51:39.468 --> 00:51:43.410
There's never been one instance
of that ever happening.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:48.570
But, you know, they go on fear.

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:49.170
Thank you.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.320
[APPLAUSE]
