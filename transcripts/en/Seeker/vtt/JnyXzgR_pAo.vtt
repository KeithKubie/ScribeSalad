Phantom Vibrations! What are… *pause* Hold
on, my phone’s buzzing. *looks at phone*

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.180
UGH, GOT ME AGAIN.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.180
Hey guys! I’m Chastity, the Associate Producer
for DNews. Have you ever thought your phone

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.360
was vibrating when it really wasn’t? Relax
- you’re not going crazy. As it turns out,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.290
most of us have!

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.470
They’re called phantom vibrations, and they’re
a common phenomenon since the turn of the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
mobile age. These sensory hallucinations are
so common that researchers have done studies

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.860
devoted to finding out what the heck is going
on here.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.589
The British Medical Journal conducted the
first survey on phantom vibrations in 2010,

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.920
asking hospital workers about their experience.
68% of them reported reaching out for their

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.749
phones when they weren’t ringing, on either
a weekly or monthly basis.

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.920
The cause of these vibrations wasn’t made
clear, but the researchers suspect our minds

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.289
are playing tricks on us. We deal with an
overwhelming amount of sensory input, which

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.940
is only made worse by our attachment to our
phones. To cope with that, our brains apply

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.149
filters based on what they expect to find.
So when we anticipate a call or text, our

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.049
brains might misinterpret sensations -Like
for example, pressure from clothing, or muscle

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.510
contractions, resulting in phantom vibrations.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.070
In the case of the hospital workers study,
this reason makes a lot of sense. Medical

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.050
professionals are expected to carry mobile
devices and constantly be on call, so it’s

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.970
no surprise that they reported phantom vibrations
occurring so frequently.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.920
In 2012, a study published in Computers in
Human Behavior looked at the prevalence of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.880
phantom vibrations among college undergrads.
89% of the students reported perceived vibrations

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.890
from their phones, and they experienced them
about once every two weeks, on average.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.630
This study took it a step further and looked
at emotional reactions to the phantom vibrations.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.420
Overall, few of the undergrads were bothered
by them. But those who did find them annoying

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.160
were rated higher in the emotional reaction
scale of text message dependence.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.620
According to CSU psychologist Dr. Larry Rosen,
phantom vibrations stem from a compulsive,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.670
obsessive behavior we have with our phones.
With smartphones, we’re constantly connected

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.600
to our network, family, and friends, and this
ever-present connection might be responsible

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.430
for the fake vibrations. Dr. Rosen recommends
weaning ourselves away from our phones for

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490
short periods, like 30 minutes to an hour.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.680
The takeaway here is that these phantom vibrations?
They’re all in your mind. If they start

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.060
to bother you, take more phone breaks. Cut
down on social media check-ins, stay off your

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.750
phone during dinner and especially during
face-to-face conversations. That’s just

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.630
bad manners.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.620
How often do you have phantom vibrations?
Let us know in the comments below, and I’ll

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.090
see you next time. Thanks for watching!
