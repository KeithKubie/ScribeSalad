one of the other things I've learned as

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
one of the other things I've learned as
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.160
one of the other things I've learned as
a social scientist and I've been warned

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
a social scientist and I've been warned
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.350
a social scientist and I've been warned
about this by I would say great social

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
about this by I would say great social
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.610
about this by I would say great social
scientists that you want to be very

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
scientists that you want to be very
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.269
scientists that you want to be very
careful about doing large-scale

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279
careful about doing large-scale
 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.439
careful about doing large-scale
experimentation with large scale systems

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
experimentation with large scale systems
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.050
experimentation with large scale systems
because the probability that if you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
because the probability that if you
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140
because the probability that if you
implement a scheme in a large-scale

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
implement a scheme in a large-scale
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.210
implement a scheme in a large-scale
social system that that scheme will have

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
social system that that scheme will have
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.900
social system that that scheme will have
the result you intended is negligible

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910
the result you intended is negligible
 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.070
the result you intended is negligible
what will happen will be something that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
what will happen will be something that
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020
what will happen will be something that
you don't intend and even worse

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
you don't intend and even worse
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540
you don't intend and even worse
something that works at counter purposes

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
something that works at counter purposes
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.770
something that works at counter purposes
to your original intent and so and that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
to your original intent and so and that
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170
to your original intent and so and that
that makes sense because if you have a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
that makes sense because if you have a
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.779
that makes sense because if you have a
very very complex system and you perturb

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
very very complex system and you perturb
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.360
very very complex system and you perturb
it the probability that you can predict

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
it the probability that you can predict
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010
it the probability that you can predict
the consequence of the perturbation is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
the consequence of the perturbation is
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.209
the consequence of the perturbation is
extraordinary low obviously if the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
extraordinary low obviously if the
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799
extraordinary low obviously if the
system works though you think you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
system works though you think you
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.930
system works though you think you
understand it because it works and so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
understand it because it works and so
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340
understand it because it works and so
you think it's simpler than it actually

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
you think it's simpler than it actually
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.369
you think it's simpler than it actually
is and so then you think that your model

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
is and so then you think that your model
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869
is and so then you think that your model
of it is correct and then you think that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
of it is correct and then you think that
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840
of it is correct and then you think that
your manipulation of the model which

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
your manipulation of the model which
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.840
your manipulation of the model which
produces the outcome you model will be

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
produces the outcome you model will be
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760
produces the outcome you model will be
the outcome that's actually produced in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
the outcome that's actually produced in
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.230
the outcome that's actually produced in
the world that doesn't work at all I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240
the world that doesn't work at all I
 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.350
the world that doesn't work at all I
thought about that an awful lot thinking

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
thought about that an awful lot thinking
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270
thought about that an awful lot thinking
about how to remediate social systems

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
about how to remediate social systems
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.570
about how to remediate social systems
because obviously they need careful

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
because obviously they need careful
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.060
because obviously they need careful
attention and adjustment and it struck

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
attention and adjustment and it struck
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.469
attention and adjustment and it struck
me that the proper strategy for

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
me that the proper strategy for
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.240
me that the proper strategy for
implementing social change is to stay

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
implementing social change is to stay
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.359
implementing social change is to stay
within your domain of competence and

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369
within your domain of competence and
 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.999
within your domain of competence and
that requires humility which is a virtue

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
that requires humility which is a virtue
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.490
that requires humility which is a virtue
that is never promoted in modern culture

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
that is never promoted in modern culture
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.580
that is never promoted in modern culture
I would say it's it's a virtue that you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
I would say it's it's a virtue that you
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.039
I would say it's it's a virtue that you
can hardly even talk about but humility

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
can hardly even talk about but humility
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.440
can hardly even talk about but humility
means you're probably not as smart as

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
means you're probably not as smart as
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330
means you're probably not as smart as
you think you are and you should be

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
you think you are and you should be
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310
you think you are and you should be
careful and so then the question might

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
careful and so then the question might
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440
careful and so then the question might
be well okay you should be careful but

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
be well okay you should be careful but
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.260
be well okay you should be careful but
perhaps you still want to do good you

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
perhaps you still want to do good you
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.730
perhaps you still want to do good you
want to make some positive changes how

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
want to make some positive changes how
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010
want to make some positive changes how
can you be careful and do good and then

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
can you be careful and do good and then
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749
can you be careful and do good and then
I would say well you try not to step

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
I would say well you try not to step
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.889
I would say well you try not to step
outside of the boundaries of your

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
outside of the boundaries of your
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.010
outside of the boundaries of your
competence and you start small and you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
competence and you start small and you
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.790
competence and you start small and you
start with things that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
start with things that
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170
start with things that
you actually could adjust that you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
you actually could adjust that you
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.790
you actually could adjust that you
actually do understand that you actually

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
actually do understand that you actually
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.130
actually do understand that you actually
could fix I mentioned to you at one

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
could fix I mentioned to you at one
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.570
could fix I mentioned to you at one
point that one of the things Carl Jung

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
point that one of the things Carl Jung
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.140
point that one of the things Carl Jung
said was that modern men don't see God

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
said was that modern men don't see God
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240
said was that modern men don't see God
because they don't look low enough it's

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
because they don't look low enough it's
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.240
because they don't look low enough it's
a very interesting phrase and one of the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250
a very interesting phrase and one of the
 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610
a very interesting phrase and one of the
things that I've been promoting I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
things that I've been promoting I
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.810
things that I've been promoting I
suppose online is the idea that you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820
suppose online is the idea that you
 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.760
suppose online is the idea that you
should restrict your attempts to fix

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
should restrict your attempts to fix
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.650
should restrict your attempts to fix
things to what's at hand so there's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
things to what's at hand so there's
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.090
things to what's at hand so there's
probably things about you that you could

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
probably things about you that you could
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.740
probably things about you that you could
fix right things that you know that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
fix right things that you know that
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.490
fix right things that you know that
aren't right

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
aren't right
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.130
aren't right
not anyone else's opinion your own

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
not anyone else's opinion your own
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.450
not anyone else's opinion your own
opinion that aren't right you can fix

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460
opinion that aren't right you can fix
 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.710
opinion that aren't right you can fix
them maybe there's some things that you

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
them maybe there's some things that you
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360
them maybe there's some things that you
could adjust in your family although

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
could adjust in your family although
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430
could adjust in your family although
that gets hard you have to have your act

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
that gets hard you have to have your act
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.930
that gets hard you have to have your act
together a lot before you can start to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
together a lot before you can start to
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.550
together a lot before you can start to
adjust your family because things can

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
adjust your family because things can
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.990
adjust your family because things can
kick back on you really hard and you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
kick back on you really hard and you
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.970
kick back on you really hard and you
think well it's hard to put yourself

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
think well it's hard to put yourself
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.740
think well it's hard to put yourself
together it's really hard to put your

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
together it's really hard to put your
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.360
together it's really hard to put your
family together why the hell do you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
family together why the hell do you
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.790
family together why the hell do you
think you can put the world together

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800
think you can put the world together
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.930
think you can put the world together
right because obviously the world is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940
right because obviously the world is
 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.220
right because obviously the world is
more complicated than you and your

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
more complicated than you and your
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.920
more complicated than you and your
family and so if you if you're stymied

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930
family and so if you if you're stymied
 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.360
family and so if you if you're stymied
in your attempts even to set your own

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
in your attempts even to set your own
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.460
in your attempts even to set your own
house in order which of course you are

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
house in order which of course you are
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.320
house in order which of course you are
then you would think that what that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
then you would think that what that
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150
then you would think that what that
would do would be to make you very very

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
would do would be to make you very very
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.820
would do would be to make you very very
leery about announcing your broad-scale

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830
leery about announcing your broad-scale
 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.710
leery about announcing your broad-scale
plans for social revolution well it's a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
plans for social revolution well it's a
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.270
plans for social revolution well it's a
peculiar thing because that isn't how it

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
peculiar thing because that isn't how it
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.410
peculiar thing because that isn't how it
works because people are much more

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
works because people are much more
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.479
works because people are much more
likely to announce their plans for

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
likely to announce their plans for
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.910
likely to announce their plans for
broad-scale social revolution than they

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
broad-scale social revolution than they
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.590
broad-scale social revolution than they
are to try to set themselves straight or

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
are to try to set themselves straight or
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.510
are to try to set themselves straight or
to set their family straight and I think

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520
to set their family straight and I think
 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.190
to set their family straight and I think
the reason for that is that as soon as

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
the reason for that is that as soon as
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.810
the reason for that is that as soon as
they try to set themselves straight or

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
they try to set themselves straight or
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.520
they try to set themselves straight or
their families the system immediately

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
their families the system immediately
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.490
their families the system immediately
kicks back at them right instantly

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
kicks back at them right instantly
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.229
kicks back at them right instantly
whereas if they announced their plans

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
whereas if they announced their plans
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.199
whereas if they announced their plans
for large-scale social revolution the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
for large-scale social revolution the
 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.870
for large-scale social revolution the
lag between the announcement and the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
lag between the announcement and the
 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.780
lag between the announcement and the
kickback is so long that they don't

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
kickback is so long that they don't
 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.729
kickback is so long that they don't
recognize that there's any error there

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
recognize that there's any error there
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.130
recognize that there's any error there
and so you know you can get away with

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140
and so you know you can get away with
 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.400
and so you know you can get away with
being wrong if if nothing falls on you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
being wrong if if nothing falls on you
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.930
being wrong if if nothing falls on you
for a while and so and it's also an

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
for a while and so and it's also an
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.330
for a while and so and it's also an
incitement to hubris because you can

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
incitement to hubris because you can
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.580
incitement to hubris because you can
Ouse yours your plans for large-scale

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
Ouse yours your plans for large-scale
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.890
Ouse yours your plans for large-scale
social revolution and stand back and you

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900
social revolution and stand back and you
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.420
social revolution and stand back and you
don't get hit by lightning and you think

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
don't get hit by lightning and you think
 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.670
don't get hit by lightning and you think
well I might be right even though you're

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680
well I might be right even though you're
 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.909
well I might be right even though you're
not you're seriously not right I might

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
not you're seriously not right I might
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.710
not you're seriously not right I might
be right and then you think well

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720
be right and then you think well
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.750
be right and then you think well
how wonderful is that especially if you

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
how wonderful is that especially if you
 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.550
how wonderful is that especially if you
could do it without any real effort and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560
could do it without any real effort and
 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.860
could do it without any real effort and
I really do think fundamentally I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870
I really do think fundamentally I
 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.420
I really do think fundamentally I
believe that that's what the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430
believe that that's what the
 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.370
believe that that's what the
universities teach students now that's

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380
universities teach students now that's
 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.350
universities teach students now that's
what they teach them to do I really

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360
what they teach them to do I really
 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.210
what they teach them to do I really
believe that and I think it's absolutely

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220
believe that and I think it's absolutely
 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.350
believe that and I think it's absolutely
appalling and I think it's horribly

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
appalling and I think it's horribly
 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.470
appalling and I think it's horribly
dangerous because it's not that easy to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480
dangerous because it's not that easy to
 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.090
dangerous because it's not that easy to
fix things especially if you don't

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100
fix things especially if you don't
 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.050
fix things especially if you don't
especially if you're not committed to it

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060
especially if you're not committed to it
 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.390
especially if you're not committed to it
and I think you know if you're committed

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400
and I think you know if you're committed
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.650
and I think you know if you're committed
because what you try to do is you try to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660
because what you try to do is you try to
 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.210
because what you try to do is you try to
straighten out your own life first and

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220
straighten out your own life first and
 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.460
straighten out your own life first and
that's enough there's a I think it's a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470
that's enough there's a I think it's a
 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.900
that's enough there's a I think it's a
statement in the New Testament that it's

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910
statement in the New Testament that it's
 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.430
statement in the New Testament that it's
I think it's in the New Testament that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
I think it's in the New Testament that
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.930
I think it's in the New Testament that
it's more difficult to rule yourself

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940
it's more difficult to rule yourself
 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.590
it's more difficult to rule yourself
than to rule the city and that's not a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600
than to rule the city and that's not a
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.020
than to rule the city and that's not a
metaphor it's like all of you who've

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030
metaphor it's like all of you who've
 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.920
metaphor it's like all of you who've
made announcements to yourself about

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930
made announcements to yourself about
 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.000
made announcements to yourself about
changing your diet and going to the gym

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010
changing your diet and going to the gym
 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.909
changing your diet and going to the gym
every January know perfectly well how

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919
every January know perfectly well how
 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.620
every January know perfectly well how
difficult it is to regulate your own

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
difficult it is to regulate your own
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.670
difficult it is to regulate your own
impulses and to bring yourself under the

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680
impulses and to bring yourself under the
 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.530
impulses and to bring yourself under the
control of some what would you say

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540
control of some what would you say
 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.500
control of some what would you say
well-structured and ethical attentive

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510
well-structured and ethical attentive
 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.780
well-structured and ethical attentive
structure of values it's extraordinarily

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790
structure of values it's extraordinarily
 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.520
structure of values it's extraordinarily
difficult and so people don't do it and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530
difficult and so people don't do it and
 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.520
difficult and so people don't do it and
then instead they wander off and I think

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530
then instead they wander off and I think
 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.580
then instead they wander off and I think
they create towers of Babel and the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
they create towers of Babel and the
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.950
they create towers of Babel and the
story indicates well those things

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
story indicates well those things
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.170
story indicates well those things
collapse under their own weight and

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180
collapse under their own weight and
 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.890
collapse under their own weight and
everyone goes their own direction I

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900
everyone goes their own direction I
 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.010
everyone goes their own direction I
think I see that happening with the LGBT

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020
think I see that happening with the LGBT
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.100
think I see that happening with the LGBT
community I think because one of the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110
community I think because one of the
 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.180
community I think because one of the
things I've noticed it's very

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
things I've noticed it's very
 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.390
things I've noticed it's very
interesting because the community is

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400
interesting because the community is
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.290
interesting because the community is
some sense it's not a community but

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300
some sense it's not a community but
 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.200
some sense it's not a community but
that's a technical error but it's it's

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
that's a technical error but it's it's
 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.860
that's a technical error but it's it's
composed of outsiders let's say and what

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870
composed of outsiders let's say and what
 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.450
composed of outsiders let's say and what
you notice across the decades is that

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460
you notice across the decades is that
 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.290
you notice across the decades is that
the acronym list keeps growing and I

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300
the acronym list keeps growing and I
 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.000
the acronym list keeps growing and I
think that's because there's an infinite

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010
think that's because there's an infinite
 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.490
think that's because there's an infinite
number of ways to be an outsider and so

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500
number of ways to be an outsider and so
 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.620
number of ways to be an outsider and so
once you open the door to the

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630
once you open the door to the
 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.360
once you open the door to the
construction of a group that's

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370
construction of a group that's
 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.890
construction of a group that's
characterized by failing to fit into the

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900
characterized by failing to fit into the
 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.409
characterized by failing to fit into the
group then you immediately create a

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419
group then you immediately create a
 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.240
group then you immediately create a
category that's infinitely expandable

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250
category that's infinitely expandable
 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.150
category that's infinitely expandable
and so I don't know how long the acronym

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160
and so I don't know how long the acronym
 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.540
and so I don't know how long the acronym
list

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550
list
 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.820
list
is now it depends on which acronym list

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830
is now it depends on which acronym list
 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.020
is now it depends on which acronym list
you consult but I've seen lists of 10 or

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030
you consult but I've seen lists of 10 or
 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.360
you consult but I've seen lists of 10 or
more acronyms and one of the things

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370
more acronyms and one of the things
 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.240
more acronyms and one of the things
that's happening is that the community

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
that's happening is that the community
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.750
that's happening is that the community
is starting to fragment in its in its

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760
is starting to fragment in its in its
 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.990
is starting to fragment in its in its
interior because there is no unity once

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000
interior because there is no unity once
 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.520
interior because there is no unity once
you put a sufficient plurality under the

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530
you put a sufficient plurality under the
 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.860
you put a sufficient plurality under the
sheltering structure of a single

sheltering structure of a single

sheltering structure of a single
umbrella say the disunity starts to

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010
umbrella say the disunity starts to
 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.560
umbrella say the disunity starts to
appear within and I think that's also a

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570
appear within and I think that's also a
 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.120

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130
it's a manifestation of the same issue
 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.650
it's a manifestation of the same issue
that this particular story is dealing

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
that this particular story is dealing
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:27.140
that this particular story is dealing
with so that ends I would say the most

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150
with so that ends I would say the most
 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.450
with so that ends I would say the most
archaic stories in the in the Bible

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460
archaic stories in the in the Bible
 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.620
archaic stories in the in the Bible
there's something about the flood story

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630
there's something about the flood story
 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.750
there's something about the flood story
and and also the Tower of Babel I think

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760
and and also the Tower of Babel I think
 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.770
and and also the Tower of Babel I think
they outlined the two fundamental

they outlined the two fundamental

they outlined the two fundamental
dangers that beset mankind one is the

dangers that beset mankind one is the

dangers that beset mankind one is the
probability that blindness and sin will

probability that blindness and sin will
 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.460
probability that blindness and sin will
produce a natural catastrophe or entice

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.470
produce a natural catastrophe or entice
 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.890
produce a natural catastrophe or entice
one that's something modern people are

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900
