they may have an increased likelihood of

they may have an increased likelihood of
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.050
they may have an increased likelihood of
becoming dependent on alcohol why that's

other biological modular markers but
we're not real sure but we certainly

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
we're not real sure but we certainly
 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.030
we're not real sure but we certainly
think that they may have an increased

think that they may have an increased
 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.749
think that they may have an increased
likelihood and then there are of course

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759
likelihood and then there are of course
 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.350
likelihood and then there are of course
there are important social factors doing
