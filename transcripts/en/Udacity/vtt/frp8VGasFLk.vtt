00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In opinion polls, we often report a margin of error.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Something like this margin of error is the same as the confidence interval width.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Usually, the margin of error in polls is stated at the 95% level.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Consider two candidates. In our poll, candidate A has 55 supporters.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Candidate B has only 45 supporters.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Please tell me what we would report as the results of the poll.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Percentage of support for candidate A plus or minus the margin of error at 95% confidence.
