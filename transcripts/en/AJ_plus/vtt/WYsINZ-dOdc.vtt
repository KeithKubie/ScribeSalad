00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300
Apple, Amazon, and Google:

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.405
They get you your phones, your packages and, well, allow you to search weird things on the internet.

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:11.200
But these companies are all synonymous with one other thing: jobs.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.020
Lots and lots of jobs!

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.300
But what’s the economic, social and political impact of thousands of people

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.960
moving into a town to work for one company?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.560
Hi guys, I'm Omar, and this Sunday we're looking at how cities try to attract big companies

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.220
- and how that can sometimes help and sometimes hurt the people who live there.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.200
OK, so in case you haven’t heard,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.980
Amazon – led by the richest man in modern history, Jeff Bezos,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.540
has been on the hunt for a second corporate headquarters, otherwise known as HQ2.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.980
And, well, despite being a
somewhat open process it's been..

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.260
one hot mess, to put it bluntly. This is only the sixth big public auction in US history.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.940
It provoked 238 bids, including many from places that don't have a prayer,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.780
that did not meet the original criteria.”

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.640
If you're wondering why so many cities applied to host Amazon's second headquarters,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.260
it's because, well, it potentially means tens of thousands of new high-paying jobs.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.400
It also means five billion dollars to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
local companies who will be charged with
building the structures, hiring people

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
who will then get paid, and contribute to
small businesses across the city.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.100
All-in-all, HQ2's presence could really
help the economic growth of the winning city.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.820
By its own projection, Amazon added
$38 billion in value to the Seattle economy.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.620
This year, Amazon narrowed its list of finalists down to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.800
20 cities, which included Boston, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Los Angeles, Columbus and Miami.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.200
These cities have tried to attract Amazon by flaunting

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.740
their modern transportation systems and
available housing infrastructure,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.480
as well as their cultural, educational and
financial institutions.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.520
Some cities like Boston have even reimagined entire neighborhoods to make way for HQ2.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
Check out this video that Boston submitted with its bid:

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.120
Sounds great, right? Except Amazon might
be looking for a whole lot more than that,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.640
in the form of tax incentives from
those competing cities.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.226
They've been told that you need to offer long-term,

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:17.239
deep tax discounts, property-tax abatements

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.360
sales-tax exemptions, income-tax credits

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.400
companies are like people, they, they pay

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.660
three main kinds of taxes - income sales
and property, and in many cases,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.400
especially for big deals, those taxes all
go away for a long time.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
So you might think, “Wow, Amazon’s pretty ballsy to expect all of that.”

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.740
Well, Amazon's gotten a lot from his years in Seattle, allowing it to become the second

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
most valuable company in the world at
$768 billion just this year.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.020
But while Amazon's fortunes have been on the rise, the same can't be said for its hometown.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.940
Despite Amazon investing nearly 40 million dollars in housing for Seattle

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.380
the city has seen the cost of housing skyrocket.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.780
Since 2010, more than a 100 people a day

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.480
have been moving to the city and the surrounding area.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.400
In the last five years, housing prices have shot up by 70%,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.160
with median rent in Seattle hitting $1,448 in 2016,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.520
coming in at fifth overall nationwide.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.480
And despite the increase of thousands of
high-paying jobs in the city,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.340
the rate of homelessness has increased by close to 50 percent between 2011 and 2017.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.480
"I got, you know, economically zero unemployment
in my city and I got thousands of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.760
homeless people that actually are
working and just can't afford housing."

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.040
So, that's what's been happening in Seattle
and now Amazon is looking for incentives

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.600
in the next city it moves to.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.560
Oh, and by the way, Amazon does not receive any tax

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.000
incentives from Seattle. It's only there
because it was founded in the city and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.180
maybe the fact that Washington state
doesn't have any kind of income tax.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.220
We know that two bids, three bids exceeded $7 billion,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.420
from St. Louis, Newark and Montgomery County, Maryland.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.760
And this is gonna be perhaps the biggest subsidy deal in U.S. history.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.720
It may rival the $8.7 billion deal that Washington state gave Boeing five years ago.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.040
And these incentive deals are actually pretty common.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.740
States and cities will often throw this kind of money at big companies.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.100
Like Ohio's $120 million to GE between 2007 and 2011.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.160
And Wisconsin's $3 billion subsidy deal that went to electronics manufacturer Foxconn.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.940
And that's just a drop in the bucket for these

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.620
types of deals between companies and local governments across the U.S.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.600
Studies have shown that the total amount of

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.720
subsidy deals for corporations could be
worth anywhere between $45 and $90 billion.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.620
The rate at which these deals
are made has also tripled since the 1990s.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.800
But this phenomenon goes way back.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.220
"The history of incentives goes back to the late 1930s.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.220
Mississippi created the first program intentionally designed to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.991
lure companies from the Midwest and from
the Northeast.

00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:48.020
The whole system really took off, especially after World War II,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.180
when the interstate highway system got built starting in the 1950s.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.500
And by 1976, there was a cover article of

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.280
Businessweek talking about the “second war among the states” -

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.240
that is the war for jobs."

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.080
Naturally, these deals have
generated much controversy over the years.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.840
And in 2006, the Supreme Court
overturned an Ohio court's ruling that

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.780
said such deals were unconstitutional.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.140
We don't have a federal industrial policy

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.730
to rein in the states from spending
excessively in these chases or from

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.440
actively pirating for each other.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.360
When free trade deals were being made left and right

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.420
in the 80s and 90s, and factory
after factory either shut down or moved abroad,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.940
many cities and states sought to
attract other industries for their work forces.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.482
Enter: the tech industry.

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:34.760
As tech took off in the U.S. in the 2000s,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.740
local and state governments started to compete once again to woo these companies to

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.400
replace the long-gone factories.

00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:42.900
And sure, a lot of big tech companies have their

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.140
home base in Silicon Valley, but they've
also opened up data centers to store

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.300
the immense amount of data that they
generate.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.920
27 states have created incentive programs

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.700
to bring in these tech data centers.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.880
And a report found that Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Amazon

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.800
have received $2 billion in subsidies for 11 data centers in the past decade.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.099
So with that much money being

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.120
spent by taxpayers to build data centers
left, right and center, you'd hope that

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.200
there'd be a lot of jobs as a result, right?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.900
Well, the study also found that

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.669
these data facilities only employ under
200 people on average and these states

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.960
had spent roughly $2 million per job created.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.020
We can point to examples

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.960
of incentives that have worked and
usually those are programs that don't

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.280
benefit one program hugely, but instead
target a whole industry.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.860
But while it's possible for a local government

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.980
and the dominant industry to work together to

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.039
better a city or a state, there's still
the question of over reliance on a

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.040
single industry.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.337
Take Detroit, for example.

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:41.360
For about 70 years Detroit was the home

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.960
of the American auto industry but when
international competition grew, it became

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.830
more expensive for the industry to
remain in Detroit with the numbers it

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.300
had in manufacturing and employment.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.500
As the auto industry started to leave Detroit,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.160
the city's economy collapsed.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.220
Today, the once thriving city is a shell of its former self.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.940
But the state of Michigan wasn't quite done enticing the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.560
auto-industry.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.420
Ford, GM and Chrysler were
awarded tax credits worth

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.360
$4.5 billion on the condition
they keep 86,000 jobs

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.520
in Michigan through 2032.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.400
By 2015, Michigan
was facing a $289 million budget

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.360
shortfall for the tax credits it had
largely offered to the auto-industry

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.640
over the previous 20 years.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.920
$289 million - does Flint even have clean water yet?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.020
"If we pick smartly and pick companies
that have a future, we can grow the whole

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.960
industry over time, and also
increase the likelihood that the

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.539
companies will stay put in that area,
because they see value in being tied to

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:40.960
the local university, the local
training program."

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.780
So, given how little so many cities and states across America

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.540
often get out of the presence of these

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.520
massive companies, many of them have
started fighting back - including Seattle.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.840
Last year, Seattle proposed what was called

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.700
an "Amazon Tax" that would see Amazon taxed $275

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.240
for each employee - something that they could have easily afforded.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.880
While the tax was not completely aimed at

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.740
Amazon, the tech giant was certainly the main target.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.632
The city council unanimously
passed the resolution.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.800
But only a month later as the City Council faced intense

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.820
pressure from Amazon and business leaders in the city,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.800
it was forced to repeal the resolution.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.220
"I don't think head taxes are the best
way to approach this deal. I think that

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.880
you have to have a comprehensive
approach.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.020
We know how to do this -

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.700
it's called community-benefits
agreements."

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.020
But the idea of an employee head tax

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.480
is popular far beyond
Washington state.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.160
About 43 miles from our San Francisco studio in Mountain View,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.420
where close to 40% of the workforce is employed by Google,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.700
there's a proposal for what some have called the "Google tax."

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.460
And we decided to go talk to the mayor
of Mountain View – this guy, Lenny Siegel –

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.520
who helped introduce the proposal for
the new tax that would make companies

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.140
like Google pay a head tax for every
employee.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.260
Mayor Siegel's lived in Mountain View since 1972.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.020
And while he's seen it change a lot, its core culture he says hasn't.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.040
"Before Google was in Mountain View, Mountain View was a thriving tech center.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.080
We're actually the birthplace of Silicon Valley.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.380
There's been a gradual transition in Silicon Valley away from physical manufacturing

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.060
to software and services, and Google is
one of the companies that represents that."

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.730
The tax which isn't officially
called the Google tax, by the way, would

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.740
charge all companies in Mountain View
a tax per employee, based on the size of the company.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.440
That yearly tax revenue
could amount to over three million

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.362
dollars, almost half of which would be
coming from Google.

00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:28.370
And for perspective,

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.690
right now all businesses in Mountain
View pay a yearly $30 flat fee,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.340
regardless of size. That brings in about
$250,000 to the city.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.940
Now, it's worth noting that Mountain View
never offered any incentives to Google.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.210
Instead, because of the pre-existing
knowledge from the semiconductor

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.145
business and NASA, Google was attracted
to the city.

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:49.900
But why does Mountain View need this extra tax?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.310
"So, it's a problem for our communities and, in fact, a

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.380
problem for our employers.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.920
Housing here is extremely expensive.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.400
The value of my house has gone up maybe
by 20 times since I bought it in 1972.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.380
And we don't have transit, other than Caltrain to get people to work."

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.480
And the mayor's not worried about alienating companies with this tax,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.300
because he knows that the lack of affordable housing is

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.000
scaring away potential employees.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.370
"The tax that we're proposing is so small
compared to the payroll of any of the

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.570
companies that are here, that we don't
think it'll have any negative impact on

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.440
their plans to continue doing business or even
to expand here."

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.905
So, is this what our fiscal future looks like -

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:36.784
stuck between bad incentive deals and coaxing companies into paying their fair share?

00:10:36.784 --> 00:10:39.260
"There may be times where incentives will

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.140
work, but by and large, the best way to it,
create a sustainable business community,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.720
is to focus on education, to focus on the
quality of life, to protect the environment,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.160
make it a place where people want to live."

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.520
And for companies like Amazon, that might be prime advice.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.380
Sorry about that guys.
