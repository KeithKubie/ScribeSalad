the logic and language video series

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
the logic and language video series
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230
the logic and language video series
introduced logic as a way of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
introduced logic as a way of
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.900
introduced logic as a way of
representing and analyzing sentences but

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
representing and analyzing sentences but
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.759
representing and analyzing sentences but
I skirted around questions of truth and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
I skirted around questions of truth and
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.070
I skirted around questions of truth and
establishing good arguments I'd like to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
establishing good arguments I'd like to
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019
establishing good arguments I'd like to
take a stab at those topics those skills

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
take a stab at those topics those skills
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419
take a stab at those topics those skills
in this video we've paid attention to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
in this video we've paid attention to
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130
in this video we've paid attention to
the structure of sentences and used

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
the structure of sentences and used
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749
the structure of sentences and used
symbolic logic to represent that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
symbolic logic to represent that
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209
symbolic logic to represent that
structure on that front logic provides a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
structure on that front logic provides a
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920
structure on that front logic provides a
handy way to sort out and clarify our

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
handy way to sort out and clarify our
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869
handy way to sort out and clarify our
statements please make sure to go

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
statements please make sure to go
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729
statements please make sure to go
through those videos if you understand

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
through those videos if you understand
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590
through those videos if you understand
that material you can see that the logic

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
that material you can see that the logic
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020
that material you can see that the logic
of a statement like for example water is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
of a statement like for example water is
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479
of a statement like for example water is
a liquid may be represented as follows

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
a liquid may be represented as follows
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.959
a liquid may be represented as follows
for all X if X is water then X is a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
for all X if X is water then X is a
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360
for all X if X is water then X is a
liquid now that you have that kind of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
liquid now that you have that kind of
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889
liquid now that you have that kind of
grasp on logical statements you can

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
grasp on logical statements you can
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.810
grasp on logical statements you can
extend your logic to whole arguments

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
extend your logic to whole arguments
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240
extend your logic to whole arguments
with multiple statements when I say

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
with multiple statements when I say
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430
with multiple statements when I say
argument I'm afraid you may be hearing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
argument I'm afraid you may be hearing
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860
argument I'm afraid you may be hearing
heated exchange of words but I mean

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
heated exchange of words but I mean
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780
heated exchange of words but I mean
instead a series of statements made in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
instead a series of statements made in
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.910
instead a series of statements made in
support of an assertion together with

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
support of an assertion together with
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.230
support of an assertion together with
the assertion drawn from those

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
the assertion drawn from those
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.620
the assertion drawn from those
statements the supporting statements are

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
statements the supporting statements are
 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.580
statements the supporting statements are
premises of the argument and the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
premises of the argument and the
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.080
premises of the argument and the
assertion that follows from them is the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
assertion that follows from them is the
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020
assertion that follows from them is the
conclusion right now I want to convince

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
conclusion right now I want to convince
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.359
conclusion right now I want to convince
you that coffee is a food not a beverage

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
you that coffee is a food not a beverage
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.620
you that coffee is a food not a beverage
yeah you heard that right

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
yeah you heard that right
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929
yeah you heard that right
I'll start with some sentences we both

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
I'll start with some sentences we both
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990
I'll start with some sentences we both
accept coffee as a bean remember your

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
accept coffee as a bean remember your
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300
accept coffee as a bean remember your
logic here I'm saying that for all X if

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
logic here I'm saying that for all X if
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090
logic here I'm saying that for all X if
X is coffee then exits of being beans

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
X is coffee then exits of being beans
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.060
X is coffee then exits of being beans
are food so it follows that all coffees

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
are food so it follows that all coffees
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.940
are food so it follows that all coffees
of food I brought you to a conclusion

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
of food I brought you to a conclusion
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030
of food I brought you to a conclusion
using to supporting premises but you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
using to supporting premises but you
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740
using to supporting premises but you
might think I'm pulling something over

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
might think I'm pulling something over
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.149
might think I'm pulling something over
on you here maybe you can't even put

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
on you here maybe you can't even put
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.990
on you here maybe you can't even put
your finger on it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
your finger on it
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910
your finger on it
hold your criticism for now and consider

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
hold your criticism for now and consider
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.679
hold your criticism for now and consider
the structure of my argument first is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
the structure of my argument first is
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.830
the structure of my argument first is
the form of my argument any good well

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
the form of my argument any good well
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179
the form of my argument any good well
what is its form

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
what is its form
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.719
what is its form
let's abstract the argument to a is B B

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
let's abstract the argument to a is B B
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.410
let's abstract the argument to a is B B
is C therefore a is C you'll find that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
is C therefore a is C you'll find that
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480
is C therefore a is C you'll find that
however you fill in this structure the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
however you fill in this structure the
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.030
however you fill in this structure the
argument seems to work I bet you're even

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
argument seems to work I bet you're even
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.069
argument seems to work I bet you're even
smart enough to see why you really are

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
smart enough to see why you really are
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.139
smart enough to see why you really are
so let's move along if on the other hand

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
so let's move along if on the other hand
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.270
so let's move along if on the other hand
I tried to fill out the argument with a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
I tried to fill out the argument with a
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.800
I tried to fill out the argument with a
structure like premise

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810
structure like premise
 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.880
structure like premise
1a is B premise 2a is C conclusion

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
1a is B premise 2a is C conclusion
 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.930
1a is B premise 2a is C conclusion
therefore B is C it turns out that the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
therefore B is C it turns out that the
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.750
therefore B is C it turns out that the
argument doesn't work apply this form to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
argument doesn't work apply this form to
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580
argument doesn't work apply this form to
a few cases and you'll figure out pretty

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
a few cases and you'll figure out pretty
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.280
a few cases and you'll figure out pretty
quickly that it fails arguments with a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
quickly that it fails arguments with a
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.830
quickly that it fails arguments with a
working structure are valid arguments

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
working structure are valid arguments
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.809
working structure are valid arguments
that are broken get the negative label

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
that are broken get the negative label
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.600
that are broken get the negative label
invalid it would be premature of us to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
invalid it would be premature of us to
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.309
invalid it would be premature of us to
stop there and declare that we have a

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319
stop there and declare that we have a
 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.470
stop there and declare that we have a
watertight argument we've checked our

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
watertight argument we've checked our
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240
watertight argument we've checked our
structure but we haven't thought about

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
structure but we haven't thought about
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.130
structure but we haven't thought about
whether we filled our form with correct

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
whether we filled our form with correct
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.590
whether we filled our form with correct
statements the premises can be true or

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600
statements the premises can be true or
 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.009
statements the premises can be true or
false

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
false
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.509
false
and the conclusion true or false as a

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519
and the conclusion true or false as a
 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.030
and the conclusion true or false as a
result I could propose that all soups

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
result I could propose that all soups
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.900
result I could propose that all soups
are cold

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
are cold
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.729
are cold
anything that's cold can't burn your

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
anything that's cold can't burn your
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.740
anything that's cold can't burn your
mouth so clearly soups can't burn your

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
mouth so clearly soups can't burn your
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.110
mouth so clearly soups can't burn your
mouth the argument has a valid structure

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
mouth the argument has a valid structure
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.150
mouth the argument has a valid structure
but one of its supporting premises is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
but one of its supporting premises is
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.309
but one of its supporting premises is
false which impacts the conclusion I'm

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319
false which impacts the conclusion I'm
 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.220
false which impacts the conclusion I'm
trying to draw if our argument is valid

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
trying to draw if our argument is valid
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680
trying to draw if our argument is valid
and has true premises it's a sound

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
and has true premises it's a sound
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.050
and has true premises it's a sound
argument this may strike you as

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060
argument this may strike you as
 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.550
argument this may strike you as
straightforward but it's easy to get

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
straightforward but it's easy to get
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.770
straightforward but it's easy to get
lazy or manipulative with your logic and

lazy or manipulative with your logic and
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.630
lazy or manipulative with your logic and
end up producing or being convinced by

end up producing or being convinced by
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000
end up producing or being convinced by
unsound arguments or should I say it's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
unsound arguments or should I say it's
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.979
unsound arguments or should I say it's
easy for the other guy but not for so

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
easy for the other guy but not for so
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.620
