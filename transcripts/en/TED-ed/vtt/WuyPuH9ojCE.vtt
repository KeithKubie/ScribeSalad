00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:08.526
Are you sleeping restlessly,

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:10.299
feeling irritable or moody,

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.839
forgetting little things,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.602
and feeling overwhelmed and isolated?

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.567
Don't worry. We've all been there.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.779
You're probably just stressed out.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.967
Stress isn't always a bad thing.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.178
It can be handy for a burst of extra
energy and focus,

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:26.589
like when you're playing 
a competitive sport,

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.516
or have to speak in public.

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.086
But when its continuous,

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:33.105
the kind most of us face day in
and day out,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.932
it actually begins to change your brain.

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.152
Chronic stress,

00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:41.235
like being overworked
or having arguments at home,

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.778
can affect brain size,

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:43.966
its structure,

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.249
and how it functions,

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.249
right down to the level of your genes.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.980
Stress begins with something called

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.606
the hypothalamus pituitary
adrenal axis,

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.698
a series of interactions

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:59.579
between endocrine glands in the brain
and on the kidney,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.500
which controls 
your body's reaction to stress.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.904
When your brain detects 
a stressful situation,

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:08.856
your HPA axis is instantly activated

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:15.022
and releases a hormone called cortisol,
which primes your body for instant action.

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:18.331
But high levels of cortisol 
over long periods of time

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.826
wreak havoc on your brain.

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:24.262
For example, chronic stress increases
the activity level

00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:28.277
and number of neural connections
in the amygdala,

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.489
your brain's fear center.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.413
And as levels of cortisol rise,

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:34.760
electric signals in your hippocampus,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.421
the part of the brain associated with
learning, memories, and stress control,

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.054
deteriorate.

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:45.229
The hippocampus also inhibits
the activity of the HPA axis,

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.511
so when it weakens,

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.982
so does your ability 
to control your stress.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:51.322
That's not all, though.

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:55.880
Cortisol can literally cause your brain
to shrink in size.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.703
Too much of it results in the loss
of synaptic connections between neurons

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.267
and the shrinking 
of your prefrontal cortex,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.871
the part of your brain the regulates
behaviors like concentration,

00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.253
decision-making,

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.379
judgement,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.620
and social interaction.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.437
It also leads to fewer new brain cells
being made in the hippocampus.

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:19.925
This means chronic stress 
might make it harder for you to learn

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.401
and remember things,

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.324
and also set the stage for more serious
mental problems,

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:28.875
like depression
and eventually Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:33.181
The effects of stress may filter
right down to your brain's DNA.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.497
An experiment showed

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:38.706
that the amount of nurturing 
a mother rat provides its newborn baby

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:43.878
plays a part in determining how that baby
responds to stress later in life.

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:48.336
The pups of nurturing moms turned out
less sensitive to stress

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.769
because their brains developed 
more cortisol receptors,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.757
which stick to cortisol
and dampen the stress response.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:58.223
The pups of negligent moms
had the opposite outcome,

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:01.910
and so became more sensitive to stress
throughout life.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.675
These are considered epigenetic changes,

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.524
meaning that they effect 
which genes are expressed

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:10.514
without directly changing 
the genetic code.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:14.361
And these changes can be reversed
if the moms are swapped.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.123
But there's a surprising result.

00:03:16.123 --> 00:03:19.788
The epigenetic changes caused by
one single mother rat

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.622
were passed down to many generations
of rats after her.

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:28.077
In other words, the results 
of these actions were inheritable.

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:30.417
It's not all bad news, though.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:34.817
There are many ways to reverse
what cortisol does to your stressed brain.

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:38.713
The most powerful weapons are exercise
and meditation,

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:40.376
which involves breathing deeply

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:43.521
and being aware 
and focused on your surroundings.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:46.255
Both of these activities 
decrease your stress

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:49.525
and increase the size of the hippocampus,

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:51.770
thereby improving your memory.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.470
So don't feel defeated 
by the pressures of daily life.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.228
Get in control of your stress
before it takes control of you.
