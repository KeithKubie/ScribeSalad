We know that Grant wants to buy 75 gallons of cleaning solution, which is why we

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.536
graphed this line of x equals 75. But what happens if he decides to buy that

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:14.536
from brand number 1? Can you use our graph to figure out how much he's going to

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:19.511
pay? I've labelled each of the lines on our graph according to the number of the

00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:24.866
brand it corresponds to. So, the teal line is for brand 1, the orange line is

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.265
for brand 2, and the light blue line is for brand 3.
