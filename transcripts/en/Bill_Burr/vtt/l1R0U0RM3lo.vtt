00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:01.991
Hey,

2
00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:06.370
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:07.510
my day.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.020
May 8th, 2017 what's going on?

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.110
How are you ? Oh, this is one of these days.

6
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:20.440
I don't want to do the podcast, you know? Oh,

7
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:25.210
I'm putting on a fucking brave face right now. I got the energy in my voice,

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.330
right? I'm trying to bring it for you.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.400
You know what I'm really feeling inside

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.190
<v 1>wohoo</v>

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.570
<v 0>is what I really feel like. Hey,</v>

12
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:39.410
is it be bill burns any from any of Monday morning pie kit?

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.800
Um, just even doing that just brought my energy down to the fucking man.

14
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:49.320
I can't, I gotta sell it. Speaking of what she,

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.440
I was just watching that quiet Ryan documentary where it was like, uh,

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.180
now you're here now what the fuck you going to do? Whatever it's called. And uh,

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.023
they would have to,

18
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.390
Kevin Dobro died and they got this new guy who could really sound like him and

19
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:05.560
hit all the notes. I'm like the first fucking show.

20
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.630
He goes out there and he's just like, uh, you guys want to bang your head

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.960
in the drummer afterwards, Frankie Benelli was giving them shit going, dude,

22
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.360
you can't just see. Got a fucking sell it.

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.780
That's what I love about watching those documentaries.

24
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.340
It's just somebody in those bands,

25
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:28.930
especially with metal music in the 80s they just thought it was a bunch of

26
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:32.690
morons that were just out there. You know, just dumb people and then you,

27
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.070
you listen to them breaking down the show and it's like, yeah,

28
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.820
these guys completely get performance. They totally, Emma, why would you rent?

29
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.330
You would have to do that to sell the amount of records that they did,

30
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:46.990
but for some reason, because of the subject matter, you don't think that they,

31
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.150
you just think that doing it and they're not thinking about it out.

32
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.280
He just got off. We just fucking read the Guy, the riot act. He's now,

33
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.390
we got like a 20 foot by 20 foot stage and you're performing like three feet by

34
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:00.970
three feet. You're not, you're going to get out there. You gotta sell it.

35
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.560
You gotta sell it.

36
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.810
I would have loved to been at that show watching the rest of the band cause

37
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:09.790
they're all pros. No one out is sell it.

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.880
And then there's this one guy in the middle looking like he's doing the fucking

39
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:16.130
river dance, you know, with his hands down by his side, his feet cut,

40
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.820
jumping around, you know, dancing on one fucking square piece of linoleum.

41
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.010
Linoleum. Um, it's a great word, isn't it?

42
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.870
It's a no Liam. It's a good name for a band, isn't it? Some glam band.

43
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.640
You just call it linoleum. They hit golf.

44
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.030
If you could sing a couple of songs about pledge, you know what?

45
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.510
Some other cleaner and that's just your thing. That's a wide open lane.

46
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.400
Nobody's ever done that. I might, I might go on a fucking that, hey,

47
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:49.930
that's my band name. Dot Net registered to seven bucks.

48
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.890
Whatever they charge. I love you. You can just register shit online.

49
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.290
Like when what it was, was this going to some guy's house?

50
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.140
Why are you acting like this is some governmental building, is that a word?

51
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.670
Governmental. Federal Lentil. How do you say it?

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.050
The Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express.

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.470
Some Guy Tears up at 20. Right? And everybody dives on it,

54
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.670
fucking tapes it back together and then goes buys themselves as sub Blimpie.

55
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.990
Now what are you gonna say to your buddy? What are you telling me next?

56
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.360
The world is flat. I'm not that, I don't agree.

57
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.950
Not that I don't agree with that hypothetical person. Um, anyways,

58
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.950
plowing ahead here. How are you, how was your Monday?

59
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.800
I was going to get up this morning and get on the elliptical and uh, I did not,

60
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.801
I woke up this morning and felt like I played three years in the NFL and what I

61
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:48.811
did last week was I really researched what the fuck I was doing wrong with my

62
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:54.400
leg workout, you know, cause you know,

63
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.910
I have thighs of steels but buns of applesauce

64
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.250
and I'm not talking about the fucking job.

65
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.040
And when I realized was that my fucking my, for whatever that for you,

66
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.070
my quads were doing all the work right then my ass was just like some lazy dude

67
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.330
just fucking going along for the ride.

68
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.970
You know like that person when you're at the four top and the check comes at the

69
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.310
end of the night and everybody's digging in their pockets and stuff and that

70
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:28.450
person just kind of fucking, oh man Ya, you're not going to believe this.

71
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.500
I left my wallet at home. I'm dead. Right.

72
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.500
That's what my ass is like.

73
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.560
It's like the fucking dude who doesn't throw in at the end of the fucking night.

74
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.860
You know, he always come up short. You always come up short.

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.740
It's the guy who collects the fuck. I stupid about this.

76
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:46.060
The guy who collects the money,

77
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.750
you know everybody throws in 20 bucks to somebody. You always 10 bucks short.

78
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.270
It's the guy who collects the money. He's the guy who fucking,

79
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.000
he shorted because once he collects the money,

80
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.970
all he's going to say is how much you have and what you need and he's just going

81
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.620
to keep counting. You know, and then eventually one of you guys,

82
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.190
he's just going to fucking cave, ought to be in like, you know,

83
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.970
not liking confrontation and then you're going to throw in and then this fucker

84
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.350
got his meal for $5, $6, $7 less. All right.

85
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.460
So anyways, um,

86
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.280
I got this new workout that I'd been doing and uh, I did that.

87
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:23.260
And then the other night, you know,

88
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.020
I had already worked out that day and I went out in the garage,

89
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.340
sort of stretched and then skipped rope for fucking three rounds.

90
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.320
And I woke up this morning. Oh my God. I felt like, you know,

91
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.640
I felt like I ran a marathon. Sometimes I forget my age.

92
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.700
Um, you know, fucking cracks me up as people tell me I'm an old dead. It's like,

93
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.690
no I'm not. I'm not. When you really look at it, when you go around, I mean,

94
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.640
as far as my, my age, yes I am, but the physical shape I'm in. No.

95
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.030
Cause this is what this is. This is the in of me and you guys can argue this.

96
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.770
I'm not saying I'm old to be a dad, but I'm not an old debt. All right?

97
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.340
Cause this is what happens if you even have a kid at fucking 25 I see people who

98
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.350
had a kid at 25 I see what they look like at 35 alright,

99
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.620
you have to finish in the kids food and doing all of that shit.

100
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:20.330
Whatever the fuck it is they do. You know their body's did done.

101
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.890
They've finished. All right. I'm still doing pull ups.

102
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.360
48 fucking years old. I'll get on a bike. You know I skipped rope. I don't know,

103
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.170
maybe I need a new pair of those fucking Steve Job, new balance.

104
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.220
You know the classic old White Guy Sneakers. What's are now those sketchers

105
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.040
that is now the official, my fucking feet hurt old white guy,

106
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.840
not even old white guy. Cause those dudes,

107
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.060
Shaq and all of them wear it on a does it TNT or TBS. I always get it confused.

108
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.880
Whatever channel the basketballs on, you know,

109
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:57.990
whenever that one dude gets up and he goes over to the giant flat screen TV,

110
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.470
um, and then wearing like the suit and they got the fucking sneakers on,

111
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:05.304
you know

112
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.253
<v 2>this,</v>

113
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.720
<v 0>there's nothing worse than the old guy fucking sneakers. All right.</v>

114
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:16.710
Hang on a second. I've got to fucking, hang on. All right. I'm back.

115
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.290
I don't what was going on there? Son was like,

116
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:24.120
I was on a fucking airplane and my nose was closing up. Um, AH, shit.

117
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.200
And I forgot what the hell I was talking about. Oh, so much sketches. Yeah,

118
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:32.700
that is the official, it's just, it's, it's fucking over. You know what I mean?

119
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.160
Like if I was a gold dig, digging whore, you know, I go to the steak houses,

120
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:38.570
you know,

121
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.060
with a fucking rich fucking dudes hanging out and that's all I'd be looking for.

122
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.000
I look for that fucking guy in the sketches and I'd be like, all right,

123
00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:46.470
this guy's got no fight left in him.

124
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.680
Oh, you do as bat your eyes at them and then that's it. Oh my God,

125
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.860
you fucking hobbles over. You're like, wow,

126
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.210
those are really interesting shoes. Oh, you cease. Get all excited about them.

127
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:05.540
It's like a walking on a cloud. Yeah. Why?

128
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.940
Once you walk on a cloud over your fucking ATM,

129
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.170
I'm telling you right now this [inaudible] if you're a fucking old rich dude

130
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:16.460
right now, do not get a pair of sketches. All right? You might as well have a,

131
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:20.210
a please gold. Dig me. Sign on the back of your fucking sport coat,

132
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.010
you know? Um, anyway, speaking of that,

133
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.240
I'm fucking worried about a, I'm not going to say the guy's name.

134
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.600
There's a fucking guy. I'm watching sports. He's fucking huge now.

135
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.320
He's fucking huge. Just can't be that big. Can't be that big.

136
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.260
You stuck getting in those fucking, those ages. You know,

137
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.000
you retire a couple of years, you just blow up. It's not going to be good.

138
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.390
You know, I was watching that quiet right thing as I mentioned. And um,

139
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.021
you know,

140
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:48.950
they always made it seem like fucking the lead singer Kevin Dobro like died

141
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:51.890
under like a mountain of cocaine and it really wasn't.

142
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.270
He had a little bit of cocaine,

143
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.860
a little bit of value in a little bit of alcohol and that they'll still fucking

144
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.460
a, you know the Quincy Guy there,

145
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.320
the Jack Klugman Quincy Guy was sitting there saying that once you get past a

146
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:09.000
certain age, he goes, you can't do that. You just can't do that today. Hey man,

147
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.230
we'll fucking ramping it up now.

148
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.050
We're slowing it down and we're going to level it out. You Heart's just like,

149
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.870
you know what? Fuck this about that.

150
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.770
I'm calling the shots now, not you. That's how it goes down.

151
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.260
You know? So anyways, getting back to that thing, all these fucking,

152
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:27.840
I'm telling you, you look at any dad, 10 years in Dell,

153
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.740
90% of them just can throw that out there without any research.

154
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.410
So like 30 pounds over fucking weight. All right.

155
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:37.820
I have lost weight since I've had a kid. The,

156
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.820
I'm not going to be the fat dad. I am not. I'm not going out like that.

157
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.940
I'm just not much saying, you know, at some point, you know, gravity takes over,

158
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.163
you know?

159
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

160
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.060
<v 0>I don't give a shit. I'm adjusting. I'm not fighting nature. I'm, I mean,</v>

161
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:52.730
I'm trying to stay in fucking shape, but you know, I just, whatever,

162
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.170
you know, some of my hair started leaving. I was like, you know what?

163
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:02.370
Fuck all of you. I'm out shaved, done. What now? What next?

164
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.493
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

165
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.620
<v 0>you can't go here. Plugs. You can't fucking do it. It's a slippery slope.</v>

166
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.330
You know, you start doing that Michael Jackson Shit. Did he let go?

167
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:21.070
What if I had a booty chin? Ah, would that make me feel good about myself?

168
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.060
And you get the botox and you get the fucking, do they have,

169
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.080
do they have like fake like man pecs yet? You know,

170
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.270
and you can walk in and, and pick like the chest you want, like off the wall

171
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.320
testicles, whatever the fuck they call pex. You know, I'm, I'm,

172
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.240
I'm looking for like a Ben her meets, uh,

173
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.750
can Proterra. I didn't know what you would do.

174
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.820
I bet that's what it's going to be like in the future.

175
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:55.560
Everybody's gonna be like, uh, you're gonna be like a Resto Mod, right?

176
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Where it's going to be like I'm going to be a 1968 white male heterosexual.

177
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.870
Right? But under the hood I'm going to have like a fucking,

178
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:11.340
you know this the fucking zoo. Six 26 that'll be a heart, right?

179
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.740
You get a brand new fucking heart brand new flocking high.

180
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.820
That's like some Saifai Shit. You know where it's like,

181
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.050
Oh God, this is so fucked up. You'd have two kids.

182
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:28.050
One kid would be your real kid and the other kid would be like the donor for the

183
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.540
foul bell. Why?

184
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.800
Why would you do that now? Cause you couldn't do that.

185
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:36.930
That's what rich people would do. Rich people. Okay.

186
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.140
Once they have like all the robots around them,

187
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:42.180
Manchez isn't a fucking movie right here.

188
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.360
They got all the rope robots garden them. Right?

189
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.910
And the only reason why they keep fucking people alive is that they need to like

190
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:51.960
harvest their parts,

191
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.620
but they don't want the fucking poor people to completely rebel and take out a

192
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:59.180
couple of their robots because it probably would be the same amount of money.

193
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.620
He's like a fucking FAA teen. Right? So what they'll do is they'll say,

194
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:05.380
all right, poor people, you're allowed to have like, you know,

195
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.920
four kids and for every four kids you have like, you know,

196
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.950
two of them gotta be donors or something like that. You know what I mean?

197
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.640
So like when I get to the age of, you know, I got to start wearing sketches,

198
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.840
you know, you come in and you fucking take the feet, you know, ah, God pill.

199
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.850
It's so fucking dark. I know it is. I know it is.

200
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.250
I've just been in a really dark place. I don't know.

201
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.530
There's something about becoming a parent. You just start thinking about them.

202
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.790
The most horrific fucking shit that could possibly happen,

203
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.730
you know, I swear to God,

204
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:37.890
Shit that used to kind of bug me now like really bugs me, you know,

205
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.840
if I see anything on TV of somebody like abusing a kid,

206
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.280
obviously that always bugged you, but once you fucking have one, you just like,

207
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.110
you just started thinking like, man, they should just,

208
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.380
people who do that should,

209
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.970
they should be lit on fire and then right before they die you put them out.

210
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.640
I don't know what you would call that. Punishment.

211
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

212
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.030
<v 0>What do you call that? Uh, what do they call that when you fucking,</v>

213
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.830
when you cook a fucking steak. Siri. Yeah, we'll good.

214
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.210
We're going to Syria. That's what we're going to do. You sear it?

215
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:19.580
Keep all the fucking vitals together. No pill. Jesus Christ. You know,

216
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.420
we listen to this podcast bill to get away from our troubles. All right,

217
00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:26.750
fair enough. Fucking fair enough.

218
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.263
Um,

219
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.260
I had a fun day yesterday when I wasn't watching the Celtics just get the shit

220
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:36.410
kicked out of him in the second half, you know,

221
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.190
but I know we're gonna win game six. I don't even know that.

222
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:43.190
I hope we're gonna win game six. You know,

223
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.930
I want to let people learn not to talk shit cause it just motivates the other

224
00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:51.740
fucking team. And then fans don't get that either. I didn't see it, you know,

225
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.450
goes busy this weekend. Had family in town visiting my daughter and um,

226
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.290
I guess someone on the Celtics, I don't know if it was green, said yeah,

227
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.540
we're definitely going to beat him in the next game. It's like,

228
00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:03.680
why would you do that?

229
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.970
That thing that fucking wall did on a Instagram alone to that guy in the Atlanta

230
00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:13.970
hawks. You know, this guy fucking thrives off a grudge.

231
00:14:13.971 --> 00:14:18.971
Why the fuck would you do that so that the wizard fads come on in?

232
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.370
I think they just saw the results of shit talk, right?

233
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.480
And I'm watching the Celtics walk off the court after a loss and you see two

234
00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:33.110
fucking Goddamn, you know,

235
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.760
cotton candy eating fatties not even fat, but just dad bods.

236
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.420
Just clap and go, hey, great job. Great job. Like yelling at the Celtics.

237
00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:43.640
Is that going off the court? It's like he fucking moron.

238
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.090
Why would you do that? You don't say anything. You cheer politely.

239
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.210
You let them walk and then that's it and you let doubt slip into their fucking

240
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:58.070
head. You don't fucking yell at a professional athlete.

241
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.710
You think they're going to implode. This isn't a field goal kicker.

242
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.883
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

243
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.930
<v 0>someone's got the balls to go down the fucking lane, right?</v>

244
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.140
All that's going to do is motivate them. You Guy,

245
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.750
you guys never learned that Shit fucking morons.

246
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:15.380
And I'm talking to Celtics fans too, cause they also do it, you know,

247
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.870
I hate those people. Like right after they win a game,

248
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:21.770
they just got fucking talk all this shit, you know,

249
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.020
Celtics get that ass slapped all that shit. It's like, dude, it's two,

250
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.910
two and then they're gonna disappear to the abyss. If we went another two,

251
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.940
they'd fucking happens every time. So we'll see. Um,

252
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.090
I want to say that the Celtics won't win the next game and then I think we lose

253
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:42.980
in Washington and then it just becomes like,

254
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.150
what team is going to win on the road or is the home team going to hold,

255
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:52.000
serve the bed, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. It, they,

256
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.650
what am I fucking do in the NBA? Thank you. I've gotta be honest with you,

257
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:58.070
as much as I, I've really come back to the NBA and I enjoyed it. I,

258
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.180
when I'm watching an NBA game, when there's an NHL game and I flip over to it,

259
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.970
it's not even close to the level of fucking excitement.

260
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.800
It's people jogging up the court versus people like skating around doing like

261
00:16:10.801 --> 00:16:14.040
2030 miles an hour slamming into each other,

262
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.050
basketball people that are all about, oh, there's no scoring,

263
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.190
which I understand.

264
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.760
It's one of my big complaints about when you watch soccer other than the fucking

265
00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:26.820
flopping, which by the way, Jesus Christ,

266
00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.310
did you guys see what's his face doing?

267
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.230
His salmon up the river set guys named Biel or whatever on, on DC,

268
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.610
and you just see all the fucking memes about that guy.

269
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.570
That was one of the worst. If he just dove, that would have been fine.

270
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:42.700
But the way he threw his head back,

271
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.490
good Lord. Fucking quiet riot ought to have him as a front man.

272
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:53.290
He'd fucking sell every goddamn song, doubt without a doubt. But I'm,

273
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.490
I gotta admit I, you know,

274
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.210
hockey's just where it's at and I've got an IOS app to apologize.

275
00:16:58.211 --> 00:17:02.640
The Ottawa Senators, I was watching that fucking game the other day.

276
00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:07.540
And uh, what was it? The a rangers was a, what was the score?

277
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.330
Were they up four to three? Is that what it was?

278
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.720
Just go with the fourth goal with like seven minutes to go.

279
00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:17.800
And I'm rooting for the range is why I hate New York expelled sports fans,

280
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.770
you know, can't stand them. But Ottawa beat my Bruin so I'm like fuck it.

281
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.670
And I always got like a soft spot spot for the ranges cause I rooted for them in

282
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:30.680
94 to win the company. That's one of the great, you know,

283
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.850
runs I ever saw in sports. So I'm rooting for him. Right.

284
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:38.140
Plus I've got a couple of friends in a big range offense, so it's four to three.

285
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.140
It gets down to like a minute and change left. And I'm thinking,

286
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:44.740
Oh and I've got family coming over, right? I got to go downstairs,

287
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:47.380
I gotta fire up the flat top, going to make some Burgers,

288
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.340
a little bit of Hash browns. I don't do French. I go hash browns.

289
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.330
I go hash browns on a flat top grill and I'm like French fries,

290
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:57.030
French fries past a certain fucking age. He just can't do it.

291
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:01.140
They just take it down to the met. It's not the Burgers, it's the fries,

292
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:05.340
it's not the pizza. It's the soda or maybe it's the combination of the two.

293
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:09.090
That's probably what it really is. When you have both of them, it's just like,

294
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.320
it's fucking over, right. So minute change. I feel like I'm fine.

295
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.540
I'll go downstairs, you know, brothers over here.

296
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.630
Couple of Bud hods right.

297
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.080
I come back in the fucking house and he's like, he's like Ottawa one.

298
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.910
Like, what do you mean they fucking won? What? How do they win?

299
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.200
Tied it up with like no time left. And they, then they gave me all right there,

300
00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:37.630
Fred and overtime. Anyways, um,

301
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.010
my apologies to the Ottawa senators. I just did not believe in them.

302
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.600
Evidently they're for real and I think they're going to take this series.

303
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.580
See what it just did there?

304
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.540
It made it sound like I was saying something positive about Ottawa,

305
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.110
but any real sports fans knows what I'm doing right now.

306
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.030
I'm trying to put a hex on him.

307
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.660
The Old Ronnie Hextall. Now I'm fucking with the, um,

308
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.460
I keep forgetting the rangers are like a wild card. I Dunno.

309
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.650
Fuck it. Anderson. Dude, that guy's these easy guy.

310
00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:16.630
Everybody keeps talking about the dude with a busted foot,

311
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.750
skating around their Carlson, whatever the hell his name is. I can't, I,

312
00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:20.291
you know, once,

313
00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:22.870
once the Russians came in and all the east and the Finnish people,

314
00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:26.570
I haven't been able to remember anybody's fucking name. Really. Bill,

315
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:29.320
you're going to blame that or your lack of short term memory. All right,

316
00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:32.890
maybe you got me. Maybe that's what it is. All right,

317
00:19:32.891 --> 00:19:36.040
let me type in my password here and let's see. Let's see. Uh, let's see.

318
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.170
We got coming up here. I've got to do a little bit of advertising here. Oh Man.

319
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.630
19 minutes and now, Whoa, Whoa, wait. We will talk about who the fuck is this?

320
00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.320
Bonna Masa live on tour near you get tickets.

321
00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:54.470
Now these shows will sell up this fucking guitars.

322
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.740
This flyer has been on everything I've looked at.

323
00:19:56.741 --> 00:20:01.300
I don't know what I clicked on. I don't know what I clicked on. Well,

324
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.500
here's the article I clicked on.

325
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.770
Two engaged doctors found bound in slain in luxury Boston penthouse suspect in

326
00:20:09.731 --> 00:20:11.950
custody after shootout.

327
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.170
Who the fuck is ed?

328
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.160
She said that somebody is 39th birthday tomorrow and I have no idea who it is.

329
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.510
He's fucking computers, man. I don't, I don't know.

330
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:26.770
I don't know what's going on with them. Um, all right, so two doc,

331
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:31.180
two doctors or engaged. One was 49 right?

332
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.660
The other was 39 right. Or 38

333
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.300
Boston police entered the 11th floor, penthouse apartment. Friday night.

334
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.060
They found a gruesome scene, which I'm not going to talk about.

335
00:20:43.061 --> 00:20:46.780
Luxury condo and this is what kills me about this whole story. No Pun intended.

336
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.160
Levon

337
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.090
<v 6>floor, luxury penthouse in Dorchester. You know,</v>

338
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.900
I know I moved away in 1995 I know that's 22 years ago,

339
00:20:56.901 --> 00:21:00.410
but the fact that there's a luxury penthouse, the two doctors are living in,

340
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.750
in Dorchester's is an unbelievable,

341
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.140
I met when I was a kid that talk about what Dorchester used to be.

342
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.910
They used to say, oh, this used to be this upscale place and blah, blah, blah.

343
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.080
Then it became blue collar and then the fucking crack eighties cat at did an old

344
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.720
fuck it. That goes to shit. Right. The thing that it's now back.

345
00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:18.740
This is what I don't understand.

346
00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:22.430
It's like every neighborhood now is becoming high end. It's like where,

347
00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.990
where is everybody else going to go?

348
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.860
I really hope we don't end up like a third world country where it's just like,

349
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.870
you know, if you have a been to one,

350
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.900
it's like you'll see like these ridiculous mansions and you know,

351
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.810
and a gated community with people like with like fucking machine guns standing

352
00:21:38.811 --> 00:21:43.190
outside of them and then everybody else was living in a fucking tin shack. Um,

353
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.570
I don't know. Is that what, what I was supposed to get out of that story?

354
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.860
I mean obviously make a dominance goes out to those two people and they caught

355
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:56.861
the fucking Douche bag with did it Luna tick Trump's war on science continues

356
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.600
with EPA firings, president Trump's war on basic facts continues,

357
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.100
but this time you literally end up choking on it. Oh, Jesus Christ.

358
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:13.160
What is it about, why do Republicans just act like the earth is just

359
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.740
<v 2>okay?</v>

360
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.450
<v 6>You know, like it's not a finite thing.</v>

361
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.393
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

362
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.520
<v 6>I just don't understand it. I get that you have companies,</v>

363
00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:29.340
I get that you're sick of the tree huggers going, hey man,

364
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:31.380
you're putting too many greenhouse gases.

365
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.540
I understand that that becomes annoying to you because all you stare at is your

366
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:40.650
fucking bottom line. But like, I just don't understand those fucking people.

367
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.160
They just sit, there's plenty of wine. Let it's a lake over there.

368
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.330
You know what the fuck they call. They just look at it like that.

369
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:48.760
I just don't understand it. Um,

370
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.840
I think that they're just so fucking psycho competitive or just so unbelievably

371
00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:56.940
selfish. Really like, well, even if what the tree huggers are saying is true,

372
00:22:56.941 --> 00:22:59.040
it's not going to happen in my lifetime. And even it does.

373
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.570
I'll be too old to give a fuck.

374
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.263
<v 2>Um,</v>

375
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.110
<v 6>Facebook's war against fake news in the UK is long overdue.</v>

376
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.920
What is Facebook concerned with? You know, the, I don't like that guy.

377
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.890
I don't like that fucking guys, Zuckerberg,

378
00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:20.020
whatever his fucking name is that runs this thing said since, what? Why,

379
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.250
why is he so fucking involved in fake news?

380
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.610
You have a site that's for people to like, you know,

381
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:28.370
figure out who the fuck they going to bang that they used to went to high school

382
00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:31.990
with. In November, Facebook, CEO,

383
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:36.910
Mark Zuckerberg said the idea that so-called fake news could influence the u s

384
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.640
election was quote crazy.

385
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.760
Can you guys read between the lines here? It's all fucking fake. It's all spun.

386
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.640
This guy, you know what this guy is right now. This guy is like,

387
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.790
he's a made guy and now he has a dog in the fight.

388
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.450
So now this fucking dope now, but he's not dope. Obviously.

389
00:23:57.451 --> 00:24:01.230
He started this fucking, this little fucking Chitchat site. Um,

390
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.250
now he's going to decide what is real and what is fakes.

391
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.100
So maybe you said it was crazy that he couldn't have influenced it. Bill,

392
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:12.560
maybe you should read the whole article before you throw this billionaire under

393
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:17.170
the bus. Okay, fair enough. Sorry mark. Uh,

394
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.350
six months later, however,

395
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:23.240
the social network has announced an all out war on misinformation and hoaxes in

396
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:28.160
the UK before the general election in June. Uh, I see, I see. You know what,

397
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:33.161
he either got paid off or he got a phone call about a convertible ride in

398
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:38.060
Dallas. That's what somebody just called up, you know,

399
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.250
he just picks it up, picks up the phone, hello Facebook. Right?

400
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.420
And then he just had that, you know that voice they always have, you know,

401
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.390
whenever they have like the gang members on TV, like your old fridge,

402
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.080
no more full grown going have grab and go group your up rear. Right.

403
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.400
They had like that voice except it was like Illuminati hitman calling up,

404
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:02.060
you know, he's like, hey, easy mark Facebook.

405
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:06.760
How may I help you? [inaudible]

406
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.270
order we're going to an apple be wears. Um, something like that.

407
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:14.240
They scared the shit out of them. You know what you know,

408
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:17.090
you scare the shit out of a fucking nerd. You just take his phone away,

409
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.670
you take his phone away and then you've threatened to burn one of his superhero

410
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:28.880
costumes and that motherfucker will tell you anything you want.

411
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.270
So now he's having this all out war on fake news out of what the fuck does y um,

412
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.750
how do you tell what is fake? And what isn't. Everybody's lying.

413
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.000
Everybody's a fucking lie.

414
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.980
How many lies do you think Hillary and Trump told combined?

415
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.290
And just one debate. You got two piles of Shit.

416
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:57.190
Just say the other one smells worse, right? Isn't that what it is?

417
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.770
Everybody's lying all fucking thing. You know, I still don't understand.

418
00:26:02.771 --> 00:26:05.410
And Iowa, I know I always say this, whenever a bill gets passed,

419
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.630
why did they always have to?

420
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.080
Why are they allowed to tag on all these other fucking things?

421
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.680
I've never understood it. Anyway, six months later, the guys,

422
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.470
he's an all out war on misinformations and hoaxes in the UK. Oh,

423
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.360
that's because they, they voted to leave the European Union,

424
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:27.460
which probably fucked with the bankers who want to have everybody all unified

425
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.920
all on one currency that they are fucking printing.

426
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.850
So inadvertently people just saying, hey man, let's get the fuck out of here.

427
00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:38.890
And now you've got to have an all out war. And that's what happened.

428
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.430
The bankers hitmen call this guy up, right? All right.

429
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:47.431
Facebook is tweaking its algorithms to try to halt the spread of misinformation.

430
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.960
Giving users tips on identifying sources designed to misinform and an even ran

435
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.750
One, the person you're talking to is wearing a trench coat with the fedora and

436
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:19.980
sunglasses. Alright. Be Skeptical of headlines.

437
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.271
You know what?

438
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:23.880
They just took a picture of the newspaper so I can't see this here.

439
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.670
Look closely at the URL. Investigate the source.

440
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.850
Watch for unusual formatting.

441
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.010
Consider the photos, inspect the dates. Check the evidence.

442
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.430
Look at other reports. Is The story a joke?

443
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:43.530
Some stories are intentionally false.

444
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.090
I don't know if you use this algorithm for Facebook, would,

445
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:52.140
would Facebook still exist? I mean, the whole fucking thing is fake.

446
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:54.060
Everybody picks takes a picture.

447
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.970
They hold the camera up over their fucking face.

448
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.550
So that drops like 40 pounds in upstate number from a four to a six and six to

449
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.443
an eight.

450
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.183
<v 0>Right.</v>

451
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.040
<v 6>Everybody photoshops does all that shit was,</v>

452
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:11.070
it wasn't y'all Kungfu Kenny talking about that new song.

453
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.150
I don't fucking know what,

454
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:20.151
why do I claim some of Wall Street's top boutique firms just landed a big payday

455
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.900
and for some reason they have a picture of a z's and sorry. I mean,

456
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:28.590
is it that misinformation right there? Jesus. Sorry, is not one of

457
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.760
the Wall Street's top boutique firms is Izzy. That's misinformation.

458
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.540
He's a stand up comedian as far as I know.

459
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.943
<v 0>Um,</v>

460
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.940
<v 6>all right. I think, I think I've fucking filibustered long enough avenue.</v>

461
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.353
<v 4>Okay.</v>

462
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.030
<v 6>You know what's funny? When I think of Mark Zuckerberg,</v>

463
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.320
I don't think of Mark Zuckerberg.

464
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.420
I think of the fucking guy that played him in the movie. And you know,

465
00:28:52.421 --> 00:28:54.790
when I look at Mark Zuckerberg, he looks way more than, yeah,

466
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.223
<v 0>okay.</v>

467
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.800
<v 6>MMM. Okay. Oh Jesus. Mother's Day's coming up, you know,</v>

so you know what you gotta get or you gotta get it. So Sherry's berries.

469
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:15.230
Talk about your favorite story about your mom or talk about a television mom you

470
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:18.120
really admire and why? You know what,

471
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:21.840

472
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:22.674

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.730

474
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:31.410

475
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.550
she's busy, she's got a couple of kids. She's not going to fuck around.

476

She's going to look at you like you want to do this. So what?

477
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.470
How do you want to do it? And I'd be like, keep the uniform on.

Um, so anyways, yesterday I did this thing. Uh,

582
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:15.900
it was the Ronnie James Dio, uh, ride for cancer, uh,

583
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.050
which I, it should be a ride to fight cancer,

584
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.040
but he said it was a ride for cancer. I was like, buddy,

585
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.870
these people for cancer cause people fans of disco.

586
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.930
And then I showed up and it was a bunch of people with fucking Harley Davidson's

587
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.810
in, in, in, you know, knives on their hips and shit. I was like, no,

588
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:33.630
these guys are fighting cancer. Okay, I get it. Um,

589
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.640
so I show up at this thing was an Encino outside of this park.

590
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:43.730
And I come walking in and I'm going to introduce Steven Adler's all star band

591
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:46.410
that he's putting together, right. And they're going to play a few songs.

592
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.600
Eddie money was there. He was fucking hilarious. Fucking hilarious.

593
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.590
Um, everybody there, like,

594
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:58.560
I don't know everybody that was just fucking killing it and had like a sense of

595
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:00.060
humor about, you know, cause they were outside.

596
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:04.380
It started raining a little bit and um, so I walk in there going like,

597
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:05.100
all right,

598
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.100
so they want me to joke around a little bit in intro the band and it's outside.

599
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:14.130
The Sun's out and then it starts fucking raining. It's a bunch of bikers.

600
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.840
This one guy walked in, I so swear to God on his, the back of his belt,

601
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.590
he had this fucking sheet knife. It was like a fucking 10 inch blade.

602
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.870
It's like, what are you going to do with that? You know,

603
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.180
what the fuck are you going to do with that thing?

604
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.680
That's not to defend yourself? You're going to murder anybody.

605
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.270
Maybe that's what it is. People see that and it's just, dude,

606
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:40.620
this guy could kill a fucking bear with this thing. Um,

607
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.720
so I'm just thinking, Oh God, this is how, how was this going to go? Right.

608
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:48.780
So I'm watching the bands and I'm enjoying everybody yet in the back of my head

609
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:50.520
going like, well, how the fuck am I gonna deal with this?

610
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.670
Eddie trunk was there and he was in trolling the band and they were being nice

611
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.350
and polite to him. So I was thinking, all right,

612
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.320
but he's not trying to be funny, even though he was being funny,

613
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:02.250
but he wasn't billed as a standup comedian. So, um,

614
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.360
I ended up going up there, joked around a little bit.

615
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.790
They laughed and I intro the band,

616
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.430
I turned around and then of course they'd give me the stretch sign, you know,

617
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:14.380
because it had finally stopped fucking rain and they will get rid of the, the,

618
00:38:14.381 --> 00:38:19.200
the four posted canopy that they had over the drum kit. And, uh,

619
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.460
I actually joked around and went, good. I had a great fucking time.

620
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:27.570
And it took me back to when I used to do college gigs,

621
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.370
the college gigs were the,

622
00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:34.080
were the worst cause you'd show up as an unknown comedian and they would fucking

623
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:38.740
stick you anywhere outside, inside raining,

624
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:43.690
snowing. They didn't give a fuck cafeteria hallway, Mike.

625
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:46.780
No, Mike, you don't think he'd come up,

626
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:48.730
walk out of that walk in closet?

627
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.530
It just took me back to those days and like really having to fight to get the

628
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:57.340
crowd. And I ended up having a great time. And um,

629
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.590
it was great, man. I got to watch fucking, uh, Adler play again. And you know,

630
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.000
it was killing me was, he does a lot of those fucking three in the row.

631
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.090
And then on the bass drum, you know, just playing even like eighth notes at a,

632
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.830
at a, like a mid tempo. But the way he puts him in really propels the song.

633
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.860
So I'm watching him play welcome to the jungle.

634
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.190
And the last time I watched a play, I figured out something that he was doing.

635
00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:23.680
So this time I'm watching his footwork. All right.

636
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.070
And is this fucking guy taking picture of him every time he goes to do that

637
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:30.070
thing like, and I'm starting to get it.

638
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:33.790
This guy keeps getting in my way and then like I had this,

639
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:38.440
then the camera man finally got out of the way and I'm getting to watch him play

640
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:42.580
a whole verse and it's common. I have this anxiety going, please,

641
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.200
please don't anybody fuck this up. Don't anybody fuck this up.

642
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.630
All of a sudden I feel this tap on the shoulder and go pick fell apart.

643
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:53.980
Just say, get a picture as I, I have too much of a need to be liked to say,

644
00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:57.190
hang on a second so I fucking missed it again

645
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.580
because my ears aren't good enough the way they've mixed it.

646
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.260
You know what I mean? With the Bass and the bass drum,

647
00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:06.870
sometimes I can't tell z did he? Do you know what?

648
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.460
What's he playing right there? I Dunno. I Dunno. It's,

649
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.820
we'll be a lifelong fucking obsession, but I've got to watch them do that.

650
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.260
Lead a Ford came out saying,

651
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:18.010
sweet child of mine and then they played rocket queen. He fucking murdered it.

652
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.210
And uh, and I had a great time, so thank you to uh,

653
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.960
everybody at that event who showed up, um,

654
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.900
to raise money for cancer. Um, you know,

655
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:33.901
always the best was at one point they was singing a dio song and uh,

656
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.040
let's tell my buddy bought this. And first of all,

657
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:42.160
I'm looking at all the people in the fucking crowd and they're all my age and a

658
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:46.870
little bit older and I'm just like, wow, man, we are fucking old. Right?

659
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:52.110
But everybody's having a great time and this fucking fucking dude,

660
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:54.160
five foot, nothing goes up there.

661
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:58.480
I saw him on another event and he somehow related to Rania doesn't know.

662
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:00.790
I don't know if he's an a personally, I don't know what, but he key, hey,

663
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.110
he really captures

664
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.070
like Ronnie's ranging really can sound like him. And he started singing it,

665
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.170
dude in the crowd. There was this one fucking guy in the crowd, man,

666
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:15.370
he fucking lost it. He still had the Vince Neil haircut,

667
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.540
not the teased up one when it's just fucking laid down and he had like a fucking

668
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.280
keg cup filled with beer. Well into his 50s, you know,

669
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:26.410
so he's got the whole dad bod and shit.

670
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.760
He lost his fucking mind cause I knew this guy was good.

671
00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:33.130
So I was looking in the crowd cause I wanted to see their reaction.

672
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.250
This guy just fucking

673
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 0>lost it. He's pointing it. He started pointing at the singer with like,</v>

674
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.180
you know, doing the double point while holding his, he was just like

675
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.840
looking at his friend. His eyes are all wide, couldn't fucking believe it.

676
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.980
And I was thinking like that was a kid when I would go to go see these bands who

677
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.720
was above five years older than me, you know, already had like the fucking awful

678
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.780
<v 6>mustache going and you know,</v>

679
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.040
<v 0>and he'd have some hot skanky looking chick with some fucking pink and black,</v>

680
00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:09.410
you know, leopard print a spandex on, you know.

681
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:13.460
And I was sitting there with my fucking, uh, you know, Ralph Mouth Look,

682
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.940
you know, couldn't grow. My hair would never grow down. It would just grow out.

683
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:22.100
It looked like fucking Bernie from room two 22. And I just always think like,

684
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.940
yeah man, Fide Brown, flat hair, man.

685
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:30.350
I could get one of those spandex chicks. He used to think that shit.

686
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.820
Rather than thinking like,

687
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.480
why don't you just fucking have a little confidence to say alo? You know,

688
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.080
this is the one thing, no matter how fucked up you look,

689
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:43.040
you have to hold onto the fact that you gotta be somebody fetish.

690
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.100
There's always hope. You know what I mean? You're not ugly.

691
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.850
You just haven't met somebody who's into what you're doing or what the fucking

692
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:52.460
hand you were dealt. Okay.

693
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.330
And if anything tells me that it's when you watch those storage wars,

694
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.390
because to me that's just a bunch of shit. I don't want any of it.

695
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:02.150
And everybody's fucking everybody else's freaking out. Like, Dude, look at that.

696
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:06.860
That's a dark board. I think that's a dartboard in that case. My God,

697
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:08.750
that's a refrigerator. You think there's food in there,

698
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.810
you know the shit that they're looking at. You know, maybe that's what you are.

699
00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:13.610
Maybe physically what you look like.

700
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.690
You're the human version of what they find in those storage sheds. You know?

701
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.940
And if you've got a great heart, but God dammit,

702
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:23.960
you're like one of those original civil war fucking muskets. I'm all right.

703
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:27.560
That was positive. That was a positive thing. So I think it's timely.

704
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.840
You know what? I think I can do a little more advertising that.

705
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.500
<v 6>Um, okay. Upside everybody. Second attempt coming around again. Um,</v>

706
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.120
you might've heard this earlier in the podcast.

707
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:40.670
Evidently there's a better way for you to buy business travel.

708
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.290
It's called upside.com. Every time you buy a Goddamn trip it upside,

709
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:50.180
you'll save your company a ton of money and they give you a gift card,

710
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.570
an Amazon gift card worth hundreds of dollars.

711
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.630
That doesn't make any sense. I mean,

712
00:43:56.631 --> 00:44:00.710
a fucking plane tickets about 300 bucks and you're going to give me $200 where

713
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:03.380
the DVDs, how are you making any money?

714
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.000
Upsides able to do this because they bundle your flights and hotels together for

715
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:11.210
one low price. Bundled pricing saves money.

716
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.760
If you're a frequent business traveler,

717
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.120
your company saves a ton of money and you could get fast thousands a year in

718
00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:23.900
gift cards just by buying your air and hotel together upside. Plus,

719
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.910
you'll still get all your miles if you're shopping for business travel.

720
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.250
You'd be crazy not to check out upside.com.

721
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:36.390
It just takes three minutes to see how much you've saved by buying your flights

722
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.630
and hotel together for one low price. I can't even read.

723
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.540
I can't even see the words anymore. I don't know what happened.

724
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:47.550

Um, all right, let's, let's get into, uh,

793
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.840
let's read some shit here for the week. All right, let's do some questions here.

794
00:49:01.841 --> 00:49:05.830
95 year old hockey player. Hey, Billy puck nuts.

795
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.820
I saw this video and thought you'd get a kick out of it.

796
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.500
Maybe it'll even motivate you to get your old red tits out there and keep

797
00:49:14.501 --> 00:49:16.870
playing hockey. I want to, I just don't have time.

798
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:22.290
It's amazing how much good you can do to yourself just by staying active.

799
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:25.360
Anyways, here's the link and go fuck yourself.

800
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:29.710
P S thanks for making my workdays crawl by a little bit fast to the dude.

801
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.540
It means a lot kids. Um, anyways, yeah,

802
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:37.450
I watched this. This guy's 95 years old. He's still playing pickup hockey.

803
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:39.910
Obviously he's not flying around out there. But, uh,

804
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.880
that's another reason why hockey's great.

805
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:45.190
It's one of the greatest old man sports ever.

806
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.250
Cause you don't have to run around you just gliding, you know,

807
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:53.230
it's great cardio. It's phenomenal. Um, oh man,

808
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.550
in the spirit of that guy, I gotta get back out there and play.

809
00:49:55.570 --> 00:50:00.570
I have not played since I played in like September or October of 2015.

810
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:05.020
I didn't play once last year. And I've yet to play this year. Um,

811
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:09.730
it's hard because we get ice time late at night and uh, you know,

812
00:50:09.731 --> 00:50:12.190
I got the kid now who by the way,

813
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:15.760
I'm telling you late at night is in the morning and late at night and my two

814
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:17.590
favorite times, you know,

815
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:20.710
when she just wakes up and she's just looking at you and she's just talking all

816
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.860
this gibberish, smiling and all that.

817
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.590
And then late at night when she gets all fussy and everything when me and Nia

818
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:31.940
just sit there and totally like engage with her, you know,

819
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.030
she's just like the look on her face,

820
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.380
just completely enamored. You know, you got to understand. I mean,

821
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.770
I obviously you just heard me real read out loud so you know how fucking dumb I

822
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:47.390
am. So to have another human being looking at you like you have all the answers,

823
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:48.920
I mean it's, it's fucking unbelievable.

824
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.160
And then this fear creeps in where you just like,

825
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:55.310
what's going to happen the day she realizes I,

826
00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.740
I really don't have any answers,

827
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:05.690
honey. Let me introduce you to the world of going with your gut. All right.

828
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:09.370
Fear of driving. Hello Billy boy.

829
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.250
I hope today is treating you and your family well. Well thank you.

830
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.260
Well just like the title says, I am completely terrified to drive a car.

831
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.030
By the way, that guy just went totally different.

832
00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:21.280
Rather than calling me an asshole, he actually said something nice.

833
00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.950
I'm completely terrified of driving a car.

834
00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:26.290
I'm 21 and can't drive worth his shit.

835
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.920
And I had been lucky enough to have a family that takes me to my college for

836
00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:33.730
classes, which is thankfully, thankfully is close by.

837
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.520
Are they helping you or enabling you?

838
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:40.330
The problem is I need my license is the last thing I need to truly be

839
00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:41.164
independent.

840
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:45.340
The problem is that when I get behind the wheel to practice driving, I tense up.

841
00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.910
Every horrible outcome pours into my stupid brain.

842
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.930
What if I make a mistake and get someone killed or accidentally hit a car full

843
00:51:52.931 --> 00:51:56.620
of kids and kill him, kill him? I would not be able to live with myself.

844
00:51:56.621 --> 00:52:00.010
So my brain just goes into hyper mode and I just start getting jittery and

845
00:52:00.011 --> 00:52:04.360
really sweaty. I don't want to lose, I don't want to be this loser anymore.

846
00:52:04.361 --> 00:52:09.320
Bill, any advice? Yes. Drive on Sundays.

847
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.770
All right. Drive to an empty parking lot.

848
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.550
It's hard to find them nowadays because nobody really, you know,

849
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.680
gives a shit about those old puritan laws. Um, back in the day,

850
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:25.070
you know, with liquor stores and you could, everybody,

851
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:28.130
like Sunday was a day arrest. So I learned how to drive.

852
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:33.131
My Dad used to take me down to the south shore plaza in a brain tree,

853
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.550
Massachusetts on Sundays and I learned how to drive on a like a 78 Chevys of

854
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.410
Chevette four speed standard transmission.

855
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:47.360
I actually took my driver's test on a stick shift and um,

856
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.960
they used to, you know, he used to do that with all of us.

857
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.120
He'd take us down there, you know, you got to a certain age,

858
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:57.830
he just take you down there, he teach you how to drive and um,

859
00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.990
that was the way to do it.

860
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:03.530
So what I would do if I was you is I would go down there,

861
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:07.460
have your parents drive you down there and just drive around an empty parking

862
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:12.461
lot or drive down like a quiet neighborhood and you just gradually build more

863
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:14.330
and more confidence.

864
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:17.690
And the only way you get over something as you gotta face it.

865
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.800
So this is what I would do, right? I would just go down that, you know,

866
00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:25.830
first time you just drive around there in the car the whole time. All right?

867
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:26.160
The next

868
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.110
<v 6>time you do it, you drive around.</v>

869
00:53:28.111 --> 00:53:31.680
And when he got 10 minutes left in the driving thing, he, you just tell you day,

870
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:33.870
dad, why don't you just step out for a second? And I'll just,

871
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.950
same thing I did last week when I got back into flying the helicopter, you know,

872
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:39.990
I took two lessons. One I wrote, you know,

873
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:43.440
I was with the instructor the next time, once again it was with the instructor.

874
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:46.800
And then at the end of the lesson I asked him to step out and I flew it around

875
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.660
by myself. Gives you confidence. Yeah, my palms were sweating. I was nervous,

876
00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.640
but you know,

877
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:55.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

878
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.170
<v 6>I mean that it's really a metaphor in life, dude. I mean,</v>

879
00:53:57.171 --> 00:54:00.650
he kinda got to face this type of shit. So, um,

880
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:01.770
<v 2>yeah.</v>

881
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:05.850
<v 0>If I was you considering you have such a fear, no pun intended,</v>

882
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:07.560
I would totally steer into this.

883
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:12.960
You could take a defensive driving course and then I bet there's actually,

884
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:17.670
I don't know where you live, but sometimes you know, they have like these, uh,

885
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

886
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.240
<v 0>I know out here they have like,</v>

887
00:54:20.241 --> 00:54:22.550
they have a course out here where they'll teach you how to do all like that shit

888
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:25.280
from the movies. Like spin the car around. I mean,

889
00:54:25.281 --> 00:54:27.070
why don't you go from being totally terrified,

890
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.720
you just becoming a fucking expert. You know,

891
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.580
learn how to do burnouts and all of that shit,

892
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:35.360
then you become an absolute terror on the fucking road. Learn how to drift,

893
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.440
you know, just master the shit as much as you can.

894
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.570
And then driving down the street will be a joke.

895
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.360
And as far as like killing a bunch of kids and everything like that,

896
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.900
the level of technology nowadays with like the airbags and all that,

897
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.510
you don't sound like you're going to be driving super fast.

898
00:54:52.511 --> 00:54:56.560
So the worst thing going to do is just crumple up some fenders. That's all. Um,

899
00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.890
but you could do it. You just get out there. So just, yeah,

900
00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.020
<v 6>baby steps, baby steps. That's all you gotta do.</v>

901
00:55:03.021 --> 00:55:07.490
I'm flying again this week. I'm flying on Tuesday. Um,

902
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.990
and then uh, I got some other family coming in.

903
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.550
I'm going to take some people up this weekend going up with instructor.

904
00:55:13.551 --> 00:55:15.980
I've yet to have the balls to bring a passenger up,

905
00:55:15.981 --> 00:55:19.010
even though I know I could do it. I can't take a family member up.

906
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.290
I was joking with a buddy of mine, Jay law head.

907
00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:22.820
I think I'm going to take him up first.

908
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.240
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

909
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:27.991
<v 6>I was like, dude,</v>

910
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:32.991
I have to deal with the pressure of just the love I have for a friend.

911
00:55:33.571 --> 00:55:37.080
Forget about an actual family member of my wife or something like that.

912
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:39.300
So anyways, all right. So that's what I would do.

913
00:55:39.301 --> 00:55:43.230
So dude is I get over my fear of uh, you know, bringing up a passenger.

914
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:48.150
You know, you, you update me, I'll update you. All right. Um,

915
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.780
so good luck. You could do it man. All right. Ex-Girlfriend's blanket.

916
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.550
Hey Billy Boo Radley. I have a question for you.

917
00:55:56.551 --> 00:56:01.551
My ex-girlfriend's grandmother made me a blanket for Christmas and I kept it

918
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:03.210
after we broke up.

919
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.100
We broke up a little over six years ago and my current girlfriend and I have

920
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:09.450
been together ever since.

921
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:14.310
We just had our six year anniversary and are talking about getting married.

922
00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:19.311
My ex just got married last week and brought up the question of the blanket,

923
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.890
wait a minute. You broke up with this woman years ago.

924
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:26.740
You still have the blanket. She just got married.

925
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.530
It's six years later and she just brought up the question,

926
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:31.480
meaning you're still in contact with her

927
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.233
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

928
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.400
<v 6>should we get rid of the blanket?</v>

929
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.470
I don't think you meant to say your ex. I think no human humans.

930
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.430
You mean your current one?

931
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.770
He just lost my ex-girlfriend's grandmother made me a blanket for Christmas and

932
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:50.590
I kept it after we broke up, broke up a little over six years ago.

933
00:56:50.591 --> 00:56:52.420
My current girlfriend and I had been together ever since.

934
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:54.730
We just had six year anniversary and we're talking about getting married.

935
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:58.350
My ex just got married last week. Oh,

936
00:56:58.351 --> 00:57:01.800
and that brought up the question of the blanket. I'm sorry. Jesus.

937
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.800
Poor bastards probably listened to this podcast. Scorn. I said that.

938
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.060
I said that in the sentence. All right,

939
00:57:09.061 --> 00:57:12.630
should we get rid of the blanket? It wouldn't.

940
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.230
It wouldn't that big. It wouldn't be that big a deal,

941
00:57:16.231 --> 00:57:20.650
but my ex grandmother stitch our names and our anniversary into it.

942
00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.740
Oh my God, Dude. What the fuck?

943
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:27.120
It's like a championship banner for your former relationship. Also,

944
00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:29.550
my current girlfriend and I really liked the blanket.

945
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:31.740
It's the color of the college

946
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.710
where my current girlfriend and I first met.

947
00:57:36.711 --> 00:57:41.540
And we have a lot of memories having Minnesota blizzards under the blanket too.

948
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.010
This is so fucking weird.

949
00:57:43.011 --> 00:57:46.760
Your new girlfriend snuggled under a blanket with your name and your past

950
00:57:46.761 --> 00:57:49.310
girlfriends name. It's your anniversary date on it.

951
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:51.770
My current girlfriends from California,

952
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.350
and these were some of the first blizzard she had seen.

953
00:57:54.351 --> 00:57:57.710
So it was a special experience for her. What should we do with the blanket?

954
00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.170
I think you should keep it. You're fucking Weirdos.

955
00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.860
I don't know any advice to it. This is the weirdest fucking shit ever.

956
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.060
So my ex girlfriend just got married last weekend.

957
00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:12.250
That brought up the question of the blanket from who you both see the Lichen.

958
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:13.951
Jesus Christ.

959
00:58:13.951 --> 00:58:17.130
Why don't you make a Voodoo doll of your fucking ex-girlfriend and spoon with

960
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.270
the between the two? Yeah. And have a threesome. Um,

961
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.750
we would appreciate your advice as we are both fans of the podcast and your

962
00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:26.520
stand up. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah,

963
00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:29.520
you guys are fucking bizarre when it comes to that.

964
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.040
Jesus Christ. Why don't you just put in a fucking sex tape?

965
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:39.190
You guys made a, I don't know, maybe I read it wrong.

966
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.290
Maybe I was being too harsh. I Apologize, but ah, that's just fucking weird. Uh,

967
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:48.250
dad kicked off Delta flight, dear illiterate.

968
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.930
Cont ah, there you go. That's, that's usual intro that I'm used to. Um,

969
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.830
have you seen the video of the guy in his family getting kicked off a Delta

970
00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:01.210
Airlines flight the other day? The video is long, but worth watching and full.

971
00:59:01.211 --> 00:59:05.950
At one point they threatened to put him and his wife in jail and his kids in

972
00:59:05.951 --> 00:59:10.280
foster care. What is going on?

973
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.430
My first question is,

974
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:16.540
what the hell is going on in the past week with all these air airplane

975
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:20.020
incidents, the Asian guy getting his ass kicked gala was brutal.

976
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.310
Some young brides not being allowed

977
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.530
<v 0>to board due to wearing yoga pants</v>

978
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.610
in the world's largest rabbit dying and transport under a plane. Well, I mean,

979
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:36.560
you know, that can happen. Why is this suddenly a trend? Uh, secondly,

980
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:40.790
I have to commend the father for his overall attitude and demeanor in the video.

981
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:41.870
While I,

982
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:46.140
while watching I couldn't help but wonder how it all would have went down.

983
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:49.610
And if an angry east coast father who were in this guy's shoes,

984
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:53.300
can you imagine an angry father driving to the airport with his bitchy wife and

985
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.810
wining Tyler searching for parking, getting the car seat out of the car,

986
00:59:56.811 --> 00:59:59.000
pushing a stroller through security,

987
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:04.001
hauling your shit all the way to the gate boarding and then being told they sold

988
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.660
your seat to someone else and you either have to hold your kid the entire flight

989
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:10.040
or get off the fucking plane.

990
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.330
Sounds more like an episode of is for family than it does reality.

991
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.820
Just wanting to share. Hope you in the lovely Nia.

992
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:21.230
Keep your DVR relationship afloat in your flooded house. Um,

993
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.550
yeah, I think it's time for other passages to speak up.

994
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.990
Everybody just sits there silently as they yank these people off the plane.

995
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:35.300
Um, I don't understand why like

996
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.980
it's like, yeah, we sold this to someone else.

997
01:00:38.981 --> 01:00:42.850
It's like you also sold it to me and I have my receipt, my ticket,

998
01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:47.560
and I'm on this flight. So you're trying to say that someone else is,

999
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.394
more importantly,

1000
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.480
I would do is I would sue the fucking shit out of that airline.

1001
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.520
They need to be sued because it's their fuck up and they're making it somebody

1002
01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.210
else's.

1003
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.590
They make it the customer's fault and the level of trauma that they're bringing

1004
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:05.120
to people. Like right now, you know something.

1005
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.420
Why don't we all just fire off angry fucking letters to United and Delta?

1006
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.700
Why don't we get organized? Why don't, I mean,

1007
01:01:13.701 --> 01:01:18.560
if anybody could send me the link where to do that, you know,

1008
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.590
the problem is, is if they're all fucking doing it, then where do you go?

1009
01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:25.850
You go to southwest. Southwest hasn't done anything like that. Have they?

1010
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.330
American hasn't done it. United has done it. Delta has done it.

1011
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.040
So fuck both of them.

1012
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.830
Fuck both of those airlines until they learn how to treat people right and Jesus

1013
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:39.320
Christ and they learn how to count. How many seats you got,

1014
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:43.430
how many tickets did you sell? Well, there you go. Um,

1015
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:48.370
no that you, I don't know man. The problem is is they're,

1016
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.460
they're an organized entity. And that the passengers are not,

1017
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.150
I remember that flyers rights thing was going down a while ago.

1018
01:01:55.151 --> 01:01:59.320
Can that thing be like revived and uh,

1019
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.050
when they start to yank somebody off with their fucking children,

1020
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.580
I mean that's, no one wants that to happen to them.

1021
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.640
That, that shouldn't, that shouldn't,

1022
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.430
it shouldn't be able to bully people like that.

1023
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.110
If you make a mistake as an airline,

1024
01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:18.540
you should eat the cost instead of passing it on to everybody else.

1025
01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:20.160
Like to have security go down there.

1026
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:24.380
<v 6>If they ever do that to me, I'm going to be like, I'm not leaving.</v>

1027
01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.341
I'm not leaving.

1028
01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:28.880
If you physically removed me from my seat that I paid for and I have the

1029
01:02:28.881 --> 01:02:32.420
receipt, I've done nothing wrong. I'm not a threat. I'm ready to fly.

1030
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.690
I'm going to sue, I'm going to sue. I'm like, I can't say the living shit.

1031
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.600
I'm going to sue you guys. You know? I mean,

1032
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:43.560
how do they at least give them miles? Did they do anything anymore?

1033
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.300
I Dunno. Cooperations are a, they're a fucking disease.

1034
01:02:50.301 --> 01:02:52.640
They're completely out of control and they have no,

1035
01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:57.740
the only thing they have sympathy and empathy for is the bottom line.

1036
01:02:57.770 --> 01:03:02.660
That's all they care about. And if you work in those worlds, like um,

1037
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.290
I understand if you're on the lower levels, you know you're not about that.

1038
01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:09.560
But in those upper levels, you guys, I dunno, I dunno how you'd do it,

1039
01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:13.160
but you guys, you pieces of shit that you could do that, you know,

1040
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.391
if I fucking,

1041
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:18.540
if somehow that ever happened at one of my comedy shows is no fucking way,

1042
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:23.100
I'm letting that person get kicked out. There's no fucking way. Find a chair.

1043
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.110
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1044
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.540
<v 6>fucking let the person sit on the side of the stage.</v>

1045
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:29.670
This chairs on the side of the stairs always, you know,

1046
01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:31.110
for the union guys that get fucking,

1047
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.900
get one of those chairs and hand it to the parcel.

1048
01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:36.360
I'm sitting on the side of the stage, take a picture. You fucking,

1049
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.930
when you fuck up like that, it's up to you digitally.

1050
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:42.360
The exact opposite of what they should be doing.

1051
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.173
<v 1>You know,</v>

1052
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.470
<v 6>don't kick the person off. Whoever you fucked over,</v>

1053
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:53.040
you give him whatever you have to give him in the airport.

1054
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.820
If they have some sort of Ah, you know, place they have to be,

1055
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.400
you got to figure out how to get them there. You know,

1056
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.850
offer enough to people.

1057
01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.980
There's going to be some single dude who's got nothing to go home to other than

1058
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:14.530
a fucking futon. Just be like, dude, we'll get you a 12 pack.

1059
01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:18.700
We'll give you 30,000 fucking miles. We wouldn't give a shit.

1060
01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:22.440
You're a fucking multimillion dollar. There's a way to do it. Right.

1061
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:23.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1062
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:26.300
<v 6>If I was running an airline that way, it would just, you know,</v>

1063
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.440
I'd have a guy come on tress like a fucking game show host. All right.

1064
01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:33.080
It'd be like, I got cash in my suit pocket.

1065
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.600
You know, I have a couple of hot chicks dress like bunnies, you know,

1066
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:42.290
that will fucking walk you down, you know? Or if you gay, you know,

1067
01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:45.650
you're gay dude, Eto. I have a couple of fucking shredded tanned up guys.

1068
01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:47.300
Shirtless. Whatever the fuck you want.

1069
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:51.950
It'd be the greatest walk he ever had up to fucking tarmac. You know,

1070
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.790
give you a stack of cash like fucking Henry Hill. You know,

1071
01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:01.660
why don't you do it that way instead of coming down fucking all knees and elbows

1072
01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:06.260
and gorilla and some gorilla. Somebody off a fucking plane. It's so stupid.

1073
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.010
All right, boyfriend troubles. Hey Bill.

1074
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.780
I was wondering if you could help with issues I'm having with my boyfriend. Uh,

1075
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:18.130
he's really sweet, but sometimes too sweet. Now Jesus,

1076
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:23.230
he's too submissive and I wish he could be more dominant. All right.

1077
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.790
Okay. He's fucking, he would give up his seat. Is that what you're saying?

1078
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:31.000
I don't know how to bring it up to him without hurting his feelings.

1079
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:35.710
I really want to do BDSM bondage. Sado

1080
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:41.620
Masochists wait, the screen just went out. Rape role play,

1081
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:43.900
but every time we try it, it never works.

1082
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:46.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.930
<v 6>Oh. Oh. Can I top off? Toughen them up.</v>

1084
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.400
Oh my God. That's a fucking sketch right there. He's too sweet. You know,

1085
01:05:56.450 --> 01:06:00.340
he's a sweet, nice guy and you want to do that with this sweet, nice guy.

1086
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.600
<v 5>Hey [inaudible]</v>

1087
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:09.160
<v 6>don't move or I'll, uh, I'll pop you on your head.</v>

1088
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1089
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.350
<v 6>How do you got to speak a little more firmer than that?</v>

1090
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:19.160
I will bop you on the head. Stop saying, Bob, you're drying me up.

1091
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:25.400
Um, I'm, can I toughen them up? You know what, you can't, you can't,

1092
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:29.600
uh, what you're looking to do. Uh, you can't do it with the person like that.

1093
01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:32.810
You just got understand that he's a square peg trying to fit into a round hole.

1094
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.000
They'll fucking pun intended. And, uh,

1095
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.820
I dunno, I, I, you know,

1096
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.550
it's like that whole sex thing. You gotta like, you guys,

1097
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.940
you gotta vibe with each other. If the vibe isn't there,

1098
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.520
especially with something like that, I mean, that's gonna be,

1099
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.980
that's gonna be the most awkward thing ever.

1100
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.890
Do you do the whole act out? Do you tell them to go outside and try to like,

1101
01:07:01.891 --> 01:07:06.840
you know, he probably knocked on the door, hello here to rape you,

1102
01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.460
if that's okay. Um, uh, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:16.260
You're, you're with, I would say you with the wrong guy. That's all. Um,

1104
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.910
so you gotta you know, I don't know. I don't, I have no idea.

1105
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:22.110
I don't know what to tell you.

1106
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:24.723
<v 5>Um,</v>

1107
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:30.010
<v 6>yeah, I'm going to leave it at that. I really need Nia here.</v>

1108
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:32.933
<v 5>You know,</v>

1109
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.640
<v 6>that's just like a whole, I don't know that you can do that.</v>

1110
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.710
Is there any woman out there? Have you been able to,

1111
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.900
cause I got to tell you from the other side when I want to back in the day when

1112
01:07:45.901 --> 01:07:47.820
I was a single man, you know,

1113
01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:52.821
glory days pass you by voting things the way you're [inaudible].

1114
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:56.663
Um,

1115
01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.130
<v 1>okay.</v>

1116
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.400
<v 6>Oh what I would do,</v>

1117
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.300
well I guess you've already done this so it's not working on it.

1118
01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:08.280
What I would always do when you are trying to like get a woman to not be so sick

1119
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.920
, cause it was really with a lot of women, they're super self conscious.

1120
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.130
It's like they don't know what they want to do or want to try.

1121
01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:16.340
It's they're so of how

1122
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.860
<v 0>a guy that they actually like is going to judge them.</v>

1123
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.880
So what I did was I would just gradually,

1124
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.840
I would just create this environment where it's just like, yeah,

1125
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.650
I'm not going to, I'm not going to judge you.

1126
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:31.370
I don't go whatever the fuck you want to do. And I really believe that. I mean,

1127
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:34.760
just like I don't judge anybody, whatever the fuck they want to do with Viet,

1128
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.410
that's what you're in to. Go ahead and do it.

1129
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.460
So long as the other person's also went to what they know. That's fine.

1130
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:45.461
So you had to create this environment where they weren't afraid to say what they

1131
01:08:45.981 --> 01:08:50.030
wanted to try, which I used to say you would drawing out their inner whore,

1132
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:53.060
which is still judgmental.

1133
01:08:53.061 --> 01:08:57.290
You really want what you're doing as you freed them up. Um, you know,

1134
01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:00.140
it's like free gift free. Getting free is freeing up as a comedian. You know,

1135
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:02.150
you just sort of leave your act behind. He just, you know,

1136
01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:03.950
you bomb a little bit, then you get relaxed.

1137
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:06.680
Then you find trying to free yourself up on an instrument.

1138
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:09.980
I imagine the same way. There's no difference. Same thing in the bedroom.

1139
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:12.980
However, um,

1140
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.080
<v 4>okay.</v>

1141
01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.100
<v 0>What the fuck is that noise? That my phone.</v>

1142
01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.770
Oh yes it is. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1143
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.900
Um, anyways. All right, I gotta get off the phone here. So, um,

1144
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.753
<v 4>wow.</v>

1145
01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:33.280
<v 0>There are certain people they don't have like what you're,</v>

1146
01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:35.650
what you're looking for that this person probably doesn't have in them.

1147
01:09:35.651 --> 01:09:39.040
So I don't know what to tell you. Um,

1148
01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.110
but I mean, if you haven't done anything else,

1149
01:09:43.111 --> 01:09:47.160
you kind of started way down the fucking road. You know what I mean?

1150
01:09:47.161 --> 01:09:50.700
Jesus quite just having slap your ass a little bit. I mean, fucking baby steps.

1151
01:09:50.701 --> 01:09:54.540
Go rent. What about Bob? Learn about baby steps and maybe you could gradually,

1152
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.333
you know,

1153
01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:57.550
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1154
01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:01.420
<v 0>take this sweet innocent person and turn them into a fucking DV and I have no</v>

1155
01:10:01.421 --> 01:10:03.480
idea. I don't know what to tell Ya. Um,

1156
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.753
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1157
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.670
<v 0>Uh, unfortunately Nia is still sleeping downstairs, so I dunno.</v>

1158
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:13.670
I Dunno what to tell you. It's been my experience that,

1159
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:15.763
<v 2>you know,</v>

1160
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.120
<v 0>I don't know if someone's not into it then on until you just fucking leave it at</v>

1161
01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:23.110
that, right. It's not what it is. Jesus. This is awkward.

1162
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.020
All right. That's the podcast.

1163
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:34.030
That's the podcast. Go Celtics. How about the fucking prejudice?

1164
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.290
First one's too advanced to the conference. Finals. Beaten me,

1165
01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:43.510
began Saint Louis Louis Blues. Go home couplets once again. Once again,

1166
01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:46.450
50 fucking years. No Cup. Um,

1167
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:51.310
the Edmonton Oilers coming back after that brutal fucking loss and overtime,

1168
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.293
<v 2>um,</v>

1169
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.800
<v 0>Jesus is going to be Edmonton and the predators is going to be the ducks.</v>

1170
01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.800
Oh God. I don't know. I just never been in, I just could never get over.

1171
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.390
I've never forgiven them for being owned by Disney and named after a kids movie,

1172
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.390
the mighty ducks.

1173
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:08.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1174
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:13.270
<v 0>You know, maybe if they still had the fucking intestinal fortitude,</v>

1175
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:16.950
as he always used to say in wrestling to still call themselves the mighty ducks.

1176
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.110
Okay. The fact that they got to where they got rid of the mighty, you know,

1177
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.880
it's like they're trying to run from the history. It's like KFC,

1178
01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:29.850
your Kentucky Fried Chicken. You know,

1179
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:33.210
stop trying to fucking lighten it up. Um,

1180
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.150
squeeze a minute. Who the fuck is left? Yeah.

1181
01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:40.210
I still think the penguins are going to do it. You know. Crosby's come back.

1182
01:11:40.211 --> 01:11:43.870
Seems to be all right, I think. Depends. Got It. Uh,

1183
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
and I can say that I haven't watched 10 games this year. All right.

1184
01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:50.360
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check on a, on Thursday. All right.
