Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Don't want to hear the truth about it. Um, we did one about a trophy hunting, uh, animals about how cause people, young people get so mad. I'll look at this guy shot a lion, right? And the truth is that, uh, in some countries, not 100% of the time, but in some countries they are effectively using trophy hunting as a way to, to protect the animals because you know, that's how they are able to sort of like monetize, you know, in that place and uh, you know, get money coming in, in order to protect the animals. And they're, they're very specific and strategic about it and it can be part of a good, you know, sort of animal management, you know, strategy and it's being used to some success, you know? Um, and yeah, people don't want to hear that. Right. It's still really hard

Speaker 2:          00:46          to me and I hunt. Yeah. Yeah. That, that, that, that whole, the whole lion and elephant thing,

Speaker 1:          00:53          right? Ooh, that's a weird one though. What they can do is they can say, okay, well we've got these elephants, one of these elephants is an old male that's like killing the other elephants. Right. And if we organize these hunts where you got to pay half a million dollars for the right to even go in there, right.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Well with the old male elephants, I know that was the issue with that giraffe.

Speaker 1:          01:13          The woman that got actually don't know that specific case. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:17          there was a, there was a woman who got in trouble because she shot this really beautiful giraffe. It was really dark and unusually colored and it was dark because it was very old. And the older the Giraffe, apparently the males get really dark. It was really cool again. Um, but she shot it and everybody went crazy on the internet because, you know, she was posing and smiling with this drought. But apparently that giraffe had to be killed because it had killed at least two, maybe three young males, and it was no longer have a apple breeding age. So they, they were in this situation where they didn't have the money to take it and bring it to a zoo somewhere and the, they would have gotten money from having this woman come in and shoot it.

Speaker 1:          01:56          That's what they did. Yeah. That's Sorta, that's sort of the idea, you know. Um, I mean, one of the issues is if you've got an area where, you know, one of the problems is you need to have a reason for the people who live in the place to care about the animals. You know what I mean? If it's just like, hey, the ovens are going to roam free while you've got people there who are like, all right, fine. So I'm living near some elephants. Occasionally they eat my crops and shit and that annoys me. I don't really give the occasionally. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I don't give a shit about that. And what that allows to happen is allows poachers to come in and kill them. Wantonly Right. But if instead, okay, we're protecting them, we have a revenue stream, right. We get money when, you know, hunters come in and pay a lot of money to go kill one animal.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Right now we've got a way to hire guards. We've got away. This is now a resource that we're protecting. Right? And that sounds a little cynical, but it is working in some places and it's both cynical and effect and effective. And we have a, we, we had a woman on from, um, uh, the IECN International Union for conservation of nature, big conservation group, talking about how this is effective now in some places, if you've got a corrupt government where there's going to pocket the bunny, yeah, that's bad. Right? But the point is just because the mere idea of someone going overseas and killing an animal is not necessarily the worst thing in the world. We have to look at the details of the situation. And it's hard for animal lovers to hear. Animal lovers don't like to hear that. Uh, yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:11          they don't. They don't. And I, like I said, I don't like to hear it. I wish, I wish I could be hear it either. I wish people would just, it just what freaks me out more than anything is that there's no other options. It's not like a bunch of people are donating a bunch of money to keep these areas clean and free of poachers. And yes,

Speaker 1:          03:31          the amount would be massive, right? We can, we can donate money, but yeah. Yeah. That, that's the w when you've got a problem that big and intractable as how do you save these animals, you know, and against habitat encroachment, right? Again, you know, people want to farm on that land. People, you know, people, people have lives, right? They're not sitting around going, the people in those countries are not sitting around going, oh, I love the cute elephant. Like we have the luxury to do. They like fucking live there. Right? And so how do you get, how do you get those people in that society to, to really protect those animals? That's a hard question to answer. And some places are having success with that strategy and that's something that we can understand. We don't have to approve of it. And every single case. And we can say that's really tough for us as animal lovers.

Speaker 1:          04:12          And in fact, the character I'm talking to you on the show says, I still just hate the idea of an animal being killed. Right? And I said, yeah, so do I. Right. We try to dramatize that emotional, you know, resistance on the show, like that emotional reaction that we have. Yeah. I also don't like the idea of, of an animal being killed brutally. You know, I think I'm uncomfortable with the idea, right? But if my main goal is to preserve the population of these animals overall and stop them from going extinct, maybe I need to accept that this tough truth that once in a tie, once in a while one's gotta be shot through the head of the rifle. Maybe I need to accept that. It's, it's weird. That's what I chose about really weird when it comes to things that people don't eat, like lions stuff. I don't understand the psychology.

Speaker 2:          04:55          Michael Douglas and the, what was that movie with the Val Kilmer, the ghost and the darkness that the, the lions that decided to kill those dudes are, would never heard of this movie, man. It's a great movie. The ghost in the darkness. Yeah. I feel like it's from the 90s yeah, but it's a really good movie about a true story about this guy that they brought, they brought this Michael Douglas character was brought in to hunt these lions that were systematically targeting and killing these workers that worked on this railroad. This team of lions work together and started eating people. Wow. That's great. My way. And they would go, it sounds all right. And they have to, they have to go for the alliance. Yeah. They have to go kill these lines. Yeah. There it is. Ghost in the darkness. Oh, holy hell biting tension. That is a great hunters. Kilmer's looking good there. Yeah. That was pre fatso but val Kilmer free when he went off to do it was too good looking guy handle anymore looking guy too handsome. That's the problem. You had to just go off the deep end.
