[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.350
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, everybody,
for coming here today.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.379
I will do a short intro
for Robert Wright.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.662
So Robert Wright is a
journalist, scholar, and prize

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:22.120
winning author of
bestselling books

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.810
about science, evolutionary
psychology, history, religion,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.450
and game theory.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.240
Robert Wright also taught
at Princeton University

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.700
about a connection
between modern cognitive

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.010
science and Buddhism.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.290
Professor Wright
famously explained

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.380
in his book, "The Moral
Animal", how evolution

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.630
shapes our human brain.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.830
And how our mind is designed to
create delusion about ourselves

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.010
and about our world.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.630
So our mind is designed to
make happiness hard to sustain.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.480
So how do we sustain happiness?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
So today, Professor
Wright finds that answer

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.950
in the 2,500 years old teachings
by Shakyamuni Buddha, a prince

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.300
from the great land of India.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.670
In his latest bestseller
book, "Why Buddhism is True",

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.190
he leads on a journey through
psychology, philosophy,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.780
and Buddhist teaching to
show how and why meditation

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.440
can serve as the foundation for
a spiritual life in a secular

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.310
age.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.280
Meditation can make us a
better and happier human being.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.670
So I introduce you
to Professor Wright.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.670
And please note that we have
15 minutes for Q&amp;A and book

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.170
signings.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.200
So if you have any questions,
please wait until the end.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.955
Thank you.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.755
ROBERT WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:46.130
Thank you for all the work
you did to make this possible,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.750
and thank you all for coming.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080
I'm almost surprised these
days when anybody shows up

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.924
for a talk on Buddhism,
because the political situation

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.590
in America is so distracting and
engrossing that a lot of people

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
have trouble thinking
about anything else.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.490
Of course, there is one
connection between meditation

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.560
and the political situation.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.710
Some people are using
meditation as a kind of refuge.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.132
Kind of to establish an island
of calm amid all of this stuff.

00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:17.340
I think there's actually a
second kind of connection.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.840
I think mindfulness
meditation, in particular,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.610
can in a subtle way play
a productive role here

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.630
in, kind of,
contemporary politics.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.500
And I want to talk about
that a little at the end

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.850
if I have time.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.920
But first I want to talk
about the book a little.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.610
Give you a basic idea
of what it's about.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.070
And I think I pretty
much have to start

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.380
by addressing the title,
"Why Buddhism is True".

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.480
In fact, as a show of
hands, try to be honest.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.770
This won't offend me.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.870
How many of you when you see the
title, or first saw the title,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.160
found it a little
obnoxious or off putting?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.902
OK.

00:03:01.902 --> 00:03:03.110
All right, you can leave now.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.500
[LAUGHING]

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.750
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing
the answer's yes.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.660
ROBERT WRIGHT: No, it's a
totally defensible reaction.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.960
And so it is incumbent on
me to try to convince you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.980
that the title is justified.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.300
So for starters, what part of
Buddhism am I talking about?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.800
I'm talking about what you might
call the naturalistic part.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.480
I'm not getting into like, you
know, reincarnation and so on.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.540
Talking about the parts that
are amenable to examination

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.710
via modern psychology,
modern philosophy.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.580
And that's the kind of
examination I do in the book.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.970
If you ask, what in particular
am I saying is true?

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.600
There's a number
of answers to that.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.950
But one thing I'd say is
at the core of Buddhism

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.830
is the claim that
the reason we suffer

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.840
and the reason we make
other people suffer

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.580
is because we don't
see the world clearly.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.080
OK.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.930
We don't see ourselves clearly.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.890
We don't see other
people clearly.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.530
As a result, we
suffer needlessly,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.405
and we behave badly
towards other people.

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:11.780
When you think about it, that's
kind of an amazing claim.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.280
Right?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.340
The idea.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.930
Because it suggested that
by clarifying your vision,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.779
by pursuing truth, you
could make yourself happier

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.250
and make yourself
a better person.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.780
So that the idea is that truth
and goodness and happiness

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.532
can, in principle, converge.

00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:29.990
So you can kind of
kill three birds

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.090
with one stone you might say.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.660
Which is nice, you
know, convenient.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.910
And, of course, Buddhism
provides the stone.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.040
It provides a whole set
of teachings and practice

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.910
that are intended to
clarify your vision

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.390
and have these very welcome
consequences of that.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.540
The practice
includes meditation,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.320
and I focus a lot
on that in the book.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.220
I talk about mindfulness
meditation in particular.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.440
I'm sure all of you either
do it or have heard of it.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.009
It needs no
introduction these days.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.300
I think a lot of people think
of mindfulness meditation

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.100
as basically therapeutic.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.990
They think of it as
for stress reduction

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.070
or dealing with anxiety.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.850
And it can do those things.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.570
But I think what's lost
is that there really

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.180
is a connection between
mindfulness meditation

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.220
and the depths of
Buddhist philosophy,

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.984
really deep issues in
Buddhist philosophy.

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:28.275
And I think people who are
doing mindfulness meditation

00:05:28.275 --> 00:05:29.970
in a kind of therapeutic
way are closer

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.160
than they realize
to really serious

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.760
philosophical and
spiritual exploration.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.680
And in the book I
try to provide some

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.944
of the background that will
help them make that connection.

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:44.610
Now, obviously, I'm
not the first person

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.820
to say that Buddhism is true.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.890
Many people have said it.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.450
Buddhists, for example, have
been saying it for 2,500 years.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.002
Obviously the
premise of this title

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:54.960
is that I have something
new to say about that.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.000
And you might ask,
who am I to claim

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.820
that I have something new to
say about a subject that's

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.870
been so discussed for so long?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.850
The good news is I
don't claim that I

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.100
had some special meditative
revelation that I'm

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.210
going to share with you.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.420
In fact, one difference
between this book

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.850
and a lot of books that get
into Buddhist meditation

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.490
is this book is not
by someone who is

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.900
especially good at meditating.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.930
Many of them are by people who
are very good at meditating.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.760
Meditation didn't
come naturally to me.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.240
I finally had to go to a retreat
to see enough benefits for me

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.530
to really make it a practice.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.050
I've done a number of retreats.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.480
And on retreat, in particular,
I have had some experiences

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.780
that seem kind of deep.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.130
But I'm not one of these adepts
who have these experiences

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.410
on a more regular basis,
or even in a sense

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.810
walk around in daily life
with the benefit of radically

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.571
different apprehensions
of the world.

00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:57.320
But I did interview a
lot of these people,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.330
and so their voices
are heard in the book.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:08.760
And so I hope that helps my
exposition of my argument.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.067
But still, I did not come
down from a mountaintop

00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:12.650
with any kind of
special illumination,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.150
you will be happy to hear.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.230
What I'm arguing is that there
is a kind of illumination

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.250
of the logic behind Buddhist
philosophy and psychology that

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.840
is available now that
just wasn't available 40,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.090
50 years ago.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.650
And it's modern
psychology, and in

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.680
particular, evolutionary
psychology, which

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.150
is the study of how
natural selection designed,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.519
so to speak, in quotes,
"designed" the human mind.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.560
Now, I wrote a book about
evolutionary psychology

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.040
a long time ago called,
"The Moral Animal".

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.402
And one thing I realized
when I wrote that--

00:07:47.402 --> 00:07:49.860
well, I realized a couple of
things that in retrospect have

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.080
real connections to Buddhism,
and I emphasized them

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.070
in the book.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.400
One is that people are
not designed to be happy.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.840
OK.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.660
Natural selection, that's not
high on natural selection's

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.220
agenda.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.284
The bottom line for
natural selection

00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:04.950
is getting genes in
the next generation.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.410
Traits that get genes
into the next generation

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.110
are the traits that flourish.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.060
Whether they make you
happy, sad, or whatever.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.460
And that seems to explain
why, as some of you

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.550
probably noticed, gratification
tends to evaporate.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.660
Right?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.010
You eat some food.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.350
You have some sex, whatever.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.850
Before long the
thrill fades and you

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.200
wouldn't mind having some more.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.150
Right?

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.434
Now, that makes sense
from the point of view

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:30.600
of natural selection, right?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.734
Because if you imagine animals
that were eternally contented.

00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:35.400
If they ate one meal
and just sat there,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.299
and boy that was great.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.007
And didn't seek any
more food, well, they

00:08:38.007 --> 00:08:39.809
wouldn't do well, right?

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.642
And so too with sex.

00:08:41.642 --> 00:08:44.100
From natural selection's point
of view, more sex is better,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.050
more chances to
reproduce are better.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.140
So you wouldn't want someone
to just bask in the afterglow

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.860
forever after a
single sexual episode.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.386
So this is consistent
with one thing

00:08:58.386 --> 00:08:59.760
that the Buddha
emphasized, which

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.180
is that there is a lot of
suffering in life as ordinarily

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.680
lived.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.950
And in fact, this
very phenomenon

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.570
is emphasized in Buddhism,
the fleetingness of pleasure.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.740
And in fact, the word that
is translated as suffering--

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.926
duka--

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:18.900
a lot of people think that
a good translation of that

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.970
might be unsatisfactoriness.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.280
And that certainly
meshes very well

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.020
with a kind of
evolutionary perspective.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.920
It's unsatisfactoriness that you
would expect natural selection

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.620
to build into us, to want us
to always want a little more,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.130
to be discontented.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:41.170
Now, I said that Buddhism
emphasizes our failure

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.460
to see things clearly.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.260
And you've kind
of seen that here

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.110
in the fleetingness of pleasure.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.540
Because when we look
forward to pleasure,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.340
we tend to look
forward to the pleasure

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.610
and not focus on the fact
that it will evaporate, right?

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.530
It's kind of an
unbalanced view--

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.869
that if you're thinking
about eating some junk food,

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:00.910
you're thinking about the
taste of the junk food.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.280
Not that, you know,
maybe half an hour later

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.200
you'll be restless.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.510
If there's some promotion
you've been gunning for,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.520
you're focusing on the benefits
it'll bring, not the headaches.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.660
That's just natural.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.200
And you can say that
that's, if not an illusion,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.860
a departure from perfect
balance of vision.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.722
Now, you might say, well, that's
not quite a misperception.

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:29.180
It's just an
unbalanced perception.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.846
And that's true.

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:32.230
And you might also say,
look, by and large, people

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.300
do a very good job of
perceiving things clearly.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.220
They don't run into walls.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.730
They have very good
navigational equipment.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:40.310
That's true.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.880
But even in that realm,
that simple pedestrian realm

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.760
of just perceiving
objects, you do see a kind

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.900
of illusion built into it.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.930
So people tend to overestimate
the speed at which

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.050
large objects approach.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.150
Now you can see why
that would make sense.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.500
There's no way of knowing
for sure that that's

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.980
built by natural selection, but
it surely makes sense, right?

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.479
Because it's better
safe than sorry.

00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:02.560
Better to get out of
the way of a big animal

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.870
or whatever too
soon than too late.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.340
And I say that just to make the
point that strictly speaking

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.430
just as our happiness is not
high on natural selection's

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.700
agenda, strictly speaking
accuracy of perception is not.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.620
If inaccuracy in perception,
if illusion will get genes

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.570
into the next
generation, then that

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.270
can be favored by
natural selection.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.777
And in this realm of
better safe than sorry--

00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:34.610
the principle that leads
you to overestimate

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.240
the speed of an object--

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.920
you kind of see how these two
things, illusion and suffering,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.480
can again coincide.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.510
So if you were like walking
through, taking a hike,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.760
and you've heard that there
are rattlesnakes all over.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.834
Every time you hear
a rustling, you're

00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:54.000
going to kind of imagine
that there's a snake there.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.709
If a lizard darts
across, you're probably

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.374
going to think it's
a snake for a while.

00:11:57.374 --> 00:11:58.196
That's an illusion.

00:11:58.196 --> 00:11:59.070
It's also unpleasant.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.250
It's suffering.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.630
But from natural
selection's point of view,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.889
and maybe even from yours,
all those false positives

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:05.430
are worth it.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.500
But the point is, again,
suffering, illusion,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.920
they can make sense from natural
selection's point of view.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.520
And then, on top of that,
living in an environment

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.320
that natural selection
did not prepare us

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.930
for compounds things.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.720
So you take forms of suffering
that are in a sense natural,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.420
like anxiety, and they morph
into a whole new difficult

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.720
to manage forms.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.740
So, for example,
evolutionary psychologists

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.140
would say that having
anxiety about a toddler

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.450
is natural if it's your
toddler and they wander off.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.491
You'll go, wait, something
horrible has happened.

00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:43.930
Run after them.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.840
But natural selection
didn't equip us for, say,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.304
dropping a toddler
off at a daycare

00:12:48.304 --> 00:12:50.470
center on the first day
where you don't know anybody

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.280
at the daycare center.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.340
And so that's going to just
totally freak people out.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.840
Right?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.050
Or similarly it's natural to
have anxiety about how you're

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.510
perceived, because winning
the esteem of people

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.930
seems to have helped get
genes into the next generation

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.670
during human evolution.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.150
But then in the
modern environment,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.790
you put people in
situations like this.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.940
They're addressing a bunch
of people they've never met.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.220
And naturally people have
public speaking anxieties,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.470
and they imagine crazy things.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.050
There are people
who are recurringly

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.750
imagined that they
will projectile vomit

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.910
while public speaking even
though they've never done it.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.250
And they believe it when
they're having the fear.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.500
And so you've got two problems.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.700
We were built to sometimes
suffer and not see things

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.390
clearly.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.180
The modern environment in
some ways makes things worse.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:42.060
It makes us imagine things
that aren't going to happen,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.200
or are very unlikely
to happen, and so on.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.130
So I fear that in talking
about anxiety and stress

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.160
I'm again making meditation
sound like a purely

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.260
therapeutic thing.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.890
And I want to
emphasize that I do

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.640
think there is a lot
more to it than that.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.505
In the book, I
focus a lot on two

00:14:03.505 --> 00:14:07.520
of the deepest and pretty
central concepts in Buddhism,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.020
I would say.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.730
One is called not self.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.124
The idea that the self is
in some sense an illusion.

00:14:12.124 --> 00:14:13.540
And the other is
called emptiness,

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.650
which has a number
of interpretations.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.390
But it's sometimes
put as the things

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.420
you see do not have
inherent existence,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.660
or they don't have essences,
or something like that.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.990
And so both things sound
pretty arcane if you hear them

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.400
for the first time.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.970
And I'm not going have time
to get into them deeply here.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.860
I would say,
though, just quickly

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.680
about not self-- a point I try
to emphasize in the book is

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.990
that when you do
something that is fairly

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.840
common in mindfulness
meditation, which is just

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.340
get a different vantage
point on your feelings,

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.759
such as the one
I just described.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.800
Or even less dramatic than
what I just described.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.410
But just suddenly you
have a little perspective

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.840
on a feeling that previously
you might have been barely

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.756
aware of, but you would
have kind of slavishly

00:14:57.756 --> 00:14:59.050
actually obeyed, right?

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.050
And you get enough
perspective on the feelings

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.824
so that they're no
longer in charge.

00:15:02.824 --> 00:15:04.990
And you may even exercise
some choice in whether you

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.400
follow their guidance.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.790
Well, I would say that when
you do something like that,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.050
you are making an incremental
step toward not self,

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.670
toward the experience
of not self.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.480
And I look at the Buddha's own
early teachings on the subject.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.440
And I think you can interpret
them very much in that spirit--

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.170
the kind of so-called first
discourse on not self.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:38.130
Now, as for emptiness,
let me just close on that.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.630
We'll talk about
emptiness, and then

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.840
get back to this question
of contemporary politics,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.260
and then open it
up for Q&amp;A. So I

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.080
had an experience on my very
first meditation retreat.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.510
I talked about this in the book.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.140
But I was taking a
walk through the woods,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.350
and I saw a particular weed
called a plantain weed.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.510
And it was a kind of
weed that had infested

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.540
my lawn for years and years.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.730
And I had spent a lot of
time trying to pull it up,

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.380
trying to kill it.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.320
And all of a sudden I just
couldn't understand why.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.260
I looked at the
weed, and I thought,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.570
this weed is just as beautiful
as all the other stuff

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.220
that we're not calling weeds.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.420
There are no objective criterion
for distinguishing weeds

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.920
from not.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.900
It's just some person
at some point decided

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.390
to call certain things
weeds, and so we all do.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.050
But the feeling at that time
was that it didn't make sense.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.740
And it wasn't just a logical
conclusion I reached.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.950
It was a perceptual shift.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.590
When we look at things
we consider weeds,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.380
we sense a kind of
essence of weed.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.000
And it's a subtle
thing, but it's

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.770
very much informed by feeling.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.470
I would say it's
not just cognitive.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.240
It's not just perceptual.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.980
It's very much
infused by feeling.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.020
And by the way, I would
say one thing in general

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.640
that I think Buddhist psychology
has been very prescient in is

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.390
the emphasis on the way feelings
subtly infiltrate what we think

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.030
of as cognition, and
shape our thoughts,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.041
and attach themselves to
our thoughts, and so on.

00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.999
But in any event, I didn't
see essence of weed,

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.880
and suddenly it was beautiful.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.859
All the greenery was beautiful.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.780
And by the way, if
you talk to people

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.750
who seem to walk around with
the so-called experience

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.579
of emptiness, they
say the same thing.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.460
They say things project
their identities

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.780
less sharply than they used to.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.517
That just seems
like a little less--

00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:32.350
they know it's a clock
if they look at that.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.850
And it's got less clock
vibe than it used to.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.010
But they also say
everything is beautiful,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.050
or they may say everything has
a positive energy or something.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.910
So this brings us back
to contemporary politics,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.260
in particular the
psychology of tribalism,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.560
which I think is the big
problem with the world.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.510
Wherever the conflict is--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.500
sectarian conflict, ideological
polarization in America,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.570
national conflict,
wherever you see conflict--

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.670
I think the problem
is what I call

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.820
the psychology of tribalism,
a somewhat misleading term.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.020
But in any event, I would
say a set of cognitive biases

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.860
that lead us to--

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.900
well, involve identifying
with one group

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.690
and affect the way you
process information

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.260
relevant to your relations
with the other group.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.400
And I think one good thing
about mindfulness meditation

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:33.560
is it makes you more aware of
how you're feelings trigger

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.400
certain biases.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.330
So a good example is
the so-called fake news.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:37.830
Right?

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.170
And now I personally
think almost all of us

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.720
have spread fake news.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.350
I know I have.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.510
There have been times
when I retweeted something

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.480
without going back and
examining the original source.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.150
And I later realized
it had been misleading.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.080
And if you ask what is it that
leads somebody to do that,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.070
it's a feeling.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.190
It feels good to
spread information

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.320
that is unflattering to
the group you don't like,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.050
or flattering to the group you
like, or confirms the argument

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.700
you've already made.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.450
This is sometimes
called confirmation

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.730
by evidence consistent
with your preexisting view.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.290
I just want to emphasize it's
not just a cognitive bias.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.020
There is a feeling
associated with it.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.490
I think mindfulness
meditation can

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.210
make you more aware that
that's happening and leads you

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.300
to kind of pause and reflect
before sharing the fake news.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.440
Now, to get back to the
essence thing and emptiness.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.050
I think the most
consequential arena

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:38.470
for emptiness and for not seeing
essence of is the human realm.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.550
Because we do.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.190
And again, I think this is a
product of natural selection.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.520
We do tend to see essence
of rival, essence of enemy,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.920
essence of friend,
essence of ally.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.680
And these perceptions
shape the way

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.600
we process information
about them.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.529
And there's one
particular cognitive bias

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:57.070
that hasn't been discussed as
much as I think it needs to be.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.380
And I want to just
mention that quickly.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.416
So this is called
attribution error.

00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:03.040
The original version
of this was called

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.010
the fundamental
attribution error.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.640
And the idea originally is,
as it was originally studied,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.150
was when we try to explain
somebody's behavior--

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.970
why they did something--
we attribute too much

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.500
significance to
the kind of person

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.870
they are, kind of
essence, you might say,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.320
and not enough to circumstance.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.860
So if somebody in front of
you in the checkout line

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.530
is a jerk, is rude to the clerk,
you go, well, that's a jerk.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.750
That's essence of
jerk, but for all you

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.760
know they just had a bad night.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.160
I was actually a
little rude last night.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.010
My flight from New Jersey
was eight hours late.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.580
And so I was just
not in the mood

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.900
to find that they did not
have any rental cars for me.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.930
And I kept it fairly
well under control.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.070
But I like to think
that wasn't the real me.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.100
Anyway, psychologists
have found that--

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.700
they originally found that
there was this bias toward--

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.450
you might say essence--
attributing things

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.015
to a person's disposition
rather than to situation.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:07.390
But then they found that it's
actually subtler than that.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.390
And this is the
interesting part.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.860
With our friends and allies,
if they do something good,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.970
we attribute that to
their disposition,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.012
to the kind of person they
are, to their essence.

00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:18.469
That's the kind of
person they are.

00:21:18.469 --> 00:21:19.330
They do good things.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.470
If they do something bad, we
have a situational explanation.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.780
They didn't get enough
sleep, like me last night.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.680
Or they were under stress.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.310
They just got horrible news
about their family, whatever.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.790
With our enemies and
rivals, it's the opposite.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.160
If they do something
bad, it confirms our view

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.612
of what their essence is.

00:21:36.612 --> 00:21:38.070
That's the kind of
person they are.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.082
If they do something
good, we explain it away.

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:41.790
They just succumb to
peer group pressure.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.680
They're showing off or whatever.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.350
This is hugely consequential.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.620
You may have noticed that
when we're ramping up

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.470
for war, people who favor the
invasion go to great lengths

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.900
to paint the leader
of the country

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.377
we might invade as
demonically as possible.

00:21:58.377 --> 00:22:00.210
Sometimes these people
don't need much help.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.418
Sometimes they're bad people.

00:22:01.418 --> 00:22:04.270
But the point is that
if you favor invasion,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.230
it makes sense to put
them in that enemy's box.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.390
Because once they're there,
it's very hard to get out.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.480
But anything good they do
will be explained away.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.240
Anything bad they do will
confirm the initial image.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.130
And I think the same thing
plays out in our politics.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:27.570
So I think just a great
contribution mindfulness

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.690
meditation can make
here is to make

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.810
us more aware of the feelings
that trigger various cognitive

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.380
biases.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.110
That get us to retweet things
or share them on Facebook

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.150
without checking them.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.370
That get us to think
unfairly unflattering things

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.160
about people.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.790
And to get back to
natural selection--

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.800
I think to become
aware of your feelings

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.900
and decide whether or
not to do their bidding

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.580
is almost to launch
a kind of rebellion

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.940
against natural selection.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.920
Because feelings are
just the key levers that

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.680
are used to kind of
get us to follow what

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.677
you might call natural
selection's agenda.

00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:07.760
And parts of natural
selection's agenda are great.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.630
It built a lot of things into
us that I'm grateful for--

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.660
love, gratitude itself,
speaking of being grateful.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.690
There's a lot of nice things.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.492
But I think we have
the power to look up

00:23:24.492 --> 00:23:26.450
at the process that built
us, decide whether we

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.575
want to follow as dictates.

00:23:27.575 --> 00:23:30.686
And I think meditation
can be a big help here.

00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:34.150
I just want to quickly
say two things,

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.000
and one is just a
bit of promotion.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.701
I started a site called
mindfulresistance.net.

00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:44.630
I only started it
a few weeks ago.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.674
Right now we're just putting
out a weekly newsletter.

00:23:48.674 --> 00:23:50.090
Of course, the
term resistance has

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.160
become associated with
resistance against Trump,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920
and I have to admit
I'm not a fan of Trump.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.950
But I mean resistance a little
more broadly and deeply.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.810
I mean fighting the forces that
gave rise to the mess we're in,

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.060
which certainly includes
the psychology of tribalism

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.640
and also includes a lot of
social political things.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.730
Figuring out how to
respond to challenges

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.060
posed by globalization,
technology, and so on.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.440
But my own feeling is that
a lot of opponents of Trump

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.220
overreact to him in ways that
actually play into his hands.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.370
That's kind of an aside.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.490
But in general, I
think that whatever

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.440
fight you're fighting,
fighting it mindfully

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.030
is just good strategy.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:35.020
And not getting too sucked
into reacting to things.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.890
So that's mindfulresistance.net.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.620
Final thing, and I should
admit before I say this,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.120
I am prone to
apocalyptic thinking,

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.240
so you should discount
this accordingly.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.070
But I think you
could make the case

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.350
that we are at a
point in history

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.550
where the only alternative to
much deeper chaos and strife

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.170
is for people to become more
aware of how their minds work

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.230
and seize some control,
some conscious control

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.790
of that process.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.190
Meditation isn't the
only way to do that.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.740
Now, in my experience,
it's the most effective.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.220
But there are various ways
to become, including just

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.740
reading about cognitive biases.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.250
There are a lot
of ways to get out

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.380
what you might
call metacognition,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.850
but I think we
may need something

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.700
like a metacognitive revolution
if the planet is going

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.680
to do what it is poised to do.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.820
Which is, kind of
cross the threshold

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.970
to form a cohesive
global community.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.850
As opposed to just collapsing
back into chaos, which I think

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.190
is a real possibility
given some of the forces

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.440
I see at work and some of
the positive feedback loops

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.360
that are at work.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.180
But I think one
way or other people

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.370
need very much to get clear on
how their minds are distorting

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.920
their perception of
reality and warping

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.490
their judgment of others and
their treatment of others.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.090
And if, as Buddhism
suggests, that makes them

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.070
not just better people
but happier people,

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.700
well, that's a nice bonus.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.986
Thank you.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.974
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.930
SPEAKER 2: So we have time for
a Q&amp;A. Anybody with a question?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.020
AUDIENCE: I have
a question here.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.660
So you just mentioned the
political situation here

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.480
in the US.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.610
It sounds like a
lot of people are

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:41.740
having a lot of illusions
over the other side,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.080
probably that's causing
a lot of conflicts.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.800
I wonder if there's a way for
them to calm down and really

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.822
have a meaningful discussion
instead of fighting each other?

00:26:51.822 --> 00:26:53.027
Thank you.

00:26:53.027 --> 00:26:53.860
ROBERT WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.620
That reminds me of another
thing that I consider

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.490
a cognitive bias that
doesn't get discussed much

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.090
in these terms, and it's this--

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.850
and I think this may be built
in by natural selection, built

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.440
into the mind, but
that's conjecture.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.150
But you may have
noticed that if you

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.900
try to explain why someone
who did something bad

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.620
did the thing, somebody will
immediately say, oh, so you're

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.102
saying it's not their fault?

00:27:24.102 --> 00:27:25.560
You're saying
they're not to blame?

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.100
Well, to take a--

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.570
no, I won't get into that.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.640
The recent example is
too highly charged.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.081
But if you try to explain,
like, why do people join ISIS?

00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:40.580
It's like, oh, you're saying
the terrorists aren't to blame?

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.300
You know?

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.980
And this is an example of
an impediment to what you're

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:53.250
talking about, which is
sitting down and just

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.880
trying to understand
if you're anti-Trump,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.570
why people voted for Trump.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.800
I have three siblings who voted
for Trump out of four siblings.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.850
So it's three to
two if you count me.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.420
And it's hard.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.630
[LAUGHS] I'm so angry,
but this is the big--

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.720
-- this is the biggest
challenge we face.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.400
And I'll do another plug.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.290
I have a platform
called bloggingheads.tv

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.840
where we try to do a better
job than many platforms do

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.239
of hearing the other side.

00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:33.780
I've had a number
of Trump supporters

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.910
on and talked to them.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.680
But it's hard.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.385
And that's why I say I have
some hope that just mindfulness

00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:45.010
and meditation, if it
continues to spread,

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.630
will play a positive role.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.075
And I want to
emphasize one thing.

00:28:49.075 --> 00:28:50.700
One thing people say
is, wait a second,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.730
if our side meditates and we are
calm, they'll just run us over,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.200
right?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.270
No, I think
unilateral disarmament

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.451
in this context works.

00:28:59.451 --> 00:28:59.950
OK?

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.210
Because I think-- to
get back to Trump--

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.810
I think a lot of times
when people aren't calm

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.650
and reacting to him,
that's what he wants.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.540
That's playing into
his hands, because it's

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.870
feeding his narrative
that everyone hates him.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.810
That narrative
appeals to his base.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.479
And that's just one example
of how, in general, I think

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:21.770
with these kinds of conflicts--

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.000
Now, obviously, if
it's an armed conflict,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.190
and you literally surrender your
weapons and they come kill you,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.550
that is not good strategy.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.980
But I think in this realm
we're talking about,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.020
just deep political
polarization,

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:41.380
I think that progress on
one side, on either side,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.320
can set in motion
forces that will

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.400
lead to a kind of calming
effect on the other side.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.730
And it can be a virtuous cycle.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.148
But this is a huge challenge.

00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:58.710
SPEAKER 2: So to ask questions,
please line up back here.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.830
I guess it works out
better for the AV

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.650
if we just line up and ask.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.230
Thank you.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.960
AUDIENCE: So you
started to touch on this

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.150
with the political resistance.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.490
So if someone who's skilled in
meditation has a tooth ache,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.160
maybe they can
contemplate the pain

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.740
and behold it and
view it with distance.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.070
But at what point should
they just go to the dentist?

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:30.590
And where does the desire for
contentment with your situation

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.700
end, and when you should start
to think about making a change?

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.490
Like, why don't we just--

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:42.600
could we just sit passively
and tolerate the administration

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.722
because we're very
good at dissociating?

00:30:45.722 --> 00:30:47.180
ROBERT WRIGHT: The
tooth ache thing

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.971
I actually did, and I
describe in the book.

00:30:48.971 --> 00:30:51.650
I was on a retreat, and I
developed an abscessed tooth.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.350
And when I drank any liquid,
it was excruciatingly painful.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.039
So I meditated for half an
hour, just as an experiment,

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.080
and then had a lot of it.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.347
And it was a surprising thing.

00:31:00.347 --> 00:31:02.180
I don't mean it took
all the pain out of it,

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.030
but it kind of vacillated
between acute pain

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.400
and just going, whoa, that's
an amazing wave of pain.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.900
And when I did that,
it didn't hurt.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.580
It was really surprising, but
I know that's not the question.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.099
The question is
with actual teeth.

00:31:15.099 --> 00:31:16.890
The answer is you should
go to the dentist.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.850
But I think the main context
for your question is--

00:31:23.721 --> 00:31:26.220
well, you hear this a lot, tell
me if this is what you mean.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:33.390
Will meditation kind of end
my passion for social justice,

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.440
or for change, or for resistance
against forces of oppression?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.770
And to be honest,
I have seen people

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.870
who had gone so
far down the path

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.280
that I think that had happened.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.320
I think it's very rare.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.620
I think for people
like me, you care

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.130
enough about certain
issues that the challenge

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.390
is to pursue them wisely
and not get caught up

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.330
in your hatred of the people
on the other side and so on.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.710
So it's like a larger
philosophical question

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.510
associated with
Buddhism, of nihilism,

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.920
which I won't get into.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.070
But it's an interesting
"in principle" question.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.430
In my experience, in practice
it doesn't arise very often.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.730
But anyway, I would say
if you get that far,

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:27.420
if you're so good at insulating
yourself from the world--

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.840
which in a certain sense is part
of what meditation is about,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.680
learning to get
better at coping.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.170
If you get so good
that you don't care,

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.610
then I would say you've gone
farther than I want to go.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.610
It doesn't happen often.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.060
AUDIENCE: Well,
it's not a question.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.820
Could you talk about
more about the projects

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.030
you are working on right now?

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.870
How they can really
help the society?

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.370
Thanks.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.203
ROBERT WRIGHT: The
mindful resistance thing?

00:32:54.203 --> 00:32:56.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
and if you can talk

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.210
about several other things.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.660
The one that you are feeling
most interesting about

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.720
or meaningful about.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.910
ROBERT WRIGHT: Yeah, OK.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.420
Well, the mindful
resistance, like I

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.816
said, we started
it a few weeks ago.

00:33:10.816 --> 00:33:13.090
The URL is
mindfulresistance.net.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.360
All we're doing right now is
putting out a weekly newsletter

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.210
kind of summarizing events.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.680
And we're still
finding our voice

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.380
but trying to do it
in a different way

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:29.510
than people in the
resistance per se do it.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:37.990
And both not get caught up in
reacting to every provocation,

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:42.250
and also trying to
convey what's going

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.014
on in the minds
of the other side,

00:33:45.014 --> 00:33:46.180
of people who support Trump.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.490
Because a lot of time
that doesn't come through.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.149
Because most people who oppose
Trump don't watch Fox News.

00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:57.940
But I think it's
illuminating to know that.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:03.850
Now, honestly, this is, I
hope, just the primordial stage

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:04.750
of this project.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.360
And that eventually
we will actually

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.630
try to get people
mobilized to try

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.000
to become more productive
citizens in the way

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.080
I've described.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.060
You know, try to actually make
a point of not sharing news

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.920
without checking it out.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.520
And not needlessly
ridiculing people

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.690
unless you're pretty sure
it's going to be productive.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.090
There have been times in history
where ridicule was important.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.850
But I would like to
develop an actual program

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:44.100
for applying mindfulness, in
the everyday English sense,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.010
to participation in
politics, in public life,

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.150
by just regular citizens.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.250
Because I think that's
where it has to go.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:57.310
If you ask, well, why do various
opinion leaders, people on CNN,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.810
Fox News, MSNBC, why do
they seem so incendiary

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.980
in the way they talk?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.170
Because they get positive
reinforcement for it.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.100
They get viewers.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.780
They get retweets.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.585
Ultimately, in that sense,
the people are in charge.

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:11.460
It's just that it takes
a whole bunch of them

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.790
to make a difference.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.290
In other words, I don't
want to confine this

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.290
to people who meditate.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.010
At the same time, I think
meditation can be very helpful.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.500
And I do want to emphasize
to people who don't meditate

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.350
that mindfulness meditation--

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.630
if you look at the term,
and the origin of the term,

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.130
and the choice of
the word "mindful"

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.830
to translate to Buddhist term
"sati" and all of this stuff--

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.740
they may think of mindfulness as
just like, whoa, stop and smell

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.480
the roses.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.130
Or just getting
absorbed in yourself

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.830
and like, oh, my feelings.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:58.275
But ultimately, mindfulness is
about real clarity of vision.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.680
The person who chose mindfulness
to translate the term

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.280
"sati", a British civil
servant and scholar

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.560
who went over to, I
think, Burma and got

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.870
engrossed in the culture.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.140
He said that the Buddhist
ideal of so-called right

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.890
mindfulness-- and this
is one of the eight

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.710
factors in the Eightfold
Path in Buddhism--

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.040
is sati, mindfulness, what's
been translated as mindfulness.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.490
He said it's like a
clear, alert mind.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.660
That is mindfulness.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:33.780
Not unswayed by emotional
reaction, just clear and alert.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.110
And I think that would
be real progress.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:42.290
AUDIENCE: You talked a lot
about mindfulness as potential

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.690
to overcome cognitive biases.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.120
And there seems to be
a lot of literature

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.060
about the problems
with cognitive biases,

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.160
and that they do,
in fact, exist.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.200
In the book, do you
go over evidence

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.900
that mindfulness
can in fact overcome

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.890
these cognitive biases?

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.040
I'm aware of mindfulness
reducing anxiety and increasing

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.870
compassion, but
in terms of seeing

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.700
more clearly biases, is there--

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.906
ROBERT WRIGHT: I'm not aware
of studies that have been done.

00:37:07.906 --> 00:37:10.280
I know I gave a talk before
the book came out at Rutgers,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.100
and a couple of people
there made the suggestion

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.260
that they should
start working on that

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.120
and actually study
whether mind-- it's

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.210
a fairly straightforward
thing to study.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.850
You have a control group and
another group that meditates,

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.680
and you give them
cognitive bias tests

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.660
at the beginning and the end.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.670
And so I don't know
what's become of that.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.380
I'm not aware of--

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.580
in fact, I'm not
that aware of a lot

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.730
of work on the role of
feelings and emotions

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.320
in triggering cognitive biases.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.880
But I feel very strongly,
just intuitively

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.600
and based on meditative
introspection,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.710
that that's really fundamental.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.360
That it's all about feelings,
in terms of triggering them.

00:37:57.846 --> 00:38:02.070
AUDIENCE: So how do you deal
with the conflicting experience

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.712
with really attributing an
error to somebody's character

00:38:05.712 --> 00:38:07.420
just because you don't
know them clearly?

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.400
Where the natural instinct
of considering the worst case

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.090
scenario, where there might be
something that's really wrong,

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.490
or it might be just
because you're not

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.490
able to see it really clearly.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.740
And you don't know what
exactly the person is

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.785
or what exactly the--

00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:26.640
ROBERT WRIGHT: So you
mean how in everyday life

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.317
should you go about trying to
figure out what the issue is?

00:38:29.317 --> 00:38:31.400
AUDIENCE: In general,
especially in a lot of cases

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.330
when we deal with
a lot of people

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.790
we may not know exactly
what the thing is.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.510
But one of the primitive
natural instincts

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.920
is when something
doesn't appear right,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.880
we tend to think negatively
and attribute negative aspects

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.420
to people or
situations or groups.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.180
So how exactly is
suggestible to deal with it?

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:58.950
ROBERT WRIGHT: Yeah, I
think I would advocate

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.740
a stance of firm agnosticism.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.920
In other words, sometimes
you just don't know.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.560
Until you know more
about the situation,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.330
you just don't know
whether they regularly

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.150
behave like this in
all circumstances,

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.950
or they just had a bad day.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.160
So you reserve judgment.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.900
And this issue of
judgment is like--

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.070
you hear it a lot in the
context of mindfulness.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.320
It's like, don't make
judgments, don't make judgments.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.180
And sometimes people
dismiss that like, what?

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.259
You don't have values?

00:39:32.259 --> 00:39:33.550
You don't make moral judgments?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.500
And it's not that.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.610
It's just don't make judgments
about stuff you don't know.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.150
And that's very hard.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.430
And I get into this
in the book about how

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.760
our brains seem designed to
make really quick judgments.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.057
If a quick judgment is
right 51% of the time,

00:39:58.057 --> 00:39:59.890
then from natural
selection's point of view,

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.723
in certain circumstances,
it might be better

00:40:01.723 --> 00:40:02.950
than agnosticism, right?

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.840
But that's not a good
reason for reaching quick--

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.366
AUDIENCE: In a lot
of situations it

00:40:12.366 --> 00:40:18.230
might be required for you to
be able to evaluate or come

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.033
to a decision than
just keeping it

00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:22.250
as an abstract way
of understanding

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.459
and just dragging it forever.

00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:25.916
ROBERT WRIGHT: Well, do you
have a specific kind of example

00:40:25.916 --> 00:40:27.610
in mind, where you
might have to--

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:32.660
AUDIENCE: For example, my
point that I'm coming from

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.820
is-- there could be a lot of
people with inherent biases

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:36.320
as well.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.730
But then they actually have
those biases because they

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.042
actually believe in them.

00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:44.750
Whether intentionally
or unintentionally,

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.275
somehow the brains
get programmed

00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:50.390
because of the past
experiences or whatever.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.360
But then they may not be
able to really see the facts

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.382
but still need to
make decisions.

00:40:56.382 --> 00:40:59.480
Let's say whether they want to
continue working with somebody

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.544
or not, or whether they want
to really stay with someone

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:05.346
or not.

00:41:05.346 --> 00:41:07.220
Even like hiring
someone or not, things

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.960
like that, where
you can't really

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.707
indefinitely delay things.

00:41:10.707 --> 00:41:12.290
ROBERT WRIGHT: Yeah,
so you're talking

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:16.100
about like group stereotypes
and biases, like ethnic bias,

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.030
and so on?

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.090
I think that some of the
social science literature

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.370
shows that what's
most constructive

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.250
is if you find yourself in
a non-zero sum situation

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.890
with somebody in that group.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.080
In other words, you can
benefit by, in some sense,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.470
doing business with them,
or it's in your interest

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.350
to collaborate with them.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.570
I'm guessing-- I don't
fly business class--

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:43.146
but I'm guessing you don't see
a lot of expressions of bigotry.

00:41:43.146 --> 00:41:44.520
Because for one
thing, you've got

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.353
these different ethnic
groups doing business

00:41:46.353 --> 00:41:47.460
with one another, right?

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.470
It pays to be polite in
a situation like that.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.600
There's a lot of
evidence of that.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.300
And I think homosexuality
is an interesting case.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.270
Because if you ask why
values changed so fast

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.110
toward acceptance
of homosexuality,

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.630
that was an interesting
case where a lot of people

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.890
knew gay people.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.720
They just didn't
know they were gay.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.990
And once gay people started
coming out of the closet,

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.650
then more people
started coming out,

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.108
and more people
started coming out,

00:42:18.108 --> 00:42:20.670
and pretty soon everyone
had a cousin or a friend.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:25.070
And so when you're in that kind
of relationship with someone,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.470
you're just more
inclined to be tolerant.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.320
And the challenge
is when there aren't

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.180
enough of those kinds
of relationships

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.420
between two groups.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.210
And once it's torn apart,
it's hard to reassemble.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.830
You know, Sunni and
Shia in Iraq used

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.790
to get together a lot better
than they did before the war,

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.260
before we invaded.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.068
And so I don't know.

00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:48.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.430
So I'm asking this question on
behalf of a group of Googlers.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.280
We had this email
thread about this topic.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.480
So recently there has
been a lot of effort

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.975
into secularizing
Buddhism, right?

00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:02.850
ROBERT WRIGHT: Right.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.940
AUDIENCE: So there is a
lot of focus on meditation

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.130
and mindfulness, but
then we leave out

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.430
the core aspects of Buddhism,
like reincarnation and cause

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.780
and effect.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.082
So in Buddhism, there
are two concepts

00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:16.290
to explain everything, right?

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.530
Like the relative truth
and the ultimate truth.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.870
As a Buddhist myself,
in ultimate truth,

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.490
I don't believe
in reincarnation.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.270
I don't believe in
cause and effect.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.760
There is no self, right?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.180
But in relative truth, for me,
not believing in reincarnation

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.580
is like I don't believe in time.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:37.650
So if you consider
yourself Buddhist,

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.970
why not explain things
in those two concepts,

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.520
like in the relative truth
and in the ultimate truth?

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.420
ROBERT WRIGHT: So
by cause and effect,

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.460
you probably mean what's
commonly called karma, right?

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:47.815
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:43:47.815 --> 00:43:48.510
ROBERT WRIGHT: Right.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.210
AUDIENCE: These topics
are considered esoteric--

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.570
ROBERT WRIGHT: I say that
because, just quickly,

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.550
one thing that's not
appreciated by Buddhism

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.200
is that karma aside.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.420
It really puts a lot of
emphasis on cause and effect

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.180
in the scientific
side, in a sense,

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.130
at least as much as
Western science does.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:06.480
If you really look at
what is meant by-- well,

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.520
the rationales for both
not self and emptiness

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.480
turn out to involve a really
pervasive appreciation

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.520
of the pervasiveness
of causal influence.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:21.664
But that aside, first of all--

00:44:21.664 --> 00:44:22.830
and I say this in the book--

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.050
I actually don't
call myself Buddhist.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.500
Because I am doing
mindfulness meditation,

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.710
I'm doing it in the explicit
context of Buddhist philosophy.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.160
And in the book, I defend
some of the fundamental ideas,

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.050
not self emptiness and so on.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:41.330
But I just worry
that to Buddhists

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:44.619
who are Buddhist in a
religious sense, it might--

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:45.160
I don't know.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.016
It might seem disrespectful
or something for me to show up

00:44:48.016 --> 00:44:49.890
and say, well, you know,
I buy the philosophy

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.580
and the psychology.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.204
So I'm going to call
myself a Buddhist.

00:44:52.204 --> 00:44:52.860
I don't know.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.318
I feel a little
awkward about that.

00:44:54.318 --> 00:44:57.266
I think it's fine for people
who are doing so-called Western

00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:59.640
Buddhism or secular Buddhism
to call themselves Buddhist.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.510
I actually don't,
because I don't

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:08.830
get into karma, reincarnation,
and so on at all.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.010
It's not part of my
practice or my belief.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.220
Is that at all responsive?

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.440
I have read that
some Buddhists--

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.130
hardcore Buddhists-- they say
that the dilution of Buddhism,

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.050
what's happening in
the West, is actually

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.820
a big threat to this
2,500 tradition.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.605
Right?

00:45:28.605 --> 00:45:31.890
ROBERT WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.534
In my experience,
my previous book

00:45:33.534 --> 00:45:34.950
was called "The
Evolution of God."

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.491
It was about the
Abrahamic religions.

00:45:36.491 --> 00:45:41.970
And one thing you notice is
just spiritual traditions evolve

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.397
forever, and they branch off.

00:45:43.397 --> 00:45:45.980
Look at how many different kinds
of Buddhism there are, right?

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.307
And there are some non-trivial
differences of doctrine within.

00:45:50.307 --> 00:45:52.890
That's one problem some people
have with why Buddhism is true.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.480
There's no one Buddhism.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.240
And that's why I focused
on pretty core concepts

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.010
like not self.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:05.020
So that's one thing you can
say is that in a certain sense,

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.580
every version of
every religion is

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.880
threatened by its own future
evolution in a certain sense.

00:46:18.895 --> 00:46:21.270
Just quickly-- one thing that's
characteristic of Western

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.220
Buddhism is meditation.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.720
Westerners think
that Buddhists are

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.050
people who meditate and
don't believe in God.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.110
Well, in Asia, that's the
opposite of the truth.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.579
They do believe not in a single
creator God but in deities.

00:46:33.579 --> 00:46:35.120
And they don't
meditate by and large.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.010
Laypeople don't
meditate in Asia.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.834
But actually, the tradition--

00:46:38.834 --> 00:46:41.000
AUDIENCE: That's the laypeople
you're talking about.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.500
ROBERT WRIGHT: The
laypeople, right.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.350
But what I was going to say
was even there, in Burma,

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.050
in the late 19th
century, in reaction

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:52.670
to colonial occupation, they did
establish a big lay meditation

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:54.110
tradition.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.510
And a lot of Western--

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.840
kind of Theravada,
Vipassana Buddhism--

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.860
traces its lineage to that.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.830
So in a certain
sense, this feature

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.270
of so-called
Western Buddhism has

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.990
roots in Asian Buddhism
as it evolved in response

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:14.710
to forces 100, 140 years ago.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:20.830
So on the one hand, I
definitely respect the view

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.080
that Western Buddhists should
not call themselves Buddhists,

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.480
and that's why I
don't call myself one.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.310
But at the same time--

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:31.890
well, I guess I certainly--

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:38.090
another way to look
at it is, isn't there

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.340
something valuable about
what's happening in the West?

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:49.540
A. And B, I think it's richer if
informed by Buddhist philosophy

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.070
than if not.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.280
And in a way this gets
into the whole issue

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.620
of cultural
appropriation and so on,

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.570
which is above my pay grade.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.020
AUDIENCE: You have a question
on the mindfulness meditation

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.110
potential, in terms of
introducing that early in life.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.970
I think many of us have accessed
some of these tools later

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.380
in life than we
would have hoped.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.330
And it seems like there's
a lot of potential

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:23.140
to offset some of the
negative aspects that

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.300
are just fundamental
to our nature in terms

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:34.135
of the tribalism and the biases
that we absorb over time.

00:48:34.135 --> 00:48:35.760
What are your thoughts
on the potential

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.605
to introduce these tools
maybe earlier in life?

00:48:38.605 --> 00:48:40.350
ROBERT WRIGHT: Oh,
I'm all for it.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.130
AUDIENCE: And are you
seeing any trends?

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.380
ROBERT WRIGHT: I'm all for it.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.010
And this gets to the question
of Buddhism as a label.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.890
Because if you
talk to people who

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.110
are trying to introduce
mindfulness meditation

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.149
in the public schools,
a lot of them will say

00:48:55.149 --> 00:48:57.690
it's a lot easier if they don't
use the word "Buddhism," just

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:58.606
as a political matter.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.730
We have one
congressman so far as I

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.280
know who is into mindfulness
meditation, Tim Ryan,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.450
and he has found in talking to
his constituents and so on he

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:14.605
needs to emphasize that
this is not at odds--

00:49:14.605 --> 00:49:16.230
the part of Buddhism
he's talking about

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:20.940
is not at odds with any
existing religious heritage

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.980
these people may have.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.817
And I think he's by
and large not using

00:49:24.817 --> 00:49:25.900
the term "Buddhism" a lot.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.180
The people who are--

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.410
there's like a "Mindful
Magazine" or something.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.760
I think something mindful.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.480
And they don't want to talk
about Buddhism, because they're

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.910
introducing meditation into
institutional settings,

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.430
corporate settings, and so on.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.820
So to some extent, that
divorce from the label

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.130
is going to happen
as part of the quest

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.740
to more deeply ingrain our
society with meditation.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.514
And maybe it's a worthwhile
trade, I don't know,

00:49:55.514 --> 00:49:57.680
but I'm certainly in favor
of starting people young.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.100
AUDIENCE: So our
modern environment

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.290
has produced conditions
in everyday life that

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.625
are not conducive to
sustained focus and attention.

00:50:08.625 --> 00:50:10.000
What are some of
the consequences

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.700
of our fractured
attention spans?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.785
And does current science
provide any insight?

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:17.782
ROBERT WRIGHT: You're
asking the right person.

00:50:17.782 --> 00:50:19.240
I've always had
attention problems.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.220
I never emerge from
a college lecture

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.920
with a coherent set of notes.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.650
And I tried.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.500
I really did.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.650
I just couldn't do it.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:35.910
And one thing-- I get into
this a little in the book.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.880
The point is just that,
again, as is often the case,

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.320
attention problems
are largely I think

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.120
problems of affect, of feeling.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.680
If you pay attention--

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.870
like if I'm trying
to do some writing,

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.990
and I suddenly switch over
and check my Twitter feed,

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.052
or get back to researching some
smartphone I'm going to buy.

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.760
If you look at what's
actually happening,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.800
first, I've reached a
point in the writing

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.630
where it's not coming
easily, and that

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.700
makes me feel uneasy
and uncomfortable.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.320
That's a bad feeling.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.729
Something pops in my mind
like researching smart phones,

00:51:07.729 --> 00:51:08.770
checking my Twitter feed.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.240
It gives me a good feeling.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.560
And it's that simple.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:17.500
Attention is very much an
affective issue, I think.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.800
Now, the problem's gotten
worse because there

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.909
are so many people
on the internet

00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:25.450
trying to get you
addicted to things.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.640
The other thing I'd say is I
think one reason meditation

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.757
retreats seem to be
growing in appeal

00:51:36.757 --> 00:51:39.340
is because one thing they do--
set aside the meditation-- they

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.037
can just get you off the grid.

00:51:41.037 --> 00:51:43.120
And by the way, if you go
to a meditation retreat,

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:48.910
I strongly recommend you put
your email on auto reply,

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:51.250
leave your smartphone
at home or whatever.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.170
Just get totally
absorbed, no news

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:56.330
from the outside world,
that for my money

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:59.710
is a way to do a
meditation retreat.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:04.000
I just think that so amplifies
the beneficial effects

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.690
of the meditation itself.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.300
And it's a good reminder.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.090
Of course, in the end, you have
to go back to the real world.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.100
And this is, of course, the
problem of meditation retreats

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:12.600
in general.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.110
They end.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.730
And then it's everything
that came easily

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.650
by the end of the
retreat is harder.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:24.100
But it's still a good
reminder of how much--

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.620
if a retreat goes well-- they
usually do in my experience--

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.990
by the end of the retreat, your
state of mind is so different.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:34.120
It's just a reminder
of how in everyday life

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.420
your mind is just pushed
and pulled increasingly

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:42.980
by electronic things.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.980
So you're probably young
enough you don't really

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.646
totally remember the
pre-internet world.

00:52:46.646 --> 00:52:55.258
Believe me, it was different

00:52:55.258 --> 00:52:57.723
SPEAKER 2: OK, again, we'd
like to thank Robert Wright

00:52:57.723 --> 00:52:58.720
for coming here today--

00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.970
ROBERT WRIGHT: Well,
thank you for having me.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.760
SPEAKER 2: --and engaging
us in this very interesting

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.130
discussion.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:02.940
ROBERT WRIGHT: This
was really great.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.480
SPEAKER 2: Once
again, thank you.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.521
ROBERT WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:07.840
[APPLAUSE]
