Welcome to

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.660

[laughter]
- Yeah!

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.241
- All right.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.410
So I have
a very sensitive stomach.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.415
I'd say about half my shits
are diarrheas.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.917
And it's not just, like,
when I eat something bad.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.586
It's also when I, like,
experience anxiety

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.122
or, like, trauma.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.457
And I'd say the most traumatic
period of my life

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:32.959
was in middle school.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.995
I went to this school
called Palms Middle School.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.364
And I was this chubby, shy,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.300
awkward little Asian kid.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.634
And I--the school--

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.536
everyone else in the school
was a bully.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.804
You know, I got--
I got bullied.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.672
I got beat up occasionally.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.873
Every time I'd go to my locker,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.208
stuff would be missing.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.477
I mean, when I think back
to my years

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:52.979
at Palms Middle School,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.515
I just picture a bunch of kids
just pointing at me

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.883
and laughing at me.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.985
It was a nightmare, right?

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.856
But eventually I graduated,
and I ended up going

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.992
to a high school,
and I just felt a lot better.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.161
I grew up.
I felt more confident.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.561
I made friends.

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.499
And one day in high school,
one of my friends came up to me

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.502
and was like, "Hey, do you want
to catch a talent show

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:17.804
"that my little sister's in?

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.371
It's at Palms."

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:23.676
And I-I could feel my body,
like, tensing up.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.244
But then I felt better,
and I was like,

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.979
"Oh, you know what?

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.714
"Yeah, you know,
I'm grown now.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.583
"That--that's past me.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.884
"I'm confident now.
You know what?

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.886
"Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.221
I'll see you there."

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.756
So that Saturday comes.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.392
I'm riding my bike
to my old middle school.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.862
I lock up my bike,
and the moment I set foot

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:47.534
on the campus, I could feel
my stomach start to turn.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.601
[light laughter]

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.036
But I pay it no mind.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.572
I go into the auditorium,
right.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.273
The auditorium is packed.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:57.710
There's just parents,
kids running around, faculty.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.945
It's just packed.
I see my friends

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.379
sitting in the front row,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.714
and they saved me a seat.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:04.383
I join them,
and the talent show begins.

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:06.185
And as soon as I sit down,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.121
I feel like I need
to use the restroom.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:12.057
My stomach is, like,
about to explode, all right?

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:15.527
But I just got there,
so I decide to fight it through.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:17.396
About a half hour into the show,

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.732
I am literally, like,
in the fetal position.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:20.967
I'm, like, shaking,

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.902
and sweat is pouring
down my face.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.736
I'm not even looking
at the stage.

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.639
And my stomach is killing me.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.906
I really have
to use the restroom,

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.408
and I think, "You know what?"

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.043
"I'm gonna--I got to relieve
this pressure.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.413
"I'm gonna try
to release some gas.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:38.751
I'm just gonna try to finesse
some gas discreetly out of me."

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.120
So I kind of position myself

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.823
to do it discreetly,
you know.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.559
And this hot squirt...

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.927
[laughter]

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.396
Shoots out of my butt,

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.565
and I'm like...

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.666
"Oh, no."

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.935
[laughter]

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.738
And I feel this cold circle

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.573
forming in the back
of my pants.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.007
[laughter]

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:03.175
And I go up to my friends,
and I'm like,

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:04.944
"Look, guys, I'll be back."

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.913
And I, like, quickstep
out of the auditorium,

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.314
and I burst
out of the auditorium

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.317
into the lobby,
and I'm frantically looking

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.251
for the boys' restroom.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.953
And I see the boys' restroom,

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.789
and I kick open the door,
and I'm in the restroom.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.858
Now, the restroom at Palms

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:20.459
is similar to the restroom

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.629
at a bunch of underfunded
middle schools

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.631
all across the country.

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:27.300
There are two stalls.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.469
One of them has the door
completely ripped off.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.771
[laughter]

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.873
The other one,
I go in there.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:37.843
The toilet is filled
with paper towels

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:40.146
and someone else's shit.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.648
[laughter]

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:46.018
And I try to flush it.
It just won't go down.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:48.621
So, you know, I have--
I have a problem here.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.489
Which--it's a philosophical
question, really.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.357
Which one do you choose?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:54.326
Do you choose the one
without the door

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:57.830
or the one with--
that's filled with shit?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.866
And at this point, I'm, like--
I'm about to explode.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.201
So I-I have no choice.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.070
I close the door,
I pull down my pants.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.872
Now, you know you have
to take a shit

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:12.211
when you're willing to shit
on top of someone else's shit.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.012
[laughter]

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:16.148
So I, like, go into the stall,

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:19.418
and I'm, like, hovering
over the--the toilet,

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.021
and I just let it loose.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.422
And it's like--
it's not like a sh--

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:26.425
it's like a dam burst,
right?

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.861
It just--for, I mean,
a good 20 seconds,

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:29.896
it's like...

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:30.996
[imitates whooshing]

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.398
Just shooting out of me.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:35.200
It's like an exorcism,
right?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.537
And I--it's weird, because
it's like this spiritual--

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:42.375
it was this spiritual situation
going on.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.509
My eyes were closed,

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.211
and I felt like these demons

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.380
were, like, shooting
out of my body.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.883
Like all of those experiences
from middle school,

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.952
the kids beating me up,

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.188
and the kids, you know,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.189
stealing my stuff
from my locker,

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.024
and--and all the kids

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.892
pointing at me
and laughing at me,

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.861
it was just shooting out of me.

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:04.730
It was the most cathartic shit

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.632
I had ever taken in my life.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.700
[laughter]

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.034
[laughs] Right?

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:12.405
And it keeps going,
and then it just stops.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.907
And I open my eyes,

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.443
and I feel so good.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:18.544
I feel like a new man.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:23.149
I feel, like, completely reborn,
right?

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.618
And then I look down
at my shoes.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.786
[laughter and groans]

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.254
And I see this brown pool

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:32.224
start forming around my feet.

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:34.627
And then I look down
into my pants.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.596
It is filled to the brim

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.298
with shit.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:42.935
[laughter]

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.803
I look back at the toilet,

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:48.574
covered in shit...

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.909
[chuckles]

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.944
My shit
and the next dude's shit,

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.779
the dude before me.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.782
The wall,
splatters everywhere.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:07:01.287
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Oh, no."

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:03.956
And I see this renegade,
like, stream

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.491
start moving out
from under the stall.

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:08.794
And just on instinct,
I start squeegeeing it back in

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:10.262
with the side of my shoe,

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:11.463
and I'm like, "Oh, no.

00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:12.632
Oh, no, what do I do?"

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:15.100
I start pulling out
the toilet paper,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.703
and I start, like--
like a sinking rowboat,

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:21.473
I start, like, just, like,
scooping it out of my pants.

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.476
And I'm like, "Oh, no.
I need more.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.611
I-I need paper towels.
I need paper towels."

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.847
So I pull up my pants,
and they're heavy and cold.

00:07:28.847 --> 00:07:30.149
[laughter and groans]

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.651
And I, like,
Charlie Chaplin it

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:35.153
over to the paper towels,

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:37.690
and I start yanking out
paper towels,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.458
yanking 'em out.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.495
And then I hear
the audience applause.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.629
And I'm like,

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.132
"Oh, no,

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.801
"It's intermission.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.136
"It's the time in the show
when people go

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:52.838
to use the bathroom."

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.573
And I look out
into the bathroom.

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:58.377
There's, like, shit footprints
all over the floor,

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:02.848
streaks of shit
going underneath into the stall.

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:04.015
I look at the sink.

00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:07.386
Just shit droppings everywhere.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:10.823
The paper towel dispenser
just dripping with feces.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.858
It's--it's a crime scene.

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.193
[laughter]

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:16.595
And I hear the audience
walking into the lobby,

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:18.697
and I'm like, "Oh"--
at this point, I'm an animal.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.833
I'm just, like, acting
purely on instinct.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:24.770
And I run into the stall,
and I just close it,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.539
and I just stand there...

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.240
[laughter]

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.744
Just waiting for this onslaught
of people...

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.178
[laughs]

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:35.748
To be met with the surprise
of their life.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.084
[laughter]

00:08:39.084 --> 00:08:42.388
My feet clearly visible
under the stall,

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.857
but I'm like, "Okay, just--
just relax.

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.693
"Relax. Calm down.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.395
Calm down."

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.063
And I hear the door open,

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:54.033
and I literally hear
a grown man gasp.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.067
[gasps] "Ahh!"

00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:57.703
And then I hear the door close,

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.072
and I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, fuck."

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.473
[murmurs indistinctly]

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.876
[laughter]

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.578
[mouthing words]

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.145
[laughter]

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:09.248
And I hear the door open again,

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.416
a teenage boy
literally screaming,

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:12.651
"Ah!"

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:15.621
And the door closes,
and I'm like, "Oh, God.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:16.822
Oh, God."

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:20.292
[laughter]

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:21.660
The door opens again.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.763
I hear a father and son
walk in a few steps,

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:28.801
and I hear the son say,
"Daddy, what happened in here?"

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.069
And the father, I hear him go,
"Let's go, come on.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:34.106
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!"

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.008
And then the door closes.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:39.245
[laughter]

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.014
This happens over and over

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:44.917
and over and over again,

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.118
and I just want to die.

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:47.419
[laughter]

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:49.321
At one point,
I hear the door open,

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.124
and I hear a bunch of boys

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.293
busting out laughing.

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.528
And I hear the voice
of another boy say,

00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:57.996
"I told you.

00:09:57.996 --> 00:09:59.698
"I told you.
You thought I was lying.

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:01.967
I told you!"

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:06.105
At this point, I had become
a part of the talent show.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.673
[laughter]

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.008
My talent?

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:11.610
Shitting everywhere.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.513
[laughter]

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:19.551
The one bright spot
was when the door opened,

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:22.220
and I hear these feet
walk in gently

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.490
and this kind man's voice say,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.726
"Is everything okay in there?"

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.995
[laughter]

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:33.165
And my plan was to not exist,
to not say anything,

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:34.900
to just...
[laughs]

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.302
Just be quiet,
but it just came out of me,

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:40.839
and I said, "I'm okay."

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.809
[laughter]

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:49.248
And then the door closed.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.717
[laughter]

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:54.552
Now, eventually,
it got to the point

00:10:54.552 --> 00:10:56.488
where the door stopped opening

00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:58.857
and I didn't hear the audience
in the lobby,

00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:00.191
and I was like, "Oh, okay.

00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:02.194
"They must be back in the show.

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.029
"You know, the second half
must have begun.

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:07.700
Now's my time to get
the hell out of here."

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.067
So I open the stall,

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:10.869
open the bathroom door.

00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:14.206
I run out through the lobby,
out of the auditorium,

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.574
and I see my bike,

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.877
and I beeline to my bike
with my head down.

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.278
I'm not looking up.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:22.080
I'm just going straight
to my bike.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.183
And from the corner of my eye,

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.886
I see a group of kids

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:29.455
pointing at me

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.723
and laughing at me.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:33.892
And they're like, "That's him.
That's him.

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:35.260
"That's the shit guy.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.563
That's him."

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:40.265
And I realize I cannot run

00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:42.567
from the trauma
of my middle school years.

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.303
It is always gonna be with me.

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.071
And I get to my bike.

00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:48.073
I unlock the bike,
I jump on it,

00:11:48.073 --> 00:11:50.542
and I pedal home
as fast as I could,

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:53.412
and I never went back
to that middle school again.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.580
[laughter]
- Yeah.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.914
- That's it.
Thanks.

00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:57.249
[cheers and applause]
