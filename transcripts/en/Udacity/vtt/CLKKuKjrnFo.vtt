00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.811
let's try one last example in this series. So, in this example,

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:08.904
there are four blocks again. There are three bricks at the bottom and

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:12.930
two on the side, not touching each other. And there is a wedge this time at

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.230
the top, not a brick. Is this an example of the concept foo?
