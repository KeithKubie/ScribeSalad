fields and so I wanted to do something

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
fields and so I wanted to do something
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.920

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.950
about it
and so I brought 20 girls together put

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960
and so I brought 20 girls together put
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.390
and so I brought 20 girls together put
them into a classroom and technology

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400

year because all of our girls learned

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
year because all of our girls learned
 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.530
year because all of our girls learned
how to code because that wasn't clear

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540
how to code because that wasn't clear
 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.149

when we first put them in
 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.760
when we first put them in
classroom and AppNexus and to they fell

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770
classroom and AppNexus and to they fell
 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.770
classroom and AppNexus and to they fell
in love with computer science and they

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780
in love with computer science and they
 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.050

can you tell us a bit about where girls
 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.370
can you tell us a bit about where girls
who code is now and and how you went

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
who code is now and and how you went
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.500

and the following year we went from one
 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.250
and the following year we went from one
program to eight programs so we taught

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
program to eight programs so we taught
 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400

like I can't do this and they have to

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530
like I can't do this and they have to
 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.500
like I can't do this and they have to
get really used to failure and getting

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510
get really used to failure and getting
 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.879
get really used to failure and getting
the code or getting the algorithm wrong

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889
the code or getting the algorithm wrong
 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.349
the code or getting the algorithm wrong
and then trying again and then trying

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359
and then trying again and then trying
 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.449

use pop culture to actually inspire our
young girls to get involved in

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.010
young girls to get involved in
 

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.410
young girls to get involved in
technology and that's what we're doing

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:14.420
technology and that's what we're doing
 

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.270
technology and that's what we're doing
at girls who code I mean we had one of

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:16.280
at girls who code I mean we had one of
 

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.740
at girls who code I mean we had one of
the things we did with our girls in

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750
the things we did with our girls in
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.300
the things we did with our girls in
Detroit is they built you know their had

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.310
Detroit is they built you know their had

their robots dance to the Harlem shake
 

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.350
their robots dance to the Harlem shake
you know they actually did it with them

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360
you know they actually did it with them
 

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.900
you know they actually did it with them
I mean we're using pop culture you know

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:25.910
I mean we're using pop culture you know
 

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.640
I mean we're using pop culture you know
to get girls excited about computer

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.650
to get girls excited about computer
 

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.800
to get girls excited about computer
science yeah how do you think your life

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:29.810
science yeah how do you think your life
 

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.820
science yeah how do you think your life
would have been different if you had the

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:30.830
would have been different if you had the
 

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.200
would have been different if you had the
chance for dissipate and girls who put

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.210
chance for dissipate and girls who put
 

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.090
chance for dissipate and girls who put
when you were not so much different I

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100
when you were not so much different I
 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.310
when you were not so much different I
mean I grew up with a both parents

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320
mean I grew up with a both parents
 

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.320
mean I grew up with a both parents
remind we're engineers and I was

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.330
remind we're engineers and I was
 

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.870
remind we're engineers and I was
terrified of math and science growing up

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880
terrified of math and science growing up
 

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.090
terrified of math and science growing up
and it lasted throughout my career

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.100
and it lasted throughout my career
 

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.380

for me now it's so much of what I do
 

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.500
for me now it's so much of what I do
when I was in politics was about

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.510
when I was in politics was about
 

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.390
when I was in politics was about
building my website right being able to

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:52.400

everybody on staff including me has to
 

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.970
everybody on staff including me has to
learn how to code you know we can't be

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:03.980

education we need it yeah it definitely

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:16.700
education we need it yeah it definitely
 

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.030
education we need it yeah it definitely
is 21st century literacy and there's a

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
is 21st century literacy and there's a
 

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.380

see the ecosystem at in five years in
 

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.040
see the ecosystem at in five years in
ten years ah so I think that this is

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
ten years ah so I think that this is
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.930
ten years ah so I think that this is
kind of a 2050 problem and I have to

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:21.940
kind of a 2050 problem and I have to
 

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.520
kind of a 2050 problem and I have to
tell myself that every day right because

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.530
tell myself that every day right because
 

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.770

and they feel like it's slow but it's

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.190
and they feel like it's slow but it's
 

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.700
and they feel like it's slow but it's
really fast if that makes sense again I

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:29.710
really fast if that makes sense again I
 

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.110
really fast if that makes sense again I
go back to telling myself you know in

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120
go back to telling myself you know in
 

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.390
go back to telling myself you know in
the 70s 10% of women were lawyers and

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:33.400
the 70s 10% of women were lawyers and
 

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.250
the 70s 10% of women were lawyers and
doctors and now that number is almost

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.260
doctors and now that number is almost
 

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.100
doctors and now that number is almost
over 40% less than you know 40 years

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.110
over 40% less than you know 40 years
 

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.010
over 40% less than you know 40 years
later that's where I want to be that's

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.020
later that's where I want to be that's
 

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.420
later that's where I want to be that's
where we want to be as an organization

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:42.430
where we want to be as an organization
