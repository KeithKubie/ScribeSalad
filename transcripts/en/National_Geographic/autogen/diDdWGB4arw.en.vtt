electricity with a wind turbine well I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
electricity with a wind turbine well I
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980
electricity with a wind turbine well I
got this windmill because I wanted to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
got this windmill because I wanted to
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.429
got this windmill because I wanted to
produce some electricity with our

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
produce some electricity with our
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.009
produce some electricity with our
household and I wanted to produce the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
household and I wanted to produce the
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.550
household and I wanted to produce the
twist take carbon dioxide free the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
twist take carbon dioxide free the

family of seven uses electricity like a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
family of seven uses electricity like a
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229
family of seven uses electricity like a
typical household we like using the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
typical household we like using the
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.319
typical household we like using the
computers watching the television and we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
computers watching the television and we
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.840
computers watching the television and we
like taking hot showers like everybody

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
like taking hot showers like everybody
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.110
like taking hot showers like everybody
else by having a windmill we can do that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
else by having a windmill we can do that
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.569
else by having a windmill we can do that
with a good conscience because we know

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
with a good conscience because we know
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.110
with a good conscience because we know
that the power we consume doesn't expose

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
that the power we consume doesn't expose
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.869
that the power we consume doesn't expose
the environment now we produce

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
the environment now we produce
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569
the environment now we produce
electricity without producing carbon

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
electricity without producing carbon
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.600
electricity without producing carbon
dioxide it feels the right to take our

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
dioxide it feels the right to take our
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.349
dioxide it feels the right to take our
little part of the responsibility of

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359
little part of the responsibility of
 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.030
little part of the responsibility of
getting better environment right now the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
getting better environment right now the
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.070
getting better environment right now the
wind is approximately 5.2 m/s and right

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
wind is approximately 5.2 m/s and right
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800
wind is approximately 5.2 m/s and right
now the windmill is producing 4.2

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
now the windmill is producing 4.2
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710
now the windmill is producing 4.2
kilowatt and I'll guess that the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
kilowatt and I'll guess that the
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240
kilowatt and I'll guess that the
household right now is using

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
household right now is using
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.450
household right now is using
approximately two kilowatt so right now

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
approximately two kilowatt so right now
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.020
approximately two kilowatt so right now
we have an excess production of 2 kilo

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
we have an excess production of 2 kilo
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030
we have an excess production of 2 kilo
it this means that some of the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
it this means that some of the
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190
it this means that some of the
electricity is sold to other households

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
electricity is sold to other households
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289
electricity is sold to other households
and when it is windy the turbine

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
and when it is windy the turbine
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420
and when it is windy the turbine
produces enough electricity for seven

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
produces enough electricity for seven
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090
produces enough electricity for seven
other families their next goal is to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
other families their next goal is to
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830
other families their next goal is to
replace one of their vehicles with an

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
replace one of their vehicles with an
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260
replace one of their vehicles with an
electric car what our future plans is to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
electric car what our future plans is to
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899
electric car what our future plans is to
reduce this carbon darksied emission

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
reduce this carbon darksied emission
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.060
reduce this carbon darksied emission
from the cars by changing worth of cars

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
from the cars by changing worth of cars
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700
from the cars by changing worth of cars
to an electric vehicle right now it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
to an electric vehicle right now it's
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350
to an electric vehicle right now it's
not possible to buy one of those cars

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
not possible to buy one of those cars
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080
not possible to buy one of those cars
because they are not at the market but I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
because they are not at the market but I
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880
because they are not at the market but I
guess there will be at the market during

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
guess there will be at the market during
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130
guess there will be at the market during
a year or so and then we will change the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
a year or so and then we will change the
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.700
a year or so and then we will change the
little car for an electric vehicle are

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
little car for an electric vehicle are
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310
little car for an electric vehicle are
using an electric vehicle we can charge

using an electric vehicle we can charge
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740
using an electric vehicle we can charge
it from the window during the night we

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
it from the window during the night we
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719
it from the window during the night we
don't use very much visited during the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
don't use very much visited during the
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.680
don't use very much visited during the
night

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690

used to judge the batteries on the
