AMRIT SANJEEV: Hello.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.769
I'm Amrit Sanjeev from
the Developer Show.

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.310
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.400
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.810
Android P beta two
is now available.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.140
This update includes a final
Android P APIs, the latest

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.360
system images, and
updated developer tools

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.180
to help you get ready for the
customer release coming later

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.300
in the summer.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.210
For more details on
machine learning,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.330
simplicity, polish, and
security in this release,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.160
head over to the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.900
We advise developers to use keys
generated on the user device

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.459
to encrypt push
messages end to end,

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:36.250
but implementing such
end-to-end encryption

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.280
has historically required
significant technical knowledge

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.440
and effort, which is why we're
excited to announce Capillary

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.090
open-source library
to greatly simplify

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.520
the implementation of
end-to-end encryption of push

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.680
messages between
the developer server

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.080
and the user's Android devices.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.210
For more details
and to get started,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.860
take a look at the post.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.920
Chrome 68 Beta is now
available and includes

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.900
a new Add to Home
Screen behavior

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.500
for Progressive Web Apps, the
payment handler API, the page

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100
lifecycle API, and more.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.950
Take a look at the post
for all the details,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.550
including screenshots and code.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.220
We recently announced changes
including our new simplified

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.010
maps, routes, and places
products, as well as

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.100
new pricing plans to make
our products easier to use

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.320
and more scalable as you grow.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.630
Make sure to visit the
post for the three steps

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.680
that you need to take
prior to June 11.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.540
Sole-tenant nodes are now
available on Google Compute

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.070
Engine in beta.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.980
Sole-tenant nodes are physical
compute engines servers

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.080
designed for your dedicated use.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.895
Normally, [INAUDIBLE]
instances run

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.510
on physical hosts that may
be shared by many customers.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.920
With sole-tenant nodes, you
have the host all to yourself.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.660
Check out the post
to get started.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.690
Last week, New Orleans hosted
the North American Association

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.000
for Computational
Linguistics Conference, which

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.560
is a venue for the
latest research

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.810
on computational
approaches to understanding

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.120
national language.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.220
We presented our research
on a diverse set of topics,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.430
including dialog, summarization,
machine translation,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.959
and linguistic analysis.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.000
