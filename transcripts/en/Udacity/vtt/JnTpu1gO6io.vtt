00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.870
Congratulations.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.780
If you followed along with me,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.540
you should have a cluster of eight
nodes including the Ambari server.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.840
You know to expand your cluster
as well as configure it for

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.320
high availability of the name node.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.970
For many situations, you won't need
a cluster running all the time, and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.500
Idol cluster is a waste of money and
computation time.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.740
A solution is to use an on
demand cluster such as

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.004
Amazon Elastic MapReduce.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.680
In the next lesson, you'll learn how to
use Elastic MapReduce to easily create

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.430
a Hadoop cluster.
