00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.140
OK.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.680
We're going to get going.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome everybody.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.430
It is wonderful to see so
many friendly faces, people

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.250
that I know, many members of
these project teams, all here

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.320
because of a great
deal of work that's

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
happened over the last
year or 18 months.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.540
My name is Erin Driver-Linn.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.410
We have a speaker
series in HILT that we

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.480
try to do once a semester.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.270
We think of this
speaker series as a way

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.210
to bring in members
of our community,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.940
or people from outside, who are
scholars doing their own work

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.340
and who are applying something
in their scholarship,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.200
or loosely related
to their scholarship,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.450
to teaching and
learning improvement.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.130
And this time around,
we were thinking

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.010
we should maybe have a
separate event for curriculum

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.170
mapping instead of doing
our usual speaker series,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.420
where we'd feature one person.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.860
Instead, we said, why not?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
This kind of fits in our
speaker series theme.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.370
But how in the
world are we going

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
to have all of these people
speak and be able to get

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.500
through all of these ideas?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.960
So we feel-- with a little
bit of misgivings, today, I'm

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
going to be emceeing and walking
through a lot of projects that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.620
don't represent my
thinking or my work at all,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.980
and instead represent the
fine ideas of these people,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.110
and hope that I
can get most of it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.000
right-- that we can
get a kind of overview.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.625
And then we're going to pull out
a couple of different projects

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.960
for a little bit
of a deeper dive.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.880
Before we go into each of
these individual projects,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810
there's a couple of other
things that I want to do.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.680
So I want to give a little
bit of organizational context

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280
and the story of
how we came to begin

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.875
using this term,
"curriculum mapping"

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.921
and begin putting all of
these projects together.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.420
And then we're going
to really focus

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.570
for a while on the
data infrastructure

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.800
and the kind of tools and ways
of thinking and data sources

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.550
that we think will help amplify
all of these projects moving

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.560
forward, and hopefully
catalyze many of you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.190
to be thinking of other
sorts of curriculum mapping

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.810
kinds of work.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.910
And for that part
of today's agenda,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.180
Dustin is going to run
through some of the many tools

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.770
that he's been working on.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.360
And then we hope to have
quite a bit of time for Q&amp;A.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.060
One of the things that I think
is really important for us

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.660
to try to get to in the
question and answer time

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.400
is what are we-- what's
the upshot of all of this?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.910
How do we pull the
picture together

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.950
with all of these
different kinds of projects

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.980
and understand from a
broader perspective where

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.250
the university ought
to be around making

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.440
the curriculum
visible for students,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.110
for faculty, and
for administrators?

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.940
And then, finally, we'll
have a reception where people

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.860
can talk with one another.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.220
And if you find that there's
something particularly

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.710
interesting about one of
these projects, or a question

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.140
that you have that you'll
be able to identify

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.260
the people who-- you'll see
their faces on the screen,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.390
or you may see them up here.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.370
And go up and talk
with them and see

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.090
if there's some way that there
is an action item coming out

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.940
of the work that you
can see in your roles

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.450
with members of these teams.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.280
So the story of
curriculum mapping.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.916
Overheard in the yard in 2016.

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:53.790
I don't even know why
it was required to take

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.900
a course before this one.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.382
It didn't really
help prepare me.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:57.840
I asked the professor,
and he said,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.048
he didn't really know either.

00:03:59.048 --> 00:04:01.470
He said, he was told it should
be listed as a pre-req when

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.708
he started here and was asked to
take over teaching the course.

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:07.030
[LAUGHING]

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.440
So this is slightly outside
of the yard, where I heard it.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.740
And this is a paraphrase.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.680
I didn't actually
take the quote down.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.950
But the three parts
of this I overheard,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.130
which was a student
saying he didn't

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.080
understand why he was
having to take something

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.620
as a prerequisite.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.990
And saying that the
professor didn't know either.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.330
And then the inherited
part that the professor

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.040
inherited the course.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.760
And so all of these
things, I think,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.220
are related to how
a curriculum evolves

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.200
and how it begins
to-- it may have

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.760
started with an intentional
plan, within a department, say.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.640
And then it evolves over time
in a way that it's lost--

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.710
we've lost the thread,
so that students

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.640
and faculty and decision
makers who are administrators

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.840
in the department
no longer know why

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.100
these sequences go together,
why courses go together.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.510
And we certainly don't
have an insight, often,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.120
into the kinds of things
that are being taught

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.530
in someone else's
course that may

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.280
have a title even very similar
to the one that we're teaching.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.220
Hearing this and
similar kinds of things,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.920
I became more
attuned to the work

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.380
that other people were
doing that seemed like it

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.110
was addressing this kind of--

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.740
a set of problems.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.810
And then I was at
a reception at MIT.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.870
And I met a faculty
member there named

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.680
Karen Willcox who is a professor
of aeronautical engineering.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.200
And she was working with
a bunch of MIT students

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.760
to really carefully
map their curriculum.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.590
So that got me super excited.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.840
And we brought Karen over for
a speaker series, was it--

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.850
three speaker series ago.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.140
And I thought this
is our solution.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.860
Karen's architecture and
what she's working on,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.410
we can just import it here.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.580
And so we tried to do that.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.680
And it didn't work,
because we're Harvard.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.030
And we're not like MIT.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.920
And I should have known that.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.790
Of course, I do know that.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.490
But we instead, I
think, have to do it

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.010
a different way,
which is to identify

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.580
all of the different kinds of
curricular mapping exercises,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.640
and then think about
how do they individually

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.580
sum up to something that
we can take and think

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.710
about systematic ways of making
the curriculum more visible.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.310
So part of what we
were doing initially

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.030
was having a small working
group that got together.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.550
And then the working
group began to expand.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.520
And it has continued to expand,
and players in this picture

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.080
have come in and out,
and there are probably

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.950
slots there that we could
put different faces.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.720
And then at different
times when we've

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.530
tried to explain how these
curriculum mapping projects

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.620
may or may not go together--

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.480
I've bucketed them.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.940
And these are two buckets--

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.060
ways that we've
tried to bucket them.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.820
It's imperfect, but we're
going to try to follow along

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.610
a little bit as a way to give
a structure to all of these 10

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.110
projects.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.840
So projects addressing
content that's

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.940
taught across Harvard
schools and projects

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.220
addressing student
learning and enrollment

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.670
patterns within subjects is the
way we're talking about this.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.940
So we have this
working group and then

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.370
we have an organization that
holds many organizations

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.860
in the Office of the
President and Provost.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.350
And our role, within
the Vice Provost

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.370
for Advances in
Learning umbrella

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.100
is to try to help
the schools who

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.010
are working on their own
teaching and learning efforts.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.660
And we do so in
different ways in

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.940
these different organizations.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.797
So HILT, our role--

00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:00.880
I'll say a little bit more
about HILT in a minute,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.500
but we primarily do grant
making and convening.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:12.250
And HarvardX, as you know, is
really an amazing organization

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.320
for experimentation in
curriculum design, pedagogy,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.930
and even understanding new
ways that courses and content

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.070
can be sequenced, but
mostly in the online space.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:30.430
And VPAL Research,
headed by Dustin,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.659
is an organization
that draws on the data

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.760
structures from
residential education

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.890
and from online education to
help to build tools and build

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.850
a research program that
can help us understand

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.240
teaching and learning
improvements more broadly.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.010
Out of VPAL Research came
another organization,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.940
DART, Digital Assets
for Reuse and Teaching.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.760
And we think DART could actually
be considered a curriculum

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.480
mapping project, which is a
little confusing, because it's

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.910
an organization, and it's
part of another organization.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.020
But it's also one of
these curricular mapping

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.690
projects, which we'll
say a little bit

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.950
more about in a minute.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.547
So HILT's mission is catalyzing
innovation and excellence

00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:21.130
in learning and teaching and,
as I said, largely through grant

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.004
making and convening.

00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:24.940
And I just wanted to
put up the team pictures

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.010
today, because I
hope you will be

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.970
able to meet your colleagues
during the reception.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.110
And because we have three
new members of our team.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.770
We have Allison Pingree,
we have Cassie--

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.330
Cassie McGrath, and we have
Zach Wang, who started today.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:43.830
[LAUGHING]

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.180
Yay!

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.590
Great to start on a day when
we have an event like this one.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.900
Each of the colleagues
in HILT, and that

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.510
includes Melissa Godet
and Jaime Goldstein.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.104
Where's Jaime?

00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:06.250
Oh, right there.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.930
And Bea Frain, have
been helping the overall

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.380
with HILT. But I want to just
say, in particular, that Jaime

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:19.010
has been taking a leadership
role in trying to have all

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.110
of these curricular
mapping projects

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.710
have a kind of coherence and
get the working groups together

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.610
and have us work together.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.220
And so we'll send another
thank you your way later,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.030
but all of their goals
relate to the next steps

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.850
for the university, as we
think through what to do

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.170
with these various projects.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.710
So shifting from the
organizational context

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.380
and the story behind us
putting all of these projects

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.408
together--

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.180
I like to think of
Dustin as a jump starter.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.580
And I actually have the
visual of those, like,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.700
clamps you put on
the dead battery--

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.830
like, you open the hood
and you put the clamps

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.950
on the dead battery, and
you give the jump start.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.180
And so early on
when we were talking

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.000
about these curricular
mapping ideas,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.800
and he met Karen
Willcox, and he was like,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.325
I can do this in
the gov department.

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:20.600
I can build something.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.640
And it seemed like the
next week there was

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.990
something for us to look at.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.040
And he began to iterate.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.669
And of course, that
early view moved

00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:29.210
into a number of
different directions

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.540
that he's going to talk about.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.760
But I thought because
he's the jump starter

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.880
I would use the enrollment view
project as a way to orient you

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.670
to these slides and the
way we're going to try

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.520
to talk through these projects.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.300
So you see on the
bottom of these slides--

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.720
I think I have a pointer
here, this line--

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.390
and it represents a rough
progression of project phases.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.400
So identifying
what it is you want

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.550
to do, collecting data,
analyzing it, exploring

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.410
solutions, testing them,
making some short-term changes,

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.890
iterating, getting more
testing, and, then,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.530
eventually getting to
where we're expanding

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.230
and doing something
that's more systematic.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.920
And what we've tried
to do is put in red

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.802
where we think these
projects are now.

00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:27.260
One could argue
with it, but that's

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.400
where we-- what
we've tried to do.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.670
And with each of
these projects we'll

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.590
introduce the set
of questions that

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.650
motivate the work and
the key constituencies.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.160
So here, what are the student
patterns of course choice

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.970
within the gov department?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.210
How do they change for
subgroups of students?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.760
What are the relationships
between courses?

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.196
What are the learning
objectives for each course?

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:53.570
And then the key
constituencies--

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.340
undergraduate students
and the gov department.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.500
Where do we want to be with
this project one year from now?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.020
All FAS departments
actively using

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.060
a version of enrollment view.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.220
Faculty discovering
their nearest neighbor.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.280
And here we get to another
curricular mapping project,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.710
Andrew Ho who will talk
about this in a minute.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.510
The nearest neighbor
project has now

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.930
sort of integrated a little
bit with the enrollment view

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.860
project.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.640
And that's where we
hope these things go,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.140
as we begin to think of the
synergies and the integrations.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.190
And then the hope from
the particular point

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.220
of view of this project
for curriculum mapping

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.240
at Harvard, broadly--

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.700
surface enrollment
patterns within departments

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.290
and across departments,
teaching your class,

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.272
mindful of other classes
that your students are in.

00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:49.730
And there is a
pretty picture here.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.380
And I'm not going to talk
about the pretty picture

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.345
because Dustin is going to talk
about the pretty picture now.

00:13:57.886 --> 00:14:01.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.706
Thank you, Erin, for
the introduction.

00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:05.080
If I'm a jump
starter, I hope I'm

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.460
on the positive
side of the lead.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.670
So my name's Dustin Tingley.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.100
I'm a professor of government
and I'm also the Faculty

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.912
Director of VPAL Research.

00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:16.120
This is a little bit of an
explanation of what we do.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.630
And we have a really fortunate
role in the university

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.020
to straddle the online space
and working with our partners

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.250
in HarvardX, but
also residential.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.680
And that gives us
an opportunity to be

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.450
aware of a variety of different
approaches to education,

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.130
a variety of different
types of data

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.380
streams that come out
of those approaches,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.450
and really trying to
leverage insights that

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.380
come from both sides.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.840
How do we help HarvardX
with what we learn

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.250
from the residential space?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.800
And how do we enhance the
residential space, given

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.200
what we know from HarvardX?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.470
I should say that this is
framed around VPAL Research,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.680
but in doing so, we
definitely work very closely

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.670
with the folks over in HUIT
who control a lot of the data

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.450
systems and whatnot.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.814
And they're a huge partner.

00:15:03.814 --> 00:15:05.980
And I'm just really glad
to see some folks from HUIT

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.190
here today.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.190
So what I'm going to do briefly
is to just layout that--

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.770
Harvard has this
huge, rich array

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.130
of different sources
of data that touch

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.220
on teaching and learning,
ranging from the Student

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.750
Information System, the course
catalog, the Canvas Learning

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.177
Management System-- this is
where you're running a course.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.260
You have a course website.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.710
This is where you go
to find a syllabus,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.010
or engage in a discussion forum,
or find readings, et cetera.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.710
We have student evaluation data.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.940
I'm not going to talk
about any of that.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.250
But that's a really
rich source of data.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.720
We have a whole range of
Harvard YouTube channels.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.150
So these are official
Harvard YouTube channels.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.580
And there's a lot of
great content on it.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.720
We have HarvardX.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.780
And then we have a whole layer
of really just being mindful

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.350
of who should get access to
what data and what information.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.050
I don't need to get access
to all of the information

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.050
that someone in institutional
research can get access to.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.980
I don't need that.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.000
And so we're very mindful of
thinking through authentication

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.530
and just permissions.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.500
And here, HarvardKey,
which has really

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.680
come online in a major way
in the past couple of years

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.340
has been really helpful
for a variety of projects.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.950
So the Student Information
System-- many of you

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.530
might think about this as
something like my.Harvard.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.582
And this is a place
where students go.

00:16:28.582 --> 00:16:30.790
It's where they're going to
do different registration

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.290
operations, et cetera.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.660
And this is a--

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.260
not just an interface for
students and for faculty

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.710
and for staff, but it also has
a big data layer behind it,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.430
right.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.604
And that data layer
is very valuable.

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.020
I'll showcase a
couple of the ways

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.530
that we've been
thinking about it.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.140
And it's not just on
projects that I've worked on,

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.848
but there's also been
other projects that

00:16:51.848 --> 00:16:53.830
have benefited
from the nice work

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.470
that HUIT has put
into architecting

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.800
the kind of database
back end for my.Harvard.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.339
So one example of this
is the enrollment view.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:10.089
So this is literally just asking
a question of what courses--

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.339
if someone has taken a
course in the gov department,

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.950
what were the other courses
that they took, right?

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.420
What sequence of
courses did they take?

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.520
Or to get to Andrew
Ho's brilliant idea

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.619
about nearest neighbors,
if I'm teaching

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.970
a course, what are the other
courses that my students are

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.720
enrolled in?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.580
That's actually really
valuable information.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.310
What are they experiencing as
they are going through what

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.129
I want them to experience?

00:17:35.129 --> 00:17:37.420
And we'll talk a little bit
more about nearest neighbor

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.540
in a second.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.660
And you can think
about these things.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.330
So this is going to be for
the physics department.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.130
So we've been working
with them, as well.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.480
So I'm teaching a class.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.120
There are these other classes
that students are enrolled in.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.320
You can even see the second
order nearest neighbor.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320
This is like not your
neighbor, but the neighbor

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.330
down the street, right.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.600
And what classes that
overlap are happening there.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.690
Or what's the sequence of
classes that people are taking?

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.460
What have people
taken before my class?

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.766
And what do people statistically
tend to take afterwards?

00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:08.140
And then, finally,
there's always

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.420
questions about, like, are
there trends in enrollment

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.880
that we within a department
administratively look at.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.820
And so this is
something that we will

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.260
be rolling out to a whole
range of FAS departments.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.490
I'm working quite
closely with Harvard's

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.450
institutional research and
our friends over in HUIT

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.810
to be able to do.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.640
Another project was just saying,
let's bring together easy ways

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.470
to just search
course descriptions.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.470
And this was an effort that
arose out of our friends

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.930
in the Safra Center
for Ethics just wanting

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.260
to know, where are
people teaching ethics?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.440
And so we are able to, again,
work with folks at HUIT to be

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.220
able to import all of the course
description information that we

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.040
could get, also grab some
of that information for some

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.310
of the other schools that aren't
on my.Harvard and put it in one

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.470
place, make it searchable,
and do all sorts of--

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.310
be able to make nice
plots of different things.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:06.570
A challenge of-- it's
not really a challenge.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.470
It's just sort of a
reality, is that we

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.667
are a little bit spread out
in terms of our data systems.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:13.250
And that's OK.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.070
That's changing.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.280
This is a little bit of
a moving target, as well.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.660
This is not fixed in stone.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.110
It might change in the coming
months and year and whatnot.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.350
But there are some different
data systems out there.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.440
We have been working a lot
with the my.Harvard back end.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.060
But there are some
others out there.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.390
And one of the
things that we do is

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.020
to try to think about
common underlying things

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.360
so that even if people have
different data systems,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.890
we can bring that data together
and have it be meaningful to be

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.780
co-located together.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.720
A final piece that really,
I think, highlights

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.240
the opportunities
for merging data

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.370
from a whole
variety of systems--

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.290
this is the syllabus
exploration tool.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.040
This is something that is now
available to anyone in FAS.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.330
You can go to a
syllabus.hmdc.harvard.edu,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.950
and you can search across
most of the syllabi that

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.290
are used in the FAS.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:08.790
OK.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.520
So how do we do that?

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.520
So what's one thing
that you're supposed

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.447
to do if you're an instructor
on your Canvas site?

00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:19.280
What's one thing that
you're supposed to do?

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.420
What should you do?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.750
You should post your syllabus.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.500
OK.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.610
Now, you are going to do that
in a variety of different ways

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.039
because I can see that data.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.080
There are particular ways
we prefer you to do it,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.520
but whatever, we'll
figure it out.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.130
And so what we did is we--

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.380
working very closely
with Dean Mike Smith--

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.340
went out and got
syllabi from across all

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.790
of these different
courses, took those files,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.190
extracted the text
from them, and then

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.930
essentially made it
searchable, right.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.210
So you can go in, and you
can find people's syllabi,

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.480
and actually get the actual
file that was their syllabus.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.530
And think of the syllabi
as being essentially

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.340
like a curated reading list.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.970
So if you're writing
a senior thesis,

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.920
and you're interested
in some topic,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.830
well, one thing you could do is
you could go to Google and type

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.970
in that topic.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.880
And then, who knows where
you're going, right?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.920
But why not, if you
could, in a sense,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.190
like Google the inside of some
of the most brilliant people's

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.314
minds in the world.

00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:22.730
And see what they would suggest
reading, given your topic.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.830
That would be a much
greater opportunity.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.320
So the syllabus project
took information

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.810
from Canvas, the learning
management system on the one

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.650
hand, brought it together
with some other information

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.300
from the operational data
storage system in HUIT,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.920
and put those things together.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.830
And now we have this
as a product for FAS.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.930
And furthermore, it's
been written in a way

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.512
that we hope some of our
friends from other schools

00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:49.220
would be interested
in joining the party.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.200
So at some point, this
could be something

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.920
like syllabus.harvard.edu
and really scale

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.149
across the institution.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.190
That's a dream right now,
but I'm a jump starter.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.540
So I'll leave it there.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.040
All right.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.873
So now, we're going to
romp through a series

00:22:02.873 --> 00:22:03.740
of these projects.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:10.610
And as we do, I'm hoping that
when we look at the project

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.980
teams, that members
of those project teams

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.030
will stand up and turn around,
so that everyone else can

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.570
see them.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.986
So that when we
have the reception

00:22:18.986 --> 00:22:22.490
they know who to
go and talk with.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.476
Oh, this was the
little exhibit to say

00:22:25.476 --> 00:22:27.350
we're not going to talk
about enrollment view

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.410
because we've already talked
about enrollment view.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.934
And then when we get to the
physics learning outcomes,

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:35.600
we're going to have
a little deeper dive

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.580
with that particular project.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.670
But we're going to start
with common competencies

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.885
for a master's redesign.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.014
So Matt Miller, Becca Miller--

00:22:50.014 --> 00:22:50.780
No relation.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.340
No relation.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.660
[LAUGHING]

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.560
Sitting on opposite
sides of the room,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.170
but working very closely
with their colleagues,

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.170
helped the School of
Education get to a place

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.490
where, in May, they
voted successfully

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.240
on a curricular reform
for the master's programs

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.540
at the school.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.600
And I think it
took a lot of work

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.710
and a lot of thinking
to get there.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.820
And I want us to just imagine
some of the challenges here,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.660
like a master's student
who comes to the Ed School

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.840
could choose one of
13 different tracks.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.540
There are about 700 that
come from master's programs

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.410
and you're just on
campus for one year.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:39.740
Now, how do you think
about a professional school

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.240
in education and imagine each
of those different tracks

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.360
and educating them to have the
competencies to go out and do

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.520
what they need to do in
a bunch of different ways

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.150
in a bunch of different
kinds of professions?

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.100
So at the Ed School, people--

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.020
the students, as I
understand it, they come in

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.670
and it's not like undergraduates
coming into a core program

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.900
and learning what it is
that they want to do.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.150
They're professional students.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.340
They have some ideas about
what they want to do.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.250
But they come from all
different kinds of backgrounds.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.070
And some people want
to be data scientists,

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.249
and some people want
to be policy makers,

00:24:16.249 --> 00:24:17.790
and some people want
to be educators,

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.904
and some people want
to be superintendents.

00:24:19.904 --> 00:24:22.320
And there's different ways
that you might come in and want

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.500
to use a master's program.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.380
So part of the
curriculum redesign

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.140
was a set of
discussions about what

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.400
are the core competencies
that faculty can agree on

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.500
should cross all of these.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.590
But how can we, now,
using technology,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.149
using what we understand
about pedagogy,

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:46.690
actually think through how to
deliver that in a personalized,

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.810
individualized way
for students who

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.490
come from different
backgrounds and need

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.830
to go into different places.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.550
So it's a tough set of problems.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.320
And I'm focusing
on it a little bit

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.060
because I think it's
a set of problems

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.970
that many of our
schools struggle with,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.160
many of the professional
schools, in particular.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.576
You have people
who are coming in,

00:25:06.576 --> 00:25:08.470
and all of these
different backgrounds,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.070
and they need to go out
in these different ways.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.550
But you have to,
as a school, say

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.170
what are these
core competencies,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.500
and how might we deliver
education flexibly,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.350
in individualized ways, to
be able to get them through

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.570
and learn from the time
while they're on campus,

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.450
which isn't very long.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:32.010
So how do we allow
learners flexibility

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.440
as they're attaining the same
professional competencies,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.820
leverage technology and data to
support diverse adult learners,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.320
prepare professionals for an
evolving career in education?

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.450
And the key constituents here
are master's degree students,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.840
faculty, staff, and alumni.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:55.680
And you can see where
they see this process.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.750
Goals by next year--

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.320
launch a first foundational
course, How People Learn.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.500
And this is, I think, a
really remarkable experiment.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.040
The How People Learn
course, which I think

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.580
is a collaboration with
other people in VPAL,

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:17.370
and is being built right now
as an individualized, flexible

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.000
program.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.830
And it relates to
all of our interests.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.420
And many people here
have an interest

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.870
in what are pre-matriculation
materials that

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.520
could be provided before
people even get on campus.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.790
So in addition, they're thinking
about, as part of a curriculum

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.520
mapping project,
learner profiles.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.922
How individual students can
identify where they want to go,

00:26:44.922 --> 00:26:46.380
what their course
progression looks

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.060
like, and the kinds
of things that they

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.280
may be taking on
in incompetencies

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.990
as they go through the program.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.200
How that, as a data source,
might relate to other data

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.970
sources in the school, allowing
for more visibility, as you're

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.752
going rapidly through
a set of courses.

00:27:04.752 --> 00:27:06.460
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard--

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.760
collaborative exploration
and innovation

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.450
around personalized,
competency-based, professional

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.880
education.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.010
So nearest neighbors,
also an Ed School project.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.510
Andrew Ho.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.030
This was Andrew's
brainchild, I believe partly

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:35.070
as GSE faculty member, partly
as faculty chair of the VPAL

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.540
Research Committee.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.170
And some of the
questions are who

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.410
are the students that
are in your class, what

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.090
other classes are they taking?

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.730
And what should I know from
the faculty members who

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.900
are teaching those classes
about what they are doing

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.440
in their classroom that I can
leverage and optimize when

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.850
I'm teaching in my classroom.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.520
How can we make it pretty
easy and quick for people

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.780
to learn from one another?

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.060
If you begin to nurture these
neighborhoods of instructors,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.350
can we call--

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.880
can we create some coherency--
even more coherency and maybe

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.170
some ways of teaching that make
better use of people's time?

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:23.580
So at the moment, this is
being used by HGSE faculty,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.820
but next year, your school.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.790
So this, like some of the
other projects that Dustin

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.950
was talking about,
it wouldn't be

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.250
that hard to adapt and to
move into different schools

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.480
and different kinds of programs.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.155
So it's in a phase
of user testing.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.360
Can people read
the print on this?

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.020
Yes.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:49.520
All right.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.160
So you can see that the way
this visual works is you've

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.150
got the course in the
center, which is red,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.080
being your course.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.410
And you can see, in
the previous semester,

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:06.060
what percentage of your students
were in these other classes,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.960
and what percentage in
the current semester

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.370
were in these other classes.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.700
And you can also begin to use
this data to project forward,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.270
to predict what percentage
might be in other classes.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:22.810
And by June, full integration
of this nearest neighbors

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:28.270
visual data set with VPAL
instructor tools, emails

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.620
to instructors answering,
"Who's your nearest neighbor?"

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.290
And "What do good neighbors
do for each other?"

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.895
That sounds sort
of Mr. Rogers like.

00:29:36.895 --> 00:29:39.990
[LAUGHING]

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.940
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard,

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.310
clear focus on the
question, whose question

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.110
are we answering?

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.080
Yes, I agree.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.900
And how actionable
is the answer?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.180
OK.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.715
Science advising-- Logan.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.360
Logan is Director
of Science Education

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.300
and, as you can see there,
has other titles, as well--

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.370
is an amazing instructor.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.130
And the questions, here, are
which structures and systems

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.440
will nurture and support
undergraduate research?

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.440
How do we meaningfully
connect undergraduate research

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.910
to the curricular experience?

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.070
Which skills and
competencies should we

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.970
be fostering and assessing from
students research experience?

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.860
Science concentration advisors
are a key constituency group,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.920
undergraduate students,
and research mentors.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.280
And from what I
understand, as you

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.110
began to think about this work
and this project and making

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.910
research experience
for undergraduates

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.460
more visible to
science advisors,

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.180
you maybe worked with Harvard
College Institutional Research,

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.110
got some data, and saw that 90%
of undergraduates in the life

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.260
sciences have done some
sort of research experience

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.030
during their time at Harvard.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.980
And in the largest undergraduate
biology concentrations,

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.749
70% of undergraduate
research is done not at FAS,

00:31:06.749 --> 00:31:09.040
but at the School of Public
Health, the medical school,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.149
and affiliated hospitals.

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:11.690
The kinds of things
that you wouldn't

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.230
know, unless you're
making these sorts of data

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.960
accessible and visible, and then
into the awareness of science

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.340
advisors.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.190
So this, of course,
raises questions, as well,

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.980
about the oversight,
and if we're

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.640
capitalizing on
undergraduate research work

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.360
that's being already done
in the best possible way.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.470
Goals by June 2019--

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.850
a mix of top down and
bottom up data collection

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.420
around undergraduate
research in science,

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.400
making data
accessible and useful

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.970
to inform advising about
research and courses.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.220
And hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard-- students

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.880
make more informed decisions
about the research,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.740
make more connections
between research

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.404
and the rest of the curriculum.

00:32:01.404 --> 00:32:03.070
I don't know how we
do that, but I think

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.710
it's incredibly important.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.870
And we hear all the time,
how important that is.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.550
How do these
research experiences

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:13.360
integrate with the
rest of the curriculum?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.370
So I'm now going to
step down and let

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.260
us have a little
break from my droning

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.410
on and hear a little bit more
depth from Logan and Louis

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.420
about this last in this category
of the curriculum mapping

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:28.920
projects.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.600
So in the physics
department, where Louis and I

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.645
are both faculty
members, we started

00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:42.500
to get interested in questions
about departmental level

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.060
learning objectives
and department

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.170
level learning outcomes.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.590
So a little bit of
history behind this.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.030
So Chris Stubbs, who recently
served a term as interim chair

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.449
and previously had been chair
of the physics department,

00:32:55.449 --> 00:32:56.990
has long been
interested in improving

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.790
undergraduate education.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.780
When he was the
department chair,

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.460
he brought Carl Wieman to
campus to talk to faculty

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.807
about creating learning
objectives for their courses

00:33:06.807 --> 00:33:09.140
and helping faculty to try
to define, what do you really

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.440
want them to learn when they
take electricity and magnetism

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.220
or quantum mechanics or whatever
that individual course is?

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.679
And Chris, at the time, said,
OK, I'm department chair.

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:22.220
I can just wave my magic wand
and make everyone make learning

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.840
objectives for their courses.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.210
And of course, we
know that didn't work.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.190
[LAUGHING]

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:32.150
But Chris realized that this
idea of actually defining

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.262
learning objectives is
a very powerful notion--

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:35.720
that you can really
articulate what

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.680
it means to learn the content
and skills and concepts

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.450
in a course.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.790
And a few years later, when
Chris was serving a term

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.650
as interim chair
of the department,

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.102
he wondered, is there anything
I can do, one semester as chair,

00:33:49.102 --> 00:33:51.560
that could have a lasting impact
on undergraduate education

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.000
in the department?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.240
And he turned to
Louis Deslaurier

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.570
who is Director of Science
Teaching and Learning in FAS,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.150
and also a senior preceptor
in our department.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.500
And Louis is one of the great
experts in science education,

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.580
here.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.380
And Louis immediately
said, well,

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.110
there is something that
no one else is doing,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.540
which is actually looking
at the department level

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.062
at learning objectives.

00:34:16.062 --> 00:34:18.020
What, as a department,
are we actually teaching

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.670
our physics undergraduates?

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.699
And Louis said, no one's doing
this at other institutions

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.870
because they think
it's just too hard.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.370
OK.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.828
They think that
logistically trying

00:34:26.828 --> 00:34:29.390
to get all of the students
and trying to get faculty

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.639
to agree about what the
department learning objectives

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.679
are-- these will
be too challenging.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.659
So Chris said, OK, let's do it.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.130
[LAUGHING]

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:44.360
And so this project was launched
with some specially arranged

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.658
help from HILT. At
the HILT conference

00:34:46.658 --> 00:34:48.199
where-- those of
you who were there--

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:52.370
remember that Chris was
presented as a guinea pig,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.340
if you will, with an opportunity
for the entire HILT conference

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.380
to weigh in on what Chris
ought to do in his one

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.161
semester as interim chair to
improve teaching and learning

00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:01.910
in the department.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.360
And one of the options was
create a departmental level

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.989
assessment to assess teaching
and learning in the department.

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:10.280
And Lo and behold, that was
one of the recommendations.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.449
So with that
ringing endorsement,

00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:15.740
one of the curriculum mapping
projects that was started

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.600
was this very project.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.760
So we wanted to
know, how do we know

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.680
if the department, as
a whole, is actually

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.732
successful in teaching
the concepts and skills

00:35:23.732 --> 00:35:25.940
that we think are important
for undergraduate success

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.260
in physics and future success
as they go into their careers,

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.580
or graduate schools?

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.050
How do we actually
engage faculty

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.216
in thinking about departmental
level learning goals?

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:38.850
As you can imagine, that
can be a contentious issue.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.767
And how do we increase
our students' awareness

00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:42.683
about what they know and
what they don't know?

00:35:42.683 --> 00:35:45.290
So we're looking here both at
the undergraduate concentrators

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:48.590
and at the faculty to try
to understand this better.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.080
So our goals by
June of next year

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.027
is that we'll have, we
hope, a system in place

00:35:53.027 --> 00:35:54.860
where all of our
undergraduate concentrators

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.270
are assessed twice.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.520
First around of the end of
their second year and again

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.110
in their fourth year.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.140
That we have student level
and departmental level

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.870
interventions in response
to these results and that

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.260
we can actually validate
the assessment itself.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.790
This is a little snapshot
of part of the assessment,

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.330
which is something that we think
is a very simple question--

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.400
conceptual question in
quantum mechanics about

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.530
the eigenfunction of a
Schroedinger equation

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.060
for a semi infinite's--
well, anyway, I won't go on.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.300
[LAUGHING]

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.340
And our hopes for
curricular mapping

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.514
are that in the future
when we have our curricular

00:36:28.514 --> 00:36:29.930
reforms in the
physics department,

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.180
we can actually
target those reforms

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.850
at places where we know
that we need to focus,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.260
in terms of outcomes.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.450
And then we can actually
assess those changes

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.835
on a department level.

00:36:39.835 --> 00:36:41.960
And finally, we hope that
our students can actually

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.804
be more confident
and can articulate

00:36:43.804 --> 00:36:45.470
what the skills are
that they've learned

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.480
as undergraduate
concentrators in physics.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.030
And now, I will turn
this over to Louis,

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.450
who understands this all
much more deeply than I do,

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.724
to explain a little bit
more about the details

00:36:55.724 --> 00:36:56.390
of this project.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.580
OK.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.000
So a little bit about
the design here.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.800
So first, the test is made up of
a broad range of topics, right.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.960
We want to make sure that
faculty and students feel

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.150
like it's quite
representative of what

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:16.440
it means to be a physicist, by
the end of your fourth year.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.830
So I made sure to see as many
colleagues and department

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.840
as possible to get their input.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.760
And I asked them,
what do you think

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.310
are the most important skills,
most important concepts,

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.670
that your students should
master by the time they get out

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.930
of the program?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.520
And I got a lot of
feedback, obviously.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.310
But one thing that was common--

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.160
feedback that was
common to everyone

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.100
was about they wanted to make
sure that this assessment did

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.220
not look just like a final exam
at the end of a course, which

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.030
in physics often times involve
end of the chapter, end

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.100
of the textbook problems.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.340
So they didn't want the
exam to look like that.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.140
And that's why if you
look at the assessment,

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.985
we have some practical lab
physics questions on there.

00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:02.610
We have even some
open-ended questions.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.030
So it really does
feel quite different.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.110
But most importantly, I wanted
to make sure that it only

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.842
had conceptual questions.

00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:13.800
And it's well known, now,
in science education,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.360
that the retention of concepts
is quite robust over time

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.390
when you compare that
to retention of facts--

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.176
facts like procedures,
steps that you

00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:25.800
need to solve an
equation or something.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.010
That's just forgotten almost in
that the same rate as a phone

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.960
number or someone's name, right.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.750
In fact, several years
ago, we published something

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:39.240
where we looked at how students
retain quantum mechanics

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.840
concepts.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.270
At the end of their first
quantum mechanics course,

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.010
students were given
a test of learning.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.740
And the test of
learning comprised

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.090
deeply conceptual questions
as well as procedures.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:50.684
Right.

00:38:50.684 --> 00:38:52.350
So a year and a half
later, we gave them

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.141
the same test of
learning, and we made sure

00:38:54.141 --> 00:38:57.720
that they had no exposure to
quantum mechanics in between.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.210
And interestingly, the concept
was retained almost at 100%.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.710
OK.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.290
The deeply conceptual
ideas, but the facts,

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.880
procedures, not
surprisingly, they

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.592
had decayed almost to
zero-- to noise level.

00:39:08.592 --> 00:39:10.050
So that's why I
wanted to make sure

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:13.860
that the feedback that
this test would give us,

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.670
faculty and students,
was meaningful.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.170
So in fact, you'll see when I
talk about student interviews,

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.520
here, not a single student
said, oh, I learned this before,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.300
but I think I did not answer
it correctly because I forgot.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.880
Because people know
intuitively these questions.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.430
If you just don't know how
to answer them a year later,

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.680
that's because you didn't
learn it in the first place.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.230
So that's a very important
part of the design.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.660
So I tried to use as many
validated questions as

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.830
possible.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.820
I called my colleagues
at other universities,

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.570
but we can only use a few.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.990
So this assessment will have
to be validated this year.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.960
So let's talk about
results a little bit.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.660
Students did not perform
as well as they hoped.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.190
So with an average of
46%, and the distribution

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.370
was pretty wide.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:05.310
So now, you should know, if
you ask is this test too hard?

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.500
Well, I started to give
it to graduate students,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.010
so they score a lot higher,
but still not that great.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.900
Much worse than they would like.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.890
And I just got the green light,
I think, in the last faculty

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.650
meeting that we had, to start
giving it to my colleagues.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.570
[LAUGHING]

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:30.060
Anyway, it'll be
anonymous, right?

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.280
I'll say, I'm the only
one that has the key.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.125
So I'll be able to get
favors from people.

00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:36.190
[LAUGHING]

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.690
So here's what's really
interesting, here, everyone--

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.720
no exception-- expected
to get an A on this test,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.230
and they were all
very disappointed.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.810
So that's a bit of
a downer, right?

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.234
Very disappointed, in fact.

00:40:47.234 --> 00:40:48.900
To the point where I
was quite concerned

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.250
with a few first students.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.170
But I interviewed every student.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.050
So I made them one-on-one.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.840
And part of the script at the
beginning for the interview

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.307
was about their perception
of fairness for the test.

00:41:00.307 --> 00:41:02.265
I asked them, is the test
fair in your opinion?

00:41:02.265 --> 00:41:04.482
And I just let them talk.

00:41:04.482 --> 00:41:06.690
Then, after that, I provide
them with a definition we

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.150
can both agree on for fairness.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.320
The definition I gave
them is that I said,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.340
let's imagine that for example
the questions on quantum

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.750
mechanics for this test--

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.350
let's say that you had
been asked those questions

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.239
at the end of your course where
you learned quantum mechanics.

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:23.280
Would it be fair for the
instructor in the course

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.650
to expect you to get all
these questions right?

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.090
And without exception,
students said, yes, absolutely.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.080
At the end of a course
in quantum mechanics,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.660
I should get those quantum
mechanics questions right.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.460
So they did feel like
the test was fair.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.290
So it was very
disappointed to them.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.110
But on the upside,
students really

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.270
did appreciate the feedback.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:46.530
I mean, many of them went out of
their ways to thank me, to say,

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.330
oh, I'm so glad that
the department is

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.340
spending a lot of
time and energy

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.650
to give me additional feedback.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.712
And many of them asked, OK,
what can I do practically now?

00:41:56.712 --> 00:41:58.920
These are students that are
about to graduate, right,

00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.610
in fourth years.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.360
They said, only got a few months
before I go to graduate school.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.130
What can I do?

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.270
Give me some advice.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.300
So it's pretty clear that we
can't just give this assessment

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.594
and leave it at that.

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:11.510
We need to provide
students with opportunities

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.490
to bridge some of the gaps.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:18.020
So another upside is that
the assessment can definitely

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.130
help students improve their
self-awareness as they progress

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.244
through the program.

00:42:23.244 --> 00:42:24.660
And that's in
addition, of course,

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.480
to helping us improve teaching
and learning in our department.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.730
So something that's
very interesting, here,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.900
as part of the
interviews, is I asked

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.090
students, what is it that
made you think that you should

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.930
have gotten an A on this test?

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.850
And you know, not all of
them, but almost all of them,

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.440
they talk about their grades.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.790
They said, well, it's too bad.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:50.210
The only feedback that I get
from the program are my grades.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.870
And I did pretty
good in my classes.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.161
So that's why I would have
assumed that I would do well

00:42:54.161 --> 00:42:55.260
on something like that.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.240
So that was the source of their
disappointment, basically.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.180
So as Logan mentioned,
when you think

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.610
about this, that's a pretty
backward way to design things,

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.110
right?

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.124
You're supposed to do
learning outcomes first,

00:43:07.124 --> 00:43:08.540
and then from that
you're supposed

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.160
to build an assessment.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.770
But we know it, practically,
just doesn't work that way.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.320
Well, you should have seen
this in the faculty meeting--

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.370
the last one that we had.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.440
I mean, people were
really engaged, right.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.580
So that might be a good way
to trick faculty into starting

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.590
to talk about these things.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.250
So the next steps here for
this coming year is, of course,

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.680
we need to design follow up
opportunities for students--

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.040
some seminar type courses.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.640
We're bouncing ideas--
what we should do.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.700
We need to revise and
validate the assessment.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.187
And that will involve
a lot of interviews.

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.770
So I want to make sure that we
make this available to everyone

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.620
around the world, so they
can use this instrument.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.860
And Karen Pearce, from
Institutional Research,

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.580
is already helping us, now,
with looking at correlations

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.960
with other institutional data.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.070
For example, what courses
did students take?

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.195
What grades did they take?

00:44:02.195 --> 00:44:06.650
And does that inform their
performance on this test?

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.589
And then, finally,
and not the least,

00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:10.880
is that we need to develop
sustainable way to give that

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.820
to students.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.330
So we want to give it at
the end of second year

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.830
and at the end of fourth year.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.080
So students did
mention in interviews,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.970
I wish I would have
had something like this

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.070
two years ago, because
I would have been

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.660
able to make some corrections.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.830
It's too bad.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.620
So giving it at the end of
second year-- that's easy

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.160
I would think not
just in physics,

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.990
but in most departments because
we have core courses, right.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.020
Like this fall semester, I'm
teaching quantum mechanics

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.432
and every students have to
go through quantum mechanics.

00:44:38.432 --> 00:44:39.890
So I'm going to
give it to students

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.090
at the end of the course.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.017
That's easy.

00:44:42.017 --> 00:44:44.600
But at the end of fourth year,
though, that's a serious issue.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.440
This semester was really hard
to communicate with each student

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.985
individually, and schedule
time, and so forth.

00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:56.817
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.920
Can you imagine a
world where that was

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.031
happening in every department?

00:45:04.031 --> 00:45:04.530
All right.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:09.330
So we're going to move on
to a different category.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.790
And we're going to
go in this order.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.700
And then at the end,
we're going to have

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.350
a little more depth about the
social innovation project.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.770
So I love this project.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.500
It's the project that
when everyone says to me,

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.820
what is curriculum mapping?

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:32.090
It's the one that I bring up
because it's just so clear.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.970
Like, if you said,
across the university,

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.720
what are all of the
courses, all the ways,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.430
that ethics is being taught?

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.700
It's probably taught in
every Harvard School.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.110
How do we know where
the ethics courses are?

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.250
So the team-- which
you can see here--

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.680
Danielle Allen couldn't be here.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:58.170

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.190
Kidd they have been
working really hard.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.940
And as I understand it, you
took inductive and deductive

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:11.340
approaches, both, to narrowing
in on the range of many words

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.340
that could be related
to ethics instruction.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.839
And then you used that to
develop a weighted algorithm.

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:19.380
And then used that
weighted algorithm

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.900
to search all of the
syllabi, and then

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:29.010
to identify courses, survey
instructors, get their teaching

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.140
learning materials,
that then become

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:36.570
additional sources of data to
draw out the implicit learning

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.280
theories around ethics.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.790
And to begin to think about
not just which courses,

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.150
but the pedagogical
approaches to teaching ethics.

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:49.170
And how to develop a community,
here, around those issues.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.450
And then broaden that
community, outside of Harvard,

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.400
and think about
ethics instruction

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.510
out there in the world
and in other institutions.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:02.780
So key constituents--
undergraduate and professional

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.124
students, faculty instructors,
and administrators.

00:47:05.124 --> 00:47:06.290
That's the whole university.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.910
[LAUGHING]

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.850
I think you could add alumni.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:17.780
And I do think it does
have that applicability.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.290
So look at this visual.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:23.180
How many courses
were identified?

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.260
That's a lot of courses.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.400
Then there is how many
were selected out of that,

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.410
and unique instructors.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.840
And look at how many
survey responses they got.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.100
This is already a community.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.060
By next year, the goal is to
do another round of faculty

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.760
surveys, refine and
administer the pre-

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.830
and post-semester
student surveys--

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.140
so now learning from students--

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.040
and test and transfer the
methodology to other campuses.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.220
And hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard--

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.460
build student-friendly tools
for identifying ethics courses

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.630
and learning opportunities.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.194
What do student-friendly
tools look like?

00:48:05.194 --> 00:48:06.610
We'll be getting
to that because I

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.430
think Jeffrey and others
in the curricle project

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.480
are also thinking about
student-friendly tools.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.620
Identify strengths and gaps in
ethics education at Harvard,

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.500
promote discussion
and collaboration.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.570
Similarly, Subu,
a faculty member

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.900
in the School of Public Health,
had another kind of question

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.060
that was crossing instruction
all across Harvard,

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.280
who's teaching applied
quantitative methods?

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.120
What are the applied statistics
courses that are being taught?

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.190
In social sciences,
by non-statisticians,

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.660
how did these courses compare?

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.650
How do students move through
the system to take courses

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.700
in applied statistics?

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.260
And people do move.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.630
They don't just stick
in their school.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.850
They move to other
schools to try

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:58.180
to get the methodological
training that they

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.500
feel that they need.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.800
Graduate students are the
key constituency, here,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.470
and then faculty.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.780
By next year, have
a web resource

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.410
to facilitate optimal course
selection for students,

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:16.090
a synthesis-based deep dive of
what's being taught at Harvard,

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.480
with an aim to develop a
taxonomy of these courses.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.920
That's a big goal.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.850
It should be an interesting one.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.990
And again, it will be drawing
on the data sources of syllabi

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.400
and course materials.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:35.560
Subu or Judy might remember,
as we identified these courses,

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.820
reached out to
faculty, and said, hey,

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.070
could you send us our syllabi?

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.900
Because we couldn't
use syllabus tool

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.260
because it was not
just in the FAS.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.290
Within an hour, you had
like hundreds of people,

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.230
or a lot of people writing.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.490
There is a hunger
among the faculty

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.400
to be able to share their
resources with one another

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.190
and to build this
kind of community.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.780
So one of the goals is just
making this meaningful faculty

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.780
connections and then providing
more course selection

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.860
support to students.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.500
If you look at this
visual, you can

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.650
see the percentage of the
applied quantitative methods

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:15.290
by school, but we don't know
if this picture is accurate.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:16.490
We really don't know.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.280
I think this is a first stab.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.280
And then we have to iterate
and learn to what degree this

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.390
might change over time.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:33.440
So curricle is this amazing
intellectual project.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.550
And when I first heard about
it, my jaw almost dropped.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:40.000
I really couldn't believe
that this ambitious effort

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.190
was underway.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:47.650
We have Jeffrey, Matthew Battles
couldn't be here, Sebastian, we

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:54.730
have Jessica, Kim,
here, from the team.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:58.190
And you can see here, we've
got these two different--

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:03.400
they're both doing user testing
and still collecting data.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.020
As I have thought
about this project,

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.970
there's two parts of it.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:12.220
One is building a
curiosity-driven search

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.660
tool for students.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.680
And the other is drawing
on really interesting

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:24.160
archival data about the
intellectual, curricular story

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.720
of Harvard over time.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.990
I mean, going back the
hundreds of years of the things

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:34.360
that have been taught
at Harvard, to say,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.170
how has Dante's
Inferno been taught

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:40.090
throughout Harvard's history?

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:44.380
And to develop these kind
of stories of a student's

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.920
progression, while
they were here,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.190
that might get students to
think in different kinds of ways

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:54.910
than they usually do about
their own progression and path

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.170
through the curriculum.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.420
So I think it's an ambitious
project because there's

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.620
a lot of data that might not
be digitized and easily put

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:09.970
into a format where you could
do that kind of deep work.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.700
At the same time, it really
relates to a lot of the tools

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.330
that Dustin has been building.

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.975
And as we, in a more
straightforward way,

00:52:16.975 --> 00:52:19.570
are building these tools
and increasing data sources,

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.490
we can pull it together
with the things

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:25.000
that Jeffrey and others
have been working on.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.890
So research questions.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.560
How might data visualization
reveal hidden connections

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.880
among courses of study?

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.980
How might we provide
students with meaningful data

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.960
in a user-friendly
format to support them

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.910
in course selection?

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.294
Using and adapting
historical curriculum data,

00:52:39.294 --> 00:52:41.710
what stories can we tell about
intellectual and curricular

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.140
trends throughout
Harvard's history?

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.440
Students, faculty, department
chairs as key constituents.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.160
Goals by June 2019.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.110
One full academic year of public
prototype testing completed.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:58.120
I think-- tell me
if this is right.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.260
You're in prototype testing now?

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.930
Yeah.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.482
Suite to visualization
micro narratives published,

00:53:06.482 --> 00:53:07.690
and a mobile version in demo.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.380
Hopes for curriculum mapping
at Harvard-- visualization

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.360
and data integration
will promote discovery

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.260
in course selection.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.420
Visualizations can
show connections.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.950
Now, how in the world--

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.460
I was looking at this
visual and was like, wait,

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.580
are these the schools
that tell the truth?

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.540
And these are the
schools that are--

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.460
and so I had to get
some clarification.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:32.620
No, this tool allows you
to put in any two words

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.010
and then see which
schools have courses

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:40.270
that offer things related
to those words, overlapping.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.520
And then, if you click on
one of those in the middle--

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.510
this is already an interface,
a tool that you can play with,

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.120
then you get to actually
see all the list of courses,

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.730
and the ways in which they're
talking about either truth

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:52.760
or lie.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.260
All right.

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.240
DART.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.480
I cannot do this
project justice.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.080
I think you can't do it
justice in this format.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.170
What you need to do is actually
play with this and have a demo.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:10.780
You need to go and look at this.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.650
There's a website.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:15.149
And I should just say on the
little brochures we handed out,

00:54:15.149 --> 00:54:17.440
there's a website you can go
and learn more information

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.400
about these tools.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:24.520
Also, you can go and look
up DART in particular.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.040
So imagine this
repository, where

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.380
you can put teaching
and learning

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.070
assets of any number
of sizes and shapes.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.560
Right now, the
content has started

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.960
with HarvardX data, HarvardX
videos, and other assets that

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.011
are in HarvardX courses, as
well as Harvard YouTube video

00:54:46.011 --> 00:54:46.510
assets.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.390
But it could include any
kinds of teaching and learning

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:50.380
assets.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.360
And then it's this really
powerful search tool.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:57.160
So you search for a word
that you're interested in.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.920
I think the demos I've
seen have been like moon.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.940
And all of the things that
are related to moon come up.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.220
And you can do a little
preview really quickly

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.780
of what these things look like.

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.200
Then, most magically,
you just say,

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.690
I want to put this
in my Canvas course.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:14.560
Boom.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.320
It's in your Canvas course,
and you can use it and share it

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.330
with your students.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:23.320
So it is a work in progress.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.050
Right now, as I understand
it, the more that Daniel

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.150
can get people to use
it and give feedback,

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.950
the more he can build new
attributes and new tools.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.866
So you should talk with Daniel.

00:55:32.866 --> 00:55:35.240
You should play with it, and
you should talk with Daniel.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:40.060
And you should begin to see
what else he can do to help you

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.810
use this tool more over time.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:47.500
By June 2019, cross
institutional content sharing

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.990
and more direct reuse
of Canvas resources.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:52.210
So now, it's going
the other direction.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:55.780
You have Canvas resources,
make it usable for everybody

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.960
to then put into
their Canvas courses.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.932
This is what the
interface looks like.

00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:03.640
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard--

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.015
provide data and
tools that allow

00:56:05.015 --> 00:56:08.350
people to more directly
explore Harvard content.

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:10.120
We're going to now
hear from Brittany

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.940
for this last of our
curriculum mapping projects.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.440
OK.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.540
So hi, I'm Brittany Butler.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.664
I'm the Executive Director
of the Social Innovation

00:56:17.664 --> 00:56:20.860
and Change Initiative, which is
a relatively new initiative--

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.870
almost two years old
at the Kennedy School,

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.640
and an adjunct lecturer there.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.260
And I'm representing
our team, the SICI team,

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.240
as well as my colleague,
Julie Battilana,

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.900
who's a professor
at both HBS and HKS.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.740
So I have to say,
we're maybe the team

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.300
that joined this
group the latest,

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.980
and thus got to
benefit on riding

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.860
the coattails of the ethics
group, of the search tool,

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.440
of the fact that there
will very soon now

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:51.164
be this syllabus search
tool, because that's

00:56:51.164 --> 00:56:52.080
sort of our next step.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.780
And so thank you actually
to HILT for involving us.

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.340
We started out--
also, the mission

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.715
of the Social Innovation Change
Initiative at the Kennedy

00:56:59.715 --> 00:57:01.390
School is to generate
new knowledge

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:03.280
and also to shape the
practice of innovation

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.180
with a social intent.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.490
So not innovation to
make a profit, not

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.710
innovation for its
own sake, but to solve

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:10.090
a specific social problem.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:13.630
And we entered into
this work essentially

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.640
because anecdotally
the student demand

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.920
was just like blasting up.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.410
So our team was immediately
overwhelmed by the number

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.590
of students coming in and asking
for advice about which courses

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.490
they should take, asking about
the i-lab, asking about HIVE,

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.532
asking about all the
competitions on campus

00:57:29.532 --> 00:57:31.490
and how they should be
navigating those things.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.650
So this is really--

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.650
we entered with a set of
questions about the curricula,

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:37.840
but also a set of
questions about

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.780
extracurricular activities,
and how those overlap.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.864
And the thing about social
innovation, unlike many

00:57:42.864 --> 00:57:44.696
of the things that have
been described here,

00:57:44.696 --> 00:57:46.570
but I think this is an
increasing trend also

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.990
in Higher Ed is it's not
actually a discipline.

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:54.530
It's-- at best, it's a phenomena
inside of certain disciplines,

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:58.510
and yet year after year, the
interest from students keeps

00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:59.180
rising.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.810
And as we talk to students
about what they want

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.160
and how they want to make
a difference in the world,

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.010
they say look there's this
specific social problem I care

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:07.774
about, and what's the
scope and sequence

00:58:07.774 --> 00:58:09.190
that I should be
thinking through,

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.480
as I prepare myself to
go out there and do this.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.410
And so we had terrible
answers for them.

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:16.330
And so-- like very basic level.

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:18.190
We just wanted to know--

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.970
is this the thing?

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:19.470
Yeah.

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.380
What courses are being taught?

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:25.270
What out of class innovation
experiences are offered?

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.840
And how do the perceptions
and experiences and demand

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.790
from the students
and external actors

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.820
about what's available
actually compare to the supply?

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.380
I mean, we just didn't
know anything about this.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.560
And so we are very
much in this stage

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.500
and looking to go deeper soon.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.390
So again, this is
where we started.

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.690
So there was a
report done in 2013

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:50.860
that gave us some
indication that 36%

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.730
of cross registration positions
across all the school--

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.800
so this is like a student
making an extra effort

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.010
to go into another school
because they perceive

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.080
that there's something
at another school that

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.490
isn't available in their own.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:05.949
30% of those fall
into this category.

00:59:05.949 --> 00:59:07.990
And many of the students
who made those petitions

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:09.310
were denied.

00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:11.560
So we know there's
interest, just

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.660
locally, again, the
anecdotes were there.

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.590
And then on the supply
side, I mean, very spotty--

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.175
but the challenge
for us, also, was it

00:59:18.175 --> 00:59:19.550
was difficult to
answer questions

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:20.592
for prospective students.

00:59:20.592 --> 00:59:22.841
And at the Kennedy School,
and at the Business School,

00:59:22.841 --> 00:59:24.490
in particular, we
were feeling the pain

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:27.073
of actually losing perspective
students because even though we

00:59:27.073 --> 00:59:29.320
had this intuition
that, as a whole,

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.720
Harvard University offers
an incredible amount

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.270
on this front, we weren't
able to represent that well.

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.100
And that was scaring us.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.600
And then yet at
the same time, you

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.036
know the students who were
pursuing this stuff would say,

00:59:40.036 --> 00:59:42.160
like, I've already taken--
sort of that first quote

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.234
that you started with.

00:59:43.234 --> 00:59:45.400
There is a lot of overlap
between these two classes,

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.780
and I really wish someone
could have given me

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.696
a heads up about that.

00:59:47.696 --> 00:59:50.809
Because I don't feel like
I'm optimizing my time here.

00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:51.850
So that's how we started.

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:54.340
But as we move forward,
some additional questions

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.570
surfaced that, again, I
think are important as folks

00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.650
particularly think about
multi-disciplinary initiatives

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:03.400
or initiatives that aren't
clearly in a discipline,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.210
but where the student
demand is high,

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:10.060
which is what is Harvard's
responsibility to get clear

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.230
about this stuff, given
that social innovation,

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:15.470
social change aren't traditional
academic disciplines.

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:17.650
And that's an open
question, but it's something

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:21.275
that, increasingly, every year
feels like we need to answer.

01:00:21.275 --> 01:00:22.900
And what can and
should be accomplished

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.090
through the curricular
versus the co-curricular?

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:27.550
So the Social Innovation
and Change Initiative

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.020
actually runs a
fellowship program.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.440
It's a co-curricular program for
15 select students every year

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.199
who are working on advancing
a project that they plan

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:36.490
to continue when they graduate.

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:39.670
They can get up to $30,000
to advance those projects

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.600
when they finish.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.120
But is that the only
experience that they should

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.124
be getting here in the school?

01:00:45.124 --> 01:00:46.540
And how does that
relate to what's

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.570
happening in the classroom?

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:48.850
So very much along
the lines of what's

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:51.607
going on with the research stuff
and how much is that shaping

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:52.690
students' experience here?

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:54.709
It's something we want
to understand better.

01:00:54.709 --> 01:00:56.500
And then what opportunities
are we missing?

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.083
And it just seems like there's
a lot of low-hanging fruit that

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.100
we don't have--

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.780
we don't really
understand again.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.940
So this is just a
quick sense of how

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.720
we approached putting our
arms around this space

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.570
and even just defining
what we're talking about.

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.730
Lucas, you spent a
lot of time on this.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:14.700
So just a sample--

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.660
this is just a sample.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.150
There are 521 uni courses, OK,
so that's on the next slide.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.174
But this is just a sample.

01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:22.090
And look at the range.

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:24.920
Innovators Practice Finding
Building Leading Good Ideas,

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.730
Applied Music Activism,
Thermal Tectonics

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:32.500
for the Next Billion People,
Designing for the Just City,

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.190
Innovative Approaches to Teacher
Prep, Innovation and Ministry.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:39.400
I mean, these are all
processes that certainly aren't

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.610
100% overlapping, but where
you can really quickly come

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:46.130
to understand that you need to
be able to define the problem,

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.630
right.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:48.490
There's a set of
competencies, here,

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.800
that each of these
students need to get.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.620
You need to understand the
root causes of those problems.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.890
You need to be able
to iterate and think

01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.130
in an iterative learning way
about potential solutions

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.440
and make selections
about those solutions.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.921
And you need to understand your
own role as a social change

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:05.420
maker.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.150
And so despite the
fact that they're

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.790
all across different
schools, and potentially

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:13.089
different in many ways, there's
actually a lot of similarities.

01:02:13.089 --> 01:02:15.130
And that's what we wanted
to start to understand.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.900
This is a set of keywords.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.980
So we followed, again, on the
coattails of the ethics folks

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.920
and did this iterative process
of looking for keywords

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.065
in the course descriptions.

01:02:25.065 --> 01:02:27.190
We would have loved to have
been able to drill down

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:29.470
to the level of the
syllabi, because we suspect

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:31.780
that when we talk about
the competencies required

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.280
to be an effective
social innovator,

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.700
it might be happening
at that syllabus level.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.987
And when we get there,
we will do that.

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:40.570
But in the meantime,
it just gives you

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:45.100
a sense of the range of search
terms that came up for us.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.310
And then we would feed
those back in to the system

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.730
until we came to this 521.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:55.440
And so yeah, for
next year, I mean,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.030
in terms of what
kind of resources

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.280
can we use to support
students and faculty

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.950
in creating a community
and finding their way--

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.037
we've been thinking about
a compendium of curricula.

01:03:05.037 --> 01:03:07.620
We think that just would be an
interesting contribution, also,

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.850
beyond Harvard.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.460
And that that would then draw
folks into the conversation,

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.122
broadly.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.580
Oh, this is our
big takeaway, which

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.940
is that pretty much every single
school is offering courses

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.570
on this front.

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.580
I mean, and it's really
pretty well distributed.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.996
There's an other
group, here, that

01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:23.460
represents a couple
of the schools,

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.430
but, again, this, just like
Erin said about the other,

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.200
this is our first
cut at a snapshot.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.720
We're still trying to figure
out even what the bounds are.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.630
And so a step for us--

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.864
next step for us will
also be connecting

01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:36.780
with relevant faculty.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.120
Faculty are interested
in this work,

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.180
particularly faculty who have an
experiential learning pedagogy.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.120
They seem to be
very drawn to this.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.980
And ask them for
reactions to the set

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.096
of courses we've surfaced.

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:50.970
And then eventually just
make recommendations

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.040
to improve the student pathway
for making social impact.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.740
I mean, many of them
come here and say

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.660
that's why they're
getting an education, now.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.530
And so how can we prepare
them to do that well?

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.050
And then hopes-- yeah, I
mean, just that, again,

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.870
the multi-disciplinary
learning journey in particular

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.780
could be a little
easier for students.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.010
Right now, we're very siloed.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.780
I think we all know that.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.810
And they feel it the most.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.242
And then creating connection
between faculty and students

01:04:18.242 --> 01:04:20.200
who would benefit from
working with each other.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.699
I mean, even on
this project, I feel

01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:24.110
like I've connected with
some of you who might not

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.312
have identified as falling
into social innovation,

01:04:26.312 --> 01:04:28.020
but when we get down
to the nitty gritty,

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.811
I think we're actually
grappling with a lot

01:04:29.811 --> 01:04:32.640
of similar questions.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.700
And this idea of
developing a one Harvard

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.160
ecosystem, especially
when resources

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.420
are distributed across school.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.720
So the Kennedy School cannot
own social innovation.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.950
And we know that.

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:46.140
But Harvard as a
whole, really could

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.230
be a dominant player in this
space, if we could coordinate.

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.100
So there are certain topics
where no department, no school

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.410
is going to be able to
really shape a field,

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:57.800
but together we might be
able to do quite a bit.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.250
So that's where I'm at.
