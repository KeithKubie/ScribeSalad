00:00:00.517 --> 00:00:01.850
MALE SPEAKER: All right, Joanna.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.140
Let's write down everything
about Android layouts.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.880
So to summarize, a view
group is just a fancy name

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.824
for a layout-- a view
you can add children to.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:16.490
JOANNA: Exactly.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.760
And we actually have all
of these different layouts

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.343
to choose from, because they are
functionally different in how

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:21.530
they lay their children out.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.363
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.340
Like linear layout is
always one row or one

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.824
column, while frame layout
can have overlapping children.

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:27.490
JOANNA: Exactly.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.760
But if you want to
kind of influence

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.500
that overlapping or
that column, that's

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.330
when you want to use
a layout attribute.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.590
This is what clarifies
to the system

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.895
where these children should be.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.020
Like, look at frame layout.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.870
We have layout gravity
specifying on both children,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.120
but in different ways
so that they overlap.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.920
MALE SPEAKER: Oh.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260
So this layout width
and height that I've

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470
been adding to children
along are actually

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.760
rules for the parent,
not for the view itself.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.390
JOANNA: Thankfully,
we make it really easy

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.150
for you to understand
in the blog post linked

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.730
in the description
below, because we're

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.690
going to talk you through every
layout attribute you should

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.450
know about and whether
or not that layout

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.055
is really right for your app.

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:06.430
MALE SPEAKER:
Sounds really long.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.532
JOANNA: Just a bit.

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:10.490
Anyway, it's a great
resource, so check it out.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.350
It's going to help
you build better apps.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.320
MALE SPEAKER: Build better apps.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.220
Build better apps.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.120
JOANNA: Stop.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.470
