&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So W. Scott Poole blames
repeated viewings of shock

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.440
theater at an impressionable age for his monster
obsession. Associate professor of history

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.430
at the College
of Charleston, he's also a prolific pop culture

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.610
critic. His reviews and commentary

devil we know".

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.510
And "Never Surrender: Confederate memory and
conservativism

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.730
in the South Carolina upcountry" which was
the 2004 winner

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.640
of the George C. Rogers Award for best book
on South Carolina history.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.150
Poole lives in Charleston, South Carolina
with his partner Beth Phillips, two dogs,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.489
an
extensive comic book and vinyl record collection.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.960
Please help me to welcome Scott Poole.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960
[Applause]

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.049
&gt;&gt; Scott: Well thank you. And thank you for
letting me come talk to you about monsters

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.060
and hopefully talking back to me about monsters
as well. I hope we've got some time.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.119
I'm planning for some time for Q and A so
anything I don't cover in the discussion can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.579
I hopefully answer for
you. So this is a weird book in certain kinds

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.310
of ways.
This is a book that's a weird combination

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.399
of some
different things. I am a historian. I'm a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.429
traditionally
trained historian even if I'm not a traditional

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.759
historian
in some ways. And so, this book really is

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.030
a cultural
history of the idea of the monster. It's not

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.799
a cultural
history of horror movies although there's

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.369
a lot of horror
movies in it. It's a cultural history of how

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.189
narratives
of monsters have intersected with American

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.460
history from
the colonial -- first period of colonial settlement

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.359
all
the way to the present. So that's part of

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.380
it. Part of
what makes it weird -- if that's not weird

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.450
enough to try
to do that -- is that this is also a book

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.670
written by and
for horror nerds. [audience chuckles] I am

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.390
absolutely a horror geek. I
consider myself kind of part of that community.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.070
I see
this book in a way as a kind of valentine

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.120
to the genre
that I love so much. And that kind of community

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.980
that
gathers around it. So, you know, it's -- it's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.440
a book
that is different things. It has sort of an

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.210
underlying
seriousness. You'll find phrases in there

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.221
like
'landscapes of corpses' [laughter] and that

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:41.500
kind of thing that
suggests, in fact, I really am after exploring

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.510
some of the
darker parts of American history. But then,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.390
I think also
horror fans will find a lot in it as well.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.850
Hopefully
finding ways to look at layers of the kind

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.820
of pop culture
entertainment they already enjoy and encounter

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.170
those
things in a different kind of way. Now, as

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.090
Shannon
mentioned, I do, in fact, owe -- blame -- whatever

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.200
part of
this fascination to a lifelong fascination

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.020
with classic
horror and also more contemporary horror.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.020
The fact of
the matter is, I spent a number of long Saturday

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.860
afternoons in the late
70s -- I've told my college kids before during

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.020
the
Clinton years but in fact it was during the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.260
Carter years. [laughter]
Sitting down in front of my parents ginormous

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.870
console
television set which I also have to explain

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.810
to them
didn't mean it was a wide screen TV. [laughter]

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.040
It means it was
this gigantic piece of furniture with this

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.260
little tiny
screen on it watching shock theater. If you're

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.740
not
familiar with shock theater. Shock was actually

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.420
a
package of films that Universal Studios started

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.830
marketing
in the late 1950s to local TV stations. And

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.200
they
actually marketed two packages -- one that

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.330
was called
Shock Theatre, the second that was called

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.109
Son of Shock.
And it actually was this combination of kind

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.050
of the
universal monsters -- Bride of Frankenstein,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:27.669
Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman,
all that kind of stuff along with the 1950's

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.030
creature
features. The giant bugs. The 50-foot women.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.039
All
of those kind of radioactive terrors that

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.710
were very much
part of the Cold War mentality in America.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.110
And so, you
know, for me in a sense that's kind of where

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.349
my own
obsessions along those kinds of lines began.

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.719
Now, the
question though becomes, "Fine, okay. We get

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.189
it, Poole.
You're a weird kid. [audience laughs] There's

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:03.389
no doubt about that. But
how does that connect to serious historical

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.439
work?" And
is that kind of material serious enough for

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.310
real
historical inquiry?" Well, I think that it

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.650
is. And I
think it is, in part, because of what one

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.850
of my favorite
historians -- who's not actually a historian

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.740
-- Greil
Marcus -- has to say. A quote that in some

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.629
ways --
you'll find it in the book -- but it's really

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.790
informative
about what I explore. [reading] "Parts of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.409
history, he says, because they
don't fit the story a people wants to tell

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.039
itself,
survive only as haunts and as fairy tales."

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.460
So there is
as with every country and as with every society

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.509
and every
culture, there's this master narrative. There's

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.819
this
story that we get out of the textbooks. There's

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.610
the
story that the guy up in front of the classroom

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.379
in the
tie tells us. There's the chronology that

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.610
we're taught
to believe is essentially the story of American

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.879
history
or the story of any culture for that matter.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.409
But most of
us have the sense that there's something lying

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:17.789
underneath. Something's under the bed. Something's
hiding in the closet. There's something in

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.439
kind of the
darkest part of the forest. And that's why

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:28.729
I see
monsters as a kind of access point into secret

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.741
histories.
And I'm almost afraid to use that term, because

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.849
you know
now there's sort of the secret history of

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.840
everything.
But I think when it comes to exploring the

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.860
master
narratives -- particularly of history that

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.409
we've been
told to accept--, it's an important idea.

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.020
And I think that
monsters have become -- as I've explained

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.960
in other
contexts -- a kind of a map to hidden topographies.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.729
A
map to where the bodies are buried in American

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.419
history.
Now, in the book, I don't actually give a

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.910
definition of
the monster. I don't actually say, "Monsters

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.039
are this."
There's a lot of different reasons for that.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.620
Partially because
monsters today are all different sorts of

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.639
things. But I
think also it's because what the monster is

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.620
depends on
the historical context that they emerge in.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.240
Monsters
actually kind of soak up meaning. They're

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.720
sort of these
sponges that collect meaning out of the historical

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.300
context in which they appear. So, for example,
when I

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.740
talk with my college students about the universal
monster

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.650
cycle -- Dracula, wolf man etcetera. They,
almost the

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.339
first thing they always say is, "you know,
that stuff

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:50.599
just isn't scary. How could people have thought
that

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.360
that was scary?" Even more interesting I've
had the

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.210
experience of watching the exorcist with graduate
students -- which I and even some of you still

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.900
find a
frightening film -- and their response has

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.069
been, "you
know, I just don't get it. This is too slow.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.210
The
special effects aren't that great. I just

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.490
really don't
find it frightening." Well, I think the fact

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.909
of the
matter is, that different things are frightening

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:17.169
at
different periods and they're frightening

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:21.309
because of the
context they're in. They're frightening because

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:24.330
they're
kind of sticking in and playing around with

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.229
parts of others
that are connected to that larger cultural

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:31.699
aegis.
They're kind of soaking up meaning while at

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.930
the very same time
they're these powerful social constructions

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.909
-- monsters
are -- all by themselves kind of helping to

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:46.220
contribute
meaning in certain kinds of ways to the era

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.910
that they
appear in. That's a little abstract. So let's

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.449
talk
about a couple of very specific examples that

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:54.310
I think
will help you see this. And what I've decided

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.209
I'll talk
about today is first of all the 19th century

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:01.889
American
obsession with the sea serpent. You may not

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:04.600
know that
there was a 19th century American obsession

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.589
with the sea
serpent, [audience chuckles] but after today

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:11.139
you will be aware how obsessed
Americans were with this creature and then

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.500
something that
you probably know a good bit more about. That

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.750
is the
obsession with the serial killer and with

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.680
the slasher.
Kind of the murdering maniac, hook for a hand.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.190
All that
kind of stuff from the 70s and 80s. So kind

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.940
of a more
historical example -- the way we tend to think

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.350
about that
term -- and then a more contemporary one.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.339
But let's get
to the sea serpent first. Indeed, Americans

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:40.660
were
obsessed with this creature in the 19th century.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.850
And
when I say "obsessed," I don't just mean as

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.570
a pop culture
phenomenon. I don't just mean that there were

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.329
sort of
marginal people in American society who were

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:53.760
interested
in the possibility of these creatures. I actually

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.800
mean
that, even in the emerging scientific community

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.089
in
America. Sort of the beginnings of natural

00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:04.590
science.
There was a real interest in whether or not

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.779
sea serpents
were real. In fact, no less a scientific name

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:12.410
than
Charles Lyell the geologist was absolutely

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.470
convinced, based on
eyewitness accounts, that sea serpents were

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.649
an
undiscovered animal. A creature that we simply

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:24.880
didn't
have an exhibit or specimen of and that we

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.910
were
eventually going to find. Now, at least one

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.149
of -- and
this is not the only -- but one of kind of

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:37.540
the trigger
points for interest in this creature was a

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.150
series of
sightings not too far from here. In 1817,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.560
there were a
series of sea serpent sightings in Gloucester

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.089
Harbor. In fact, hundreds of people claimed
that this creature, and they

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:53.779
actually drew a picture of it, this creature
showed

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:58.709
itself in the harbor. Was seen by whalers
who got out in

00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:01.850
their row boats and went out to get it in
true American

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.069
style when they saw this marvel, they decided
"hey let's

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:09.759
get our harpoons and our muskets and let's
go kill it." [laughter]

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:14.019
And so, hundreds as you can see here -- well,
make you

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.750
can't see it very well -- but it's the largest
ever seen

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.000
in America. Just made its appearance in Gloucester
Harbor, Cape Ann,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.750
and has been seen by hundreds of respectable
citizens,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.600
people claim. Not a bunch of crazies. Not
slack jawed

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.949
yokels and that kind of thing. Hundreds of
respectable citizens saw this

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:40.990
creature, it was claimed. Now, there was so
much interest

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.360
in this that an early American scientific
society -- in

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.160
fact a very elite scientific society -- known
as the New England Linnaean Society, located

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:58.920
in Boston featuring a number of kind of America's
emerging scientific elite. They took a special

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.339
interest
in the sea serpent, decided they were going

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:07.160
to work up a
zoological profile of it. Started collecting

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.649
a variety
of eyewitness accounts including the eye witness

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:17.350
accounts that came from the Gloucester Harbor
siting. And then at one point, actually believed

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.170
they had
found a specimen. And here's a drawing of

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.449
it that a
member of the society did. Thought that they

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:28.519
had found a
specimen of one of the sea serpent's babies

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:33.579
-- one of its
spawn essentially -- about three feet in length.

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:35.840
And
there had actually been a lot of discussion

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.440
about the
spawn of the sea serpent. There was all this

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.290
talk in
1817, 1818 -- well, maybe this thing has shown

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.879
up in
Gloucester Harbor because it's going to spawn

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:53.209
and that's
going to be really terrible for the fishing

00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:57.449
industry. They
were taking it this seriously they thought

00:12:57.449 --> 00:13:01.259
how is this
monster going to ruin the local economy was

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:05.519
the
discussion. Well, the Linnaean Society found

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:09.259
this
creature -- three feet long -- very strange

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:12.959
markings on
it. They could not identify it as any known

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.680
zoological
specimen. Unfortunately for them but good

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.180
for science,
Louis Agassiz famous zoologist connected to

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.870
Harvard took
a look at at it and said, "you know, this

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.740
isn't actually
a spawn of a sea serpent. This is actually

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.670
a fairly
common New England water snake that happens

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:40.199
to have a skin disease, some kind of skin
infection that has caused it to have all these

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:44.389
strange
markings." New England Linnaean Society disappeared

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:47.699
about two years later. Essentially in kind
of complete

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:50.959
embarrassment. They only formed in 1818, so
they weren't

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.600
around that long. There were other reasons
for their

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.529
dissolution, but I think this was part of
it. So after

00:13:58.529 --> 00:14:05.960
this, the scientific or emerging professionalized
scientific community in America sort of takes

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.310
a turn when
it comes to the sea serpent. They start saying

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:14.180
things
like eyewitness accounts are not enough. That's

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.230
not what
we mean by scientific evidence. Scientific

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:24.069
evidence has
to do with having a specimen in a lab that

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:27.450
is confirmed.
Doesn't have to do with how many people have

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.810
seen it.
And the American public's response to this

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:39.790
was, "Well,
okay, fine. But sea serpents are awesome.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.199
And what if
they do exist?" [laughter] And so, the sea

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:48.519
serpent becomes a really
important part of American popular culture.

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:51.761
As you can
see here. This is from the 1850s. This is

00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:56.019
a piece of
sheet music from the 1850s. Sort of the 19th

00:14:56.019 --> 00:15:00.699
century
version of the CD or the download. And I actually

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:04.290
discovered
in an issue of Harper's Magazine that this

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:10.371
particular
sheet music was on whoever was the 1850s version

00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:16.879
of Ryan Seacrest's top
ten list of best-selling sheet music. So the

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:20.790
Sea Serpent
Polka. Very, very popular. Captains started

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.930
naming their
ships the USS Sea Serpent. It just became

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:32.839
a very important
part of American culture and representation.

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:37.029
It even
showed up in the side show and sort of the

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:41.889
history -- the
emerging history of the American carnival

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:46.529
tradition. And
I wanted to show you this image, in part,

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.740
because you can
see where this is going and you can see where

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.209
the turn
away from science fits in with this. This

00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:59.139
great wonder
of the world -- Hydrarchos -- sea serpent.

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:04.230
Supposedly 114
feet in length. This traveled all over the

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.050
country.
This is actually from an advertisement for

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.509
a show in
Brooklyn. And unfortunately you can't see

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:13.100
the small
print in there. You can see it in the book.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.220
The image
is reproduced in the book. But it essentially

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.139
makes the
claim not that this is an unknown animal,

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:28.149
not that this is an animal we haven't
discovered yet, but rather that it is a supernatural

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:32.759
creature.
In fact, it specifically says -- the promoter

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:37.279
claimed -- what we've got here is the skeleton
of

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:41.760
Leviathan. This beast from the Hebrew Bible.
From the

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.890
Old Testament this kind of chaos monster that
existed

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.939
from the beginning of time. So you see there,
as the scientific community has

00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:56.310
said, "no, we need evidence." Sort of the
American

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.990
public in the popular imagination said, "We
don't care about that

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.480
and in fact, maybe it's supernatural. Maybe
that's the

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.539
explanation for these creatures." As you might
guess, I

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:11.709
do draw some connections in the book between
sort of

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:14.520
popular misunderstanding of what counts for
scientific

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:21.101
evidence today -- the whole debate over intelligent
design. I mean in certain kinds of ways, it's

00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:24.970
the same
sort of discussion. By the way, just side

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:30.690
note, that in
fact was an actual set of fossils. It's simply

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.029
that it
was fossils that had been taxidermied together

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:40.440
to look like a
sea serpent and became so popular that Herman

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.221
Melville
actually mentions it in Moby Dick. There's

00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:45.760
a reference in
Moby Dick to these fossils that have been

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.870
discovered in
northern Alabama that some people believe

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.340
are the bones
of fallen angels, he says. Became quite a

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:59.580
important part
of sort of the American psyche in the 19th

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.820
century. Now,
not all monsters are quite so friendly and

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.890
interesting as
the sea serpent. And in fact in some ways

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.500
at least one
of the new monsters -- the late 20th century

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.270
monsters --
that have obsessed Americans is sort of the

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:21.350
knife-wielding maniac. The psycho. And of
course, this

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.520
begins in the late 1950s with one of America's
first

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.980
modern celebrity serial killers -- Ed Gein.
The Ed Gein

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:38.429
killings which directly influenced the 1960
film Psycho.

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:42.740
And then, by the 1970s, certainly by the 1980s
and for

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.390
sure in the early 90s, there was this mountain
of films,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:57.350
books, sociological material, even criminological
material on the dangers of the serial killer.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.320
And in
fact, the alleged dangers of the serial killer

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.610
to
essentially everybody. To every American.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.550
Even though
statistically, all the homicides in the United

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.470
States
during the 1980s taken together -- only about

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.980
0.01
percent of those murders were actually ever

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.980
traced to an
actual serial killer or stranger killing as

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.960
they were
often called. And yet, there was this mountain

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.650
of
material produced about them. Why is that?

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.610
Why did the
serial killer become the monster of that particular

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.720
moment? Well, I think there's a number of
answers to

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.620
that. And part of it has to do with the sort
of

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.380
political climate during that period. There
were some

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.100
who made a connection -- kind of a direct
connection --

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.220
between what they saw as the changes to American
society

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.970
during the sexual revolution. During the 1960s
and

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.900
counterculture and what they saw as an increasingly
quote

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:06.299
unquote degenerate society in the 1970s and
1980s. And

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:09.730
some of these claims actually came from some
relatively

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.690
surprising sources. So, for example, in 1984
-- which

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.850
was kind of the beginning really in a way
of the serial

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.409
killer becoming a major obsession in American
society. A

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.710
New York Times Editorial reported that quote
many

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.050
officials -- no officials named, no agency
actually

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.971
linked to them, just simply "many officials,"
believe

00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:37.690
that a link exists between sweeping changes
and attitudes

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.409
regarding sexuality that have occurred in
the last 20

00:20:41.409 --> 00:20:46.799
years and the emergence of the serial killer.
So that

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:53.909
very vague assertion suggested that the sexual
revolution -- maybe second wave feminism as

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:59.410
well -- the
direct result of that had been serial murder.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.850
Now, some
made this -- connected these dots -- dots

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.429
not easy to
connect in an even stranger sort of way. One

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:11.340
of the most
popular genres during the 1980s and in fact

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.370
it's remained
a very popular genre -- true crime book, the

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:23.620
true crime novel. And in fact, there
was a particular author, Ann Rule, R-U-L-E,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.620
who was a particular best seller.
I mean, her books were just insanely popular.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.960
If there
are any -- this is a strange way to put it

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.321
-- but if
there are any Ted Bundy fans [laughter] out

00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:42.289
there. Then [chuckles] you
probably have heard the name Ann Rule. Because

00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:46.690
she wrote
the book "Stranger Beside Me," which has become

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:51.270
classic
in the true crime genre. Now Ann Rule is an

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.679
interesting
person. She actually got her start during

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:58.950
the 1960s
writing these kind of under-the-counter -- literally

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.700
kept
under the counter-- magazines with names like

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.440
Spicy
Detective. True Crime. That kind of stuff.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.240
And yet,
by the 80s, she's a best-selling author and

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.830
she's writing
for magazines like Good Housekeeping and Family

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.090
Circle.
And she's making claims like these. In her

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.740
book about
Ted Bundy, she suggests part of the reason

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.410
that Bundy becomes a
serial killer is that he came from an unstable

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:35.120
home. An
unstable domestic environment. She says and

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.789
I quote,
"his mother was deeply involved in the promiscuous

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:45.289
culture created by the 1960s." And so, her
equation

00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:55.340
there is "single mom; dates a lot -- Ted Bundy."
[laughter] Now obviously this was sort of

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.601
a -- these
were sub-political kinds of statements. She

00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:05.000
was not
openly allying herself with the emerging Christian

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.070
right,
which it's no accident I think the Moral Majority

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.340
was
formed in 1978 almost on the emergence of

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.960
this serial
killer epidemic quote unquote. Nevertheless,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.409
she is using a kind
of political language -- certainly a culturally

00:23:23.409 --> 00:23:26.780
political
language. And she wasn't alone in this. The

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.730
true crime
genre did this a lot, talked about the monster

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:39.220
as really the production or
the produce of the counterculture. Now, part

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.140
of this
era -- part of the era of the 1980s and part

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.480
of really
the American fascination with the serial killer--

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.091
was the
emergence of the popularity of the slasher

00:23:49.091 --> 00:23:53.140
film. Now,
there's a whole political discussion around

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.399
the slasher
film that I get into in the book that I won't

00:23:56.399 --> 00:23:59.490
really get
into here. The really short version of it

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.799
was that at
least part of the critique of the slasher

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:07.840
film was from
second wave feminist critics who argued that

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.091
essentially
these are movies are killing women. These

00:24:12.091 --> 00:24:16.031
are movies
about how the sexual revolution was bad. These

00:24:16.031 --> 00:24:18.320
are
movies in which the first couple that had

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.620
sex is the one
that dies and the only woman that lives is

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.610
the one that's
a virgin. That's kind of really in a way I

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.440
would argue a
simplistic understanding of these films. And

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.570
that did
come out of and was important part of second

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.420
wave feminism's
critique of these. Third wave feminism has

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.240
a much more
complicated view of these movies. And I should

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.840
add even
in talking about this that I consider myself

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.860
a feminist
scholar. And so, some of the things I'll have

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.710
to say about
them should be read in that light. I actually

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.440
want to
bracket that whole discussion -- although

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.630
I'm happy to
answer some questions about it and talk to

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.290
you instead a
little bit about kind of a different -- maybe

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.090
a sort of
new interpretation of these films. I actually

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.480
see the
slasher films as what I call subversive fairy

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.419
tales.
Stories that are overturning certain kinds

00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:15.790
of stories
that had already been circulating in American

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:21.990
society.
Specifically, cautionary tales about the dangers

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.169
of the
counterculture, the dangers of sexuality.

00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:31.390
Urban legends
and social rumors that had suggested basically

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.110
young
people -- particularly young women -- were

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.799
completely out
of control. So let me give you a couple of

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:44.400
examples of
that. In talking about what I call the dangerous

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.850
babysitter stories. And then, also the babysitters
in

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:54.309
danger stories. Let's talk dangerous babysitters
first.

00:25:54.309 --> 00:25:57.780
Now, believe me I didn't think that a book
about monsters

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.269
would lead me into researching the history
of babysitting but it

00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:03.789
certainly did and it actually turned out to
be a

00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:07.000
important part of this story. You probably
all heard the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.840
urban legend of the cooked baby. The cooked
baby story

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.669
as it's generally told today. Although this
isn't the

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:19.230
original version of it. I'll tell you the
original

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.059
version. But as it's usually told today. Babysitter
--

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:27.419
she's talking to -- who of course is female,
right?

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:31.059
Always female. Babysitter is talking on her
phone to her

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:33.610
boyfriend. She's watching TV. She's raiding
the

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.700
refrigerator. She's been told to put the roast
in the

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:43.110
oven and the baby to bed and [laughter] instead
she puts, you know,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.320
the roast to bed and she puts the baby in
the oven. It's

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.779
terrible, right? And everybody knows somebody
who knows

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:54.559
somebody who's cousin knew somebody that saw
this on the

00:26:54.559 --> 00:27:01.940
news. [laughter] It's an urban legend, right?
Well, the original

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.830
version of this story -- folklorists refer
to it as the

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.039
hippie babysitter. Because it's a story that
started

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:13.399
circulating in the 1960s. And it basically
went like

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:19.390
this. It's similar to the version I just repeated,
except the babysitter is a counter-cultural

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:24.049
teen that
shows up high. And for whatever reason -- parents

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:26.429
decide, "okay, she's high. We're going out
to dinner

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:30.270
anyway." They leave her with the baby. And
because

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.419
she's smoking pot, that has led her to put
the roast to

00:27:35.419 --> 00:27:40.899
bed and the baby in the oven. Now, there's
an even later

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:43.059
version of the story that started making the
rounds in

00:27:43.059 --> 00:27:47.650
the 1970s that made it not a babysitter but
rather a

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.900
single mom who's taken too much Valium. And
that's

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.139
what caused this horrible thing to occur.
So these

00:27:57.139 --> 00:28:02.269
were -- these were sort of social cautionary
tales.

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:05.080
These kind of social rumors that were meant
to be

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:10.570
warnings about what happens if you trust young
people, if

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.139
you let counter-cultural kids too close to
your own kids,

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:18.779
and about why you ought to, for goodness sakes,
stay within

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:21.360
a traditional marriage. You're liable to cook
the baby

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.399
otherwise essentially. [laughter] Now, allied
to those stories is

00:28:27.399 --> 00:28:30.779
the babysitter in danger story. And this is
so famous, I

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:33.179
don't even have to tell it. In fact, there
was a movie

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:36.769
made about it in the 70s and a recent remake.
The whole

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:40.130
story about the babysitter. She's at home.
There's a

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.649
call being made. The call, it turns out, is
from inside

00:28:44.649 --> 00:28:48.600
the house. The mad killer is actually up stairs.
It is

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.630
sometimes called the story of the man upstairs.
That's

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.980
sort of the folklorist version of it. It's
related to

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:02.260
the dangerous babysitter in that it's yet
another story

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.270
about how, really, young women don't know
what they're

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.649
doing. They really cannot be left in charge
of things.

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:13.800
They're going to be -- they're going to become
victims.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.360
And both of these versions -- both of these
types of

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.000
stories -- either say young women are victimizers
or

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.909
they're victims. Now, what does that have
to do with the

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:30.080
Slasher genre? Well, the Slasher genre in
different ways

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.519
turns these stories on their heads. It takes
these

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:37.779
social cautionary tales, which have basically
been around

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:42.710
for 20 years, and tells a very different version
of them.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:48.919
John Carpenter's Halloween, for example, in
1978, it's a story about babysitters

00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:52.910
in danger. Laurie Strode is a babysitter in
danger. Jamie Leigh

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.080
Curtis is a babysitter in danger. Does she
become the

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.510
victim? Does she show herself ultimately to
be

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.750
irresponsible? No. In fact, she becomes the
monster

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.221
hunter. She's kind of the Van Helsing of the
story -- the one that

00:30:08.221 --> 00:30:11.080
kills the monster at least until the sequel.
And of

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.019
course they didn't know there was going to
be a sequel

00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.769
when Halloween first came along. So for all
practical

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:21.799
purposes, the monster was dead. Now, quickly
-- there is

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:26.899
a related sort of genre of these. Related
to the

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:32.700
American summer camp. And again, as with babysitting,
I

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.130
really didn't think examining monsters was
going to end

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.159
up leading me to examine the history of the
American

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:42.110
summer camp, but it certainly did. And let
me give you

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.669
kind of a brief version of that. After World
War II, the

00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:49.690
summer camp becomes very important, as does
a whole

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:55.049
network really of civic organizations, church
groups,

00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:59.200
neighborhood organizations, sports organizations
-- all

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.480
which had the purpose of kind of reining in
young people

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.070
who were increasingly seen as getting totally
out of

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:12.779
control. We think of that as, "That's a 1960s
phenomenon," but it's not. 1950s was the age

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:15.720
of Marlon
Brando and the Wild Ones; nobody wanted their

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.429
kid to be Marlon Brando. It's the age of "Rebel
Without a Cause."

00:31:20.429 --> 00:31:22.330
Everybody's afraid, "my kid -- he's wearing
a leather

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.009
jacket; he's going to turn out to be James
Dean." It

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:29.500
was the age of the juvenile delinquent . The
idea of the

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.600
juvenile delinquent became important. So there's
the

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.779
emergence of all this whole system of things
meant to

00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:41.830
become sites of social discipline. Meant to
turn kids

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.940
into good citizens, basically. And the summer
camp was

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:52.409
very much a part of that. Now, a very strange
side to

00:31:52.409 --> 00:31:56.480
summer camp, which we think of as, you know,
encouraging

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.950
the values of teamwork. Everybody sits around
the

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.320
campfire and sings the praises of Camp Watchatoochee
--

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.700
whatever it happens to be. Kids go out and
they encounter

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.930
nature. Fresh air. Exercise. Blah, blah, blah.
That's

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.039
what it's supposed to be about. And yet, there's
this

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:17.210
other side to the summer camp, which many
of you are

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.530
probably familiar with -- in which sitting
around the

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:28.510
campfire also means hearing stories of monstrous
murdering maniacs [laughter] who are hiding

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:33.370
in the woods, [laughter] hiding in
the darkness just right beyond the light of

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.100
the campfire.
The escaped lunatic with a hook for a hand

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:42.309
-- which by
the way, lunatics who have lost their hands.

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:44.700
Why give
them a hook? [laughter] Ever thought about

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:50.049
that? Doesn't make
rational sense. Not a hook. Worst idea ever.

00:32:50.049 --> 00:32:54.370
And yet,
almost every camp -- and actually examined

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.539
kind of the
alumni memories and this kind of thing of

00:32:57.539 --> 00:33:03.649
camps all over
the country. And what I found was camps in

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:07.271
central
Kentucky had stories of Headless Hattie. This

00:33:07.271 --> 00:33:10.929
horrible
sort of female demonic presence that was going

00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:14.190
to come
after the kids. I learned about -- some of

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.960
you maybe
have seen the documentary about "Cropsey",

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.809
this disfigured hermit in
Staten Island but also camps around upstate

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:32.370
New York. And the
warnings always were, "it's the kids who aren't

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.360
practicing the values being taught at summer
camp that

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.830
the creature is going to get." So, if you're
the kid

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:44.139
smoking pot out in the woods, then Headless
Hattie is

00:33:44.139 --> 00:33:47.460
going to get you. If you're the kid who's
off by

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.059
themselves instead of swimming and doing archery
practice

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:54.820
and that kind of stuff, then that's going
to make you the

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.220
victim. In the strangest -- in a way most
offensive

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.720
thing I've found-- was from one of these upstate
New York

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.139
camps that kind of emphasize that it's the
kids who don't

00:34:05.139 --> 00:34:10.520
follow the fresh air, physical regime aspect
of summer

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.980
camp that the monster gets. In fact, the specific
quote -- and I am quoting here -- was that

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:22.230
"we learned
that Cropsey always goes after the fat kids"

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.750
unquote. So
it's literally the kids that are physically

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.220
unfit that
aren't living up to this sort of standard

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.400
of health and
good citizenship that the monster is going

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.780
to go after.
Well, this is part of what makes Friday the

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.649
13th -- at
least in its first two versions -- so interesting.

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:44.569
You
think, "well, it actually sounds very similar.

00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:47.480
There's a
summer camp. There's a maniac out in the woods

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.210
surrounding
the summer camp. But guess what? He doesn't

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.530
go after
the kids. He goes after the counselors. And

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.000
in fact, he
goes after the counselors who are telling

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.010
the stories
around the campfire of the thing that is going

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.300
to to get
you. So in a certain kind of sense, the Friday

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.140
the 13th
films -- particularly again the early ones

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.130
-- I'm talking
1981, 1982, become sort of these vengeance

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:20.130
narratives
for kids who had sort of heard this stuff

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.640
from counselors
for ten years, for 20 years, the monster becomes

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.329
not a moral
custodian, but rather just this force that's

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:32.660
going to
wreak vengeance on all these forces of control

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.480
that
they've had to encounter at summer camp and

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.950
in other
kinds of situations. I would add really briefly

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:44.670
that at
least part of my response to kind of the political

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.240
discussion around the Slasher film has to
do with the

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.990
birth of the idea of the final girl, which
is not my

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.890
phrase at all. There's a scholar by the name
of Carol

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:58.400
Clover who wrote this book with this great
title called

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.730
Men, Women and Chain Saws [laughter] in which
--she as a feminist

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:07.550
scholar herself-- as well explores these films
and talks

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.730
about the fact that -- first of all, they're
not simply

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.890
about women being killed, they're about women
fighting

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.410
killers. And in fact, Halloween, which you
see here with

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.370
Jamie Lee Curtis as we've already talked about.
That's

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.310
the story. And I actually think a lot of these
films

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.780
are the background to a figure that's now
essentially ubiquitous

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.940
in popular culture -- the idea of the female
action hero,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.359
which Buffy is part of, but you could name
ten other

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:37.900
examples in many kinds of ways. That doesn't
make them

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.970
feminist films, but also problematizes the
idea that

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.880
they're simply films about killing women.
You could make

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.460
a stronger argument that they're about women
killing

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.511
monsters. Which is also an interesting kind
of, part

00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.232
of a discussion given the political climate
of the 1970s

00:36:54.232 --> 00:36:59.859
and 80s when these films were born. So, just
to wrap up

00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:04.270
and to hopefully give us a bit of time for
questions as

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.410
well, I just like to say that part of what
my analysis

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.180
does and what the book tries to do is to make
the

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:16.800
argument that really story and history are
not separate.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:24.360
It's not that monsters are about popular entertainment
that's here. And then actual events -- the

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.710
events that
people are actually living as history are

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.670
over here.
Narrative and social structure are always

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.410
together. Now,
we tend to pull them apart. I guess I've pulled

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:39.460
them
apart today just kind of for purposes of analysis.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.890
I'm
not sure that that's how people actually experience

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.020
the
world though. I think that the images that

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.460
they see in
popular narratives -- whether that's more

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.710
recently in
film or longer ago in discussions about sightings

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.839
of the
sea serpent -- has a lot to do with how they

00:37:56.839 --> 00:38:00.880
experience
history. And so, then the monster becomes

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.130
not just a
sort of marginalized entertainment or interesting

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.740
pop
culture, it does become this guide into this

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.510
underground
America -- a way for us to go places that

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.800
maybe there's
not any other way for us to go. So thank you

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.280
very much.
And if you have any questions or anything

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.980
you'd like to
talk about. Thank you.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.980
[Applause].

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.930
&gt;&gt;Scott: Any more of this you'd like to talk
about, I'd love to.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:31.900
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Could you talk about what's happened
to vampires in the last 20 years?

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.869
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oh gosh. In fact, interviewer a

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:41.280
couple of weeks ago
asked me a interesting question. "if you could

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.540
re-title
your book, what would you re-title it?" And

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.359
I've not
seriously answered. I think I would call it,

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:54.570
"yes, there
is stuff about vampires and zombies in here."

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.420
[laughter] Because
you're definitely not the first person. I

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.960
actually spent
a whole chapter on this. A chapter entitled

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.400
"Undead
Americans," in which I explore -- not just

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.580
the recent --
certainly not the recent interest in vampires

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.570
and zombies
as well. But the fact that that's part of

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.950
a longer
trajectory. Really kind of going back to the

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.820
1970s in
certain kinds of ways. In fact, although I'm

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.960
not going
to blame Anne Rice for Twilight. Not at all.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:32.250
I do think
kind of this image of the tormented brooding

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:37.170
vampire with
a soul, who wants a soul, and also in love,

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:42.589
[laughter] and that kind of
thing. I mean, that really goes back to -- that

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:45.460
really
goes back to the incredibly popular Anne Rice

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:51.750
novels which
were 1970s. Came out of the 1970s. And is

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.750
part of --
both that and the zombie phenomenon. I see

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.420
as part of
kind of a -- well, actually I talk about Reagan

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:05.190
talking
about the post-Vietnam syndrome, which, in

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:10.480
part, has to do
with a fascination with and an awareness of

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.369
the
dismembered body. Gore as kind of a popular

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:19.559
culture in
certain ways obviously more of an influence

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:23.700
on the zombie
mythology than vampire but certainly kind

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:33.630
of a
fascination with death that's very much in

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.880
the
background. Yeah.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.950
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Regarding the serial killer fascination.
[inaudible]

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:44.030
Jack the Ripper. [inaudible] Like the time
where people sensationalize.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:51.710
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oh, actually in the 1880s. One of
the most popular American -- not English --

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:57.440
American narratives was Jack the Ripper.
Americans were more into Jack the Ripper than

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:04.440
the British were. In fact, so much so there
were all these claims Jack the Ripper was

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.510
an
American. There were claims that Jack the

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:15.170
Ripper -- [audience member comments inaudibly]
[laughter] It's hilarious. Because

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:20.430
actually that's exactly what it was. It was
kind of like this. [laughter] Their monster

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.300
can't be
better than our monster, you know? [laughter]

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.650
It's
exactly it. I mean, there were stories

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:33.040
about -- oh, there's been these weird killings
in Texas -- got to be Jack the Ripper. Weird

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.119
killings in New York. He's come over here
or

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:41.560
maybe he was an American in the first place.
There were novels written in which the

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.140
Pinkerton agents, that sort of secret service
--

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:53.240
private secret service, pre-Black Water Black
Water of the 19th century they go over to

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:59.470
England to investigate the White Chapel murders
and they discover it's actually a Native

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:05.869
American who's doing this and that that
accounts for the quote unquote savagery of

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:12.349
the killings. And
so, yeah. Many of you if you've ever read

00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:18.369
Larson's excellent book, "Devil in a White
City." That talks about the serial killer,

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:22.220
H. H.
Holmes, who in some ways was kind of America's

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:26.420
first real celebrity serial killer of the
19th

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:34.420
century. In fact, received like 10,000 bucks
from Hearst to write his story. It was kind

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.430
of
the first true crime story. Then it went away.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:44.480
For a really long time. And comes back. But
there's definitely a big background. I wish

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.579
I
had put that in the book "USA, USA". [laughter]

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:50.470
That would
have been a great section title kind of for

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.470
that really..
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So earlier you were talking about

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.020
how they watch these movies -- shock movies.
And you said that it was basically the culture

00:42:53.020 --> 00:43:02.481
at the time didn't find this scary. Could
it

00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:13.840
also be these things have been subsumed into
the culture. They've seen these things before

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:20.380
so it no longer -- like out there and scary.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:26.930
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think that could be it. I think
that, you know -- so for example, you know,

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:36.619
thinking about -- thinking about the
universal -- the universal monsters. They're

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:48.280
in some ways almost a kind of an iconography
now. And kind of immediately recognizable.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.859
You know, I thought of them before as kind
of

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:56.950
an almost literal iconography in the sense
that

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.940
religious symbols that at one time may have
had

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:08.349
this powerful "oomph" kind of punch. You know,
even -- especially some of the gory stuff

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:11.390
like
stations of the cross and saints with arrows

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:16.170
sticking out of them and all that kind of
thing. I mean, after a certain point, that

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:22.280
just becomes that stuff on the church wall.
And I think in a certain kind of way, that

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:30.040
maybe has happened with those kinds of
monsters. Although, I do still think that

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.770
it
has to do with the moment that makes things

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:37.440
scary. I mean, I think it's really interesting
for example that what's sometimes called the

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:43.510
torture porn genre -- The Hostel and Saw and
that kind of stuff. I mean, those movies

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.160
appear right in a moment when we're having
an actual

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.930
conversation about the ethics of torture.
And

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.060
so, it seems like the monsters are really
hard

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:58.780
wired into the moment in a way that makes
them

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:04.500
frightening. Which means that horror is a
historical experience, you know, in a kind

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.500
of
way.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:11.650
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Along those same lines, what are
your thoughts about Colonial New England and

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:16.079
kind of unique
circumstances then, whether it's sea serpents

00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:22.240
on Gloucester or the Salem witch trials, what
was going on in this part of the country that

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.869
caused so much of it to happen here?

00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:25.300
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's easy. Puritans. [laughter]
No, yeah --

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.670
in a way that's true. Actually, the first
sea

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:35.560
serpent sightings in New England were in the
early 17th century. Although the Gloucester

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.230
serpent that I talked about. There was a lot
of discussion about what that meant and even

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:46.829
some efforts later to connect it to the
supernatural. The very first sightings by

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:54.441
Puritans in 1630s, 1640s, they were convinced
these were manifestations of Satan. Big

00:45:54.441 --> 00:46:00.040
surprise with them, right? Because everything
was. These were people who even thought black

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:07.650
bears were manifestation. Black dogs were
manifestations of the devil. And so, it's

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.240
really interesting that you move from that
to

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.849
-- in the very same part of the country -- in
the early 19th century -- a kind of quasi,

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:19.320
turned out
pseudo, kind of discussion of the same kinds

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.230
of
creatures. But yeah, it's certainly the

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:30.339
influence of Puritanism seeing all kinds of
phenomenon through the filter of Calvinism

00:46:30.339 --> 00:46:32.640
and
all its associated terrors, you know? Yeah?

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.640
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Fascinating to think about the
path

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.000
of social discussion next to what's happening
in pop culture. Just curious

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:45.460
think about today and monsters in the news
today of the history

00:46:45.460 --> 00:47:02.570
or even broader catholic church to Penn State.
It's the national

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:08.120
social dialogue that you would kind of think
was running in parallel to that-- experience,

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.309
if there is one.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Well, you know, there actually is

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:19.070
always -- always -- horror narratives connected
to dangers to children. And that is nothing

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:25.020
new at all. I mean, in fact, the Slasher
phenomenon, the serial killer phenomenon,

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.609
was
connected to that. The witch craze was connected

00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:31.160
to
that to some degree. Because there were all

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:38.740
these discussions about, "it's women who are
infertile, who are unable to become mothers

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.590
who
are the ones most likely to become witches."

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:49.960
And that's kind of an anxiety about, "what's
happening with the children?" Yeah, I think

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:58.380
sort of -- a good example of this in the 1980s,
we had the missing child panic in the 1980s.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:04.180
Even though statistically there were actually
fewer missing children during that era than

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.050
in
earlier kinds of eras. But it all got tied

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:15.010
into -- not just the serial killer panic -- you
mention my Satan In America book for example.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.610
I talk about the Satanic panic of that era
where, you know, there was this whole

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:24.470
discussion of every time somebody's pet went
missing, they were convinced there was a

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:30.270
Satanic ceremony of some kind being performed.
My grandmother

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.360
actually thought Satanists were stealing her
cats. [laughter] Serious..

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:40.579
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Have we seen changes in like the
tenor or the subjects of the monster

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:49.980
over the years, sort of like the waves of
immigration that we've seen?

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.680
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes, although what came to mind
when

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.151
you first said that was that there's been
a

00:48:55.151 --> 00:48:57.940
tendency obviously through American history
to

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.320
monsterrize the immigrant in certain kinds
of

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.650
ways. I actually think that that's one of
the

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:11.359
interesting things about the popularity of
Dracula in 1931. Dracula is essentially an

00:49:11.359 --> 00:49:16.170
immigrant. And in fact, he's an eastern
European immigrant, which American culture

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:23.339
during that period was especially nervous
about. People with Bela Lugosi's accent were

00:49:23.339 --> 00:49:27.820
seen as a threat. And a specific kind of
threat. Don't know if you're familiar with

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:34.309
the white slavery panic of the early 20th
century. This is what it was called. This

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:37.100
kind of rumor panic that essentially said,
"you

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.460
know, these young innocent Anglo women from
the

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.440
farms of the Midwest are going to places like
Chicago. And what they're finding there are

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.430
these immigrants from eastern Europe, often
Jews, who are seducing them, turning them

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:58.080
into
prostitutes." Sort of early ideas about sex

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.460
traffic about. That kind of stuff. Never any
actual evidence that this was actually

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.760
happening, as with most of these things. There
were novels being published

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:14.599
about it, discussions of it. Then you have
the very same period Dracula that's about

00:50:14.599 --> 00:50:17.640
this
eastern European immigrant who has this

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.589
incredible power to seduce women with a simple
look and to actually kind of make them part

00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:29.230
of
his harem. And so, again, I think that kind

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:33.650
of
goes to this idea of, "what is it about history

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:38.069
that makes things frightening at particular
moments?" I mean, in the background of those

00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:42.590
people's minds would have been all of those
ideas.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:47.750
Whether or not it was sort of conscious when
they were watching it is hard to know. I've

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.740
also thought about the fact today when we
watch

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:57.920
the original Frankenstein, James Whale's 1932
Frankenstein. He comes across.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:03.859
And I think this was actually Whale's intention.
He comes across as this very sympathetic kind

00:51:03.859 --> 00:51:11.140
of monster. I'm not sure many 1932 audiences
would have seen it that way. You know, there's

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:19.000
kind of a lynch mob that forms in Frankenstein.
The whole angry villagers with torches kind

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.869
of
stuff. And they form because he essentially

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:27.910
kills this young girl. It's an accident, but
he kills her anyway. One of the things that

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:31.441
struck me as I was reading and writing about
that was, you

00:51:31.441 --> 00:51:37.610
know, in 1932, film that showed all over the
country, film that also showed in rural

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:42.920
theaters in the American South, there would
have been people -- I don't mean this as a

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.730
joke
at all -- there would have been people watching

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.599
that film who had taken part in a lynch mob.
I

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:52.810
mean, lynching was relatively common during
that

00:51:52.810 --> 00:52:01.910
period in the South. And so, how they would
have viewed that story as opposed to how

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:05.670
contemporary viewers would have seen it is
an

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.850
interesting thing to look at it. I mean, some
of the same people would have thrilled to

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:14.930
the heroics of the
Ku Klux Klan in Birth of a Nation, right.

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.359
And there's
actually similar imagery in Frankenstein and

00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:25.240
Birth of a Nation. And
so, I think in a way history is what's scary.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.410
It's what's happening at that particular
historical moment.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.260
&gt;&gt; Male #6: When you're talking about history
is

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.520
what's scary. If you look at how things have
progressed.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:42.310
These supernatural creatures and
then there's Satanism and there's magic and

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:46.390
supernatural. And I'm looking at movies now
--

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:53.599
particularly the Saw genre. Are people scared
of mechanical engineers? [laughter]

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:59.660
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes. [laughter] People are also
increasingly scared -- you know, historians

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:07.270
aren't really supposed to prognosticate, but
people are also increasingly scared of sort

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.660
of
the terrors of the digital frontier. This

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.510
may
be a good place to talk about this. You know,

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:20.230
I think about films like Source Code, Duncan
Jones' Source Code, where

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:26.720
there's this idea of -- it's not killer
Androids -- it's not killer robots. It's our

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:36.280
humanity locked into the technology. And also,
the terrors that I think are kind of implicit

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:44.520
in the fact that, almost all of us exist as
ourselves and also as Internet constructs

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.270
of
one kind or another. I mean, my publicist

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:53.570
made me get on Twitter this month. Been on
Facebook forever. So now there's me. But then

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:56.890
there's also these things that aren't really
me

00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:03.000
out there, you know? And what's that? That's
the doppelganger. I mean, that's sort of the

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.870
terror
as old as Gothic literature itself. Things

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:12.339
that are you but really isn't you. And I
actually think that in film and maybe even

00:54:12.339 --> 00:54:15.109
in
ethical reflection on these kinds of things,

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:19.339
we're going to see more and more monsters
on

00:54:19.339 --> 00:54:27.770
that digital frontier. Let's call them the
Google monsters for example. [laughter] Yeah?

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.252
&gt;&gt; Male #7: In 9/11 something very, very scary
happened. And we sort of started a national

00:54:31.252 --> 00:54:32.980
conversation
about fear became 'we have to protect ourselves

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:45.460
from fear' -- we're being too driven by
fear. We need to be driven by hope. All these

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.960
things. And I [inaudible] on that translating
itself to

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.152
monsters in the pop culture over the last
10 years. Is it because it

00:54:55.152 --> 00:55:01.910
was all above board that there wasn't any
need to create things below board? Or [inaudible].

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:07.309
&gt;&gt; Male #8: That's like when the Muslim
subculture, the Arab terrorism started being

00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:20.190
very big. That's the fear of where that fear
really started growing. It wasn't a big thing

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:27.630
before that. Before that when you heard about
people terrorism, they were blowing buses

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:31.690
up in London and the IRA?

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:35.870
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So I'm so close to it that the
fear

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:40.190
that sounds credible, although overblown to
me,

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:43.619
is what historians 50 years from now will
be

00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:45.200
studying as the Muslim scare.

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.360
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I think there will be some
of

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:54.230
that. I think it's also true though that –
and I think part of your question was, "why

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:59.280
haven't there been fantasy scenarios that
have

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.270
obstructed that, reflected that, become
metaphors of that." And I actually think there

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:09.339
has been to some degree. I actually think
that

00:56:09.339 --> 00:56:17.490
part of the new terror of Contagion -- the
movie, Contagion -- the terror of infection.

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.079
The terror of sort of out of control disease
--

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:25.910
has to do with anxieties about everything
from

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:33.720
dirty bombs to bird flu to bio-weapons to
-- all

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:38.180
of that. And if you think about films like
Contagion, if you think about Rise of the

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.690
Planet of the Apes. If you think about 28
days

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.740
Later. I mean, all of these are films that
are

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.130
in certain kinds of ways tapping into fears
of

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:55.500
uncontrollable outbreaks of infection sometimes
related to military -- quasi military --

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.480
actions of one kind or another. I haven't
seen

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:05.090
Contagion yet, but I have a friend, horror
novelist Jonathan Maberry who said after he

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:09.280
saw Contagion, he wanted to do Jell-O shots
of

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.950
sanitary soap. [laughter] So I don't know
if any of the

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:18.220
rest of you have seen it yet, but anyway.
Yeah?

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:22.099
&gt;&gt; Male #9: Potential source just like much
of

00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:32.549
the TV series 24 particularly [audience members
speak simultaneously] --

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:39.510
&gt;&gt;Male #10: There's a lot
of stuff I don't think it falls into the horror

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:40.510
of the genre. It falls into action adventure
more than horror.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:41.510
&gt;&gt; Male #11: Well, so 24 is a great example.
I

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:46.180
think it is trying to look at it 40 years
later. The story of the pervasive underground

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:55.833
conspiracy. He has to not just find the first
guy. But the guy behind and the guy behind.

00:57:55.833 --> 00:57:59.670
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right. And the threat that's being
faced is so terrible that any means necessary

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:04.900
becomes possible to deal with it is often
the case in

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.670
the horror genre. Like, if you're fighting
the

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.800
monster, then everything becomes fair. You
can

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.309
sort of suspend ethical reflection, and you
can just burn

00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:18.320
the whole town down, right? All right.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:24.020
&gt;&gt; Multiple audience members: Thank you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Scott: Thank-you

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:24.840
[applause]
