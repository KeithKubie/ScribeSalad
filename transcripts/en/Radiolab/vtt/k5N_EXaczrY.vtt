1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
We're going to start with a conversation that I had with Jad a few weeks ago.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.260
Okay. So I like medical stories.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.870
This I know about you and this, you know, um,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
and so I read this website called stat news.com which does sort of really,

5
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.440
it's like a new website out of Boston. It's new, right? They basically,

6
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.940
it's this collection of really amazing like medical reporters and I will click

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.690
on stories that look interesting and there was one about, um,

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
we'd just grown embryos, human embryos for a long time in a lab.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.340
And that was when I read the phrase,

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.010
the 14 day rule for the first time.

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.390
And it was that apparently there's this thing that you can't grow an embryo in a

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.790
lab past 14 days. Huh.

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.810
Which I didn't even know you could grow an embryo in a lab at all. Right. Or,

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
or that people were or that, I mean,

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.040
I guess I knew IVF happened. Sure. Like test tube babies,

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
how long in the average IVF situation, how long has an embryo in a dish for it.

17
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.010
And then I realized, I didn't actually even know that either.

18
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.180
So then I just spun out.

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840
So like the whole article is just interesting to me cause I was like,

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.290
<v 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.250
<v 0>I don't know about any of this, right?</v>

22
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.830
<v 2>I'm Molly Webster. Oh. And I am Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.</v>

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.670
And today on radio lab we're going to zip down a worm hole into another

24
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:23.770
universe. And Robert, you're coming with me. Okay.

25
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.280
W what can you tell me about the universe? [inaudible] okay,

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.180
you're going to want to buy a ticket because in this universe are twins and

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.620
souls and mice and something called the primitive streak and they're all

28
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.760
gathered together around a certain rule. And who am I making what the rule was?

29
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.880
Well, um, so you know how you can fertilize an egg,

30
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:45.910
you get negative sperm and you put them together. Yes. Fertilizes the egg,

31
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.690
right? And then the egg, the fertilized egg,

32
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.560
it multiplies multiply cell divides.

33
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.820
So a scientist could take it to watch it grow, to learn about human development,

34
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.590
<v 0>but then they have to stop at day 14.</v>

35
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.230
That's the rule because this is a medical kind of thing or science limitation.

36
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.330
It is, it's medical, it's all those things.

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.840
It's medical and it's science and there's like philosophy and ethics and

38
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.730
obviously religion and uh, that's, yeah, you're buying it now.

39
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.210
Bang. I have water. Okay, I'll take a sip. Okay.

40
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.980
And we are going to begin with this guy, Leroy Walters. Okay.

41
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.730
He was an ethicist at Georgetown University, now retired.

42
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.410
And to me he is sort of the father of the 14 day rule. I never,

43
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060
I never thought of myself as the father 14 day rule,

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.310
but he is. He totally is. Well,

45
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
we shouldn't forget the context of 73 all right.

46
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.990
So 1973 Leroy has recently graduated with a doctorate in ethics from Yale

47
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.380
University and he's settling into his job and at the time,

48
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.970
medicine and ethics sort of collision course.

49
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.130
Yes, yes. [inaudible]

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.180
<v 2>January, 1972</v>

51
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.160
<v 3>and landmark ruling the supreme court today legalized abortion.</v>

52
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.080
Roe v Wade happens. It is clear,

53
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:14.081
at least under present law that a unborn fetus is not a person within the

54
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:18.230
meaning of the constitution. But just six months after that decision,

55
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.730
the issue of fetuses and research done with them.

56
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.020
Fetal research became a hot topic.

57
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.080
Some of the testimony in here is shocking news reports,

58
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.900
butchering and patting up in that area,

59
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.810
<v 2>dissecting fetuses, even an instance of decapitating fetuses. Oh Man.</v>

60
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.470
And then around the same time that human Guinea pig,

61
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.510
the research involving human beings,

62
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:43.890
controversial Tuskegee syphilis study news reports of the civil studies that

63
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.260
were done on African American men without their knowledge,

64
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:50.640
there was that sterilization of daughters had been sterilized without their

65
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.880
informed and women with intellectual disabilities,

66
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.540
extremis and genetic research, genetic engineering was coming into its own.

67
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.860
He have all these questions swirling about like how we feel about the human

68
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:02.520
body,

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.030
whether or not we want to experiment on and what do we protect and what don't we

70
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:06.864
protect.

71
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.180
It's just sort of this whirlwind and uh,

72
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.580
<v 4>you are about to see a his time</v>

73
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.100
<v 2>then most relevant for our story.</v>

74
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.040
<v 4>Yeah. Okay. Is there in a sec,</v>

75
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830
<v 2>on July 25th, 1978 scientists in the the,</v>

76
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.830
<v 4>okay. We are now in sizing the uterus itself</v>

77
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.843
reduced

78
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.840
<v 5>a child with the aid of invitro fertilization.</v>

79
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.160
<v 2>The first baby that was born from an embryo that was grown inside a tube.</v>

80
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.223
Baby Lewis Brown babies.

81
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.690
<v 4>No, that wasn't her eyes yet.</v>

82
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.763
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.260
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

84
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.920
<v 5>Everyone in the world was fascinated,</v>

85
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.170
but there were people who predicted doom.

86
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.650
What was the doom that in vitro fertilization would lead to reproduction as a

87
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.200
form of manufacturer.

88
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.320
<v 2>So the government was grappling with,</v>

89
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.880
we need more regulations or we need as a country to think about like what our

90
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.240
ethical guidelines are, right? So the Department of Health,

91
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.470
education and welfare,

92
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.790
and they put together something called the ethics advisory board panel of

93
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:31.740
doctors, layman academics,

94
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.370
even a Jesuit priest that's consider it some fundamental moral and ethical

95
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.240
questions. Questions involved in test tube, human fertilization.

96
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.010
It's meetings and discussions open today. Now as part of those meetings,

97
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.780
the board will call in these expert witnesses.

98
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.980
And one of those witnesses was our boy Leroy, right? The staff director.

99
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.770
And they asked Leroy like ethically,

100
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:57.060
tell us what we should be thinking about when it comes to embryos and how we are

101
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.130
to regard them.

102
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.590
<v 0>And he says, well, there's a spectrum. And on the one side you could argue,</v>

103
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.890
okay,

104
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 5>human embryos should be protected from the time of fertilization forward.</v>

105
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.780
<v 0>We shouldn't even be growing embryos in a lab at all.</v>

106
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.400
But then there's the other side. Okay.

107
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.440
<v 5>Most permissive position was that research could be done until about eight weeks</v>

108
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.920
<v 0>because</v>

109
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.920
<v 5>a fetus at about eight weeks can have a reflex response to a stimulus.</v>

110
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.040
And then [inaudible]

111
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.280
<v 0>at some point a committee member turns to Leroy and she says,</v>

112
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.200
where would you draw the line? He pauses and he says, well,

113
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.060
<v 5>well, I would say for me 14 days,</v>

114
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.850
<v 0>why 14? Well,</v>

115
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.750
Leroy had a couple of different arguments for one before 14 days,

116
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.780
<v 5>about 50% of early human embryos are simply sloughed off.</v>

117
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.460
<v 0>They're just sort of shed from the woman's uterus</v>

118
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.420
<v 5>and don't develop further.</v>

119
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.420
<v 0>So the thinking was, if we are already losing 50% of them, naturally</v>

120
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.220
<v 5>we don't have strong moral obligations toward early human embryos.</v>

121
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.180
I see. You can even pose it as a metaphysical question.

122
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.920
If these are important beings, why do 50% of them disappear?

123
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.490
And we never had any knowledge of them. Argument number two,

124
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.100
early embryos can split into two

125
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.730
<v 0>as in twin</v>

126
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.960
<v 5>or two. Separate embryos can recombine</v>

127
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.690
<v 0>into one embryo, right, like before 14 days in embryo,</v>

128
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:34.600
doesn't know if it's one embryo or if it's like can be one person or if it's

129
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.180
going to be two people. So as Lee ripe put it,

130
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.160
it doesn't have a biological identity and that happens right around 14 days.

131
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.750
[inaudible] argument number three,

132
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.440
<v 5>the primitive streak appears primitive streak.</v>

133
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.000
The primitive streak is the first indication of a,

134
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.590
an access of the future body. People see it as like a,

135
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.480
the body starting to organize itself.

136
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.510
You might say it's the outline of the spinal cord that will develop later on.

137
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.400
It's the first hint of like shape.

138
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.080
All of those seem to kind of converge around 14 days.

139
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.580
<v 0>Eventually the committee decides to Take Leroy's suggestion and recommend that</v>

140
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.300
all research on human embryos be stopped at 14 days

141
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.150
<v 5>with high expectations.</v>

142
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.170
We submitted the report to Secretary of Health Education and welfare,

143
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.030
Joseph California on May 4th,

144
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.030
1979 and on July 19th,

145
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.810
1979 before he could respond,

146
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.760
secretary of California was fired by President Jimmy Carter.

147
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.760
<v 0>It was part of a whole cabinet shakeup</v>

148
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.890
<v 5>and so the report has been sitting on shelves gathering dust and there has never</v>

149
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.120
been a formal response.

150
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.100
<v 2>It did end up becoming a guideline in the u s it's actually an international</v>

151
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:04.520
guideline, but we never actually needed it because 14 days

152
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.530
<v 5>that was so far beyond the capacity of researchers to culture early embryos that</v>

153
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.320
it also seemed like a safe, a safe marker,

154
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.180
a safe boundary.

155
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.120
<v 2>Because, and this is the interesting thing with IVF,</v>

156
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.560
we're familiar with like days zero one two three four five,

157
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.300
six which is about the time they put the embryo into the mother [inaudible].

158
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
And so nobody had ever really seen how an embryo develops from day seven through

159
00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:41.920
14 oh, interesting.

160
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.570
You can't photograph it through the body for like various reasons. For one,

161
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.970
no one ever knows they're pregnant that early. Like,

162
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.460
when did you and your wife realize you're pregnant?

163
00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:55.390
It's like a month after the fertilization happens. Yeah. It's funny.

164
00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:57.400
It's like when she, you, even if you're trying,

165
00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:59.590
you don't actually know for weeks until, yeah.

166
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.830
And it's so small that even if you did know the way it attaches to the uterus,

167
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.240
it's sort of burrows in and you kinda can't see it. And at the same time,

168
00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:14.560
scientists are pretty sure that this is a very important moment in development

169
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.950
and they just can't get to it. Wait, wait a second.

170
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.860
Life magazine 50 years ago published these gorgeous pictures of,

171
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.920
of a fertilized cell and then beautiful little baby with eyes,

172
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:29.630
you know, just, yeah. But the, the, the,

173
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:32.630
that they have pictures of sperms in eggs,

174
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.590
then there's a blank spot until at least three and a half weeks.

175
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.940
So that magazine spread. So we ha, so life didn't show the first few.

176
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.820
The second note there are no really? Yeah. You're saying it,

177
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:47.840
there is a place in the development of the human being that no scientist has

178
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:51.680
seen. No ever. No. Really. Yeah.

179
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.030
So this is this kind of period, which in the textbook who would find,

180
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.290
describe as a black box,

181
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.290
which brings us to Magdalena though I Magdala [inaudible] met the University of

182
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.860
Cambridge in UK. Okay, great. Thank you.

183
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.960
She for years had been trying to figure out how to grow embryos during this

184
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:09.500
period,

185
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.750
but for those experiments and the problem was at this point the embryo is

186
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.170
beginning to attach to the mother's uterus and so just need certain things from

187
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:21.170
the mother and if you try and grow it in a dish,

188
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.040
it just shrivels up and dies. Yes, yes. So at the time we were trying create,

189
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.710
scratch our heads and come up with demos and enriching environment.

190
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.480
We could imagine like maybe I can like recreate that really warm,

191
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:39.920
cozy home, but in a dish without the mom.

192
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.521
Interesting.

193
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:45.521
So it's like experimenting like what is the right a bath that the growing embryo

194
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:48.440
needs to sort of get what it needs.

195
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.380
And they decided that while they were still trying to figure it out,

196
00:11:51.381 --> 00:11:53.440
they would just do it on mice embryos first.

197
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.770
And so she started essentially just, um,

198
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.040
coming up with like chemistry concoctions.

199
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.660
<v 7>They started with the Gel,</v>

200
00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:06.260
which was a particular LSD CT sort of gloppy and Gooey,

201
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:09.710
and then they toss it a siro made from human placentas,

202
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.830
added some hormones like progesterone along with five ProPlus growth factors.

203
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.770
And of course the Dasho slamming in fiboronectin is sounds like it.

204
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.160
Like someone would sell this as like a face cream or something.

205
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.660
They even tried serum from, that's Placentas. That actually really didn't work.

206
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.610
It was not so good as this. You don't from the human person say yes, you know,

207
00:12:31.611 --> 00:12:34.100
so for five years they put stuff in, they pulled stuff out,

208
00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:37.960
they tried everything until they ended up with something that at least on mice

209
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.730
seem to work really well. So they thought, okay,

210
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.880
<v 2>maybe it's time we try this with human embryos. We took two,</v>

211
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.520
Andrew's just two human blastocyst,

212
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.170
put them in a dish with their chemical concoction and an amazing grip.

213
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.363
It works.

214
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.850
One of them ditch make it to 13 days.

215
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.030
The other one didn't, but one made it right.

216
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.710
Suddenly they had an embryo that was growing happily into day eight,

217
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.940
day nine, day 10

218
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.320
and they were able to see all of these moments in human development that no one

219
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.610
had ever seen before.

220
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.680
And, and guess what Robert? Yeah, I got to see them too. I did.

221
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.860
We want to come. Of course. I want to come. Okay. Alicia, go right now.

222
00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:40.470
I mean we are going to go but we're going to actually have to take a break

223
00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:43.350
first. Oh God. So we'll be back in a bit. Okay.

224
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.390

I'm Molly Webster is Radiolab and today the 14 day rule.

239
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.051
Last we left you.

240
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:47.340
We had just met a woman who managed to grow a human embryo in a lab right up to

241
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:51.270
the 14 day line. Now we get to see it, right? That's your promise. Yes.

242
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.570
<v 7>When your phone on one of your phone off. Good look. Good luck.</v>

243
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.620
Lucky enough for me

244
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.090
<v 0>in embryology lab right here in New York, Rockefeller University.</v>

245
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.700
How are you? Nice to meet you. Run by this guy, radio scientists,

246
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.300
Ali Ribbon. Lou. I fake being a scientist,

247
00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:15.360
but Ali's team building off of Magdalena's work.

248
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.560
They were also growing human embryos in the lab to the 14 day mark,

249
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.000
so we invited me up to see them

250
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.540
or are seeing something that no other human beings has ever seen except the

251
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:30.090
group in this lab and Obviously Magda lab way.

252
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.210
How many people are in this lab that you think saw?

253
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.390
Let's see what a total of 25 so then I'll be like 26 so Ali has to step out of

254
00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:42.830
the room. I'm excited. Thank you Ali. And he passes me off to a,

255
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.240
the guy that runs like the human embryology research,

256
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.840
<v 7>the lab and a lab technician. She, she up in Nigrini to Chile.</v>

257
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.300
Up Pellegrino? Yes. Okay. We go into the lab, walk into the call lab.

258
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.210
It's very big and everyone's looking at plots of benches and microscopes and

259
00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:01.270
people pipetting. And so a fridge,

260
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.160
there's a little sticky note on the fridge that says experiment 27 embryos here.

261
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.710
So we keep them Tipa and Shelia

262
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.570
<v 0>pulls out like a plastic box that has a blue bottom and like a white opaque top.</v>

263
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.160
The Lid just came off and inside there was kind of like a microscope slide and

264
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:21.130
the embryos were attached to that, but there's condensation on it.

265
00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:23.800
So we had to wait like 10 minutes. I got weirdly nervous,

266
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.960
but eventually we'll be like,

267
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.120
look down into this like little square. Well. Okay.

268
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.010
It's like 10 millimeters by 10 millimeters and it has a little bit of liquid in

269
00:16:36.011 --> 00:16:38.350
it. And then inside that liquid,

270
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.140
<v 10>yeah.</v>

271
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.880
<v 0>Wow. This is human embryo. How big is it? How big is the embryo?</v>

272
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.500
You talk about 14 days, and in my mind I do imagine a tiny little human.

273
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:53.060
Is it even [inaudible]

274
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.830
<v 7>human like at that point, tiny dot right there. No is just the little white dot.</v>

275
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.340
Really crapped. It's really small. That's like a grain of sand.

276
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.330
It's about that size

277
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.420
<v 0>and it looks like I'm,</v>

278
00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:09.250
I kept also thinking that it looked like if you took a sheet of typing paper and

279
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:14.251
you took a pin and you poked a hole in the paper and a little pinpoint of light

280
00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:17.080
came through, it looks like that.

281
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.373
<v 7>Oh,</v>

282
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.610
I cannot believe that goes into a five foot nine tall human being.

283
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.140
<v 0>So that was a day 12 embryo we were looking at with our naked eye,</v>

284
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.920
but guest and Tutelian also took me over to this badass microscope.

285
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.030
<v 7>I don't want to break anything.</v>

286
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.280
So we could look at a bunch of images and see the development of an embryo day

287
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:45.250
by day. Starting with day eight. You see right here, like he,

288
00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:49.040
you have the embryo mass. What are you, what does it look like? It's uh,

289
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.120
it looks very lunar to me blown out gray sphere that has like modeled surfaces,

290
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.110
but inside of it are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cells.

291
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.060
[inaudible] primitive endoderm and there's Abby glass,

292
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.880
there were like three different types of cells.

293
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.460
But to me it like looked like a simple structure.

294
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.280
And then this is the same embryo the next day. Wait is this day nine? Oh whoa.

295
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:14.700
It looks totally different. So it starts to get a little more complex.

296
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.860
Now we can see nuclei that what all those bright spots are. Yeah,

297
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.080
there's a nucleus, there's a nucleus, huh? And it can we switch from nine to 10.

298
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.860
So what are those little oil drop up looking?

299
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.780
Things like oil droplets don't date.

300
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.800
So now there are these like spiritual balls around the edges and it could be any

301
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.890
number of things, but guess things. They might be fat, like Lipid.

302
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.310
And the embryo, it starts forming like the asymmetry,

303
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:43.080
like you see things move to different areas of the south makes a hollow shell

304
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.973
inside.

305
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.390
And then your inner gut cavity that starts to form and there's all of a sudden a

306
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.600
new cell type. We've never seen the yolk sac trove ectoderm cells.

307
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.720
So a totally new type of cell. No one's ever seen before.

308
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:57.630
So we don't know where it comes from and neither does anyone else.

309
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:02.690
And then day 11 do I get excited every time you open one of them.

310
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.990
Okay. Day 11

311
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.493
<v 11>okay.</v>

312
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.490
<v 0>Day 11 didn't really like, looks at different to me.</v>

313
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.930
<v 7>Date Day 12 day 12 has a lot more going on. That's the origin of the placenta.</v>

314
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.003
Cool.

315
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.600
Day 13 there's all this brightness at the bottom in the upper left hand corner.

316
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.040
These could be at the last house. Okay.

317
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:28.020
Remind me again the eblast is that is the the cell type from which the entire

318
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.360
body eventually marches.

319
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.550
<v 0>Guess says those are the cells that all of the body comes from.</v>

320
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:38.300
Like all the other stuff is mostly just support. Oh Wow. So it's like the,

321
00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:42.710
it's like the primal, like primordial foundational cells. Yeah.

322
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.853
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

323
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.390
<v 0>So,</v>

324
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.880
so I actually got there on day 13 of the experiments so all of the embryos were

325
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:55.830
just sort of waiting to get to day 14 and so that was it.

326
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.900
So let's shut this down and get this guy back in the incubator and then I was

327
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:03.140
just sort of spit back out into the real world.

328
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.010
Are they learning fantastically new, amazing things based on this or this one?

329
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:07.970
Like the,

330
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:13.060
the big takeaway that both of the groups had was that this embryo grew for

331
00:20:14.601 --> 00:20:19.250
another week without any maternal input and it grew basically as it should have

332
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:19.740
grown,

333
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.540
<v 12>which was mind blowing to me and to all of my colleagues that the human embryo</v>

334
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.900
will behave in a self organizing manner in a complete absence of maternal inputs

335
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.400
at least for 14 days.

336
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.870
<v 0>I think they always thought even if they got the chemistry right,</v>

337
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.850
there'd be some sort of system breakdown because it wasn't getting input from

338
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:43.470
the mom. Interesting.

339
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.280
I always like keep thinking of it as like the anti mother's Day message.

340
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.010
The embryo

341
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.660
<v 2>doesn't need you happy mother's Day.</v>

342
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.610
<v 0>Um, but the, the one pro pro mom thing is by the,</v>

343
00:20:55.611 --> 00:20:59.240
by the end in between day like 12 to 14,

344
00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:02.990
it became clear that it started needing maternal input. I see.

345
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.990
And so do they know well so they don't I this is a party that was cool.

346
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:07.730
It was like, um,

347
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:12.730
they saw that the embryo started forming tunnels and pathways for the mom to

348
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:14.470
like infiltrate.

349
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:18.040
So there were little tubes and pathways of forum where like nerve attachment

350
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:21.400
could happen and like circulation.

351
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.230
So it prepares itself in this week for the mom and the connection.

352
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:27.064
Really cool.

353
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.370
It's like [inaudible] it's like hooking itself up to the network in a way.

354
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.000
I know. It's funny. It's like coming online as like a human being. Yeah,

355
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.980
that's a good way to put it. Yeah. That's cool.

356
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.010
The other cool thing was a guest told me that right around day 10 along the

357
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.030
edges of the embryo, this hormone shows up and that your body had,

358
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:49.750
doesn't have before. It's called like a Ganache, a trophon. So you know,

359
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:54.160
when you take a pregnancy test, hmm. The thing it's reading is that hormone.

360
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.590
Oh it is that he thinks like the embryo broadcasting. Yes.

361
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.310
It's like

362
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.900
<v 2>boom, boom, boom</v>

363
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.440
<v 0>out to the rest of the body. Like I'm here, I'm here. Look at this hormone. Wow,</v>

364
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.700
that's super cool.

365
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.970
What is it like to look through a microscope and see day eight when we've been

366
00:22:17.251 --> 00:22:21.720
stopped at day seven since the 1970s or day nine or take 10

367
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.510
<v 12>it's hard to describe it.</v>

368
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.030
When people receive the digital image of the Hubble telescope,

369
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.670
those first few eyes who are getting it in their screens,

370
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.360
I guess it has to be something very similar to that.

371
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.130
When I look inside of our own,

372
00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:48.131
and that's to me at the time where nobody knows that we even exist is the same

373
00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:55.001
as looking at dimensions that would have never imagined would ever see because

374
00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:57.050
we didn't even know they exist

375
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:06.860
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

376
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.720
<v 0>but then at day 14 you have to essentially bomb it. Huh?</v>

377
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.280
You like um, can make it stop growing and freeze in the place that it's at.

378
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.210
They call it fixing, but if they want it to, what could they go past 14 days?

379
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.130
Maybe, but Ali,

380
00:23:22.131 --> 00:23:26.780
he said that as they got closer to day 14 they noticed changes in the embryo.

381
00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:30.830
That made it clear that it started needing more than just the current bath that

382
00:23:30.831 --> 00:23:34.850
it was in. Okay. But like in Britain, Lou says this too, in Magdalena says,

383
00:23:34.851 --> 00:23:37.910
this is like every day feels like an accomplishment. You're like, oh my gosh,

384
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.680
it grew another day. And then you start like cheering it on. You're like

385
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.100
<v 2>another day grow another day. Oh my gosh. And it becomes</v>

386
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.300
<v 0>like, you're like championing it it and then you're like, okay,</v>

387
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.890
stop. You're done. Right. And I felt like when I was standing there I was like,

388
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.900
oh, that's abrupt because I wanted it to grow,

389
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:03.680
grow, grow, grow, grow. But obviously I don't want it to grow, grow,

390
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:05.960
grow too far. So I was like, good,

391
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:10.700
are they 1516 and then I'm like, when does the joy in my voice stuff,

392
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.590
I eventually, I'm going to hit him. Don't worry.

393
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.780
I'm going to hit a point where I'm like, that's uncomfortable. Right?

394
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.840
<v 12>This is something that touches us in the root of our own definition of our being</v>

395
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:26.840
in existence. In individuality,

396
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.940
it's becomes a little bit like a Pandora box. So yes,

397
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:35.900
you to open it, but you have to be ready to see what's in it.

398
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.700
<v 14>If technology has now moved it a whole nother week, so we can go for 14 days,</v>

399
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.120
maybe it's pretty soon, you can go a whole nother week. And then home mother,

400
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.200
we got what are the, what does that mean? The rules going to have to change?

401
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.350
<v 0>That is the conversation that's happening right now. Um,</v>

402
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.120
basically once this research was published,

403
00:24:55.121 --> 00:25:00.121
there were commentaries and articles and columns about what do we do about the

404
00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.440
14 day rule? And there's conferences,

405
00:25:02.441 --> 00:25:04.690
there's a conference in Boston that's happening in the fall.

406
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.650
<v 14>Well, what are your choices though? Like you could choose,</v>

407
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.000
<v 0>could, could do any number of things.</v>

408
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.350
It depends on where you sort of throw down a biological or moral marker that you

409
00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:16.060
feel comfortable with. Like, um,

410
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.600
you could keep it at 14 days and sort of keep it around like this idea of

411
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:24.190
twinning and the primitive streak. Uh, you could move it a week out.

412
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.120
So say today,

413
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.320
21 when there's interesting sort of neural folds and divisions that are starting

414
00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:32.080
to happen in the brain, you could go to eight weeks,

415
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.430
but it could also go back to zero. Oh, so there's no consensus on, no, no.

416
00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:39.190
There's no consensus. And the scientists are the first to say like,

417
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.820
they don't want to make this decision. They just think like,

418
00:25:42.821 --> 00:25:45.370
maybe we should have this conversation as a group. Um,

419
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.200
so this society decides not us. So yeah. And then, but it's just like,

420
00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:53.560
if you say that like, it's amazing as like the Hubble telescope.

421
00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:55.180
How does it feel when you're like,

422
00:25:55.181 --> 00:25:57.700
I've gotten this far and now I have to end it?

423
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.090
<v 12>Um, so that's the toughest question you're gonna ask me today. Uh,</v>

424
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:05.931
for me,

425
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:10.931
for sure it was important to stop the experiments where there was still a

426
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:17.180
message that we could convey that would not offend people.

427
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.610
This is more than just science.

428
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.320
One of the greatest challenge in reproductive biology,

429
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.660
especially in human reproductive biology,

430
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:32.350
is to make sure that you don't offend people sense of uh,

431
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.210
identity, dignity, religion.

432
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.120
<v 0>And so Ali,</v>

433
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:42.121
he finds himself trying to keep all of these different perspectives in his head

434
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.680
all once.

435
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.970
<v 12>So for example, if the Catholic point of view is human religions conception,</v>

436
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.750
then I have to respect also the Jewish point of view that says, you know,

437
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.710
what is that heartbeat?

438
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.480
Also have to respect the Muslim point of view about the origin of human life,

439
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.080
which surprisingly for Ron seems to be similar than the Jewish point of view is

440
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:05.460
also heartbeats. I also have to respect the Buddhist point of view.

441
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.000
And what about the Hindus? The Buddhist says if you don't get [inaudible],

442
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.950
you're not independent, you're not a human being.

443
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.570
You don't call an organic human being as it's attached to you. And Hindu says,

444
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.390
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

445
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.280
There is no origin or and what circles within circles within circles.

446
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.820
I'm a butterfly today I'm going to die and come back as a tiger.

447
00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:34.580
I'm going to then come back as a human, then come back as an elephant.

448
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.090
What origin? That circle does not have an origin.

449
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.420
So I am for the progress of silence.

450
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.510
I am for gaining knowledge. It's my job.

451
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.600
It's the way I'm wired as a human being.

452
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.160
I satisfy our sense of curiosity and there's nothing more curious to me than our

453
00:27:52.161 --> 00:27:52.994
own region.

454
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.190
<v 0>So then that would be like you would love to know like what happens on day 21</v>

455
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.960
<v 12>absolutely. And I like to think that before I die,</v>

456
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.410
we will know what happens on day 21

457
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:31.930
<v 0>this episode was produced by Annie Mcewen with help from Matt Kielty and Brennan</v>

458
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.910
Pharell and Simon Adler. I actually think the entire radio lab staff.

459
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.820
It's something to do with this episode. So thanks guys.

460
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.170
And I want to thank the research library at Georgetown University.

461
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.870
Thank you for listening. See you later.
