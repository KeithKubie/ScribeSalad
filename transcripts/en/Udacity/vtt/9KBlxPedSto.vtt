00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.670
Now let's take a look at the hardware
security support in iOS devices.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.553
Each iOS device has a dedicated AES-256
crypto engine built into the direct

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:16.350
memory access path between the flash
storage and the main system memory.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.188
This makes file encryption
highly efficient.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:24.940
Recall that AES-256 means that
the key length is 256-bit.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.081
The device's unique ID or UID,
and the device group ID or GID,

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:36.483
are AES-256 bit keys fused or compelled
into the application processor,

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:40.380
a secure enclave during manufacturing.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.320
This means that no software or
firmware can read them directly.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.710
They can see only
the results of encryption or

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.910
decryption operations performed
by the dedicated AES engines

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.310
implemented in silicon using the UID or
GID as a key.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.760
This is an important feature because
the keys are stored securely in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.780
the hardware.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.459
The UIDs are unique to each device and
are not recorded by Apple or

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.170
its suppliers.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.030
The GIDs are common to all
processors in a class of devices.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.962
For example, all devices
using the Apple A8 processor.

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:20.900
The GIDs are used for tasks such as
delivering system installation and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.010
updates.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.360
Again, a unique feature of iOS
devices is that the UID and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.460
GID keys are directly
burned in the silicon and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.590
they can be only accessed
by the Crypto Engine.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.230
And the Crypto Engine itself
is part of the hardware.
