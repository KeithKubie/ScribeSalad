00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay. Let's add something new to our URLs,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
called a Query parameter--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
also known as GET parameters--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we'll talk about this name shortly,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when we start talking about http.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here is an example:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We've got our normal URL--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or the type of the simple URL we just discussed--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with a simple Path, /foo,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we've added, to the end of this, ?p=1.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And this adds an extra parameter, whose name is "p" and whose value is "1".

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The format of the Query parameter looks like this:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You've got "Name = value"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or in this case, "p=1".

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the value can be just about anything,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but it's good not to use question marks and other URL characters;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
although you could, if you really wanted.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can make this a little bit more complicated, by adding more Query parameters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's do that--we've added a second Query parameter.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first Query parameter is separated from the URL,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
using a question mark.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All the following parameters are separated from each other,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
using ampersands.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The first one gets a question mark, the next one gets an ampersand.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In this case, the new parameter is "q" and it equals the string, "neat".

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we have these Query parameters--what are they for?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They're for--basically, when you make a request for this Path,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this is extra information the Server gets.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And there's all sorts of things you can do with this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If this is a Web application, doing fancy things,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
these parameters might mean something.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It can affect caching--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because, technically, it changes the entire URL.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So there are all sorts of handy uses,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that we'll discuss later in the class,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for what these Query parameters can do.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But they're separate from the Path--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but they are included in part of the whole URL

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that the Servers use when you make a request.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In the following URL, what is the value of the z parameter?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.113
Here is your URL.
