Mysteries of Vernacular

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:20.910
Tuxedo:

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.376
men's evening wear for semi-formal occasions.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:26.849
Tuxedo, surprisingly, has its roots

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.355
in Native American history.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.729
The Delaware Indians of what is now

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.867
the Northeast United States,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.344
were divided into three subgroups,

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:39.733
distinguished by their animal totems:

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.234
the turkey,

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:42.442
the turtle,

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.738
and the wolf.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:47.412
Members of the tribe belonging to the wolf totem

00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:49.122
were often referred to

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:52.504
by the indigenous word for the four-footed canine,

00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:53.965
p'tuksit.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.803
In the 18th century,

00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:59.751
Europeans who settled in the former region of the P'tuksit

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:02.503
Anglicized the name as "tuxedo"

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:06.968
and slapped it on a town in southeast New York.

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:09.533
Decades later, in the late 1800s,

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.982
a lavish resort was constructed

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.350
and christened "The Tuxedo Club".

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.421
It was at The Tuxedo Club,

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:19.048
around the turn of the century,

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:21.066
when a dress jacket was required

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.066
for almost every occasion,

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.892
that a brash young man,

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:27.739
heir to an enormous tobacco fortune,

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:30.659
caused a stir by flaunting tradition

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.241
and donning a formal dinner jacket

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.176
without tails.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:38.556
His bold fashion statement was quickly popularized

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.109
and nicknamed tuxedo,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.919
which in modern America,

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.582
is the headache of high school prom attendees

00:01:45.582 --> 00:01:47.384
across the nation.
