00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.700
I think the light sensor would be the best answer.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.330
Cause then you would know that it's dark and your

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.870
users asleep. But also the accelerometer and the gyroscope, would

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.620
tell you that your user hasn't moved so their sleeping.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you would think that this is an isolated problem, but

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.100
it's not. In fact it's such a huge issue for users, that there

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.350
exists entire category application. Agent being one of them. Which actually is a

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.430
stand alone app, which silences your

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.740
phone. So that other applications won't disturb

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.670
you in the middle of the night, with information you don't really want.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.160
&gt;&gt; Apps like Trigger take into account

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.049
these triggers like light and accelerometer. And

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.610
they know that if you're sleeping or

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.050
you're not moving, they'll silence your whole phone.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.590
But if you're building an application that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.720
provides sports updates. You should take advantage of

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.990
these sensors within the application, and deliver

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.860
the notification when you know the user's awake.
