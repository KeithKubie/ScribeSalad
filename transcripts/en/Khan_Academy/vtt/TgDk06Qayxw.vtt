00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:02.050
In the last video,
we learned that if we

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.035
have two different
triangles and if all

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:08.060
of the corresponding
sides of the two triangles

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.770
have the same length,
then by side-side-side,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.640
we know that the two
triangles are congruent.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.580
And I also touched a
little bit on the idea

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.030
of an axiom or postulate.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.230
But I want to be clear.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.070
Sometimes you will
hear this referred

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.880
to as a side-side-side
theorem, and sometimes you'll

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.900
hear it as a side-side-side
postulate or axiom.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.090
And I think it's
worth differentiating

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700
what these mean.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.200
A postulate or an
axiom is something

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.430
that you just assume, you
assume from the get-go,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
while a theorem is something
you prove using more basic

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
or using some
postulates or axioms.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.660
Really in all of mathematics,
you make some core assumptions.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.010
You call these the
axioms or the postulates.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.900
And then using those, you
try to prove theorems.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.030
So maybe using that one, I can
prove some theorem over here.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.610
And maybe using that
theorem, and then this axiom,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.880
I can prove another
theorem over here.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.900
And then using both
of those theorems,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.640
I can prove another
theorem over here.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.806
I think you get the picture.

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:19.470
This axiom might lead
us to this theorem.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.290
These two might lead us to
this theorem right over here.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.110
And we essentially try
to build our knowledge

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.110
or we build a mathematics
around these core assumptions.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.270
In an introductory
geometry class,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.967
we don't rigorously prove
the side-side-side theorem.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.800
And that's why in a lot
of geometry classes,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.520
you kind of just
take it as a given,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.136
as a postulate or an axiom.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:45.760
And the whole reason
why I'm doing this

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.134
is one, just so you know the
difference between the words

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:50.490
theorem and postulate or axiom.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.209
And also so that you
don't get confused.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.000
It is just a given,
but in a lot of books--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.416
and I've looked
at several books--

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.629
they do refer to it as the
side-side-side theorem,

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.420
even though they never
prove it rigorously.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.600
They do just assume it.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.690
So it really is more of
a postulate or an axiom.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.494
Now with that out
of the way, we're

00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:06.910
just going to
assume going forward

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.410
that we just know
that this is true.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.820
We're going to
take it as a given.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.403
I want to show you
that we can already

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:13.507
do something pretty
useful with it.

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:14.965
So let's say that
we have a circle.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.710
And there's many useful things
that we can already do with it.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.720
And this circle has a
center, right here at A.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.870
And let's say that we have
a chord in the circle that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.440
is not a diameter.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.780
So let me draw a chord here.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.150
So let me draw a
chord in this circle.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.350
So it's kind of a
segment of a secant line.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.690
And let's say that
I have a line that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.473
bisects this chord
from the center.

00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:49.223
And I guess I call it
a radius because I'm

00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:53.600
going to go from the center
to the edge of the circle

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.570
right over there.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.830
So I'm going to the center
to the circle itself.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.760
And when I say bisects
it-- so these are all--

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.870
I'm just setting up
the problem right now.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.490
When I say bisecting
it, it means

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.830
it splits that line
segment in half.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.560
So what it tells is, is that
the length of this segment

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.400
right over here is going to
be equivalent to the length

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.170
of this segment
right over there.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.795
I've set it up.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.910
I have a circle.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.380
This radius bisects this
chord right over here.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.720
And the goal here
is to prove that it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.909
bisects this chord
at a right angle.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.200
Or another way to say it--
let me add some points here.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.890
Let's call this B.
Let's call this C,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.940
And let's call this
D. I want to prove

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.290
that segment AB
is perpendicular.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.030
It intersects it
at a right angle.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.170
It is perpendicular
to segment CD.

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:52.140
And as you could
imagine, I'm going

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.790
to prove it pretty much using
the side-side-side whatever you

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.220
want to call it, side-side-side
theorem, postulate, or axiom.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.001
So let's do it.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.250
Let's think about it this way.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.610
So you can imagine if
I'm going to use this,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.859
I need to have some triangles.

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.630
There's no triangles
here right now.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.130
But I can construct triangles,
and I can construct triangles

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.640
based on things I know.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.105
For example, I can construct--
this has some radius.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.074
That's a radius right over here.

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.739
The length of that is just going
to be the radius of the circle.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.390
But I can also do
it right over here.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.520
The length of AC is also going
to be the radius of the circle.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.450
So we know that these two lines
have the same length, which

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.070
is the radius of the circle.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.500
Or we could say that
AD is congruent to AC,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.990
or they have the
exact same lengths.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.380
We know from the
set-up in the problem

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.310
that this segment
is equal in length

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.310
to this segment over here.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.500
Let me add a point here
so I can refer to it.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.310
So if I call that
point E, we know

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.210
from the set-up in the problem,
that CE is congruent to ED,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.620
or they have the same lengths.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.260
CE has the same length as ED.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.700
And we also know that both of
these triangles, the one here

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.900
on the left and the one here
on the right, they both share

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.410
the side EA.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.540
So EA is clearly equal to EA.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.990
So this is clearly
equal to itself.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.790
It's the same side.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.820
The same side is being
used for both triangles.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.240
The triangles are
adjacent to each other.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.250
And so we see a situation where
we have two different triangles

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.220
that have corresponding
sides being equal.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.230
This side is equivalent to
this side right over here.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.760
This side is equal in length
to that side over there.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.364
And then, obviously, AE
is equivalent to itself.

00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:38.530
It's a side on both of them.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.820
It's the corresponding side
on both of these triangles.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:06:05.440
And so by side-side-side, AEC.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.140
Let me write it over here.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:17.304
By side-side-side, we
know that triangle AEC

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:19.940
is congruent to triangle AED.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.500
But how does that help us?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.490
How does that help
us knowing that we

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.110
used our little theorem?

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.860
But how does that
actually help us here?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.430
Well, what's cool is once we
know that two triangles are

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:41.050
congruent-- so because they
are congruent, from that,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.470
we can deduce that all
the angles are the same.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.950
And in particular,
we can deduce that

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:53.270
this angle right over here,
that the measure of angle CEA

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.806
is equivalent to the
measure of angle DEA.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.900
And the reason why that's
useful is that we also

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.680
see, just by looking
at this, that they're

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.905
supplementary to each other.

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:07.920
They're adjacent angles.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.830
Their outer sides
form a straight angle.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.830
So CEA is supplementary
and equivalent to DEA.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.790
So, they're are
also supplementary.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.480
So we also have the
measure of angle CEA

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.030
plus the measure of angle
DEA is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.730
But they're equivalent
to each other.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.090
So I could replace the measure
of DEA with the measure of CEA.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.830
Or I could rewrite this as 2
times the measure of angle CEA

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.110
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.130
Or I could divide
both sides by 2.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.870
And I say the
measure of angle CEA

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.180
is equal to 90
degrees, which is going

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.710
to be the same as the
measure of angle DEA

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.820
because they're equivalent.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.495
So we know that this angle
right over here is 90 degrees.

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:01.600
So I can do it with
that little box.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.540
And this angle right
over here is 90 degrees.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.290
And because AB intersects
where it intersects CD,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.290
we have a 90 degree
angle here and there.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.900
And we could also prove
this over there as well.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.090
They are perpendicular
to each other.
