LOGAN URY: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.260
My name is Logan Ury.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.630
I am based in the
Mountain View office,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870
and I'm very excited
to be here in New

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.580
York for this special edition
of our Modern Romance series.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.480
So this is a series I started
in Mountain View last year,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.100
and this is our fifth event.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.730
And we're so lucky to have
Esther Perel and Dan Savage

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.990
here with us.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.050
They are excellent
experts on modern romance.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.619
So you probably know a
little bit about them,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.720
but I'll give you some more
information about our guests.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.420
Esther is a practicing
psychotherapist,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.670
and she's also a
celebrated speaker.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.540
She's widely celebrated
as one of the most

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.700
insightful and
provocative voices

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.940
on personal and
professional relationships

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.910
and the complex science
behind human interaction.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670
She's also the
bestselling author

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
of "Mating in Captivity
Unlocking Erotic Intelligence."

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.160
She's a Belgian native, and
she's fluent in nine languages.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.920
Her Ted Talks have also been
viewed over 10 million times.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.294
Welcome, Esther.

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:08.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.660
And of course, we also
have Dan Savage with us.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.490
Dan is a writer,
a TV personality,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.890
and an activist best known
for his political and social

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.400
commentary, as well as his
honest approach to sex, love,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.970
and relationships.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.850
He's the author of the
widely syndicated sex advice

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.010
column "Savage Love," and the
host of one of my favorite

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.650
podcasts, "The
Savage Love Cast."

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.700
He's also written several
best-selling books,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.060
including "American Savage."

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.100
Along with his
husband, Terry Miller,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.080
he's the co-founder
of the It Gets Better

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.753
project, and their son, DJ.

00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:45.645
DAN SAVAGE: A co-founder of DJ.

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:47.537
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:49.542
I thought you would like that.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.411
Welcome, Dan.

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:56.790
So we're going to
chat for a while,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.165
and then we'll leave 20 minutes
at the end for questions.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.930
And we're also selling books,
so don't miss out on that.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.055
So I want to start off with
talking about infidelity.

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:07.430
You've both written
extensively--

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.790
DAN SAVAGE: You didn't see
that one coming, did you?

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.710
ESTHER PEREL: No.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.550
LOGAN URY: Who
would have guessed?

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.990
I just want you all to know
what you're in for today.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.620
So you've both written
extensively on this topic,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.570
and because there is
no universally agreed

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.400
upon definition of
infidelity, researchers

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.460
estimate that anywhere
between 26% to 75% of people

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.260
cheat during relationships.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.190
Let's start by talking about
why you think people cheat,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.730
and what you think
couples should do

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.401
when there's been a betrayal.

00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:35.900
Feel free to jump
in, either of you.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.450
ESTHER PEREL: You first.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.324
DAN SAVAGE: Me first?

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.180
ESTHER PEREL: Yes.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.574
DAN SAVAGE: People cheat
because it's a trap.

00:02:42.574 --> 00:02:44.990
People cheat because we've
expanded the definition of what

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.615
is cheating to such
a ridiculous extent

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:48.580
that everyone's
essentially a cheater.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.929
People cheat because monogamous
commitments are a fucking trap.

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:57.470
I don't know.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.719
I'm not to be very articulate.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.602
This is literally the first
time I've spoken aloud today.

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:03.050
LOGAN URY: [LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.290
DAN SAVAGE: People cheat
because they're bored.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.840
People cheat because
they're unsatisfied.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.690
People cheat because
there's an opportunity.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.430
People cheat, as Esther points
in "Mating in Captivity,"

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.480
to feel alive.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.180
People cheat for all sorts
of reasons, not all of them--

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.430
and I usually, when I
start talking about this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.304
these days, because I'm
such a fan of Esther,

00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:20.410
start citing Esther
extensively--

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.050
so you're going to have to
sit here while I do this.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.950
People cheat because--
it's not always

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.099
because they're not in
love with their partner,

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.140
that you can cheat on
someone and still very much

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.014
be in love with them.

00:03:31.014 --> 00:03:34.650
There are other reasons
why people cheat.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.170
It seems to me,
and the conclusion

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.060
that I've reached after 25
years of writing "Savage Love"

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.770
and being buried under
emails-- that it's not

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.240
that we are failing monogamy.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.380
It's that monogamy has failed
us, and we need to rethink it.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.280
That doesn't mean
that I'm opposed

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.090
to all monogamous
commitments, or I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.110
think everyone who makes
a monogamous commitment

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.980
or wants a monogamous
commitment is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.660
a fool or fooling themselves.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.730
But the way we talk
about monogamy sets

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.330
up all monogamous
relationships for failure

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.380
because what we tell people
is that sexual exclusivity is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.420
the most important marker
of love and commitment,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.640
and a failure at that means
the relationship entirely

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.550
is a failure.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.540
And we tell people that
if you are in love,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.450
you will not want to
fuck other people,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.092
when we all know in our
guts, and in our junk,

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:23.050
that you can be in love,
and you're still going

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.460
to want to fuck other people.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.170
And the people that that
lie damages the most

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.830
are the people who
really believe it

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.940
because they are in love.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.356
They make a
monogamous commitment.

00:04:31.356 --> 00:04:33.190
Suddenly, someone comes
across their radar,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.794
or walks in front
of them in the gym,

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:36.460
or they have a crush
on someone at work.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.700
They suddenly want to
fuck somebody else.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.158
And if they believe
because they've

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:43.985
been told that love and desire
is a zero-sum game, where

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:45.360
if you want to
fuck somebody else

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.040
you must not be in love
with your partner anymore,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.410
they will then act on that.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.190
That undermines a
monogamous commitment.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.187
It destroys relationships.

00:04:53.187 --> 00:04:55.020
And finally, the last
thing I'm going to say

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.064
is we have to stop telling
people that monogamy

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.230
is the only thing that you
have to execute perfectly

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.900
100% of the time to be
regarded as good at it,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.100
that you can fall off a bicycle
and still win the goddamn Tour

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.536
de France.

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:11.160
And you can fall
snowboarding and still

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.690
be an excellent snowboarder.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.231
We need to tell
people that if you're

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.480
with somebody for-- really, now,
because of expanding lifespans,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.890
50, 60 years, if you
make a commitment

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.700
in your early and mid-20s,
or late 20s or 30s--

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.450
if you're with somebody
for 50 or 60 years

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.690
and they only cheated on
you a handful of times,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.050
and you only cheated on
them a handful of times,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.990
you were both pretty good
at monogamy, not bad at it.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.410
That's my thing, which
is 30% your thing now.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.510
I keep reading you.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.009
LOGAN URY: Did he get it right?

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:44.800
ESTHER PEREL: Lots.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.570
Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.340
But it's very
interesting because I

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.760
think that one thing we
have to be careful about

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.610
is that in some way, the
conversation about infidelity

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.790
is not the same as the
conversation about monogamy

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.830
because infidelity occurs in
consensual, non-monogamous

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.220
couples too.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.440
So the first thing I would
say is look what word

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.540
we're using, "cheating."

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.070
And when it's not cheating, it's
betraying, and violating trust,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.830
and being unfaithful,
and being adulterous.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.260
There is no morally
neutral language

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.620
to talk about
this, first of all.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.460
So we are trapped in the
words themselves that we use.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.980
Most of history, monogamy
was one person for life.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.250
And at this moment, monogamy
is one person at a time.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.850
And so many of us
go around saying

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.290
"I am monogamous in
all my relationships,"

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.870
and that seems totally natural.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.150
For most of history,
faithfulness, fidelity,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.990
had nothing to do with love.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.580
It basically was an
imposition on women

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.540
by men in order to
know who gets the cows

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.500
and whose children are mine.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.720
And it was about
patrimony and lineage,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.460
and it was only a
double standard.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.890
It was apply to women,
and rarely to men,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.190
actually, even if in
the text it's written.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.760
But when I think
about infidelity,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.551
the first thing I often
think is, you know,

00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:07.340
it's the only commandment that
is repeated twice in the Bible,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.930
once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.330
So somebody understood that
the human inclination is not

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.160
necessarily so singular
and monogamous.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.290
But why we go outside--
I would say like this.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.170
But I am a therapist,
and in that sense,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.120
I still very much work with
couples all over the world,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.100
and there are a few things
that are very clear to me--

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.615
is that the vast majority of
people who cheat in my practice

00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:37.140
are actually not your
chronic philanderers.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.620
They are not the ones that
are continuously cheating.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.730
They are often people who have
been faithful for decades.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.879
And then one day, they cross
a line, a line which often,

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.420
indeed, they never
thought they would

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.480
cross because they are often
monogamous in their values

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.670
but plural in their behavior.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.070
And they experience a
conflict between their values

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.500
and their behavior.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.760
And these people
are sometimes going

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.320
to risk everything
they've built for years.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.150
And then, you say, for what?

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.650
And then, the word
you picked up,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.770
which when I wrote
it in "Mating"

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.210
it was quite a few years ago.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.390
Now I've gone around the
globe with this, this one word

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.710
that people will tell me
when they have an affair.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.840
I'm not talking just
about fucking and sex.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.240
I'm talking about something
actually probably a little

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.070
more involved, and
sometimes a love story.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.590
It's that they feel alive.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.810
And that word, "alive,"
actually goes beyond just sex.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.179
It's about trespassing one's
own limitations, the boundaries

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.220
of the life that one has
lived, the constraints

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.190
of the marriage that
one is in, the mortality

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.669
that is hitting at the door.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.770
The essence of infidelity
is transgression.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.510
It's actually about
breaking rules,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.710
including one's own rules,
internal and external.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.390
And that transgressive
power actually

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.020
makes people feel alive,
free, bold, autonomous.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.360
When you have an
affair, when you cheat,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.620
as in when you do something
that is just for you, then

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.710
you know that you
are not taking care

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.130
of anybody else, not
being good citizen,

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.880
not being so responsible.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.470
And we've always had two sides
to us, the sides of us that

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.870
wants to be good, and
compliant, and obedient,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.030
and proper, and the side of us
who thrives on breaking rules.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.980
Just watch kids play.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.380
LOGAN URY: So
that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.760
DAN SAVAGE: I would add one
thing to all of that, is that

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.060
monogamy was for millennia
imposed on women.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.730
There were huge
double standards.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.800
And about 100
years ago, we began

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.000
to make marriage fairer
and more egalitarian.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.250
ESTHER PEREL: But instead
of giving women more rights,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.791
we took the rights
away from the men.

00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.480
DAN SAVAGE: Instead of extending
to women the same license

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.490
that men had always
enjoyed and abused,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.682
we imposed on men the
limitations that we had always

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:50.390
imposed on women.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.830
And it's been a disaster
because men are as bad at it

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.230
as women are.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.370
ESTHER PEREL: Or reverse.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.720
Women are as roaming as men.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.342
Give the woman a car, and then
we look at her true nature.

00:10:03.342 --> 00:10:05.050
DAN SAVAGE: There's
all this talk about--

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.280
ESTHER PEREL: Just let
her leave the house.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.655
DAN SAVAGE: There's all this
talk about sex-- about women

00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:12.805
with low desire, and this
is being medicalized,

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:14.930
and there are pills coming
out to treat low desire,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.260
and there's all these therapists
and sex researchers working

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.530
on the problem of low desire.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.130
And one thing that
keeps coming up

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.535
is that they'll work
with this person,

00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.326
and the low desire--
no sex in the marriage

00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:25.490
is destroying the marriage.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.031
And the woman-- it's
often the woman,

00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:30.830
but not always-- has no desire,
no desire, can't get it back.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.650
The marriage is in peril-- is
working so hard to get it back.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.560
Nothing works.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.410
There's a divorce.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.230
Suddenly, she's fucking
horny again because she

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.700
has this opportunity
now to be free again,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.200
and she didn't have
that opportunity

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.860
to be free in her marriage.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.080
And we have to find
a way to give people

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.470
freedom in their marriages
and that autonomy

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.350
within their marriages so
that that desire for freedom

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.360
or autonomy is not eating
away at and corroding

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.394
their marriages.

00:10:58.394 --> 00:10:59.810
ESTHER PEREL: May
I add something?

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.960
LOGAN URY: Yes.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.543
ESTHER PEREL:
[CLEARING THROAT] Sorry.

00:11:02.543 --> 00:11:04.490
I think I am totally--
the problem is

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.220
we don't disagree that much.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.420
But if you listen carefully,
there are places--

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.080
DAN SAVAGE: We're in
violent agreement over here.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.050
ESTHER PEREL: No, it's not
just actually if she divorces.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.890
I think that there are
two things I would--

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.330
the first one is something
that you said earlier,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.410
which I do want to emphasize.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.430
The romantic ideal that we
are very much participants

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.630
at-- that is about
150 years-- is

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.880
that I'm going to be the
chosen one and I am it,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.910
and I'm irreplaceable,
and I'm indispensable.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.740
And I'm the one, and
when I'm the one,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.880
it means that you
don't think, or want,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.460
or look at anyone else again.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.570
Hence, if you have
everything you need with me,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.730
there's no need to
go looking elsewhere.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.930
Hence, if you go
looking elsewhere,

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.440
it means that there is either
something wrong with me,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.460
wrong with you,
or wrong with us.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.370
And this is the current
model of infidelity,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.530
is that it's a deficiency model.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.280
It only happens because
there's something missing,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.020
and it's general-- But I always
say that you can't-- millions

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.030
of people can't all be
pathological, after all.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.200
So turn it into a
disease or a disorder

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.320
when it is a phenomenon.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.720
And that, combined with this
secret truth that is only

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.990
beginning to come
out, which is that

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.630
in committed relationships,
actually, women

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.920
get bored with monogamy
much sooner than men.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.400
Males' desire goes
down very gradually.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.740
Women's desire often plummets.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.670
And it's not the
fault of the partner,

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.270
and it's not the
fault of marriage.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.050
It's that the
institutionalization

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.030
of the relationship, the
familiarity with the partner,

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.930
and particularly, the
desexualization of the roles.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.100
There is not much sexy
to wife and to mother.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.450
And so whenever she has an
opportunity to change the plot,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.770
her hormones change too.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.700
And it's that
piece that actually

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.520
has been mistranslated.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.870
It's been decided that
because she loses interest,

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.010
her sex drive is less strong.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.360
First of all, we can question
the concept of drive.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.850
But it's not that her
drive is less strong.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.390
It's that in order
to want sex, it

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.300
needs to be six that
is worth wanting,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.580
and it's just not interesting
enough in her role--

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.066
not with the partner,
but in her role.

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:29.732
DAN SAVAGE: Can I add
something to that?

00:13:29.732 --> 00:13:30.690
LOGAN URY: Yes!

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.680
Let's chat.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.040
ESTHER PEREL: We
going to-- Logan!

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.873
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:34.694 --> 00:13:36.110
DAN SAVAGE: That
idea that someone

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.050
has to be all things-- you
used the phrase "the one,"

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.390
and that's a phrase
that drives me crazy.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.848
And I'm always yelling at people
but there is no "the one."

00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.380
And you know that's
a lie about you.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.730
Why aren't I all things to you?

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.688
Because you're looking
at someone that you know

00:13:47.688 --> 00:13:49.732
isn't all things to
you and can't be.

00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:51.190
And the best any
of us can hope for

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.440
is a 0.64 that we round
the fuck up to the one.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.510
And that's an act of
will, and an act of love,

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.741
and regard, and care for
someone to treat them

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.740
as if they are this thing
that does not actually

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.680
exist in the world, which
is your perfect match,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.400
or someone who can
be all things to you

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.420
or that you can
be all things to.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.040
And if we can walk away from
these myths and these lies,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.942
it doesn't destabilize
our relationships.

00:14:13.942 --> 00:14:15.400
It doesn't make
them less valuable.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.320
It actually makes them stronger.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.670
It's really hard to look
at somebody every day

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.922
and live a lie.

00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:22.630
It's easier to look
at somebody every day

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.440
and say you aren't the one.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.830
There is no one, but I treat
you like one and the one.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.190
And in my treating you
that way and you treating

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.940
me that way in return, we
are being so good, and kind,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.330
and loving to each other,
and there's value to that,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.992
and a greater value to that than
there is some one out there.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:43.450
And so if people just knew--
of course he looked elsewhere,

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.310
or she looked elsewhere, or
they want to fuck other people,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.684
or you want to
fuck other people.

00:14:46.684 --> 00:14:49.300
Or sometimes you go to friends
for emotional fulfillment

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.590
that you can't get from
your partner, and that's OK.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.141
Two people can't be all
things to each other.

00:14:55.141 --> 00:14:57.057
ESTHER PEREL: We should
let Logan [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:57.057 --> 00:14:57.848
DAN SAVAGE: I know.

00:14:57.848 --> 00:14:58.348
Sorry.

00:14:58.348 --> 00:14:59.723
LOGAN URY: I'm
enjoying it, yeah.

00:14:59.723 --> 00:15:01.820
So I think that you're
both in violent agreement

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.180
that monogamy maybe
isn't the right answer,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.636
and I know, Dan, you are--
OK, I'll let you answer that.

00:15:07.636 --> 00:15:09.260
But I think you're
famous for your idea

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.000
of monogamish relationships,
which you can discuss.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.670
But if you could redesign
marriage from scratch

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.940
with any different
kind of contracts--

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.850
maybe you rethink it
every five years--

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.210
how would you redesign marriage?

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.450
DAN SAVAGE: You go
first this time.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.500
ESTHER PEREL: Well,
redesigning marriage

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.570
depends first and
foremost on power.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.630
After all, marriage
is an institution

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:41.270
that stabilizes power,
basically, and obligations--

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.090
little freedoms, but
mostly-- so I would not

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.550
have the same answer when I am
asked this question in North

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.970
America, and if I'm asked
this question in Turkey.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.240
So this is a very
global question

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.370
with a localized answer, OK?

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.745
In our context, I don't know
that we actually need marriage.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.450
Marriage used to be an
economic enterprise.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.580
And by the way, infidelity
was an economic threat.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.720
Now marriage or
committed relationships

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.370
are a romantic arrangement,
and so infidelity

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.280
is a romantic threat.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.840
That's really what shifted.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.250
So in this romantic
arrangement, we

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.050
have replaced-- it's like
in the larger economy.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.200
It used to be marriage was a
part of the production economy,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.550
and you made children, and you
created assets and all of that.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.690
Now marriage is part
of the service economy.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.565
Like the general economy,
the service economy

00:16:35.565 --> 00:16:38.590
is intimacy, trust,
affection, sex.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.360
That's service in the best
sense of the word, right?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.300
Hence, trust has become
so central as well.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.840
I don't know that
we need marriage.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.350
I think that--
but of course, you

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.660
need a state that then
takes care of things.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.490
That's where the Europeans marry
way less than the Americans.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.680
Americans love to
marry, by the way.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.950
They love to marry, and they
can marry multiple times.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.533
And you can sit in
an audience and say

00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:03.000
you're divorced three times,
and nobody blinks an eye.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.950
But if I was to ask
you here, "Has anybody

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.010
here been unfaithful or been
cheated on?" not many of you

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.550
would answer publicly because
the stigma has shifted.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.200
It used to be divorce.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.500
Now it's infidelity.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.200
So I would redesign marriage.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.839
First of all, there
needs to be equal power.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.099
There needs to be a system in
which maternity leave is not

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.720
a disability leave.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.550
There needs to be a system where
there is affordable child care

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.160
and where there is family
leave that is for both people.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.167
Then we can start to
talk about relationships

00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:36.000
that are not going to
crumble under pressure

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.150
or where the supposed equality
suddenly topples completely

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.750
the moment you have
children, which

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.680
is, after all, the primary
thing for marriage.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.450
It needs to be a system
that is fluid and flexible,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.400
like any other organism.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.570
It doesn't survive if
it doesn't straddle

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.730
well stability and change,
homeostasis and novelty.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.550
But if it does too much
novelty and it's too unstable,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.760
it will be chaotic.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.620
And if it is too much stable
and too much not changing,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.110
it will be fossilized.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.610
There is very little
fluidity in marriage.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.270
Most people are creative,
and imaginative,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.600
and pursuing, and active, and
all of that before they marry.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.540
And then once they're
married, many,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.560
many times they will
settle into a state

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.560
of complacency, in which
you do the least amount.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.560
People treat their
friends much better.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.810
They behave much better at work.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.090
They dress up much nicer
when they go out with others.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.130
Literally, the
partner is often--

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.530
the home is often
the place where

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.980
many people bring
leftovers, actually,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.500
not the best of themselves.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.260
So it needs to be reevaluated
every few years, this idea

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.410
that we live twice as long
but we're going to stay

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.820
with something's that undoable.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.600
And most people
these days are going

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.074
to marry two or three times in
the West anyway, and some of us

00:18:51.074 --> 00:18:52.740
are going to do it
with the same person.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.260
DAN SAVAGE: I would say that
marriage has been redefined,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.520
and it would be
wonderful if everyone

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.134
was up to speed on how
thoroughly it's been redefined.

00:19:04.134 --> 00:19:06.300
During the marriage equality
debate in this country,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.329
we, the homos, were
accused of wanting

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.620
to radically redefine marriage.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.190
And the truth was that
straight people had already

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.010
radically redefined
marriage to an extent

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.630
that no logical,
secular case could

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.640
be made for excluding same-sex
couples from the institution

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.030
as straight people redefined
it, lived it, and practiced it.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.490
It is now, after millennia
of being something

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.740
very different-- in the
West, in this country--

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.610
the legal union of two
autonomous and equal

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.160
individuals.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.660
Period.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.450
The end.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.060
And the marriage is
only as patriarchal

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.260
as those two people in
it choose to make it.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.599
A marriage can be
monogamous or not.

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:42.390
It can be for life or
not, children or not.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.098
It can have a religious
component or not.

00:19:44.098 --> 00:19:46.780
It's up to that couple.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.000
Every marriage is
its own universe,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.460
and gay people--
same-sex couples,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.140
not all gay-- said
we want that too.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.900
And it's no longer a
gendered institution.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.300
There don't have to be children.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.000
Children aren't required.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Otherwise, Pat
Buchanan's not really

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.670
married to his [INAUDIBLE] wife.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.310
And if I were going
to change anything

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.896
about the definition
of marriage,

00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:12.770
it's not so much of a
change that definition.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.880
I'm very comfortable with
that definition of marriage.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.070
I would change
people's expectations

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.350
around what marriage
means over the long haul.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:28.510
As someone who is-- as a
gay dude-- has been open

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.984
about the fact that my husband
and I are not monogamous, much

00:20:31.984 --> 00:20:33.900
to the consternation of
some gay rights groups

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.170
that were fighting for marriage
equality and gay parenting

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.450
organizations, because
we're also parents,

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.229
I'm often really
offended by what

00:20:42.229 --> 00:20:44.520
you talk about, people who've
been married two or three

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.030
times, people who are monogamous
in all of their relationships--

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.770
those people will
look at me and say I

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.370
am not seriously in love with
or committed to my partner

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.940
because we are not monogamous.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.180
And then, the next
thing out of their mouth

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.790
is, "I've been monogamous
in every relationship

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.540
I've ever been in.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.270
All of my marriages, plural,
have been monogamous.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.660
That's how committed I
am, not to my partner,

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.780
but to monogamy."

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.810
And I find that idiotic.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.500
And if there's anything I
would like to redefine or get

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.042
into people's heads
is that marriage,

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.416
particularly if it's for the
long haul and the long term,

00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:20.310
it's going to evolve.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.260
There are going to be stages.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.360
It's going to change.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.190
What's very, very
important a year in

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.690
may not be so
important 20 years in.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.530
You can reassess.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.830
You can reevaluate.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.990
That idea of having to opt back
in after a few years-- that

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.580
shouldn't just be opt
back in for that partner,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.550
but opt back in for everything
that you guys talked

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.057
about being important to your
marriage or definitional,

00:21:41.057 --> 00:21:42.640
or what you wanted
from your marriage.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.430
That stuff changes over time,
and we have to roll with,

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.470
if indeed we're going to be
more committed to commitment

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.550
than we are to never touching
anyone else with our genitals

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.830
ever again, which to me seems
like a ridiculous and very

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.550
limiting definition of
marriage or commitment.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.820
But for many people,
that's it, that loyalty

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.150
is something we only
show with our genitals.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.020
Any other form of loyalty, any
other way of expressing it,

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.640
has less value than
have you touched

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.030
anyone else with your dick
ever again if you're a guy.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.070
And I find that
I'm often accused

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.040
of putting too much
importance on sex,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.540
too much emphasis on sex.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.650
I think that puts too
much emphasis on sex, when

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.360
you say that's the most
important way of expressing

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.360
love, commitment, loyalty
is with your genitalia.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.350
So if I was going to redefine
it, I would yank that out.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.310
But it's not in the definition.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.020
That's just an attitude
that people have.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.530
LOGAN URY: Definitely.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.030
ESTHER PEREL: One
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.030
that took place is that you used
to marry 'til death do us part,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.480
and now you marry
'til love dies.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.460
That is a fundamental shift, and
divorce laws have fundamentally

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.250
changed as well.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.180
You need to be able
to leave in order

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.950
to be able to choose to
stay, and that is not always

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.920
the case.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.140
I think that on many levels,
there are certain freedoms

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.520
that you-- like the
redefinition of monogamy

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.090
as a primary emotional
commitment that may or may not

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.560
be including sexual
exclusiveness

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.280
is one of the most
important things

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.960
that straight couples can
learn from gay couples

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.710
because in the straight
discourse, that is always

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.890
considered impossible.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.890
And it's not impossible
intrinsically.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.640
It's not biologically
impossible.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.220
It's culturally become
impossible over millennia,

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.599
and there is tremendous
freedom that can come from--

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:35.140
DAN SAVAGE: Well,
if there's anything

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.745
that straight couples can
borrow from gay couples--

00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:39.650
ESTHER PEREL: Lots.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.080
DAN SAVAGE: --it's that
monogamy for gay male couples

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.590
has always been an
opt-in conversation.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.304
And so you don't get gay
couples realizing 5 or 10 years

00:23:48.304 --> 00:23:49.720
into the relationship
that they're

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.900
on very different
pages about this.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.730
But for straight
couples, because monogamy

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.460
is this default setting
and it's assumed,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.157
you get people who've two years
in, five years in, realize

00:23:59.157 --> 00:24:01.240
that they've either made
a commitment that they're

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.970
incapable of honoring because
they just were dragged along

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.620
by the cultural
undertow, or they've

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.300
committed to someone who
was incapable of honoring

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.461
that commitment because
they couldn't have

00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:13.960
a conversation about whether
that was a commitment that they

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.876
wanted to make, or that
monogamy was something

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:17.070
that they were going to do.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.060
And in almost all gay
male relationships

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.260
that I've been witness to, and
all the studies bear this out,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.570
monogamy is not important enough
to destroy a relationship over

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.450
and everything else
in that relationship.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.420
ESTHER PEREL: Sexual
exclusiveness.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.480
DAN SAVAGE: Sexual exclusivity.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.550
LOGAN URY: Do you think that
the legalization of gay marriage

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.520
is going to change that?

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.145
DAN SAVAGE: No.

00:24:36.145 --> 00:24:37.080
LOGAN URY: OK.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.242
Do you want to talk
more about that?

00:24:40.242 --> 00:24:41.700
DAN SAVAGE: I get
asked that a lot.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.158
Now that we can
get married, are we

00:24:43.158 --> 00:24:45.395
gonna all march off into
the suburbs and die?

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.760
And I don't think you
see that borne out.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.120
I haven't witnessed it
in the last six months

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.790
since [INAUDIBLE], but
we'll see in 10 years.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.670
I don't think that gay people
being open about who we are

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.040
and being accepted is
changing gay people.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.540
I think our acceptance
and the truth

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.539
we're telling about our
lives and our experience

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:09.080
are changing straight people.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.650
You do see a lot already
in straight culture that

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.350
has basically been
ripped off, borrowed,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.270
renamed from gay culture.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:15.880
We had tricks.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.927
You guys hook up.

00:25:16.927 --> 00:25:17.760
We had fuck buddies.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.790
You have friends with benefits.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.956
It's always so much more
polite went straight people

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:22.090
try [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.830
The way that most
straight people live now

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.250
into their late 20s, early
30s, is the gay lifestyle

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.760
as sort of condemned
and sex-panicked

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.330
about by social conservatives
30 years ago-- moving

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.410
to urban areas, having
many multiple sex partners,

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.750
having many relationships, not
settling down, not becoming

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.620
an economic unit
and cranking out

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.080
the next wave of
human consumers.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.172
That delaying of
marriage and parenthood,

00:25:50.172 --> 00:25:51.880
as people are doing
who are straight now,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.200
is-- basically what you
see is straight people

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.658
all over the country living
the gay lifestyle until they're

00:25:55.658 --> 00:25:58.957
about 33 and then going off
and living the "straight life."

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:00.790
So what we know now is
there was nothing gay

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.080
about the gay lifestyle,
nothing straight

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.288
about the straight lifestyle.

00:26:03.288 --> 00:26:06.060
It was just which boxes
people were herded into.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.990
ESTHER PEREL: But you
know, family life has

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.070
changed enormously, and
the configuration of family

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.230
from single-parent family,
blended family, the gay family,

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.270
commuter family.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.260
We have really
developed a multiplicity

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.360
of models for
family, but we remain

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.210
very monolithic for couple.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.940
I actually wouldn't
say marriage, per se.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.410
I would even say couple.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.630
And even though marriage
as an institution

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.990
has always been in
transition, but coupledom--

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.990
once romanticism enters we
became really doggedly devoted

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.220
to it.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.310
It is one of the most tenacious,
mystifying stories that

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.894
has sat over Western culture.

00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:49.310
DAN SAVAGE: Stephanie Kuntz's
book, "Marriage-- A History,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.070
the Triumph of Love over
Marriage" is a great read,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.410
and it's sometimes
shocking for me

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.110
to learn that social
conservatives oppose vigorously

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.420
marrying for love, that
that was undermining

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.379
what marriage was actually
about 250, 300 years ago.

00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:06.420
You married for property.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.378
You married for status.

00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:09.170
You married for
legitimate offspring.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.680
You didn't marry for anything
as fleeting as lust, or desire,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.470
or sexual passion, or even love.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.260
You had a spouse that
was recognized in law,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.649
and you had loves.

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:20.190
ESTHER PEREL:
Actually, what she says

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.720
is that adultery was
the space for love.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.320
Marriage was too
mercantile an institution

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.590
to go seek love in it, and so
you went outside to find love.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.840
But now that we've brought
love into marriage,

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.180
adultery destroys it.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.497
That's a major shift.

00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:37.580
LOGAN URY: That was great.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.350
Thank you.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.074
I want to shift
gears a little bit.

00:27:40.074 --> 00:27:41.490
Dan, one of the
topics that you're

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.800
very passionate about
is sex ed, and how

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.490
you find abstinence-only
education very dangerous.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.420
So if you could design a
class, either in high schools

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.370
or online, that every person
would be required to take

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.222
before entering into
adult relationships--

00:27:55.222 --> 00:27:57.180
ESTHER PEREL: Can we
start at age four, please?

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.805
LOGAN URY: Yes.

00:27:57.805 --> 00:27:59.579
At age four, preschool, what--

00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:01.120
ESTHER PEREL: Like
it should be done?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.786
Not high school.

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:02.860
LOGAN URY: OK, yeah.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.360
Let's hear.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.910
What would you want to
teach people about--

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.760
DAN SAVAGE: There are people
in high school with four year

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.260
olds.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.740
It's too late in high school.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.350
LOGAN URY: OK.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.147
Preschool, day one.

00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:12.230
What should people be
learning about healthy adult

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.322
relationships?

00:28:13.322 --> 00:28:14.280
DAN SAVAGE: Oh, my God.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.430
I'm a terrible person.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.410
A sex ed course needs
to be comprehensive.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.260
It needs to be-- it needs
to start very young,

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.830
and it needs to be
age appropriate,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.380
but that terminology
is so subjective.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.710
Who's going to define
what age appropriate is?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.770
There are people out
there-- many of them--

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.090
who believe that a kid
who's 18 is not yet

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.510
ready for comprehensive sex
ed because then that kid is

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.077
going to want to have sex.

00:28:42.077 --> 00:28:43.660
If I were going to
design the program,

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.980
it would be ongoing,
lifelong, comprehensive.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.340
It would be queer-inclusive.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.500
It would address kink.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.550
It would address the
99.99% of the sex

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.050
that people are having over the
course of their lives, which

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.060
is not procreation.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.990
It's recreational sex.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.040
Even what a lot of us liberals
and-- as I sweepingly gesture

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.900
to the room, assuming we're
all liberals and progressives--

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.490
even often what we hold up as
an example of really good sex

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.820
ed-- when you look at
it and you dig into it,

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.540
it's just reproductive
biology, and you can

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.500
cover that in about 11 minutes.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.760
Any idiot can make a baby.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.150
Bristol Palin made two.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.780
What trips people up is not
fallopian tubes, and zygotes,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.770
and spermatozoa.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:30.880
What trips people up is
consent, desire, what it means,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.500
and the 99.99% of the sex
people are having, which is

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.030
sex for pleasure.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.470
And we need to educate young
people about the options

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:42.090
that most adults who have
worked past the vaginal or anal

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.100
intercourse
obsession know, which

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.410
is that it's not all
vaginal or anal intercourse.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.310
There's a lot that young
people can do sexually

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.010
that creates those feelings
of intimacy, and release,

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.790
and that bond that don't involve
the high bar, high stakes,

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.490
high risk that comes
with penetrative sex.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.740
But imagine a sex ed course.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.850
It's [INAUDIBLE] 15 year olds,
14 year olds, and 13 year olds.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.500
First boyfriend,
first girlfriend,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.280
first non-binary friend--
maybe you masturbate together,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.050
roll round have oral sex.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.030
You don't have to worry
about birth control

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.170
if you're not having
vaginal intercourse yet,

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.760
and there's plenty
of time for that.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.100
Learn each other's bodies,
and learn your own body,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.990
and enjoy them.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.770
And you can wait on that.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.540
Good sex ed empowers people
not to necessarily have sex,

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.623
but to make their own
choices, their own decisions

00:30:34.623 --> 00:30:36.670
about when and how.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.510
I always compare the
sex ed that we get--

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.600
and speaking of
abstinence, I was so

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.500
thrilled in 2008 during Barack
Obama's first inaugural address

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.280
when he said we're
going to return science

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.980
to its proper place.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.830
I thought that meant no more
money for abstinence education

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.460
because the science has shown
that not only doesn't it

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.570
work, it backfires because kids
who've had abstinence-only sex

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.530
education may delay sexual
activity by about six months,

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.050
but much less likely to use
protection, so much likelier,

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:08.160
once six months later than
their peers they're having sex,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.186
to have an unplanned
pregnancy, to contract

00:31:10.186 --> 00:31:11.560
a sexually-transmitted
infection.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.060
I thought it would
be the end of it.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.310
But Republicans bundled
up quarter-billion dollars

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.904
worth of funding for abstinence
education with Obamacare

00:31:19.904 --> 00:31:21.320
and put Obama in
the position then

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.660
of having to veto Obamacare to
stop funding absence education.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.180
And so it's still out
there, and in many places

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.210
it's the only sex ed kids get.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.660
And it's destructive,
and it destroys the lives

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.500
not just of straight kids,
but also of queer kids.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.927
And it's got to stop.

00:31:39.927 --> 00:31:41.510
Particularly the
reproductive biology.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.260
I always compare it
a driver's ed class,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.720
where they teach you how
the internal combustion

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.110
engine works, but not how
to steer, not how to break,

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:51.220
and not what the red hexagon
at the end of the street means.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.960
And so you give somebody keys
to the car after that sex ed--

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.543
or after that driver's
ed, and they're

00:31:55.543 --> 00:31:58.000
going to run over someone.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.210
And yet that's our sex ed.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.210
Here's how your internal
reproductive combustion

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:01.790
engine works.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.040
Here's the keys to your pants.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.829
Now go.

00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:06.370
LOGAN URY: Esther,
what do you think?

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.495
You have a very global
perspective on what people--

00:32:08.495 --> 00:32:11.300
ESTHER PEREL: I'm even
more extreme than this.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.470
Look, I'm married 30 years.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.170
I have two boys, and I
was going to make them not

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.035
become casualties of
the American system.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.470
We have comprehensive
sex education.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.110
It starts at age four.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.370
It doesn't talk
about private parts.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.610
It's not a plumbing class.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.490
It looks at-- it is
somewhat more procreative,

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.840
but it connects-- it
talks about pleasure.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.054
It talks about love.

00:32:37.054 --> 00:32:38.220
It talks about relationship.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.220
This is the book you read
for the four year olds.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.960
It talks about how it compares
with other living creatures.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.460
It is-- the one that I'm
thinking of is definitely

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.810
a heterosexual story, but it
plants the seeds very clearly

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.250
of this is part
of how we relate.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.250
This is part of how
we express our love,

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.050
our connection, our fondness.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.490
This is pleasurable,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.880
And it establishes from the
start freedom, autonomy,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.780
respect, pleasure,
connection, that.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.810
I had one kid in public
school in Manhattan.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.790
He had two hours
of sex education.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.750
It went like this.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.700
Two people came in.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.510
One said, "When you
have sex you get AIDS.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.960
The other one said, "I had sex.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.250
Therefore, I have AIDS."

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.680
That was the end of
his sex education.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.599
Very respectable public school
in Manhattan-- the other one

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:24.640
was really, really lucky.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.230
He had actually a
very good program

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.880
that I could look through it.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.790
But still, it was about disease.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.060
It was about the dangers.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.550
It was about dysfunction.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.860
Here's what's wrong
in the United States.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.180
This is the only
country that doesn't

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.820
have a public health policy
on adolescent sexuality

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.830
in the West.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.090
Therefore, as a result of
the abstinence campaigns,

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.610
activity starts two years before
the liberal Dutch, eight times

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.710
more teen pregnancy
than all of EU

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:57.160
and 35 other countries combined,
and a proliferation of STDs.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.410
There is on the one
hand a complete madness

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.390
around the politics of safety
and the precautionary principal

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.760
and all the assault stuff
that you have on campus,

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.330
and then you just
swipe and you go

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.600
and you fuck the next stranger.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.040
Here you can't talk to anybody.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.060
And here, there is this-- and
these two extremes are typical.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.469
It's always a combination
of repressive tactics

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.190
and complete, massive
excess, with nothing

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.060
that is just simply
an integrated topic

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.860
because in the US, sex
is the risk factor.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.150
In Europe, being irresponsible
is the risk factor.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.460
Sex is a natural part of life.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.159
As a result, you have
posters all over the place

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.515
about the fact that 14
year olds, 15 year olds

00:34:36.515 --> 00:34:39.210
will have sex and should
use protection in order

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:43.150
to be able to enjoy the sex, not
in order to avoid getting sick.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.070
It's actually a very
different conception.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.199
I can't even tell you
where to begin with this.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.550
It's wrong from the start.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.340
It's wrong from the moment
you have pink and blue.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.810
There's still the distinction.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.690
It starts from the fact that
everything-- that masculinity

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.280
here is-- if you don't have
sports, for God's sakes,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.140
most men would never be touched.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.632
At this point, most--

00:35:02.632 --> 00:35:06.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.700
This is all for me sexuality.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.400
Sexuality is not about
doing the act, sex.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.060
It's about being sexual people.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.710
It's about a way that
you-- it's the distinction

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.620
between violence
and everything else.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.070
It starts with the fact
that-- ugh, I can't go.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.200
I can go on and on.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.120
It's really so bad.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.840
The majority of boys
at this point in the US

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.580
get their sex education starting
around age 11 from one source

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.260
only, and that is porn only.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.900
Porn is perfectly fun, but
it is terrible sex education.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.320
It's really lousy sex ed.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.669
And if you leave a
vacuum, you always

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:40.210
get the people that
come in that will

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.050
take advantage of the vacuum.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.230
And then, when you get a
good English teacher here

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.580
that starts to teach sex
education to the class,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.620
you get people coming in saying
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.860
It's a public health issue.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.610
It's not even-- it
touches at every level

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.720
because sexuality
in every society

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.720
is the place where you're
going to find the most

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.830
archaic, the most entrenched,
the most rooted values

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.840
of a society, and
it's also the place

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.298
where you're going
to find the most

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:09.480
radical, progressive changes.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.070
It's really a lens into
a society, and especially

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.960
around violence.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.930
And so the fact that you don't
have real, comprehensive sex

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.940
education-- and
it's at age four.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.630
Why four?

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.470
Because at four,
you begin to know,

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.310
where does grandma
go when she dies?

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.060
And so you have a
conception of death.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.970
And once you know
where we go, you also

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.250
need to know where we
come from, most of us.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.005
That's the first place,
why it is so young.

00:36:37.005 --> 00:36:39.130
But this is also a country
who thinks that you only

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.650
should start learning foreign
languages in high school.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.110
LOGAN URY: Whew!

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.460
Dan, it sounds like--

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.959
DAN SAVAGE: I think
the problem goes

00:36:47.959 --> 00:36:49.800
back to that Australia
got the convicts,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.380
Canada got the French,
and we got the Puritans,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.090
that it was a shitty deal.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.230
LOGAN URY: So Esther, you
mentioned masculinity,

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.730
and there was
something that I heard

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.970
you say in a podcast that really
fascinated me around women

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.260
and perfectionism, how women
really need to feel sexy

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.490
in order to have sex, and
a lot of desire and passion

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.130
is around the
woman feeling sexy,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.582
and that's at odds
with perfectionism

00:37:14.582 --> 00:37:16.290
because the woman has
a voice in her head

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.200
that's always
critical of herself.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.370
And I think this is a
high-performing audience,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.786
and a lot of women
here are trying

00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:24.370
to be the perfect employee,
the perfect mother,

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.810
the perfect spouse.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.110
Can you speak a little
bit about femininity,

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.000
and desire, and perfectionism?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.910
ESTHER PEREL: Whoa.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.300
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.230
But I'm going to
rephrase this a little.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.460
I'm going to say that
being self-critical

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:47.040
is one of the most effective
tools of a consumer society,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.570
and it's not just a
privilege of women, actually.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.230
I think men have their own
list of things about which they

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:56.860
can feel not good enough, or
insufficient, or inadequate.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:02.610
So in that sense, I would
say something different.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.400
And I think that
that's probably--

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.858
you need to tell me what you
think about this because we've

00:38:06.858 --> 00:38:10.090
actually not talked
about this one.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.660
If you think about
sexuality-- I'm

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.040
going to take a tiny detail.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.680
If you think about sexuality and
the experience of letting go,

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.180
right?

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.200
Letting go in order
to be able to enjoy,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.960
in order to be able
to experience pleasure

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.880
and all of that-- you
would think, then,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.690
what is it that are the blocks
that prevent letting go?

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.230
In a straight narrative,
you will often

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.400
hear a man say nothing
turns me on more

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.620
than for her to be turned on.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.910
Yes?

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.570
Because if she's turned on, then
he knows he's not hurting her.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.900
She's into it.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.140
He can bypass the
mainframe obstacle

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.490
for men, which is
the predatory fear.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.770
If she's into it,
if she likes it,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.730
then he doesn't have to worry.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.760
This is actually what
he gets on screen.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.620
The woman on screen always
likes it, never has a headache,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.070
always says me too, always
says more, more, more,

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.480
and he doesn't have to
feel neither inadequate,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.710
nor afraid of rejection, nor
worried if she likes it, which

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.670
are the three most important
internal experiences for men,

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.810
psychologically, sexually.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.840
What is it for her?

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.980
Why do I say the predatory fear?

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.370
Because I think that the
obstacle in sexuality

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.150
is the opposite of
the social role.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.800
If you are raised to be a
protector, than the obstacle

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.880
has to be that you need to free
yourself from the role of being

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.410
a protector in order to
be able to enjoy, to play,

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.540
and to have fun.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.890
For her, it's the
parallel, same one.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.170
It's the taking care.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.240
She doesn't say nothing
turns me on more than

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.530
to see him turned on, or her
turned on, for that matter.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.900
It doesn't make a difference.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.830
If she's not into it,
he can stand there

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.010
with the biggest hard
on, makes no dent.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.430
Shop is closed.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.660
Nothing's going to happen.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.900
What turns her on is
to be the turn on,

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.150
and that's the big secret
of female sexuality

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.540
is that it is
massively narcissistic.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.300
It's the opposite of
the caring for others,

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.560
of feeling responsible
for others.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.280
If she can think about herself,
then she can be into it.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.070
And in order to
think about herself,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.190
she then needs to like herself.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.210
Hence, she can't be
in a critical voice.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:20.730
That's the perfection piece.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.330
If she starts to think about
everything about her that

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.840
is not good enough,
that she doesn't like,

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.780
she will shut herself off.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.725
Before you ask a woman if
she will make love to a man

00:40:30.725 --> 00:40:32.460
or to another woman,
ask a woman if she

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.340
would make love to herself.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.180
If she doesn't want to
make love to herself,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.700
she won't let anybody
else do it either,

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.170
and that's where the
perfection piece comes in.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:47.330
That voice is harder
for her to extinguish

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.770
because it is more
self-reflexive than it

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.430
is for him.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.190
And I think that
between two guys,

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:56.830
the predatory fear is not
present in that same way,

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.480
that you have a level of
freedom because of that.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.830
You're not busy making sure,
"Is the other person OK?"

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.330
You know it when they
are and when they're not,

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.930
not because they're excited just
physiologically, not because

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.280
of dick.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.200
You have the communication
because she also-- she's

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.730
spent so many thousands
of years making sure

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.920
that she doesn't let it
be known that she likes it

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.350
because if she likes it,
she's going to be slut-shamed,

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.120
whatever the language
was for that before.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.870
So she has to wrap it in
five layers of relatedness

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.590
to make it clear
that she likes it,

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.060
so she doesn't know
what she likes.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.185
So all she ends up saying
is what she doesn't like.

00:41:33.185 --> 00:41:36.540
That, she knows very well.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.528
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:39.528 --> 00:41:42.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.850
You get it?

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.610
Am I-- I don't see you.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.250
Is this-- am I speaking--
this is-- yeah, somewhat?

00:41:52.057 --> 00:41:52.890
DAN SAVAGE: I agree.

00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:57.290
LOGAN URY: One thing I did
want to talk about was--

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.873
ESTHER PEREL: Do you
agree on two men,

00:41:58.873 --> 00:42:02.120
that it takes-- that the
predatory fear is less present?

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.620
DAN SAVAGE: Not
always because there

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.784
can be differences around--
sometimes when people

00:42:06.784 --> 00:42:08.200
say two men together,
they picture

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.300
two men of sort of equal
physical stature, age,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.680
social power, everything else.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.050
There can be a radical power
imbalance where then you

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:17.851
begin to feel bad.

00:42:17.851 --> 00:42:18.350
Are you OK?

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:18.850
Are you OK?

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.020
Are you OK?

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.300
Some of those dynamics can
be replicated, I think,

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.297
in same-sex relationships.

00:42:24.297 --> 00:42:25.880
LOGAN URY: So this
is somewhat related

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.879
to the sex ed question--

00:42:26.879 --> 00:42:28.295
DAN SAVAGE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:28.295 --> 00:42:30.170
LOGAN URY: So we're at
Google, and google.com

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.387
has the homepage.

00:42:31.387 --> 00:42:32.970
I'm sure you've been
there many times.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.910
And billions of searches
happen on that page every day,

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.410
and sometimes there's
a line of text

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.150
under it promoting a new
product or a new service.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.400
If you could take over the
google.com homepage for a day

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.720
and leave one message for
people around the world,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.550
potentially about
sex and relationships

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.759
or not, what message would
you want to get out there?

00:42:50.759 --> 00:42:52.675
DAN SAVAGE: If I could
take it over for a day,

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:54.800
I would just shut it down
because Google really

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.360
fucked up my sex advice column.

00:42:58.742 --> 00:42:59.450
LOGAN URY: Go on.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.824
DAN SAVAGE: Because
25 years ago,

00:43:00.824 --> 00:43:04.140
half the questions I would
get were "what's a butt plug?"

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.570
and "fisting-- how
do you do that?"

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.930
and those things
have wiki pages now,

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.100
and those were really
easy columns to write.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.766
A butt plug-- it looks
like a lava lamp.

00:43:12.766 --> 00:43:15.300
It goes in your butt.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.501
And so all the mail
I get-- and people

00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:19.500
would write me like,
"Where is the swingers club

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.230
in my neighborhood?" and
that was kind of specialized

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.270
knowledge 25 years ago.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.960
You'd have to have
these magazines,

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.620
these swingers magazines, with
PO boxes listed in the back,

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.190
and you would then
give those to people.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:30.550
And that was half the mail then.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.924
Those were easy
columns to write.

00:43:31.924 --> 00:43:34.230
All the mail now is
situational ethics.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.780
I did this.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.612
They did that.

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:36.820
This terrible thing happened.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.390
Who's right.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.890
Who's wrong.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.490
Please cut this baby in half.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.110
And those columns are
much harder to write,

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.450
so Google made my job
much more difficult.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.070
And if I just had
it for a day, I

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.528
would shut it all down so I
could get some of those "what's

00:43:48.528 --> 00:43:49.695
a butt plug" questions back.

00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:51.819
LOGAN URY: I think Google
also made somebody else's

00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:53.300
job a little more difficult.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.100
DAN SAVAGE: Whose?

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.210
LOGAN URY: Rick Santorum.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.240
DAN SAVAGE: Yes, it did.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.780
But Google investigated actually
and declared that it wasn't

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.904
a gaming of the algorithm.

00:44:03.904 --> 00:44:05.320
It wasn't any sort
of Google bomb.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.140
It was just the legitimate
first return for about 12 years.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.723
LOGAN URY: I think
it's a good lesson.

00:44:09.723 --> 00:44:11.150
Don't piss off
Dan Savage's fans.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.590
DAN SAVAGE: Readers.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.450
LOGAN URY: Readers.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:12.810
DAN SAVAGE: People
always credit me

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.870
for the Santorum Google
bomb, but a reader

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.092
suggested the contest.

00:44:16.092 --> 00:44:17.800
A reader came up with
the new definition,

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.720
and readers picked
that definition

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.290
from a field of 10
other definitions.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.849
So I was just getting out of
the way of my genius readers.

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:26.890
LOGAN URY: So no one's
taken out their phone yet,

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.431
but if you're not
familiar with this,

00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:31.500
I recommend googling
it after this talk.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.320
DAN SAVAGE: Who isn't
familiar with Google Santorum?

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.200
All right then.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:35.960
Good.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.740
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.710
Esther, what about you,
if you could take it over?

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.710
ESTHER PEREL: I would
probably shut it down too,

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.327
but for a different reason.

00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:45.243
DAN SAVAGE: We are never
getting invited back.

00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:48.770
ESTHER PEREL: Just
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.470
I think at this point,
I would probably

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.770
close up a lot of
things for a while

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.370
to give us the space to reclaim
back our own imagination.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.140
I think that we are being
robbed of our imagination

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.170
because everything is
served up so immediately

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.390
and we don't even know.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.550
We don't even know.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.880
Once people had
much richer fantasy

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.680
lives than they have today.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.210
I'm not just talking about
sexual fantasy lives,

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.060
but erotic fantasy
lives, yes, and that's

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.720
why I would close it, to
reclaim the power of the erotic

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.807
in our own imaginative space.

00:45:29.807 --> 00:45:32.390
LOGAN URY: OK, so the headline
is "Esther Perel and Dan Savage

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.005
Say Shut Down Google."

00:45:34.005 --> 00:45:35.130
ESTHER PEREL: That's right.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:35.271
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:35.760
Got it.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.843
DAN SAVAGE: Google's done.

00:45:36.843 --> 00:45:39.120
LOGAN URY: On that note,
we'll open up the questions

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.860
from googlers, see how
they feel about this.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.280
So if you have a question,
just line up at the two mics

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:44.780
right here.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.810
ESTHER PEREL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.040
LOGAN URY: Yeah, let's do that.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.270
DAN SAVAGE: I guess I
should be totally honest.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.850
I would shut Google down
for everyone else but me

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.083
because I use it every day.

00:45:51.083 --> 00:45:51.850
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.350
That's true.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.880
We haven't thought this through.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.137
Any questions?

00:45:55.137 --> 00:45:56.053
I have more I can ask.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:02.270
AUDIENCE: Howdy.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:06.770
I'm curious what maybe the
98th percentile of monogamous,

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.825
exclusive relationships look
like, the best case scenario.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:14.790
Does anyone actually
pull it off?

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.560
ESTHER PEREL: Yes.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.740
OK, so I-- yes, of course.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:23.440
And I think that monogamy
is a continuum, right?

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.850
I say it a little
bit differently

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.130
than when Dan says
you've been good at it.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.440
I think that today-- we
used to marry and have

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.300
sex for the first time.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.810
Now we marry and we stop
having sex with others.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.080
So when you arrive to
committed relationships,

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.330
you have not been monogamous.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:46.000
So in some strange way,
monogamy only exists in reality.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.870
It doesn't exist
in your fantasies,

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:50.570
and it doesn't
exist in your past.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:54.470
A relationship that
opts for the choice,

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.950
that chooses to practice
monogamy-- and it may change.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.780
It may be 10, 15
years of something

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.910
and then another 15
years of something else;

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.900
it's really not static-- is a
relationship in which people

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.010
understand the erotic
freedom of the other person

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.280
and decides together what
will be a line that we

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.170
will create about that freedom?

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.590
That means that
you have memories.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.590
That means that you may
have your own fantasies.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.500
That means that sometimes
you may flirt with people.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.577
That means that you may
not flirt with people.

00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:23.910
That means that you may have
friendships with the people

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.240
from the other sex.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.990
You're asking about
straight couples here,

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.862
or all couples that
are monogamous.

00:47:29.862 --> 00:47:32.320
AUDIENCE: I only care about
the straight couples, but yeah.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:37.120
ESTHER PEREL: Because the
friendship with the other sex

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.370
is different in the
same-sex couples.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.610
That's why I'm going to
make the distinction.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:46.570
But basically , the first thing
I would say is that hetero

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.930
couples who have good monogamous
relationships are couples who

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.660
have talked about it.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.280
They didn't just assume it.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.240
They've negotiated it,
and their negotiation

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.830
was a little more than just "I
catch you, and you're dead,"

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.780
which is the
majority conversation

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.130
in most straight couples.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.390
The only time straight
couples talk about this stuff

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:08.030
is after the shit hits
the fan, when there's

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:11.960
a crisis, when I suddenly
discover I have herpes

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.230
that I wasn't meant to have,
when I suddenly discover

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.630
a slew of texts in your
phone that [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.080
et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.600
So the first thing is,
it's a conversation.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.530
It's a conversation
when things aren't good.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.560
It's a conversation that doesn't
invite the other person to lie.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.059
And that tells you
that-- because we

00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:32.100
can complain about the
other person being a liar,

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.040
but we sometimes need
to check to what degree

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.830
am I a lying invitee, right?

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.300
I set it up in such a
way that you're never

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.920
going to tell me the truth.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.710
Third, I respect that your
entire sexuality-- that doesn't

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.240
mean the act of sex, but
your entire erotic world--

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.700
doesn't belong to me
because we are married.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.260
You are still a sovereign,
autonomous person.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.360
Fourth, there is
permission-- very much

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.310
what Dan said-- to
recognize that you

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.290
may have desires, attractions,
crushes for other people,

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:05.620
and it isn't instantly
translated as "I'm not enough."

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:10.050
And it is revisited over
time, and it's that.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:13.410
And it's couples who maintain
a good erotic connection

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.890
with each other,
which has nothing

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.790
to do with how often they
have sex, how many orgasms

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:20.380
they have, how hard, how long.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.080
It's really a way of
being with each other that

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.500
makes them remain adult,
sexualized people, which

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.680
is different from family.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.990
You can become
monogamous in the family,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.300
and often that also
becomes a kiss of death

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.380
because really, if
your head is screwed up

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.880
when on your shoulders, you
do not want sex in the family.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.590
Your partner is not your mama,
your daddy, your best friend.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.450
Your partner is your
partner, and that ability

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.950
to see them as other is
essential to the maintaining

00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.884
of an erotic connection in
a monogamous relationship.

00:50:01.884 --> 00:50:02.522
Yeah?

00:50:02.522 --> 00:50:03.230
DAN SAVAGE: Yeah.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:04.271
ESTHER PEREL: Good start?

00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:06.780
DAN SAVAGE: That's
a great start.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.590
Usually, people would define the
98th percentile, the best case

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.831
scenario, as two people
made a monogamous commitment

00:50:12.831 --> 00:50:13.456
and honored it.

00:50:13.456 --> 00:50:14.997
They never fucked
anybody else, ever,

00:50:14.997 --> 00:50:17.927
and they got to be together 50
years and dropped dead one day.

00:50:17.927 --> 00:50:19.760
And that's the marriage
victory finish line.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.570
Somebody dies.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:21.280
ESTHER PEREL: But Dan,
sex doesn't start just

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:21.750
when you fuck.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:22.300
DAN SAVAGE: No, I agree.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.091
I completely agree.

00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:24.990
I'm just being
intentionally reductive.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.880
I'm being a jerk on purpose.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.800
But that-- you can say-- if I
told you there was this couple

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.930
and one cheated on the other,
the other cheated on the other,

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.477
and they were together
35 years, and there

00:50:38.477 --> 00:50:40.810
was a handful of
infidelities, and there's

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.180
this couple together 50 years,
and neither ever cheated

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.840
on each other, which is the
successful-- going off that,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.130
which is the
successful relationship

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.439
and the successful marriage?

00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:51.230
And everyone's going
to say, without asking

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.550
for any additional information,
the 50-year, perfectly executed

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.310
monogamy.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.880
That's the loving, committed,
successful relationship.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.857
OK, alcoholism, physical
violence, child abuse,

00:51:02.857 --> 00:51:04.690
and on, and on, and on
in this relationship,

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:05.731
not in that relationship.

00:51:05.731 --> 00:51:07.344
Now which one's the
more successful?

00:51:07.344 --> 00:51:09.510
I just think that it's
reductive to hold up monogamy

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.542
as the most important measure
of love, commitment, or success.

00:51:13.542 --> 00:51:15.750
But to answer your question,
what would it look like?

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.464
It would look like
two people who

00:51:16.464 --> 00:51:18.640
made a monogamous
commitment and didn't cheat.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.020
And a lot of people think
they're in that relationship

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.785
and are not.

00:51:21.785 --> 00:51:22.660
ESTHER PEREL: No, no.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.450
I'm sorry.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:26.110
For me, monogamous
doesn't just mean--

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.670
the idea is not just how
not to break the rules

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.480
and not how now to
violate the trust.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.740
It is also how to be
together as an erotic couple.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.470
It's not enough not just--

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.720
DAN SAVAGE: And doing
everything that you talked about

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.530
makes successfully executing a
monogamous commitment likelier,

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.920
by giving each other
permission to desire others

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.190
but not act on that
desire, not policing

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:51.730
each other's sexuality
or erotic life entirely,

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:56.630
not regarding pornography when
discovered as an infidelity

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:59.000
or as evidence of an
impending infidelity,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.480
or defining it as cheating,
or getting on a cam show

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.840
once or twice, or whatever
else technology's made possible

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.720
for us.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:14.467
The more strict and insane your
definitions of cheating are,

00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:16.050
the likelier you are
to be cheated on.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.970
You want the lowest
bar definition

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.910
of cheating if you want
to be less likely to cheat

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.910
or be cheated on, of course.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.280
Sorry.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.280
LOGAN URY: I think you
were waiting for a while.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.070
AUDIENCE: Yes, I am.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.290
So I guess I had one
question regarding

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.190
the discussion on sex ed.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:39.050
So I guess in a way, it almost
comes as a surprise to me

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:43.680
that we need sex ed now
with the internet in place.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.900
Empirically, obviously,
there's a terrible case

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.930
for that because for example,
as Dan brought up earlier,

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:53.020
there's this result that says if
people get abstinence-only sex

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:55.910
education, then it does
measurably take them longer

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.170
to start having sex.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.900
So basically, clearly we do
have some degree of influence.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.180
But I guess-- I don't know.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.770
In my own personal case, when I
was 12, I found "Savage Love,"

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:10.810
and that was a big part of
how this development happened.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:14.800
So what would you say
about-- essentially,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.230
should we expect that people
will-- because of tools

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:20.370
like the internet, start
to develop this stuff more

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.200
independently?

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.241
DAN SAVAGE: You would
think that the availability

00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:26.240
of so much really good sex
ed online-- not just "Savage

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.720
Love," but all these other
sites-- Planned Parenthood

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.404
sites, Scarlet Teen.

00:53:31.404 --> 00:53:33.570
There's a lot of great sex
ed information out there.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.220
But we also have kids growing
up in a really sex-negative

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.450
culture that puts
it in their heads

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.550
that if they go looking
for that information

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.540
that they're dirty sex
monsters and there's something

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.290
wrong with them, and
there's virtue in ignorance,

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.330
and there's virtue in
sex happening naturally

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.610
and impulsively.

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.920
If you lose control, that
means there's so much

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.750
love, passion there,
and it sort of

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.790
exonerates you for the dirty
thing of having the sex.

00:53:57.790 --> 00:53:59.560
So the intentionality,
the planning

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.080
of it, the thinking about it
in advance for a lot of kids

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.025
is the barrier to accessing
the information that

00:54:06.025 --> 00:54:07.150
seems so easily accessible.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:08.608
ESTHER PEREL: This
is so important.

00:54:08.608 --> 00:54:11.550
Really, listen to this.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.670
DAN SAVAGE: I have a
17-year-old son, right?

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:17.710
And we were hyper
about sex ed with him.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:20.706
And particularly, a
young teenage man, a boy,

00:54:20.706 --> 00:54:22.580
in this country, also
particularly very hyper

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.540
about consent and what it
meant and what it looked

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.790
like, and that's something
they do not teach in sex ed

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.080
because that's basically
teaching young people how

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.590
to talk people into fucking you.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.540
How do you get to yes?

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.780
What does a yes look like?

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.350
What does a no look like?

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:35.990
And what does an
implied no look like?

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.090
Very important.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.330
And all of my
conversations with my son,

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.230
he did not want to have.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.866
I know that.

00:54:41.866 --> 00:54:43.240
We don't have to
talk about that.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.570
But I couldn't know that he
knew that because I knew that he

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:50.390
would tell me he knew it because
he wanted me to stop talking

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.260
to him about sex, so I had
to have those conversations

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.479
with him whether he
wanted to have them

00:54:55.479 --> 00:54:58.020
or not, and whether he needed
me to have them with him or not

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.610
because I couldn't know for sure
that he didn't actually know.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:03.310
So I made an outline,
and I was like,

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:04.970
"Here are the things
we're going to talk about.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.810
The more you fight
this conversation,

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:10.040
the longer it takes."

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.900
And so we had those talks.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.976
But kids are really
inhibited about seeking.

00:55:14.976 --> 00:55:17.100
You would think-- particularly,
people in this room

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.349
probably are seekers of
information and ran out there

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:22.890
and accessed it even
as young people.

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:26.030
And a lot of young people--
particularly young women

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:29.064
and girls-- that they will--
they slut shame themselves

00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:31.230
in advance of seeking the
information they may need.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.620
LOGAN URY: I think you two
should pair up and teach a sex

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.612
ed class online.

00:55:34.612 --> 00:55:35.820
That'd make a lot of people--

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.870
DAN SAVAGE: But then we
have to compel people.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:39.244
That's why we need the national
standard in actual sex ed

00:55:39.244 --> 00:55:41.650
curriculum, and we can't even
have a national curriculum

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:44.720
about geography
without the right wing

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.114
shitting its pants every day.

00:55:46.114 --> 00:55:47.780
ESTHER PEREL: Here's
two things that you

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.380
don't get when you go
online, and it's also

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.610
a problem with the sex
education, that is.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.340
Sex education as I
know it, everybody's

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.510
in the class at the same time.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.210
It's not the boys
get their education,

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.800
the girls get their education.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.790
That's number one.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.380
Second of all, you
learn to relate.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.040
You learn to listen
to the nuances.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.360
The problem of the whole
debate about consent

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.660
is that it's become-- it's
part of a culture that

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.510
has lost the ability
to read nuances

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.240
and to travel ambiguities.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.520
Relationships are ambiguous.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.140
They're not fuck/no,
in/out, yes/no.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.450
Life is not like that in the
extremes in the relationship,

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:31.450
and that you do not
get from a screen.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.680
LOGAN URY: So we have time--

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:32.930
DAN SAVAGE: And
the other thing--

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.600
a quick point about sex ed being
mandatory and across the board

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.604
is that we can be really
proactive about educating

00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:41.270
our kids about sex, but our kids
aren't going to sleep only with

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:44.740
other people's-- the kids
of other parents who are

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.510
hyperactive about
educating their kids.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:48.520
It's the stirring into
the general population

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.443
of kids who know
nothing about sex that

00:56:51.443 --> 00:56:53.026
imperils all of our
kids, whether they

00:56:53.026 --> 00:56:54.970
have good or decent some
sex education or not.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.011
LOGAN URY: So we have time
for one more question,

00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:59.670
and then I don't want to
miss out on book signing

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.931
in the back, so go for it.

00:57:03.931 --> 00:57:05.430
AUDIENCE: So when
you think about it

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:12.240
and rationalize the idea of no
more monogamy, it makes sense.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.260
However, the
feelings and emotions

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.820
do not follow, with being
wired by the society

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.980
to feel bad about
it over decades.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.310
So how do you cut
the wire and make

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.899
emotions match the thoughts,
and how was the process for you?

00:57:27.899 --> 00:57:30.190
DAN SAVAGE: You're referring
to jealousy, particularly?

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.757
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and other
feelings [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:32.757 --> 00:57:34.840
DAN SAVAGE: People often
say, we get conversations

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.560
about non-monogamy
or monogamish-amy

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.750
or whatever, they bring up
jealousy as a disqualifier

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.431
somehow, that these
feelings of jealousy

00:57:41.431 --> 00:57:43.680
mean that we shouldn't have
this kind of relationship,

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.650
or I'm incapable of having
this kind of relationship,

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:47.983
or that because there's
jealousy within our relationship

00:57:47.983 --> 00:57:50.615
that we as a couple obviously
can't be non-monogamous.

00:57:50.615 --> 00:57:52.240
I don't think every
couple needs to be,

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.531
or should be, or would be
happier being non-monogamous.

00:57:54.531 --> 00:57:56.940
I'm not prescriptive about it.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.740
But it has been my experience
that processing that jealousy

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.811
and talking it out
and working through it

00:58:03.811 --> 00:58:05.310
is how we demonstrated
to each other

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.340
that this was the
right model for us,

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.800
that we were capable
of doing this.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.300
So it was in the handling of
this thing that a lot of people

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.350
think is some sort of
disqualifying kryptonite

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:19.880
that we developed the
emotional tools, and really

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.130
the connection,
to do this thing.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.630
So I don't think
jealousy as an emotion

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:29.737
and as an experience means
you can't or shouldn't do it.

00:58:29.737 --> 00:58:31.570
It's how you process
that and how you handle

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:31.675
It.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:32.820
And it's case specific.

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.640
For some people, jealousy is
too powerful, and too strong,

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.760
and too destabilizing,
and too risky,

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.310
and so maybe a
non-monogamous thing isn't

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:46.155
the best idea for you-- not
the best idea for you now.

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:48.280
The first four years of my
relationship with Terry,

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.863
we were strictly
monogamous because he

00:58:49.863 --> 00:58:54.500
was very, very jealous
and a little insecure

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.390
about everything and about it.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.770
But who he is now is
very different from who

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:00.024
he was 21 years ago.

00:59:00.024 --> 00:59:01.440
The relationship
is now old enough

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.890
to drink in all 50 states.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:10.850
ESTHER PEREL: But
differently, maybe, for me--

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:14.520
if I have a position, it's
that we need multiple models.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.650
We need something that
breathes, and that's alive,

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:20.190
and that changes and thrives.

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:23.520
And if for you you say
"I like one person,"

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.000
if there's no passion,
generally it's monogamous.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.400
Passion doesn't share well.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.970
It's after.

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:30.960
When you're passionate,
you love single-mined.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.090
You're very, very
focused on one person.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:36.280
And when you have had lots
of insecurity in your life

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.630
and massive trauma in
your life, sometimes it

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.390
makes you want to
just have somebody

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:43.410
that is there for you that's
reliable, stable, secure,

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:45.040
and you do not want
to have to deal

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.520
with the unknown of multiples.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.690
We have lots of
different pieces of us

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:52.220
that come to this
question, and the goal

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:55.730
is not for you to try to see
how can I be non-monogamous.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:57.500
If your nature, if
your sensibility

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.890
is one that is more single,
stay like this if you like it,

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.350
if it works for you.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.960
If one day you change, then
go accordingly to that.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.790
Don't align yourself
with an ideology.

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:12.540
The problem of the conversation
of open/close monogamy

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.820
is that it becomes very quickly
ideological and fractured

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.030
and polarized.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.240
I don't think that's right.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.020
I think we need a conversation.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.380
Monogamy has evolved all along.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.400
I think that premarital sex was
an inconceivably thing not too

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.210
long ago, and today having
sex inside the relationship

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.890
with others is to some
people inconceivable,

01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.690
but it is the same line.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.750
It all happened because somebody
democratized contraception,

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.070
by the way.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.200
Without that, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.300
So you stay true to your
sensibility and to your--

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.960
DAN SAVAGE: While recognizing
your sensibility may change,

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.220
and what's working for
you now may be something

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.770
you need to revisit
later, and you

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.740
have that ability and that
power to revisit later.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.440
This gets me into trouble with
the non-monogamy proselytizers

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.220
when I say this.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.830
But in my-- all anecdotal
but tons of mail

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.784
and tons of eyewitness
stuff-- in my experience,

01:01:07.784 --> 01:01:10.200
the relationships that were
non-monogamous out of the gate

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.820
usually don't "succeed."

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.910
And we can argue what's
the definition of success

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:16.660
in a relationship.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.076
Together until you're both
dead or 'til one of you is dead

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.192
is the idea.

01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:22.650
If you're together for three
months, six months, two years,

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.460
10 years, 20 years, and
you part and you both

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.470
learned, your both grew,
there's still affection there,

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.540
it was a low-conflict
relationship,

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.360
and you both survived it, I
think those relationships also

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.230
have to be regarded as
successful relationships.

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:39.570
But if what you want is
a long-term commitment,

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.656
someone by your side long
haul-- in my experience,

01:01:42.656 --> 01:01:44.280
and borne out by the
mail and borne out

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.820
by what I've seen
in my communities,

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:53.330
is the ones that are
non-monogamous that first week

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:56.090
aren't long-haul relationships--
not necessarily unsuccessful,

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:56.840
but not long-haul.

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:01.000
LOGAN URY: That's
all we have time

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.100
for, but thank you so much.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.599
This was a fascinating
conversation.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:06.750
[APPLAUSE]
