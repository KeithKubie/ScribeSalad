MARK BALL: Hi.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.202
My name is Mark Ball.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.672
I am here with
you all at Google.

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.880
I'm on a team, actually,
called team and organization

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.494
development.

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:11.160
And we get to work
with team development

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.290
all across the company,
so it's super fun.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.470
And I first took a course
called "Art of Living" course

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.220
over 20 years ago
and was blown away

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.123
by the effectiveness of
using the breath to-- hello,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:27.232
John-- using the breath to get
into deep states of meditation

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:28.700
very easily and quickly.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.731
And then-- so, for 10 years,
just doing the techniques

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.230
and getting more and more amazed
at how effective they were,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.450
I finally decided,
OK, go to the source.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.780
Go to India.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.620
And then, went there, and I was
definitely not disappointed.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.750
To me, it was such a completely
non-conceptual, very concrete

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.570
like here's the things
that these practices,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.890
and techniques, and
ways of thinking do.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.640
Not just the stress
reduction, which

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.144
is obviously very nice, and
especially now as a new father,

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:58.560
I really appreciate
the techniques

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.520
that can reduce stress.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.220
But even other kind of crazy
things-- thank you [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.652
Other experiences,
too, that I wouldn't

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:13.385
have thought-- much more kind
of subtle and just interesting

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.990
and fun to have.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.360
Those kinds of experiences
were there, too.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.220
Greeting me there was Kashi.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.110
And I haven't told
you this before,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.819
but many very nice people
there at the center-- this

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.360
is the Art of Living
center in India.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.300
So there's hundreds of people
there running the place.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.410
Everybody's very nice.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.070
But you alone were
really genuine

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.240
and genuinely interested in
who I was and what I was doing.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210
And it was such a warm welcome.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.410
Coming from a different country
to stay for a few months,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.930
it was a big deal for me.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.190
Kashi was there after
having graduated

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.040
from IIT Mumbai, which I looked
up on "Wall Street Journal"

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.220
this morning, said it's arguably
harder to get into the IITs,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.010
any of the IITs, than it
is to MIT or to Harvard.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.550
So very impressive
school system.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.990
So not only a deep,
deep knowledge

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.500
of what you're
going to hear about,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.364
but also this tremendous brain.

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:10.780
So I thought that
was very Googly.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.900
I think that's pretty much all
I wanted to say in introduction.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.270
Well, more things about him.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.190
He's been teaching a lot.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.525
So he's taught-- not just like
a number that I'm making up,

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:25.900
but a literal
number, if you were

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.540
to count the people--
over 500,000 people

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.970
in various techniques through
the "Art of Living" programs.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.480
If you're interested--
and I don't

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.355
know if he's going to--
if he talks about any

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.430
of the techniques during
this talk, some of them

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.180
are offered in a program
that we have here

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.534
called Sky Meditation.

00:02:40.534 --> 00:02:42.200
So you don't even
have to go off campus,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.320
if you're in Mountain View,
to get involved with that.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.120
And what might be the
go link if you wanted

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.985
to know about Sky Meditation?

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:48.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.456
MARK BALL: Oh, OK,
go/SkyMeditation.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:52.330
Kashi.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.960
DINESH KASHIKAR: Thank you.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.380
Thank you, Mark.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.170
So the topic of what
I'm going to speak today

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.190
is about pouring water on your
table and still able to smile.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.920
There a lot of things
that the universe

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.812
throws at us which
transforms the way

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:22.990
we think about the world, which
affects the way we function.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.450
But each of us has an innate
ability, or innate capability,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.070
of doing the reverse, of
having an impact on the world

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.736
rather than the universe
having an impact on us.

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.580
Through the ancient
times, people

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.550
thought about this,
medicated on this.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.890
And all that knowledge,
all that experience,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.780
is available to us today as the
Veda, or the Vedic tradition.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.930
As I went through college, I
experienced modern technology,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.450
but I had the good fortune
of having been brought up

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.160
in a family where the Vedic
traditions were followed, too.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.550
While I was in school, I didn't
really appreciate it so much.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.640
I knew there was something
to my background.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.900
But as I started looking
at technology more,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.980
as I start learning
about science more,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.089
I realized there are many
things that are common.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.910
And like Mark said,
after doing all

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.020
that, when I started
exploring inner technology,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.960
or the signs of the
spirits, so to speak,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.570
started learning about myself.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.430
I realized there's so many
things that we can really use.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.750
And that's what brought
me on this journey.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.540
So the talk today
is about my journey

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.060
through this whole--
the Vedic experience--

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.140
and how it was so relevant for
me, very practical for me, what

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.050
learnings we can take
from this, and how

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.270
it can be useful for
each one of us out here.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.020
Throughout this session, please
feel free to interrupt me.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.710
Ask questions at any time.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.790
I'm OK with that.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.910
At any point of time if
my accent is too Indian

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.230
and you don't
understand something,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.260
please feel free to smile.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.080
I'll understand.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.930
So the word Veda itself
comes from the Sanskrit

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.640
root [INAUDIBLE],
which means "to know."

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.680
We know our environment
through various means.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.500
Through the five
senses-- seeing,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.570
hearing, touching,
feeling, tasting.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.220
There's so much input that
happens to this nervous system.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.880
All of the methods of knowing
all the ways in which we

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.700
are knowing gets put together.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.510
All the knowledge
that we accumulate

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.810
comes together as the Veda.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.710
As more and more scientists
add to this body of knowledge,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.510
it grows vaster and vaster.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.200
Initially, when they
started printing books,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.410
books were a very
rare commodity.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.710
And then they started
getting stored in places.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.260
Very soon, there
were so many books

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.110
that there was a need
to categorize them.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.380
And the library system
came into existence.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.710
I don't know if people
still remember--

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.310
there's the Dewey Decimal
system of numbering books based

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.380
on the topic.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.550
So as the subjects
got vaster, they

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.500
started cataloguing
them and arranging them.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.050
That's what happened
in ancient India, too.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.850
And they called it "The Vedas."

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.360
They said, based on the kind of
knowledge, let's categorize it.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.860
So the first thing
they did was they

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.230
said, OK, there are four Vedas.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.200
Let's categorize
all this knowledge

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.720
and put it into four buckets.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.170
So the first bucket was
called the the "Rigveda."

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:12.264
The Rigveda is all about
the principles, or the,

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:14.610
for want of a better
word, principles.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.730
Then comes the Yajurveda,
which means the application

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.960
of those principles.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.030
Then comes the
Samaveda, which has

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.100
to do with the rhythm,
or the harmony,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.790
or the beauty, the music.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.460
And then comes the
Atharvaveda, which

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.960
is about our mundane existence,
about our day to day lives.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.690
So if you look at
knowledge, there

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.340
are different
types of-- e equals

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.350
mc squared was an equation.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.750
There are so many equations
that we learn in college

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.690
but hardly ever use later on.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.530
Maybe we all had to go through
differentiation and integration

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.100
calculus.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.380
And after the exam was
over, very few people

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.120
actually use it.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.440
Maybe you actually use it here.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.090
I have no idea.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.370
But if you look at it, there
are a lot of principles,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.815
and then there are application
of those principles.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.920
Some people are more interested
in ideation, in ideas.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.346
And some people are more
interested in application

00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:26.970
of those ideas.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.539
So those who are
more ideation, more

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.870
getting to the basic principles,
I would say they are Rigvedis.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.260
Their brain makeup is more
of the kind of Rigveda.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.560
And if you put them to
do something practical,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.400
it doesn't work.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.610
There are some people who
love to make things practical.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.740
Bring it down to existence.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.000
For example, if
you take a string,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.890
stretch it and
pluck it, it's going

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.650
to vibrate at a
certain frequency.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.490
If you change the length
of the string, the tension

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.130
of the string, the
material of the string,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.540
it's going to change the
frequency at which it vibrates.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.040
That's Rigveda, the principle.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.420
Someone said, OK,
this is the principle.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.960
Let's put six strings
on a piece of wood,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.140
put some frets and we
make it into a guitar.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.930
It's the same principle,
but it's now come down

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.810
into the form of a guitar.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.000
That's Yajurveda.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.030
A person who does the
research on the stress

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.420
and tension in the string has
nothing to do with the guitar.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.440
And a person who
makes the guitar,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.050
he just needs to
know the equations.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.150
He's not worried
about how it works.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.410
If I have a phone,
most probably I

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.250
would look at the
features inside it.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.240
A person who's
designing the phone

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.231
would probably look at all the
processes that go behind it.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.570
You give me a guitar, I
can probably make sound.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.070
But if I have to create music,
I need to know how to play it.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.830
So even if you have
something very practical,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.200
unless we know how
to create music,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.020
that's another level of knowing.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.350
I can appreciate good
music, but to create

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.340
that music needs another skill.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.770
And that skill is the
Samaveda, how to create music.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.130
How to create harmony.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.000
When I say music, it
doesn't mean just music,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.460
but how to use that practical
knowledge and create harmony,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.340
make it beautiful.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.010
Different types of music
affect us in different ways.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.030
If someone plays some
tune, you probably

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.380
want to stand up and dance.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.070
Some other music makes
you feel, OK, I just

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.190
want to close my eyes and relax.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.290
Impact of that knowledge
on the human psyche,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.430
that's a different
ball game altogether.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.500
There are people who
make great music,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.710
and there are people who
can analyze that music.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.260
So in this example,
if you look at it,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.430
the equations of the stretched
string, that's Rigveda.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.930
Creating the guitar
was the Yajurveda.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.330
The Samaveda is how to
make music out of it.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.490
And what impact
does that music have

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.238
on people, groups of people,
that's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.600
Each of us usually has one or
a couple of these capabilities.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.150
Some of us are great at ideas,
not good at implementing.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.480
Some of us are great
managers, but not very

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.450
good at creating harmony.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.350
Some people can get
groups of people together,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.240
make it all work.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.250
But if you have to do something
practical, it doesn't work.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.940
And some people are at the
front and can look at the impact

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.130
that this is going
to have on people

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.880
and make decisions
according to that.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.910
So if we look at all these
four aspects of knowing,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.450
it translates to how
we live our life.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.200
Sometimes, we have one
of these Vedas in excess.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.790
Others, we don't have.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.630
And we wonder, why
am I not progressing?

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.100
What is it that I
need to focus on?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.790
So if you look at these four
Vedas, then it gives us a clue.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.900
Where can I put some attention?

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.650
Where do I need to move ahead?

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.410
Maybe you're great at
harmonizing with people,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.500
but ideation might
not be so good.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.360
So there are two
things we can do.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.100
They said if you have
to learn these Vedas,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.810
if you have to become
proficient in the Vedas,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.630
they said there
are six Vedangas.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.267
There are six
aspects to this Veda.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.200
The six limbs of the Veda.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.970
Anga means "limb."

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.690
For example, if I have
a body, but the hands

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.790
enable me to do
something with them.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.790
I might have a great
idea, but to type it out,

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.280
I need my fingers.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.490
I use my legs to take my body
from one place to another.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:38.010
So in that sense, the limbs help
the body to function properly.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.000
And this is what
the Vedangas do.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.830
The Angas starts with Shiksha.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.330
Shiksha means how
to create the sound.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.800
When I say something when
I'm speaking something,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.990
I'm creating sound.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.310
And if I need to
communicate properly,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.610
if I need to
understand properly,

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:09.630
first I need to go into the
root of-- so creating the sound.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.920
Then comes Nirukta,
or how to put

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.905
sounds together to create words.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.810
Then comes Vyakarana, or
how do I put words together

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.830
to create sentences.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.520
Then comes Chandas, what is
the rhythm in the sentence.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.260
The same sentence, when
I speak in a certain way,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.320
creates a certain impact.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.936
Spoken in another way, it
creates another impact.

00:14:38.936 --> 00:14:39.560
The intonation.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.150
Hello.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.230
Hello.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.970
It's just one word,
but the way we speak

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.230
it conveys much more sense.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:15:00.150
So how do I convey sense
using-- Then comes Jyotisha.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.200
Jyotisha is the impact of time.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.760
Getting the timing right is
the key to communication,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.360
the key to knowledge.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.720
How do I-- if I can
get my timing right,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.430
then I get the results.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.400
And the sixth one is
Kalpa, or the context.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.650
When we take care of all
these six aspects of the Veda,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:30.050
of knowing, then we are
able to polish our knowing,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.790
so to speak.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.690
Some of these seem
to be quite obvious--

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.820
how to make the sound.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.985
But there is a big
science behind it.

00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:48.730
You know, a lot of times, fights
begin with "but I told you."

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.250
I thought I said something.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.720
Someone else thought they
heard something else.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.890
And that's where the
misunderstanding starts.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.080
So this communication
is the key to knowledge.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.050
And when we can look
at all these aspects,

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.630
that increases all these
four aspects of knowing,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.010
which is the Rigveda, Yajurveda,
Samaveda, Atharvaveda.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.260
OK.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.170
There are all these things.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.650
But all of this seems to
be very impractical to me.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.440
How do I do it?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.720
What is it that I can do?

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.410
So then they said
there are six version,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:36.300
six ways of seeing this, six
ways of experiencing this.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.060
So the first darshana is Nyaya.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.190
Now, [INAUDIBLE]
realized that there

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.360
are different types of people.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.040
You can't say the same
thing to everyone.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.600
When I came into this-- when
all of us came into this hall,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:59.510
and I started speaking,
everyone was looking intently.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:05.230
Maybe some of the people
up there on the live stream

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.640
were watching.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.390
And then, after some
time, some of us

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.579
were very interested-- oh,
yeah, I want to know more.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.300
Some of us were
waiting, OK, let's

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.119
come to the practical aspects.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.274
Then we'll start listening.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.060
So each of us has a
different mindset.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.300
So [INAUDIBLE] said,
the Vedic scholar

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.100
said, let's address all
these mindsets separately.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.350
So the first one is
called Nyaya, or logic.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.940
There are some people
who are logical,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.880
who need a reason
for everything.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.220
Someone comes and says, oh,
this meditation is excellent.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.534
And the question
is, OK, who says so?

00:17:49.534 --> 00:17:50.450
Where is the research?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.530
Where are the testimonials?

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.810
I want proof.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.270
So some of our minds work
proof and logic, Nyaya.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.100
There is conversely
another attitude

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.330
which says it doesn't matter
what everyone is saying,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.390
I want to know for myself.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.720
Unless I experience it,
it's going to be no use.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.720
That is Vaisheshika, vaishesha.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.980
"Vaishesha" means
"special" or "knowing."

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.810
So the first darshana
is Nyaya, or logic.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:28.890
And the second is Vaisheshika,
or personal experience.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.200
Now if you look at
people around you,

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.720
there are some people
who need logic,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.890
some people who need
to have testimonials,

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.250
who need to have proof.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.220
And there are some people
who base their life

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.907
on experience-- I want to know.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:49.240
If you talk to a Nyaya person
in a Vaisheshika manner,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.050
a person who likes
logic and you tell them,

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.050
no, no, you sit
here and experience.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.560
He says, no, I'm not interested.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.860
And if a person is interested
in Vaisheshika, in experience,

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.244
and you throw numbers and facts
and figures at them, they say,

00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:07.410
all this doesn't impress me.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:13.910
Show me the result.
Nyaya and Vaisheshika.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.930
Then comes Yoga and Samkhya.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.290
Samhkya-- "Samhkya"
means counting.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.410
And Yoga means uniting.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.820
When we count, we are analyzing.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.270
OK, there are two
categories of people

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.540
in this room-- male and female.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.140
There are people with long
hair, short hair, no hair.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.060
So we can categorize.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.170
Some people like to
see the differences--

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.290
how is this different from me?

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.130
And some people like
to see the union-- what

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.230
is there that's common?

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.700
And the last one is
Mimamsa and Vedanta.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.760
Some people love rituals.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.950
When you get to your
office, you want your things

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.460
in a certain manner.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.020
If you look at people's desktop,
you probably can make an idea.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.300
Some people have all kinds of
things put in folders somewhere

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.400
deep down.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.875
And some people have all
their files on the desktop.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.070
You know, when I was in college,
I used to stay in a hostel.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:44.070
And my friend who used to
stay in the next room, one

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.580
day his mother visited.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.770
She came to his room, and she
saw that it was very creativity

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.270
organized.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.180
So she thought she
would do him a good turn

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.300
and she arranged everything,
put everything in place,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.770
folded all the clothes,
put them nicely.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.902
When he came back, he told-- he
said, Mom, you've spoiled it.

00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:10.690
It's all chaotic now.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.150
I can't find what is where.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.400
Some people find order in chaos.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.570
Some people find that without
order, there is chaos.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.280
So when we recognize
these different ways

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.365
of looking at
knowledge, then we're

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:31.430
able to appreciate the other
person's point of view.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.830
And to do all this,
first what is required

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.210
is that the mind
needs to be settled.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.830
And the mind is
so agitated, then

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.260
it's very difficult to
perceive all these aspects,

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.050
to appreciate these
other aspects.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.390
And that's where the techniques
of yoga, the part of yoga,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.710
evolved as a method
of implementing,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.470
of acquiring this knowledge.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:09.930
If you notice, the whole of our
life, the quality of our life,

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.430
depends in a certain way
on the state of the mind.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.850
We all might be in the same
situation, yet each of us

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.652
reacts to it differently.

00:22:22.652 --> 00:22:24.110
Because each of us
are individuals.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.850
So if we can do something
about the state of the mind,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.330
then it makes a
great difference.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.070
For example, you are here
sitting in front of me

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.090
and hearing, seeing.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.590
Hopefully.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.150
And you're listening
to me speaking.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.930
But if you actually look at it,
the experience of those words

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.220
is happening inside the mind.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.600
I might touch this podium.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.800
The podium is there, but
what I'm experiencing

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.860
is actually inside.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.590
The touch happens inside.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.470
So if you look at
it, all perception

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.090
is actually happening inside.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.310
Even though, whether the objects
are there outside or not,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.380
but the experience
of the objects

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.920
is happening in the mind.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.910
And therefore, when
we can have an impact

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:27.710
on the state of the mind, it can
change the experience, how we

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.060
experience the world outside.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.370
The techniques of yoga
help us to go into that.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:38.730
And that's why, even
though we might not

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.010
be able to change
what is there outside,

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.426
we can definitely change
the experience of that

00:23:43.426 --> 00:23:45.830
which is outside.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.780
And by changing
that experience, we

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.360
change the way we
interact with the world.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.070
Have you noticed,
sometimes what people

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.890
say seems to have a great
impact on the state of our mind.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.720
Someone says something,
we get upset,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.580
and then it takes a long time
for us to come out of it.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.910
But with these techniques,
we're able to reduce that impact

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.000
and increase these efficiency.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.300
When I was in
college, I always felt

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:22.400
that I needed about
28 hours every day.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.280
I was playing soccer
for my college, theater.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.800
I did hundreds of things.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:39.210
And one day, one of my friends
said, come do these things.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.800
And I said, OK, let's see.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.510
We'll find out how it works.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.510
I gave my experience.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.880
And then, when I
started meditating,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.000
suddenly I realized
it was so effective

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.765
that I got more time every day.

00:24:57.675 --> 00:25:02.280
My sleep reduced without having
any impact on my efficiency.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.730
And that's how I started
knowing more, studying more.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.960
And then I started sharing.

00:25:11.452 --> 00:25:12.660
Have you had this experience?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.950
Sometimes you're
sleeping at night.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:21.700
And in the morning, it seemed
as if the body has woken up,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.940
but the mind has
not yet woken up.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.750
The body starts fidgeting,
but you say, OK,

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.192
let me sleep for a
little more time.

00:25:32.192 --> 00:25:33.150
Someone did a research.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.290
They said, oh, let's
find out how much time

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.490
is ideal to sleep.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.070
They asked a lot of people.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.600
And finally, they figured out
that the ideal amount of time

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.670
to sleep is five more minutes.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.820
It doesn't matter
how much you sleep.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.390
You press the snooze button
and say, just five minutes.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.505
Those five minutes seem
to be really precious.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.000
So if you'll notice the kind of
lifestyle that we're leading,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.590
maybe 50 years back, most of
our work was physical in nature.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.540
But today, most of our work
seems to be mental in nature.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.870
The amount of input
that comes to our mind

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.670
has increased with
the internet, phones.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.270
There used to be a time when
you would walk out of house,

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.920
and you were not contactable.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.020
You were free.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.817
But today, wherever you
go, something follows you.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.600
What better place to
say this then here?

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.570
Somehow, information--
the amount

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.180
of information that's there
today, that's available

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.460
and that goes into
our nervous system--

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.870
has increased tremendously.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.140
But at the same time, the
amount of physical activity

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.550
that happens in the body,
that seems to have reduced.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.790
And this imbalance
creates an imbalance

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.000
in our resting patterns in
a certain way, I would say.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.600
And that's where the
techniques of meditation,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.350
which enable us to rest deeply,
can make such a big impact

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.940
on our system, that can help
bring back this balance.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:47.090
And that really is
Veda-- the knowing.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.525
That enhances our knowing.

00:27:50.525 --> 00:27:55.450
Have you noticed that
our-- the way we know,

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.850
the way we interact
with our environment,

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.050
the efficiency seems
to keep changing.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.820
At some point-- some
people are morning people.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.930
Get up in the morning fresh,
and by the end of the day,

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:13.150
you just want to-- but there
are, conversely, other people

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.920
who are not morning people.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.540
Very difficult to get up in
the morning, but late at night,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.530
you tell me how much
to work, I can work.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.200
But during the
day, mornings not.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.810
So each one of us has different
cycles, different rhythms.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.480
And if you can work
with these rhythms,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.860
then that can enhance
our knowing, our Veda.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.010
Enhance all these
aspects of the Veda.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.890
Whether it's the
principles, the Rigveda.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.710
There's the application,
the Yajurveda.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.230
Whether it's the harmony,
or the music, or the rhythm.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.340
This is the Samaveda.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.140
Or whether it's the mundane
aspect of knowledge,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.070
knowing what to do, how
to interact with people.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:05.420
All these aspects build up as
we do all the meditation, all

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.750
these practices.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:13.150
That's why I would say, if
these practices might not

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.500
have been relevant, so
relevant 50 years ago.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.740
But with the increase
in our information,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.650
it becomes all the more
relevant in today's age.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:30.910
So I would like to present
before everyone-- if it's OK,

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.300
we'll do a short meditation
and a breathing technique which

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.660
you can take home with
you, take back with you

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.030
from this session, that
you can practice regularly.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.900
You know, anything,
any technique,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.800
when you practice a little bit
more, it increases [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.580
You're able to do it better.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.650
For example, we
learned how to ride

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.910
a bicycle when we were small.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.010
But the first time we
sat on the bicycle,

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.580
it probably felt
as if, not for me.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.960
But doing it a couple
of times, slowly it

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:09.540
became so natural that today we
can ride one, if we ride one,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.880
without even thinking about it.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.720
So the rest of this
session, I'm going

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.630
to talk a little bit about
techniques-- some things

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.840
that we can do to
improve or enhance

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:28.430
the state of how we feel so that
all these aspects of knowledge

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.890
can blossom.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:37.441
So let's start with just shaking
the hands wherever we are.

00:30:37.441 --> 00:30:39.630
If you're sitting too
close to each other,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.330
and you can shift
a little bit, make

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.920
sure you have space around you.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.080
And relax.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.120
Let's roll our shoulders.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.060
And in the opposite direction.

00:31:10.964 --> 00:31:13.960
And relax.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.470
If you have space
around you, you

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.380
can take your arms to the sides.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.620
And pull the fingers
towards yourself.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.380
Spread the fingers a
little wider apart.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.300
Don't forget to breath.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.830
Keep pulling the fingers
towards yourself.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.780
Push away with the
palm, as if you're

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.965
trying to push the walls.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.055
If you look at me so seriously,
I feel really afraid.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.110
And release.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.990
Bring the hands down.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.020
Interlock the hands together,
the fingers together,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.810
and place them behind the head.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.450
Gently press the head
forward with the hands.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.420
Push the head forward
with the hands.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.600
With your head,
push the hands back.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.460
Nothing is moving.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.835
You're just feeling
the pressure.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.740
And as you breathe in, push
the elbows back a little bit.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.045
Stay there and keep breathing.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.370
And gently release the hands.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.110
Bring them down.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.950
With the right hand,
press the right side

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:44.000
of the head-- with your
right hand, or some hand.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.210
And gently press the head.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.240
With your neck, you're
resisting that pressure.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:58.350
It's OK to smile.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.370
And gently release the hand.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.934
Other side.

00:33:02.934 --> 00:33:04.250
A gentle pressure.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:14.060
Feeling the sensation on
the neck, in the upper back.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.740
And gently release the hands.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.169
Once again, let's
roll our shoulders.

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:22.085
Notice the difference.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.815
And in the opposite direction.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.135
And relax.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.695
Gently bring the ears
towards the shoulders.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.080
If you feel some discomfort,
do not go too much.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.590
Just do as much as you can.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.010
Keeping the neck straight,
look left and right.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.181
If you want to lose weight,
this is the perfect pose to do.

00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:07.710
Just do this when there's
food in front of you.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.960
And relax.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.480
Interlock the hands
in front of the chest.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.520
And this time,
twist a little bit.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.090
Breathing out,
twist to the side.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.010
Breathe in to center.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.780
Breathe out, twist to the side.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.230
Breathe in to center.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:39.650
Breathe out to the side,
breathe in to center.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.199
Breathe out to the
side, breathe in center

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.139
and come back to center, relax.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.860
Place the hands on the
knees in front of you.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.980
As you breathe in, look up.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.000
Push the chest forward.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.420
And as we exhale, let's
bring the chin to the chest,

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.630
arch the back behind us.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.800
Breathing in, look up.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.420
Push the chest forward.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.300
Exhale, arch the back.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.890
Bring the chin to the chest.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.610
Once again.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.310
Breathe in, look up.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:26.440
Exhale, arch the back,
bring the chin to the chest.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.430
And relax.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.220
Gently, as we breathe out,
let the shoulders move

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.250
to the right.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.490
Breathe in to center.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.780
Breathe out, bend a
little bit to the left.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.560
Breathe in to center.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.530
Breathe out to the right.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.950
Breathe in, center.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.390
Breathe out, left.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.520
Breathe in, center.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.280
And relax.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.050
The three major movements for
our spine-- front and back,

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.690
twisting, and sideways.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:11.180
If you can just do
these few things,

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.520
it helps to keep the spine
held in a certain way.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.910
A lot of times,
sitting in one posture,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.320
we do not do these movements.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.640
So just a few of
these movements can

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:31.050
help to relax a lot of the
muscle systems of the spine.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.270
And once the body is relaxed,
then it's easier to meditate.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.000
Otherwise what happens
when we start to meditate,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.990
then suddenly we
realize we have a body.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.700
If you're sitting for watching
a movie, three hours, two hours,

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.010
you can sit perfectly still.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.770
But when you sit for
meditation, in five minutes,

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.250
you say, oh, I have back pain.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.330
Which is why doing some gentle
movements like this, very

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.700
useful before a meditation.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.719
Then we'll go on to a
breathing technique.

00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:07.760
Now this is called,
variously, nadi [? sodhana ?]

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.680
and [? anuloma viloma, ?] or
alternate nostril breathing.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.700
Many ways in which to do it.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.140
But what this-- the way
we'll be doing it here

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:28.070
today, our whole purpose is to
breathe in from one nostril,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.450
breathe out from the other.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.783
Breathe in from one nostril,
breathe out from the other.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.880
Don't worry.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.860
We'll have some help.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.710
If you think only
superhumans can do that,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.500
I don't think I can-- like.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.400
So we're going to
use our fingers.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.650
Place our hands
in this position.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:57.730
It's like the thumb on the
right nostril, index finger

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.650
and middle finger in between
the eyebrows, and ring finger

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.760
and little finger, you can
bend them and place them

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.930
on the left nostril.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.330
So this is the position
for the fingers.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:17.860
Now, the middle two
fingers-- the index finger

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.040
and the middle finger--
gently touching

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.720
in between the eyebrows.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.050
So | want, in this technique,
all the five fingers

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.630
to touch the skin.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.470
And we'll move as
little as possible.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:38.200
So what we're going to do is
either increase the pressure

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.780
from the thumb or increase the
pressure with the ring finger.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.930
Without moving the
hands, it's just

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:48.830
going to change the pressure
and control the breath flow,

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.550
moving it either right or left.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:56.800
So let's keep our
hands in this position.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.440
With the eyes closed, breathe
in from both nostrils.

00:39:02.386 --> 00:39:04.975
Press the thumb, exhale left.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:15.370
Breathe in left,
and exhale right.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:24.380
Breathe in right,
and exhale left.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.520
Breathe in left.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.320
Continue at your own pace.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.120
Gentle breaths, moving the
hands as little as possible.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.639
Four more breaths
in this fashion.

00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:02.180
Put all your attention
on the breath.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.070
And after breathing
out from the left side,

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.495
we may relax the hands,
keep the eyes closed.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.670
Keeping the eyes closed,
let's bring our hands

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.875
onto the laps, palms
facing upwards.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.722
Gently, let's take
a deep breath in.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.035
And gently, exhale.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.340
Let's take the attention to
all the sounds around us,

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.540
keeping the eyes closed.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.016
The sounds of people walking
behind or talking, gentle

00:41:22.016 --> 00:41:22.515
sounds.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.620
Breathing in once again.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.770
And gently, let's breathe out.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.385
Allow the breath to go
in and out all by itself.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.480
Without changing the
flow of the breathe,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.350
just observe how the
breath is flowing.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:19.460
It might be long or
short, shallow or deep.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.216
Let there be a gentle
smile on the face,

00:42:26.216 --> 00:42:27.215
even if it's artificial.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.100
With a smile, breathe in.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.740
And breathe out with a smile.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.150
For a few minutes,
for a few seconds,

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.960
let's keep our body
as still as possible.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.550
The feet are still.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.490
The legs, knees, and thighs.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.020
The spine is still and erect.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.440
As the breath moves
in and out, there's

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.350
a rhythmic motion
happening all by itself.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.230
The hands are still.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.100
The neck is still.

00:43:41.016 --> 00:43:44.680
And let the whole body
be as still as possible.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.560
You might experience
a little discomfort.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.528
Just for the next few
seconds, let's be with that.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.820
For a little while,
nothing to do.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.130
Nothing to know.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:34.055
Just relax.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.529
Let go of all your
efforts, and relax.

00:45:14.688 --> 00:45:15.666
(CHANTING) Om.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:29.480
Loka samasta sukhino bhuvantu.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:44.420
Om shanti, shanti, shanti.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.210
Gently, let's take
another deep breath in.

00:46:06.707 --> 00:46:08.680
And slowly exhale.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.892
And slowly and gradually
become aware of the body

00:46:28.892 --> 00:46:29.600
and surroundings.

00:46:35.745 --> 00:46:40.420
And whenever we feel
like it, at our own pace,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.340
we may open our eyes.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.330
Take your own time.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.398
There's no hurry.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.560
Good morning.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.464
It just took a few minutes.

00:47:03.464 --> 00:47:09.270
Yet, after all that talk,
just a few minutes of eyes

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.520
closed felt so relaxing.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.000
And this is the power
of our own mind.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.950
And as we can explore
deeper and get

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.500
to know more about all these
aspects of ourself, something

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.490
that is so-- seems
inconsequential,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:33.900
can have great consequences.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.930
Something that starts
off very simple,

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.380
just moving the
shoulders, can eventually

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.500
have an impact on the mind.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.990
And this is the knowledge from
the Vedas, how all of this

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.740
is interconnected.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.030
It's like when you catch one
leg of the chair and pull,

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.240
all the other legs
come together.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.530
In that sense, all of this
knowledge, all the Vedas,

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.570
it has so much to offer us.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.700
And we start from somewhere,
with some small technique

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.910
somewhere, and that
opens up something

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.220
that is useful not
just for ourself,

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:25.380
but not interaction with--
it helps in so many ways.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.760
That's been my-- for
the last 20 years,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.450
I have been teaching
these techniques,

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:34.140
talking to people across
the world, traveling.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:39.280
And it's been so satisfying
to see all these techniques

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.645
having such an impact.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.280
So I love doing this,
and this is what I do.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.930
And I can go on and on and on,
because this is my passion.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:58.640
But I can see that we are almost
close to just five minutes away

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.240
from the end.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.740
It's been one hour that
we have been sitting here.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.586
It doesn't feel like it.

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:08.120
So if you have any
questions, anything to ask

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:12.052
or anything to say,
please feel free to.

00:49:12.052 --> 00:49:14.010
AUDIENCE: So I had a
question about the comment

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:19.090
that you made about doing
this while you're eating.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.090
And I know maybe
it's just a joke,

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:24.450
but I read some
research on the subject,

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.740
and I found that
not eating actually

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.512
causes people stress, people
who are trying to lose weight.

00:49:30.512 --> 00:49:31.470
DINESH KASHIKAR: Right.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.511
AUDIENCE: And so it's
actually counterproductive,

00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:36.174
because that stress causes
them to want to eat more.

00:49:36.174 --> 00:49:37.090
DINESH KASHIKAR: More.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:37.475
Right.

00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:38.891
AUDIENCE: And so
that's a problem.

00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:41.816
So I was wondering if
that's just a joke,

00:49:41.816 --> 00:49:43.720
or if you have a few
words to say on--

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.011
DINESH KASHIKAR: On not eating.

00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:45.929
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:45.929 --> 00:49:47.720
DINESH KASHIKAR: So,
yeah, in that context,

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.050
obviously I wanted to
lighten up the atmosphere,

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.010
and it was not part of my talk.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.090
But usually, when I
conduct a yoga session,

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:02.030
like some of these, it helps
to lighten up the atmosphere.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.880
That changes the
state of the mind.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.320
So yes, in that sense, it was
intended more as a bit levity

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.160
rather than
something so serious.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.950
In Sanskrit, there is a saying
which says [SPEAKING SANSKRIT].

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:20.240
It means excess of
anything is not good.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.530
So in that sense, I would
say moderation definitely

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:30.421
is the way to go, neither going
overboard nor going underboard.

00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:33.010
Yeah, you're right.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:34.457
AUDIENCE: I think
I read somewhere

00:50:34.457 --> 00:50:41.970
that your breath pattern follows
the quote unquote "moon cycle."

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.660
And so that's why you
breathe in from one nostril,

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.380
and it switches to the
other, and it repeats.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:55.510
And so when you
switch, artificially,

00:50:55.510 --> 00:51:01.097
how to breathe, what's
the significance of that?

00:51:01.097 --> 00:51:03.305
DINESH KASHIKAR: I'm sure
there are many studies that

00:51:03.305 --> 00:51:08.510
are happening, but
I would say there

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.570
are a lot of aspects
of own physiology

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.990
that we are still exploding.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.380
We really don't know
much about ourself,

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:23.950
and the envelope of knowledge
is increasing day by day.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.070
One thing which is a
very interesting study

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.860
is how our breath
patterns keep changing,

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.170
like you just mentioned.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.610
If you notice, sometimes
we feel one nostril

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:36.990
is more active than the other.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.140
And this keeps flipping.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.970
It keeps changing.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.340
What I have experienced by
doing all these practice,

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.530
especially the nadi sodhana,
the alternate nostril breathing,

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.570
is it helps to calm the
mind in a certain way.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.530
Of course, all this
is anecdotal evidence.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.820
More and more people who do
this find it easier to meditate.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.490
What happens during this thing?

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.645
I'm not a medical practitioner
nor a medical researcher,

00:52:04.645 --> 00:52:09.010
so I really don't know about
it, nor is it appropriate

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.620
for me to comment about it.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:13.610
But as a yoga teacher,
I've seen this technique

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.615
used very effectively
before a meditation.

00:52:15.615 --> 00:52:20.050
It helps the mind to calm
down and to be more balanced.

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:24.780
So I would hazard a guess,
I would say that, you know,

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.860
breathing in different
patterns helps

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.590
to make an impact on
the state of the mind.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.910
Usually some of the
questions that I get asked

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:37.610
is, after this, it's easy to
come and sit here and meditate

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.780
when you're giving instructions.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.890
But how do I do it on my own?

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.990
Usually, when I sit on my own,
my mind goes here and there.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:49.800
So one takeaway-- oh,
was that a question?

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.360
That's why, in this session,
one takeaway that I thought

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.180
we could put together is we
actually created an Android

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.140
app, where we have all
these instructions,

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.140
and you can have a meditation
timer, so to speak.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.720
So it helps you to meditate
and track your meditation.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.910
And that's what you
see up out there.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:19.120
It says android:
sattva-meditation timer.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.390
So this is called the
sattva meditation timer.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:24.800
It helps to-- so there are
some instructions there,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.749
and you can use the app and
do your meditation by yourself

00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:30.665
with the instructions.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.360
A good time to do it is before
breakfast, before lunch,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.720
before dinner, when the
stomach is not full.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.160
Usually if the stomach is
full and you close your eyes,

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.090
it's a very potent combination.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.220
So it's a good idea to do this.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.140
Even if you do it for
about a few minutes,

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.732
5 or 10 minutes
regularly, every day,

00:53:53.732 --> 00:53:54.940
it can make a big difference.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.890
Meditation, I would
say, is not a quick fix.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:04.450
It's not that, OK, I want to
have higher efficiency today,

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.550
so let me meditate today.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:11.970
There's no point digging the
well when the house is on fire.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.160
But if you dig your
well and keep it ready,

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.450
then even if there
is a fire, you

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.010
have the means to put it out.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.140
And that really is what
meditation is all about.

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.990
It's more a preventive
rather than a cure.

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:28.180
And, in fact, in
the "Yoga Sutras,"

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.090
one of the texts
on yoga, Patanjali

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.410
says that [SPEAKING SANSKRIT].

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.140
The whole purpose of
all these techniques

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:41.760
is to remove the misery
that has not yet come.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.510
So in a sense, regular
practice of all these things

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:51.360
can have an impact on the mind
and can make a big difference

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.110
to the way we live our life.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.720
So just summarizing,
once again, the four

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:04.110
Vedas-- the four ways of looking
at knowledge, whether it's

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:09.050
ideation, management,
creating harmony out of that,

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:13.160
or making it very practical
to day to day life.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:17.980
And to do that, we have
the six Vedangas-- the way

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:23.300
to improve communication
through sound, words, grammar,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:28.820
through the intonation, the
rhythm, through the timing

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.530
and through the context.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.550
And then, the six
darshanas, or the ways

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.050
of looking at this knowledge.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:43.050
Nyaya-- logic,
practical experience.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:47.450
Yoga and Samkhya--
analysis versus synthesis.

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:51.590
And Mimamsa and Vedanta, or
getting into rituals, getting

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:55.240
caught up in one form
of thinking, or allowing

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.760
the freedom to happen.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.990
So recognizing all these
aspects and developing

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.970
all these aspects.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.280
Where you need to have
order, you need order.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.240
And where you need to
think out of the box,

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.950
you need to think
out of the box.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:11.030
So developing all
these aspects, which

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:13.220
is what all the
techniques do, which

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.610
is what all the meditation,
all these things

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:20.220
allow us all the abilities
of the mind to develop.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.760
And that's why the
practical techniques.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.160
So I enjoyed being
here with all of you.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.880
I hope all of you also
enjoy being here with me.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.140
And maybe it's
useful in some way.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:39.510
I know one hour is too short
a time to really do justice

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:42.690
to such a vast topic.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:46.910
And I hope we can meet
sometime, any time.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.570
Do feel free to
follow up on this.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:53.220
Mark is here in Google, and
he does some very interesting

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.140
things.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.950
So there's that
go/SkyMeditation.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:56.910
Oh, I should--

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.710
MARK BALL: Thank you, Kashi.

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.460
