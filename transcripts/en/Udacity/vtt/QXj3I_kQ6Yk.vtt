Now, if you clicked on the discussion link

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.590
for this question, you would've found that it's a

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.870
reference to the book, The Hitchhikers's Guide to

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.440
the Galaxy, in which case, the answer was 42.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.110
&gt;&gt; Now, if you ever have a question that you don't

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.590
know how to answer it, go to the discussion board and look

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.170
at the forums. Ask the question there, see if somebody else

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.990
has the same question. You could also check out the instructor's notes.
