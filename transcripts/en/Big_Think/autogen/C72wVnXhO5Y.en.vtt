and are put our book argues that if you

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199
and are put our book argues that if you
 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.990

places into personal lives but
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.780
places into personal lives but
everywhere into public lives and so the

everywhere into public lives and so the
 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.549
everywhere into public lives and so the
two don't necessarily contradict each

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
two don't necessarily contradict each
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410
two don't necessarily contradict each
other like that in terms of the numbers

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
other like that in terms of the numbers
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.630
other like that in terms of the numbers
inside America I think those are really

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
inside America I think those are really
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.240
inside America I think those are really
interesting if you most them we've gone

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
interesting if you most them we've gone
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.619
interesting if you most them we've gone
through if you look underneath the

through if you look underneath the
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450
through if you look underneath the
headline numbers what seems to be

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
headline numbers what seems to be
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670
headline numbers what seems to be
happening is a two-phase thing on the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680

believers are definitely pushing towards
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660
believers are definitely pushing towards
more towards atheism on the other side

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
more towards atheism on the other side
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789
more towards atheism on the other side
the people who are believers tend to be

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
the people who are believers tend to be
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980

extent you have a polarization between
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749
extent you have a polarization between
those two and I think what's interesting

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
those two and I think what's interesting
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880
those two and I think what's interesting
about that is that possibly it means

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
about that is that possibly it means
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830
about that is that possibly it means
that religion those people imagine

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

going to care much more and actually to
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.380
going to care much more and actually to
some extent what seems to be happening

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
some extent what seems to be happening
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.060

in the reception of people like Dawkins

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840
in the reception of people like Dawkins
 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360

and Christopher Hitchens and people like
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.280
and Christopher Hitchens and people like
that but I think what's also interesting

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
that but I think what's also interesting
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.500
that but I think what's also interesting
about Dawkins and Kristen oceans is that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
about Dawkins and Kristen oceans is that
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.149
about Dawkins and Kristen oceans is that

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.129
think you've won the argument and what's
really interesting from a big global

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139
really interesting from a big global
 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.550
really interesting from a big global
perspective is I think for most of the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
perspective is I think for most of the
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.429
perspective is I think for most of the
20th century the elite the global elite

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439

with secularization and America was seen
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.719
with secularization and America was seen
as an outlier a slightly strange thing

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:15.729
as an outlier a slightly strange thing
 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.339
as an outlier a slightly strange thing
but in the end it would come in and

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349
but in the end it would come in and
 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.289
but in the end it would come in and
what's happening and very much what our

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
what's happening and very much what our
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.849
what's happening and very much what our
book is about is you look around the

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859
book is about is you look around the
 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.710
book is about is you look around the
world at the moment the more modern lots

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
