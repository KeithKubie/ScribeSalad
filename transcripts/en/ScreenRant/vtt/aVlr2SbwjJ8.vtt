00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.360
As The Force Awakens has introduced dozens
of new characters to the Star Wars universe,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.930
fans can’t help but wonder how many of them
are exactly what they seem.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.410
And if their true identities are much more
interesting, how many of them will be revealed

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.939
in the coming films?

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.699
Fan theories have ranged from convincing to
ridiculous, with the true identities of Rey,

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.880
the Jedi hero in The Force Awakens, and Supreme
Leader Snoke being two of the most debated.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.730
To fill you in on the best – and worst – theories,
we’re going to run through some of the most

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.340
popular suspicions from commenters on Screen
Rant.com.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.680
Needless to say, we’ll be SPOILING Star
Wars: The Force Awakens, so you have been

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.670
warned.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
Rey

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.670
The identity of Rey’s parents is almost
definitely a key detail – not only because

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.310
she’s the latest in a line of powerful Force
users, but because they’ve apparently abandoned

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.719
her on a backwater planet without being given
a last name that we know of.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.659
Assuming her parents weren’t pure evil,
fans have argued that Rey – which may or

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.800
may not be her real name – was stashed for
her own safety.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.640
And that means her parents could have been
prime targets – for good or bad.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.410
The Youngest Skywalker

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.420
With the Star Wars saga following the Skywalker
family to this point, introducing Luke Skywalker’s

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.680
daughter as the new star would keep the cycle
alive.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.710
There’s a lot of evidence, too: Rey hears
Luke and Anakin’s lightsaber calling out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.010
to her – not just in any voice, but her
own cries when her unseen parents left her

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.610
behind on Jakku.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.000
When she touches the saber, she envisions
sights and sounds key to the Skywalker family.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.931
Not to mention the revelation that in her
darkest hours, she pictures an island in the

00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:55.610
middle of an ocean – probably the same ocean
where she eventually finds an older Luke Skywalker.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.210
Could the daughter’s Force powers have been
calling to her father the entire time?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.890
It’s possible that Rey is just a student
of Luke Skywalker’s, but with Luke’s life

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.890
a total mystery, and the Force especially
powerful in his bloodline, a stronger bond

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340
looks likely.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.530
Sister of Ren

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.420
As Yoda told fans in the original series,
“There is another” Skywalker aside from

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.150
the bearded Jedi.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.310
Since Leia is shown to have had a son with
Han Solo, who says the two couldn’t have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.890
had a daughter?

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.890
In the extended universe novels, Leia and
Han had multiple children, one of whom fell

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.370
to the dark side just like Kylo Ren.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.280
The theory would explain why Kylo can sense
that the mystery girl helping the Resistance

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.800
is important, even claiming that “he feels
it too” when mentally linking with Rey.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.790
It would add a deeper meaning to Rey and Leia’s
first meeting, not to mention Rey and Han’s

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.510
relationship, especially if the old smuggler
agreed to keep their bond a secret, knowing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.069
Kylo would come looking for his younger sister.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.760
Star Wars fans have seen a brother and sister
join forces already, but could the new trilogy

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.100
see them go head-to-head, determining once
and for all whether the Light Side or Dark

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.090
Side will come out on top?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.730
Another Kenobi in Hiding

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.550
His padawan Anakin may have been the first
Jedi to fall in love despite the Order’s

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.050
rules against attachment, but the Clone Wars
series showed that Obi-Wan Kenobi had just

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.069
as much to give – especially once the Order
was destroyed, and he went into hiding.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.740
This theory claims that Obi-Wan had a child
who knew to keep the family name a secret

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.990
from the Empire, eventually hiding their own
child on Jakku.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.319
There’s not much evidence to support this
one, but the mirrored stories are too good

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.349
to ignore.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.210
If it’s true, Rey would be returning Anakin’s
lightsaber to Luke, just as her grandfather

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.709
gave it to him decades before.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.349
Where Anakin’s grandson Kylo Ren fights
for the Dark Side, Obi-Wan’s granddaughter

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.130
rises to defeat him.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.599
Aside from making Anakin and Obi-Wan the heart
of the entire series, it would open the door

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.970
to Kenobi’s bloodline, not Skywalker’s,
producing the Chosen One prophesied to bring

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.190
balance to The Force.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.819
It’s a bit less likely, but seeing Luke
train the grandchild of his own mentor?

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.470
That might even be a better way of bringing
the story full circle.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.769
Anakin Reincarnated

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.340
Okay, this one is a bit crazier – but still
could be true.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.020
According to Anakin’s mother, her son didn’t
have a father – he was a child born out

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.020
of the Force.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.210
It explained his powers, and his mission to
destroy the Sith… but the First Order and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.520
Empire lived on.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.560
So what if the Force made another child?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.879
Or, more specifically, gave Anakin a second
chance?

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.400
As Rey, the child would have the same force
powers and knack for spaceship mechanics that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.490
she demonstrates all the time, and touching
Anakin’s lightsaber would bring emotions

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.949
and memories flooding back.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.330
The studio has promised a satisfying answer
that will call back to the very start of the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.509
saga, and a second Chosen One with Anakin’s
gifts would do the trick.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.580
Supreme Leader Snoke

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.939
Those are just a few of the theories concerning
the identity of the newest Star Wars Force

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.800
User, but the big bad villain is just as important.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.979
Assuming that Supreme Leader Snoke is an adopted
title (like most Star Wars villains), fans

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.270
can’t help but imagine which existing characters
Snoke might actually be – even if the cast

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.039
maintains he’s a new character.

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:34.330
And the 
theories are just as much fun to imagine.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.559
The Operator

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.279
The old Star Wars novels were thrown out of
canon, but were replaced just as quickly.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.010
“Star Wars Aftermath” introduced a few
characters before they appear in The Force

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.840
Awakens, but one mystery leader has fans talking.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.220
Known only as ‘The Operator,’ and believed
to be a former Imperial Admiral presumed dead,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.479
the figure is more ruthless than any Imperial
before him.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.029
He’s even willing to leak information to
the Resistance, letting other officers be

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.800
ambushed and killed to make the Empire stronger
or more devoted.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.150
Fans have seen how the new First Order is
likely a result, and have wondered if ‘The

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.889
Operator’ eventually takes the name Snoke
to lead the order himself.

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.119
Darth Plagueis

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.789
When Palpatine was trying to seduce Anakin
Skywalker to the Dark Side in Revenge of the

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.439
Sith, he told him a story of his own master,
Darth Plagueis.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.249
But even the knowledge of how to prevent death
or create life couldn’t keep Plagueis alive

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:34.400
when his apprentice rose up to kill him, and
take a servant Sith of his own.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.160
But what if Plagueis was only disfigured?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.889
Could he live on in secret, waiting to undo
his apprentice’s plan, and take a new student

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:42.889
in Kylo Ren?

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.839
It would explain Snoke’s alien size and
appearance, and his injuries.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:52.860
Maybe having died and resurrected himself
was Plagueis’ last challenge?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.219
The Grand Inquisitor

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.449
As fans of Star Wars Rebels already know,
Darth Vader and the Emperor didn’t hunt

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.810
down Force Users themselves: they hired Inquisitors
to do the job.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.699
Leading the group was the Grand Inquisitor,
directly serving Vader as his best Force-using

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:08.699
Jedi-hunter.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.139
He actually looks like Snoke, but was implied
to have died in the show.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.759
But as Star Wars fans know, death is never
permanent.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.759
Grand Moff Tarkin

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.110
It’s a long shot, but we have to include
our own theory about Snoke’s identity.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.860
In short, he’s the broken, rebuilt, and
more determined than ever Grand Moff Tarkin,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.669
Darth Vader’s former superior officer and
the villain of the first Star Wars.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.460
Tarkin has the smarts to be both The Operator
and Snoke, assuming he wasn’t killed in

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.710
the Death Star explosion.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.460
It’s an outlandish theory, but if the new
Star Wars team is going to bring back an existing

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.939
character, why not start with the best?

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:51.820
That’s our breakdown of the most convincing,
or most entertaining theories on Snoke and

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.710
Rey’s identities in the new Force Awakens
trilogy.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.750
But what do you think?

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.029
Have we missed any possible answers?
