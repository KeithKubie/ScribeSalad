00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Next question comes from Thomas,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and his question has to do with mistakes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Basically, you never seem to make any--at least in the videos.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Maybe you can talk a little bit about your design process in coming up

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with these lectures and how mistakes figure in there.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is always a trade off of how many mistakes we want to leave in,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and believe me, I make lots of them.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I make them at various points in time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So as I'm first thinking up the questions we're going to do, I'm coding up answers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I make mistakes there in a couple of ways.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One is, I just make errors.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I write something. It computes the wrong answer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It generates an error.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I swapped the order of two arguments, or I pass the wrong thing in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm making those mistakes all the time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Those aren't very interesting ones, so I don't show them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And then, when I'm recording the videos, I make mistakes there too.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And, sometimes errors have crept into the program

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that I didn't notice when I was developing them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I didn't write enough test cases, and then I have to decide what to do.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And mostly, those have ended up on the cutting room floor.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, just as when you watch a movie or a TV show, you don't see most of the outtakes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Sometimes after the credits, they roll a few of the outtakes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So believe me the errors are there, we're not just showing most of them.
