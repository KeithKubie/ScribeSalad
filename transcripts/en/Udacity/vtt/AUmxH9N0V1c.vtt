00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.260
In lesson 7 we learned that the Y in mitochondrial chromosomes

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.900
can be used to trace both the maternal and paternal lines.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.120
&gt;&gt; But let’s do a quick recap to learn why the Y

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
can trace the paternal side and the mitochondria can trace the maternal side.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.290
&gt;&gt; All right, so let’s set up a little

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.000
scenario here, let’s imagine that I have biological children.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.750
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you, and I pass down my x chromosome, what sex will the

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.590
child be? Be a female, because the mother has two Xs so she can only

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.320
pass down the X. And you passed down an X,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.340
and so you have a child with two Xs. Baby girl.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.620
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Now, what happens if I pass down my Y chromosome?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.090
&gt;&gt; Well, the mother again only passes down the X and you gave a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.720
Y, and so an XY equals a baby boy. So you'd have a male child.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we can use this Y chromosome to trace back

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.420
father, to father, to father And that's how we trace the paternal line.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.840
&gt;&gt; And the mitochondria

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.100
are only passed down by the mother. So they trace your maternal line.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.040
&gt;&gt; Precisely. This means that if you're a male, you

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.670
can actually submit a DNA sample. And you'll get information

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.850
about your maternal and paternal lines because you have both

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.930
mitochondria and a Y chromosome. But if you're a female

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.690
you only have mitochondria. So you can't actually get your

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.980
paternal information just from your own DNA sample. You're going to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.510
have to use someone else in your family. I want

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.980
you to tell me, Which of the following relatives would

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.340
you not want to use if you're a female

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.290
and you want to get information about your paternal lineage?
