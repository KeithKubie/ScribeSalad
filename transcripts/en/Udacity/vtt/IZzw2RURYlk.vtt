00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.550
Well let's first find the point 1,3.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.689
I'm going to go over one.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.700
And up one, two, three.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.590
Okay.
So it has to be this stark blue one or

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.880
the green one.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.330
So which of these has a slope of two?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.947
Well slope of two means the rise is two,
so I can go up two and

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:20.500
the run on the run,
the run is one, over one.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.027
So that will take me here.

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:24.670
It looks like the stark
blue line is correct.
