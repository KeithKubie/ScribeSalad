[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:08.530
RICHARD: Buck!

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.686
BUCKINGHAM: Yeah.

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:11.060
RICHARD: A word
with you, sirrah.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.220
BUCKINGHAM: Dude,
what did you call me?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.240
Stop talking like that.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.530
RICHARD: Well, I have a
philosophical question.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.310
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, I love those.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.740
Go ahead.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.240
RICHARD: OK.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.519
Do think our social
station is circamountable,

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.310
or is it immutable?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.970
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, good question.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.930
Immutable.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.737
RICHARD: Uh, no, but
[LAUGHS] don't you

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.570
think we can overcome
our circumstance given

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.865
sufficient cunning and skill?

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:27.490
BUCKINGHAM: No.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.650
No, I don't.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.210
But I'm not like
you, yearning to fly

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.010
beyond nature's
boundaries like some sort

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.500
of disabled nerd Icarus.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.730
Anyway, why do you ask?

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.320
RICHARD: No reason,
Buckingham, Buck--

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.129
Barbie B. It's just that
I've got plans for a date.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.920
BUCKINGHAM: A date?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.430
You?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.450
Who's going to date you?

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.100
RICHARD: Well, I was thinking
of grabbing a date to the Sadie

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.430
Hawkins.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.646
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, I get it.

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.270
You think by going
to the dance, you'll

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.560
seem like less of a
creepy Renaissance

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.470
bear talking weirdo?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.270
RICHARD: Well, and I'll
rise past by circumstance.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.740
Yes.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.656
BUCKINGHAM: I like it.

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:55.940
I can help if you want.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.732
Oh, do you want to go
with me to the dance?

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.981
Not as like a date or whatever,
but as, like, friends?

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:00.820
RICHARD: Hmm.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.820
I'll pass.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.529
BUCKINGHAM: OK,
whatever, jerk face.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.070
It's not like I want to be the
matchy matchy disabled couple.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.260
RICHARD: Fine.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.120
BUCKINGHAM: Fine?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.040
OK.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.990
You do know this Sadie
Hawkins dance is where

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.550
the girl asks the guy out.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.330
Right?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.425
And I'm, like, the only
girl that talks you.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:18.300
RICHARD: That's fine.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.200
I was thinking of
going with Anne.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.730
BUCKINGHAM: Anne Margaret?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.510
But she's the most
popular girl in school.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.930
RICHARD: Formerly
the most popular.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.440
Eddie broke up with
her over winter break.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.110
BUCKINGHAM: So what?

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.651
She's still super
out of your league?

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.740
RICHARD: Is she, Buck?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.346
Is she?

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:31.720
Or maybe it's just
that you don't

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.928
know what league that I'm in.

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.760
[TIGHTENS BACKPACK STRAPS]

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.180
BUCKINGHAM: No.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.620
She's out of your league.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.250
She's hot.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.790
She's smart.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.870
She's super talented.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.940
You know she's a
quasi-professional dancer?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.190
RICHARD: Oh, but now she's
in wounded bird mode.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.690
See, if I can get her
to ask me to the dance,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.210
then I will instantly bolt past
my current inglorious station--

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.720
BUCKINGHAM: No, you won't.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.490
RICHARD: And for once,
people might see me.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.130
BUCKINGHAM: OK.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.120
[LAUGHS] Richard, if you had
to ask Anne to the dance,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.960
that would already be
a humiliating rejection

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.890
situation.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.300
But getting her to ask you,
hmm, I mean, what's your angle?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.235
Hypnosis or cash?

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:05.450
RICHARD: Buck.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.670
BUCKINGHAM: Plus why
Eddie's ex-girlfriend?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.320
Is it like a copycat thing,
a revenge thing, a sex thing?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.410
Is it a
sex-revenge-copycat thing?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.020
Wait, Richard, is this a scheme?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.760
RICHARD: What?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.330
BUCKINGHAM: You're
always scheming.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.521
Oh, ah!

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:21.770
Are you running for president?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.492
RICHARD: What?

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:24.625
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, my god.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.750
Is getting a date with Anne
Margaret the first step

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.520
in an elaborate multi-step
scheme for getting

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.900
elected senior class president?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.752
[GASPS] It is, isn't it?

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:32.680
Confess!

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.900
RICHARD: Well, no.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.030
Buck, it's not a scheme.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.230
I just want a date.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.890
BUCKINGHAM: Yeah, and I want
Chris Evans to sit on my face.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.730
Only he has to ask.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.019
RICHARD: Who is Chris--

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.810
BUCKINGHAM: Chris Evans
is Captain America.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.901
He's been Captain America
for, like, 19 movies.

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:48.650
I'm sorry, do you watch
movies, or are you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.390
too busy tuning into the
voices inside your head?

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.556
RICHARD: [GASPS] Softer now.

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:52.280
She approaches.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.750
BUCKINGHAM: Softer now,
who talks like that?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.760
RICHARD: Away with you, Buck.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.060
BUCKINGHAM: All right.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.520
Whatever, pal.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.311
Follow your dreams.

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:01.710
RICHARD: Well, Buck's
right, of course.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.085
Landing a date
with Anne Margaret

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:04.860
is part of an elaborate
multi-step scheme.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.020
If I can capture
Eddie's ex-girlfriend,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.860
the people will know that I
am the most redoubtable knave,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.780
someone who's not
to be fuck-ed with.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.890
And so, Roseland High School,
prepare for your fate.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.448
My first step to power
is to land a first date.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:23.220
ANNE MARGARET: Ah!

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.260
RICHARD: Oh, Anne.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.840
I believe you have something
you wanted to ask me.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.190
ANNE MARGARET: I did?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.398
RICHARD: Uh-huh, so go ahead.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:33.417
ANNE MARGARET: Uh, I really
can't think of anything.

00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:34.500
Can you get out of my way?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.450
RICHARD: Oops,
no, that's not it.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.560
ANNE MARGARET: I don't
know what your deal is.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.269
But I'm not into
guessing games, Richard.

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.560
RICHARD: Oh, this isn't a game.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.420
It's an invitation.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420
So go ahead.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.680
Invite me to Sadie Hawkins.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.804
All you have to do is ask.

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:46.760
ANNE MARGARET: Oh.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.913
Excuse me.

00:03:47.913 --> 00:03:50.372
[CHUCKLES] Look, I know
you're differently abled,

00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:52.080
but you got to know
that's not happening.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.344
RICHARD: Uh, but why, Anne?

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:56.010
ANNE MARGARET: Because
I don't like you.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.940
RICHARD: You don't even know me.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.650
I mean, we've known each
other since middle school,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.910
but this is the most
that we've talked.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.330
ANNE MARGARET: You're right.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.050
I don't know you.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.130
So why would I ask you out?

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.940
Because I pity you?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.410
RICHARD: Whoa, no one's
asking for pity here.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.910
Why?

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.600
Do you pity me?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.707
Or do you fear me?

00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:08.790
Are you afraid you'll
contract cerebral palsy just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.179
by the very taint of my touch?

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:11.220
ANNE MARGARET: Quit that.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.850
RICHARD: See?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.666
You hate me for what I am.

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:14.790
ANNE MARGARET: No, I don't.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.054
I just-- Richard, I
don't mean to be mean.

00:04:18.054 --> 00:04:19.720
I'm just trying to
stay in my lane here.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.220
You know?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.120
RICHARD: Well,
which is it, Anne?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.410
Pity me, hate me, or fear me?

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.951
ANNE MARGARET: I
don't even know you.

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.810
I nothing you.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.770
RICHARD: Exactly.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.901
I'm not even relevant here.

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:27.400
See?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.190
The real reason you're going
to ask me to Sadie Hawkins

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.405
is because it's the best
way to get back at Eddie.

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:32.280
ANNE MARGARET: Eddie?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.020
But I don't want to
get back at Eddie.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.890
RICHARD: Really?

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.570
Even though he was
hardcore dating you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.730
all through winter break,
only to immediately start

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.344
dating Liz Woodville?

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:41.760
ANNE MARGARET:
Eddie's dating Liz?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.934
[SCOFFS] No, he's not.

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.350
RICHARD: Clearly,
you don't follow

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.860
Lix Woodville on Instagram.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.460
ANNE MARGARET: Whatever.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.119
It's done now.

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.160
He can date who he wants.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.035
RICHARD: Well, I've seen
you on campus, Anne,

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.660
seen the happy-go-lucky social
butterfly cocooning herself

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.987
in a chrysalis of
melancholy and doubt.

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:02.320
ANNE MARGARET: Yeah, well,
it's been a really hard year.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.903
RICHARD: Well, which is why it's
so brave of you soldiering on

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:05.670
like this.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.050
You know something, Anne?

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.170
I've never known the
tender pleasures of dating.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.080
ANNE MARGARET:
(SARCASTICALLY) Really?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.538
RICHARD: But then
again, I've never

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:13.335
been unceremoniously dumped.

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:14.550
ANNE MARGARET: That--

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.284
That's-- is that what
people are saying?

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:17.700
RICHARD: Well,
that's right, Anne.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.574
He's still the most
popular person in school,

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:21.633
whereas you, you
are nothing now.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:22.633
ANNE MARGARET: I'm not--

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.390
I'm not nothing.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.087
I'm just me.

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:26.670
RICHARD: Well, being
you isn't enough,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.599
not in this Roseland wasteland.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.390
If Eddie and Liz
Woodville go to the dance,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.330
what's your counterattack?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.413
ANNE MARGARET: Why do I
even need a counterattack?

00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:35.820
I swear to god, high school
drama is such bullshit.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.270
RICHARD: Ask me to the dance.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.561
If you go with me, everyone
will see what a good person

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:41.940
you are, that you did this
selfless good deed of taking

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.400
Richard the Cripple to
his very first dance.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.192
I'm your charm offensive.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.900
ANNE MARGARET: OK.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.150
But if I did go
with you, I'd only

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.042
be doing it to be a good person.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:56.750
It doesn't mean that
we're, like, dating.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.260
RICHARD: Well, not yet.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.259
ANNE MARGARET: Not ever.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.910
RICHARD: Not ever yet.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.690
ANNE MARGARET: God, Richard,
what kind of crazy fantasies

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.482
go on in that head?

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:04.440
RICHARD: So many, Anne.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.150
You have no idea.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.450
So what's it going to be?

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.510
ANNE MARGARET: Fine.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.230
Richard, will you go to
Sadie Hawkins with me?

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.741
RICHARD: No.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:15.490
ANNE MARGARET: No?

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.540
You fucking ass crack.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.873
RICHARD: No, I-- I can't go
to the dance with you, Anne,

00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:20.710
because I never
learned how to dance.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.880
ANNE MARGARET: Oh.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.120
Well, could I teach
you or something?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.380
I do have a dance background.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.697
RICHARD: It's a date!

00:06:28.697 --> 00:06:30.030
ANNE MARGARET: Oh, but it's not.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.314
RICHARD: Oo, spicy, Anne.

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:32.980
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.590
ANNE MARGARET: I think
I'm protesting just right.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.620
RICHARD: Hey, Anne.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.495
ANNE MARGARET: Jesus.

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:38.140
What?

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.424
RICHARD: You're a good person.

00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:41.340
ANNE MARGARET: Thanks.

00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:44.850
RICHARD: Ha!

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.200
Did you fucking see that?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.520
Ha, ha, ha.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.680
Was ever woman so easily won?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.670
Whoo!

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.700
We're going to be like
Lancelot and Guinevere, Pyramus

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.300
and Thisbe, Michelle and Barack.

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:02.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:08.620
GREGG MOZGALA:
I'm Gregg Mozgala.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.880
And I'm playing Richard.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.856
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Hi.

00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:11.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:12.915
GREGG MOZGALA: Oh, thanks.

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:14.510
That's really nice.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.530
Thanks, Charlie.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.030
Hi,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.870
TIFFANY VILLARIN:
I'm Tiffany Villarin.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.280
And I'm playing Anne Margaret.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:23.840
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I'm Marinda Anderson,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.487
and I play Elizabeth, Miss
York, also known as Miss York.

00:07:27.487 --> 00:07:30.349
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.025
SHANNON DEVIDO: I'm Shannon
DeVido, and I play Buck.

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:35.185
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:36.310
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Wonderful.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.860
Well, I hope you all
enjoyed the scene.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.780
I know some people have actually
been to the show already.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.490
If you haven't, go
get your tickets now.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.070
It's selling out really fast.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.310
And they've already announced
an extension actually.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.140
So you can go and get tickets.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.220
So "Teenage Dick" is
a modern retelling

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.590
of "Richard III,"
Shakespeare's "Richard III."

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.580
You probably recognized
some of the dialogue.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.580
So let's talk about the title.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.860
I know it caused a little
bit of hand-wringing.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.504
Gregg, you actually commissioned
the play from Mike Lew.

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:09.670
GREGG MOZGALA: That's right.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.860
Yeah.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.850
And he mentioned in the video--

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.050
it was as simple as that.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.320
I just thought, Mike, I want
you write a "Richard III"

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.040
set in high school and
call it "Teenage Dick."

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.460
So yeah, so I run a theater
company called The Apothetae.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.650
And we focus on plays that--

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.990
we produce works that
explore and illuminate

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.440
the disabled experience,
which is really an exploration

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.240
to figure out what that is.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.754
And I thought Richard III
is arguably the most famous

00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:39.940
disabled character in
Western dramatic literature.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.380
So he's a great character
to take on and explore.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.020
CORRIE DAVIDSON: You
mentioned Apothetae.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.880
Where did that name come from?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.690
GREGG MOZGALA: So
the inspiration,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.520
the namesake of the company,
there was a disabled playwright

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.910
named John Belluso, who had
worked in theater extensively

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.090
and was also writing for
shows like "Deadwood" on HBO

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.950
and some network shows.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.080
He actually passed away in 2006.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.012
And in 2007, I was in
the New York premiere

00:09:08.012 --> 00:09:09.970
of a show of his called
"The Rules of Charity,"

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.020
and a character actually
mentions the Apothetae, which

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.960
was a place in ancient
Sparta in Greece where--

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.450
The Spartans were known
for their very fascistic

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.370
physical world view.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.360
They were a very
militaristic society.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.809
So if you didn't
fit that worldview,

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:30.850
the Apothetae was a place,
a chasm in the ground,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.308
where disabled and
deformed infants

00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:34.420
were left to the elements.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.420
So it roughly translates
to "the place of exposure."

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.970
And I'm just like, I thought
that was really beautiful.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.440
And so I'm playing on
that double entendre

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.270
to shed light into dark
places and also expose,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.470
or make visible, the
disabled experience,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.875
or make the history of
disabled performance.

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:55.000
CORRIE DAVIDSON: And we
talked a little bit earlier

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.310
about authentic casting.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.460
And if we think
about stories that

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.430
feature a disabled character,
so often these narratives

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.100
fall in a very
few limited number

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.070
of buckets, inspirational,
overcoming adversity.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.930
Why do you think
these narratives are

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.140
so pervasive in our culture?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.020
GREGG MOZGALA: Whoa.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.062
That's a big question.

00:10:19.062 --> 00:10:21.520
Well, I think, again, with this
incredibly representational

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.760
cast, right, and I think
that was intentional.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.320
And by partnering
with Ma-Yi, which

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.230
is an Asian-American
theater company,

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.560
we have this incredible
cast and production

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:41.050
team that is diverse ethnically,
gender, ability, just

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.410
all kinds of ways,
which is really great.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.370
And I can't speak on
being Asian-American or

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.070
African-American, but from
a disability perspective,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.860
I think disability is
very hard to deal with.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.550
I mean, there's a lot of anxiety
around the issue and the topic

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.550
that's not discussed,
or hasn't been discussed

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.250
as openly as the experience
of other marginalized groups,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.930
because that work has been
done for decades and decades

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.020
and decades now, where
disability is behind

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.740
in that regard.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.070
But the pervasive
narratives are being

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.040
an inspiration, overcoming
adversity, or death

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.011
with dignity.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:19.510
You know?

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.000
And I think those
are the three buckets

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.190
that I would put these in.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.050
I don't know, not
to be a downer,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.065
but I think the
context of disability

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:32.400
is not a geographic location
or a specific culture.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.950
Right?

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:38.320
But the context of disability
is illness, trauma, pain,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.750
and death.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:46.160
So that can be difficult to
deal with because it reminds one

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.080
of their own vulnerability
and ultimately,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.220
their own mortality,
I think, which again,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.570
that can be a difficult
pill to swallow.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.231
But I think there's great--

00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.980
that can be seen as a
deficit, or that can

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.050
be seen as a great strength.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.600
Because if someone has undergone
trauma and becomes disabled,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.800
that's difficult, yes.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.070
But the flip side of
that is that they've

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.470
had an encounter with
death and beat it.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.865
And I think there's
great strength in that.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.240
And so I'm interested
in focusing

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.205
on both the dark, and the light,
and all the spaces in between.

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:18.510
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Excellent.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.850
Now you mentioned-- Ma-Yi
is very focused on diversity

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.370
and representation in
the arts in general,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.820
not just on stage, but off
stage as well, in the crew,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.820
and in writing and directing.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.850
There's been a lot of
other stories in the media

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.750
lately about movies
in particular and TV

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.860
and representation
in those roles,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.380
either be it a traditional role
being played by a white actor.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.060
And Chen and I were having
a quick conversation

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.854
about this earlier.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.895
And you never want to take
work away from people.

00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:56.480
But you also want to be in
control of your narrative

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.010
that you identify with.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.370
So how do you guys handle
that in your day to day,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.330
and going the casting calls,
and choosing productions

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.880
you work on?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.880
TIFFANY VILLARIN: I think
one of the reasons why

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.890
I love being an
actor in New York

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.250
is Ma-Yi theater, because
they are the largest

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.110
gathering of
Asian-American playwrights

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.990
in history in the
country, in the world.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.050
And I feel very fortunate
to be able to have

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.810
gotten to know a lot of them,
a lot of those playwrights,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.110
and to be in on the
ground level of new works

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.710
that they're creating
because that conversation

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.880
about representation.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.770
And about being in
charge of our narratives,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.230
and not having the
narrative always

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.440
be about explaining my
race for white people,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.700
frankly, is at the top of that
awareness for those writers.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:14:02.160
And it's important work, I
think, to be to be doing.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.514
And Mike is-- he's the--

00:14:05.514 --> 00:14:07.680
GREGG MOZGALA: He's the
head of that program, right?

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.510
TIFFANY VILLARIN: He's the
head of the Ma-Yi's writers lab

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.140
right now.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.810
And I think that this
play in particular

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.210
is doing all of those things
on all the different levels,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.570
not just about race, but also
about ability and disability.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.070
GREGG MOZGALA: It
also happens to be

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.420
incredibly smart and funny.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.461
TIFFANY VILLARIN: And it's
smart, and it's funny.

00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:34.780
And yeah, it's all
those levels of things.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.280
And it's Shakespeare.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.450
So you know, people who laugh
at the funny inside Shakespeare

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.360
jokes are like, oh, you're
the Shakespeare nerds.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.380
I hear you.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.760
So it's all in there.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.250
And that's the work that
I want to be involved in

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.180
and that I think is
the future of what

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.090
audiences want to experience.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.620
That's the possibility.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.130
That where theater could go,
where storytelling could go,

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.960
that direction.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.052
Yeah.

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:08.441
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Great.

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:09.830
Oh.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.810
Anything you would add?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.550
MARINDA ANDERSON: No,
I agree with that.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.050
Yeah.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.430
I mean, being an actor,
going into these auditions,

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.310
a lot of the times,
you do get into a play,

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.830
and a lot of the times,
they are not really

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.030
welcoming of your experience,
for me, as a black woman

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.290
into the room.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.200
I mean it's like, yay,
we want to be diverse.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.320
Yay!

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.700
You know what I mean?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.560
Can I also bring
myself into it as well?

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.770
And that's not been
this experience at all.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.820
It's so inclusive.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.940
And I feel very welcomed
and feel very represented,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.356
and not in a way
of like, I'm black.

00:15:47.356 --> 00:15:48.230
You know what I mean?

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.206
Just like, I'm a teacher,
and I'm doing my job.

00:15:50.206 --> 00:15:51.080
You know what I mean?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.520
I don't have to explain it.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.019
Like what you were saying, I
don't have to explain what I am

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.820
and who I am.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.600
And with this play, it's just--

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.850
like you said, it's all there.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.610
It's just brilliant,
and so easy to dive

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.570
into and have so much fun.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.620
So I feel very welcome.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.620
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Marinda,
you mentioned that you

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.520
play the teacher is your work.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.020
So your character-- you
guys really should go

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.920
watch the play.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.230
Your character has these
really great moments

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.640
where you're cringing
at some of the moments,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.622
and then you're just
laughing out loud.

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.080
I'm not going to
give any spoilers.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.545
MARINDA ANDERSON: I'm cringing?

00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:31.686
Or you're cringing.

00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:33.352
CORRIE DAVIDSON:
You're cringing at some

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:36.920
of the lines and the gestures.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.930
But then toward the
latter end of the show,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.860
you have this
spectacular solo moments,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.940
where I feel like Miss
York really finds her own.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.940
You're also the only adult
in the room, if you will.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.190
Everyone else is a
high school teenager.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.117
So what was it like playing that
adult in such an ensemble show?

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.700
MARINDA ANDERSON:
It's funny because I

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.270
was like, oh, this is so fun.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.580
It's set in high school.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.060
And I don't actually
know how old everyone is.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.210
I assume we're all
actually the same age-ish.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.780
But I was like, oh, yeah,
we get to play teens.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.720
I'm like, oh, no, I have
to be the adult person.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.548
And it's funny because
I'm also the deputy,

00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:17.839
and I'm also the fight captain.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.294
So it's funny how--

00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:20.960
CORRIE DAVIDSON: All
the responsibility.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.501
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I, all of a sudden,

00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:26.450
became the responsible one,
which is not me as Marinda.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.710
But it's funny how that just
kind of a seeped on over.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.355
But it's been fun.

00:17:32.355 --> 00:17:33.230
I've actually never--

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.130
GREGG MOZGALA: We
get what we deserve,

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.240
and we get what we're ready for.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.698
MARINDA ANDERSON:
Thank you, Gregg.

00:17:36.698 --> 00:17:39.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.610
I never felt like the
adult in the room,

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.950
though, during rehearsal.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.780
I just felt like one of
the clowns just having fun.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.880
So I don't really
feel like the teacher,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.830
I mean, in those
moments of like, oh god,

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.000
what, is she doing.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.080
I'm like, oh, that's when the
awareness comes in, I guess.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.630
But it's just such an
ensemble, I don't really

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.570
feel like, oh, I'm like the
adult playing the adult here.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.250
But yeah.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.820
Did I answer your question?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.528
CORRIE DAVIDSON: No,
you mentioned you're

00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:10.922
a deputy and a fire warden?

00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:11.726
Like, what?

00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:13.376
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:14.730
MARINDA ANDERSON: I am that too.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.850
I am a fire warden.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.820
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Just
hold it very well.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.290
MARINDA ANDERSON: No, we are
in a union, the actors equity

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.790
union.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.960
And each show has a deputy.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.930
So it's like if anything,
any troubles arise,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.620
they come to me.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.110
And I told them,
don't come to me.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.740
Don't do it.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.930
But it's always that
thing at the beginning

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.263
of rehearsals, they're like,
who wants to be the deputy?

00:18:38.263 --> 00:18:40.640
And everyone's like, well,
yeah, I did it before.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.489
I don't really need
to do it again.

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:44.030
So I just went ahead
and volunteered.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.280
And then I also became
the fight captain

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.730
to make sure people stay safe.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.800
There are a few little
tiffs in the show.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.190
So I just make
sure we stay safe.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.190
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Gotcha.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.690
Gotcha.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.540
Now, you had
mentioned earlier, you

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.570
have a fight call
earlier before the show.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.090
And there are some fight
scenes, some dance scenes.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.120
There's a lot of choreographed
elements for this show.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.490
What kind of special
training did you guys

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.980
have to go through
to prepare for that?

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.720
The choreographers
you brought in,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.340
what was that experience like?

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.640
GREGG MOZGALA: Well, we
have a-- so neither Tiffany

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.126
nor I have a dance background.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.250
MARINDA ANDERSON: Professional
dancers are nowhere.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:23.930
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah, right.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.430
Right.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.820
But I mean, I have
had experience.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.230
I was in a dance piece
several years ago.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.076
But that was it.

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:34.450
I mean, I was hired as an
actor to be in that dance piece

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.820
and had to learn
all those skills.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.530
But this was a very
different style.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.014
I mean, all great
high school stories

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.430
should end at a
high school dance.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.860
And you know,
"Teenage Dick" does.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.830
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Yes.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.240
GREGG MOZGALA: And so--

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.460
TIFFANY VILLARIN:
You want [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.626
GREGG MOZGALA: I mean,
again, you saw in that scene,

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:53.720
it's like their relationship,
most of their scenes

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.560
take place within Anne's dance
studio, where she is teaching

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.530
Richard how to dance.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.710
And they meet through the body.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.155
And I think it's
really beautiful,

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:04.700
Mike, what he's constructed
here, because they develop

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.400
this really incredible
level of intimacy that

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.380
later becomes sort of romantic,
but doesn't start that way.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.690
But yeah, we had two incredible
choreographers, Jen Weber,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.880
who worked on a Ma-Yi
production of "KPOP,"

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.940
which was about Korean
pop, the Korean pop scene.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.560
And Liz Tenuto, the
associate choreographer.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.517
And we just--

00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:35.350
TIFFANY VILLARIN: We
started every rehearsal

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.754
with 90 minutes of dance.

00:20:36.754 --> 00:20:39.170
So the first week, I was like,
oh, my god, these muscles--

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.050
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah,
we were hurting.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.130
TIFFANY VILLARIN: --that
I've never felt before.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.510
You know?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.850
And now, we've just built it up.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.300
We're like, OK, I can do this.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.800
Yeah.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.633
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah.

00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:48.660
But again, I mean,
the difference

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.280
between dancers and
actors is dancers practice

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.620
their craft every day.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.760
If you're not in a show, you
go to the barre, and like,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.159
you take a class.

00:20:57.159 --> 00:20:58.450
Actors aren't that disciplined.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.500
TIFFANY VILLARIN:
We also go to a bar.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.375
GREGG MOZGALA: Right!

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:01.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.364 --> 00:21:02.090
Exactly.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.590
Right.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.346
Yeah.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.220
SHANNON DEVIDO: Marinda
and I were at the bar

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:05.803
while you guys--

00:21:05.803 --> 00:21:06.719
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Yes.

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:08.678
While we were rehearsing,
they were at the bar.

00:21:08.678 --> 00:21:10.177
MARINDA ANDERSON:
We were brunching.

00:21:10.177 --> 00:21:12.190
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Yeah,
explain them later.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.485
GREGG MOZGALA: We come from
a long line of people who

00:21:14.485 --> 00:21:17.210
have never picked up a fork.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.610
So yeah.

00:21:22.354 --> 00:21:24.670
It's just another element
to the play, again,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.040
I think because of the
high school nature of it,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.890
the ending at prom, or like the
big spring fling, or whatever.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.280
You know, you have to have that.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.760
And Mike said, in a
conversation the other day,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.620
because "Richard III" ends at--

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.250
the Battle of Bosworth is
the big climactic event.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.260
And so he said he
was transplanting

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.700
the world of the
high school dance

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.520
into the Shakespearean battle.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.270
And I thought that was
really, really amazing.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.520
I just really lived that idea.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.870
So yeah, we drilled, and
drilled, and drilled.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.400
CORRIE DAVIDSON:
Actually, movement

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.870
is such a theme of the
show in different ways.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.600
Actually, Shannon, I know--
we talked about this earlier,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.700
but you had a really funny
role on the Hulu show, RIP,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.250
"Difficult People"--

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.870
we'll pour one out for
"Difficult People"--

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.670
that really, they cast
you as a comedian.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.670
And it was written for
someone in a wheelchair.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.320
It was cast for a comedian.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.070
And then in this role, Buck is
traditionally played by a man.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.380
And you're playing
it as a woman.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.115
SHANNON DEVIDO: It
was originally a man.

00:22:27.115 --> 00:22:27.990
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Yes.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.504
MARINDA ANDERSON: A little boy.

00:22:29.504 --> 00:22:30.920
SHANNON DEVIDO: A
very little boy.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.080
GREGG MOZGALA: Right, well, I
had known Shannon for a couple

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.000
years prior to this.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.730
And Mike did not know her.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.730
So she was always, from
the genesis, it was like,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.470
we're going to use
Shannon DeVido.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.130
But I think Mike wasn't sure.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:50.500
But as soon as he discovered
how wonderful Shannon was,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.076
it was a match.

00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:55.076
SHANNON DEVIDO: I was
allowed to be in the room.

00:22:55.076 --> 00:22:56.492
CORRIE DAVIDSON:
You were allowed.

00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:59.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.680
So in this show, you bring
this robust reinterpretation

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.240
to the role.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.700
And you were cast for
your talents as an actor.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.700
But you bring these
really wonderful, almost a

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.710
secondary character
with you to the stage.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.570
And we've brought
up before, Shannon

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.310
has this great scene, where
she's giving Richard the finger

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.600
and rolling away.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.760
And it's just this epic fade.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.260
And it's such a--

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.510
It's really, really well done.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.650
Your comedic timing
is so on point.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.510
So how did you bring that
unique choreography to the role?

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.430
And how did you work
with the other actors

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.460
and the choreographers
to stage that?

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:42.550
SHANNON DEVIDO: That's a
very interesting question

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.460
because I don't think about it.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.380
I didn't really work with
the choreographers at all.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.210
It's funny because
a lot of the reviews

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.670
also touched on that,
how it's just part

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.110
of the world of how I live.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.850
And I love that they are seeing
that because a wheelchair is

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.770
often put into this world
where it's a hindrance,

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.310
or "wheelchair bound" is
often a term that is used,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.970
but we need to stop using.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.682
But it is.

00:24:12.682 --> 00:24:14.890
Like you're tied to it, and
it's this horrible thing.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.880
But I love that people are
noticing that it's so freeing,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.210
and it's a part of me.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.510
And I don't-- it
flows through me.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.595
Actors often talk about
being in their bodies when

00:24:27.595 --> 00:24:28.220
they're acting.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.180
And I feel like, for
so many years, when

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.680
I was in acting
classes, they wanted

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.720
me to be in just my body.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.800
And I appreciate that.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.550
But I feel like my wheelchair's
an extension of that.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.790
And I really get the
ability to utilize that

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.310
on the stage in this show.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:50.350
And I think a lot of my comedy
comes through with that.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.980
So yeah, it's pretty cool that I
got that ability to show people

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.270
that it's not a hindrance.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.874
It's actually a freeing,
wonderful thing.

00:24:57.874 --> 00:24:59.790
GREGG MOZGALA: Can I add
to that a little bit?

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.010
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Absolutely.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.926
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah, the
comment on how people

00:25:02.926 --> 00:25:04.300
respond to the reviews is--

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.970
the reviews have been fantastic.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.205
But again, people are
amazed that I can dance.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.160
I'm not sort of
calling anybody out.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.850
But this sort of idea, I think
it's just you haven't seen it.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.807
There are plenty of
amazing actors and dancers.

00:25:23.807 --> 00:25:25.640
There's a dancer named
Alice Sheppard, who's

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.820
a wheelchair dancers, who is on
the cover of "Dance" magazine

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.630
this month.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:33.310
You just haven't-- it's
not in cultural zeitgeist.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.680
It hasn't been shared
or displayed as much.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.630
So it's so new, it's
almost revelatory.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.030
And again, the
sort of vocabulary,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.490
the language about
having to write,

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.030
I think if you just saw it more
and more and more and more,

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.370
that would fade away, and
people would just say,

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:57.520
Shannon is like a physical
and verbal comedic actor.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.680
And she has a great
genius in that sense.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.760
And I consider myself a
rigorous physical actor

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.240
because I mean, I throw
myself around all the time.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.210
But people seem so
amazed that I-- and it's

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.535
a common conception about
disability in some ways, that

00:26:15.535 --> 00:26:18.910
you you can get to the store,
or like, get to your job,

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.120
or have a life, or whatnot.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.245
And if the theater is just sort
of a reflection of our lives,

00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:26.620
then oh, my god, look what
these people can do on stage--

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.050
I think that's why having
the narratives that

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:34.877
are more nuanced, more
thought out, again,

00:26:34.877 --> 00:26:37.210
where the disabled people
themselves have agency and can

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.180
inhabit roles that are
closer to themselves

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.236
actually help to move
that needle forward.

00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:43.360
And it starts a discussion.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.800
I mean, we're having
a discussion right

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.460
now about this.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.060
Right?

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.720
And this discussion itself
is pretty unprecedented.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.211
Like, I never imagined I
would be at Google, talking

00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:53.710
about a play that came to life
with these incredible people.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.260
You know?

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.650
But again, it's about proximity,
and it's just about visibility.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:05.200
And again, why, I
think Ma-Yi and work

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.290
within the
African-American community,

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.960
within the theater community,
any marginalized group,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.960
they understood, we have
to tell our own stories.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.977
Or our own stories in
partnership with others.

00:27:15.977 --> 00:27:17.560
The plays, and the
plays and the plays

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.630
and the plays, that
the narrative is what

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:24.220
moves the culture forward
and then hopefully society

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.820
forward too.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.300
But it's working well together.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.787
They're both moving like this.

00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:30.370
CORRIE DAVIDSON: You
mentioned agency,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.580
which is actually something I'd
like to talk to Tiffany about.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.380
Women in Shakespearean plays
are often side characters.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.000
Particularly in
"Richard III," they

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.490
tend to fill a role of a
crying, mourning victim.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.410
Mike wrote these roles
very differently.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.470
He gave a lot of meat to
your role in particular.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.710
And as the play
goes, your character

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.110
changes the tone and the
direction of some of the show.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.210
Without revealing
anything, how did you

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.530
bring that agency and ultimately
that power to your role

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.189
as Anne?

00:28:04.189 --> 00:28:05.980
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Again,
I think this roots

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.280
to being able to be in
the room with a new play

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.660
at the inception,
or very near to,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:19.150
and having relationships with
playwrights who are alive

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.360
and like writing
for you in a way.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.310
Shakespeare died so long ago.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.640
And he didn't write
anything for me, I feel.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.650
But getting to sit with
Mike and saying, like,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.270
hey, I think she's
smarter than that, I think

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.820
she's got more grit than we--

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.994
we were able to have
those conversations.

00:28:40.994 --> 00:28:42.410
And Mike is the
kind of playwright

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.600
who's open to having
that with all of us

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.700
about all of the roles
about what we think

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.510
is authentic to that character.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.420
And we were getting
rewrites and previews.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.100
We got a whole new scene.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.360
We'd already done three
previews, and got a new scene,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.990
and put it up.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.610
And I feel very blessed
to be able to stand

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.840
on the public stage and say
something like, "I am not

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.506
a tossed off afterthought
like in a Shakespeare play,

00:29:12.506 --> 00:29:14.880
where all the women are a
bunch of objects, and character

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.810
foils, and plot devices."

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.540
And I get to do that,
and I get to say that,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.150
and look at women
in the audience

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.130
and see it reflected back to me.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.790
And that, I think, is a
really special moment,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.490
and something that is
under the whole piece,

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.470
this idea of agency.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.880
And something we
talked about, too,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.670
Mike started writing this
play four or five years ago

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.120
before this big
cultural turn that we've

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.820
had in the MeToo
movement and all of that.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:55.520
And Mike has a lot of pop
culture references in his play,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.290
plays that change, that
keep changing with time.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:03.800
And that's another thing,
Delivering that monologue now

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.770
is different than when I did
it in a workshop two years ago.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:16.240
And getting to dig into it in
those layers is very powerful,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.440
I think, and feels good.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.680
It's something that I think
needs to be seen onstage.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.374
Yeah.

00:30:24.374 --> 00:30:26.040
CORRIE DAVIDSON: You
mentioned the we're

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.510
still getting new scenes
and line changes up

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.660
through previews.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.295
And I know you and Marinda
have actually have both done--

00:30:33.295 --> 00:30:34.860
and Shannon too--
have both done TV.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.140
Both of you were on "Gotham."

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.440
I don't know if there
was any overlap there.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.960
But how is that
process from doing

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.290
TV, episodic TV, or one-off
roles compared to live theater?

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.160
I know you've also
done multi-format work?

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.740
But what is that process
like that's different?

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.220
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I love theater.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.150
I mean, there's nothing like it.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.478
TV is cool too.

00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:05.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.580
It is very cool.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.680
I mean, I want to do
more of it as well.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.830
And I mean, everyone
gets to see it.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:16.244
You get more exposure,
whatever, that way as well.

00:31:16.244 --> 00:31:17.410
I mean, I love both mediums.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.980
But theater, just
to be with people.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.190
It's about community,
and reaching, people,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.150
and it's making contact that
you can't do through a screen.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.950
And the preparation
is totally different.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.530
I get so nervous if I
have to be on a set.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.850
It's like, just know your lines,
and just say your two lines.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.510
Mr. President!

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:42.055 --> 00:31:43.340
Or whatever.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.940
And it's actually very
nerve-wracking to me sometimes.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.850
But with theater,
I mean, it's alive.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.580
And the great thing is
these two, they're so good.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.540
He is so good, like, just
being spontaneous on the spot.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.010
He responds in the audience.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.460
Someone sneezed, and
he was like, bless you.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.400
You know what I mean?

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.280
You can do.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.450
And that's so amazing.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.530
And I love it.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.810
It makes me so excited
when those things happen.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.560
Yeah.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.265
So that's how I feel about it.

00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:14.157
Anybody else want
to talk about it?

00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:16.612
CORRIE DAVIDSON: So speaking
of multi-formats, Shannon,

00:32:16.612 --> 00:32:19.070
when are we going to get more
installations in your YouTube

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.800
series?

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.520
SHANNON DEVIDO: [LAUGHS]

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.980
CORRIE DAVIDSON:
Actually, why don't you

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.063
tell everyone-- give us a
little background on why

00:32:24.063 --> 00:32:26.510
you created that, what
you were doing with it.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.440
And then tell me when
we get more episodes.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.490
SHANNON DEVIDO: So I have
a web series on YouTube

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.350
called "Stare at Shannon."

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.370
And I started it
because I was bored.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:43.200
And I was like, hey,
it'd be really funny

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.320
if I went through a
drive-through in my wheelchair

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.970
and filmed it.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.264
And then I called my friend.

00:32:49.264 --> 00:32:50.430
I was like, can you do this?

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.650
And he was like, uh, sure.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.030
And so he did.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.885
And so we went through the
drive-through in my wheelchair,

00:32:56.885 --> 00:32:57.720
and Jerry filmed it.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.290
And then I was like, oh,
I should do more of this

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.680
because I'm bored a lot.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.560
But in reality, the reason
I wanted to do was because--

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.397
I have this phrase
where I'm like, well,

00:33:08.397 --> 00:33:09.730
people are staring at me anyway.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.540
I might as well be
doing something cool.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.040
And so yeah, so I do all
kinds of weird things,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.350
like go to a grocery
store, and eat food,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.870
and see what I
can get away with.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.190
Which is true.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.180
I did.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.830
I was very sick.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.140
Because I ate everything.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.280
I ate a cake.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.850
I made a--

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.820
GREGG MOZGALA:
Nobody stopped you?

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.210
SHANNON DEVIDO: No.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.793
TIFFANY VILLARIN:
Did you have to pay?

00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:32.904
You just opened it up?

00:33:32.904 --> 00:33:34.820
SHANNON DEVIDO: I paid
at the end, yeah, yeah.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.130
So I mean-- no, yeah, so I
just like kept opening stuff.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.140
And like, the
people at the store

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.390
would help me [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.920
I made a sundae.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.390
I poured a bowl of cereal.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.490
I just made a sandwich.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.670
I just went to town.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.750
And no one stopped me.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.810
They all helped.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.300
I just was like, all right.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.113
And oh, god, painful.

00:34:00.113 --> 00:34:03.551
I ate a whole cake.

00:34:03.551 --> 00:34:04.300
It was ridiculous.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.466
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Hilarious.

00:34:05.466 --> 00:34:07.250
GREGG MOZGALA: Do
you take suggestions?

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.969
SHANNON DEVIDO:
Yeah, no, I just--

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.210
yeah, OK.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.389
I was fun though.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.960
But you watch that
on YouTube and then

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.230
think about how sick I was.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.474
So anyway, so that's my channel.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.770
I'm really selling it.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.750
When will you get more?

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.580
Well, I'm here a lot.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.139
So I'm not bored.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.739
But I'll be bored.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:34.830
I'll be bored on July 30.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.810
So maybe then I
will have some time

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.576
to eat more food
in a grocery store.

00:34:41.576 --> 00:34:43.159
CORRIE DAVIDSON: I
look forward to it.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:43.889
GREGG MOZGALA: But
Shannon, you said something

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.130
earlier about using
comedy as a vehicle

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.250
to move things forward,
or spark the conversation,

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.550
or it makes it
easier to metabolize

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.914
the issues around the issues.

00:34:54.914 --> 00:34:56.830
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yeah,
well, I mean, disability

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.079
is not a fun thing to talk
about, which you definitely

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.000
touched on earlier.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.550
It's like, that's sad.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.170
Right?

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.440
But comedy is not.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.590
So sometimes.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.098
It depends on how good you are.

00:35:08.098 --> 00:35:10.038
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.538 --> 00:35:12.550
Sometimes it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.740
I have been in a lot of improv
shows that were very sad.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.087
CORRIE DAVIDSON: And you
have an improv group.

00:35:21.087 --> 00:35:22.919
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yeah,
I've been in a couple,

00:35:22.919 --> 00:35:24.190
and a couple sketch groups.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:28.170
So there's a lot of
sad comedy going on.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.870
But it does.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.520
It's a very good way to
break down a barrier that

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.970
is not fun to talk about.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.790
And it allows you to talk
about what you're doing

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.270
versus the disability of it.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.300
I think that people
are then seeing me

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.795
as a comedian versus seeing
my chair first and then

00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:51.470
a comedian.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:57.875
So yeah, I like company
for that reason.

00:35:57.875 --> 00:35:59.000
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Wonderful.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.666
At this point, we're
going to open it up

00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:01.850
to audience questions.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.050
We have a microphone
in each aisle,

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.950
if you want to approach
the microphone.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.679
And we'll do Q&amp;A. While people--

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:10.970
they're going to ask questions.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.803
While people are doing
that, I have a couple

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:15.355
of fun rapid fire questions.

00:36:15.355 --> 00:36:16.980
We'll burn through
them pretty quickly.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.260
GREGG MOZGALA: Can I say just
one thing about questions,

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:18.760
though?

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.050
I mean, one thing
that I say to anyone

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.580
is ask whatever
you want, and then

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.210
anything you're afraid
ask, don't be afraid.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.591
We'll answer anything.

00:36:26.591 --> 00:36:27.840
SHANNON DEVIDO: Or Gregg will.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.140
TIFFANY VILLARIN:
Right, Gregg will.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.265
SHANNON DEVIDO: Gregg will.

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:31.970
GREGG MOZGALA: There you go.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.900
So go for it.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.420
CORRIE DAVIDSON: OK.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.370
Who is most likely to
try and get everyone

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.800
to go out and party after
a show or a practice?

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.522 --> 00:36:41.480
SHANNON DEVIDO: Not me.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.944
I want to train.

00:36:43.944 --> 00:36:45.710
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I feel like Gregg.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:46.596
GREGG MOZGALA: What?

00:36:46.596 --> 00:36:47.971
MARINDA ANDERSON:
You the one who

00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:49.260
wanted [INAUDIBLE] last night.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.620
GREGG MOZGALA: So Alex
Breaux plays Eddie.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.520
And he couldn't be here today.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.080
It was just the two of us.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.050
And--

00:36:59.050 --> 00:36:59.120
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Guys.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.619
GREGG MOZGALA: You
know, we're guys.

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:01.839
And we're doing our thing.

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.755
And the ladies are just
like putting on music,

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:04.730
and we hear them laughing.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:05.896
They're having a great time.

00:37:05.896 --> 00:37:08.030
They have a case of rose
in their dressing room.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.130
I don't think they're
drinking before the show,

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.720
but after the show, for sure.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.020
MARINDA ANDERSON: As deputy,
you can have one beverage.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.650
Before a show.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.160
It's true.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.910
It's in the rider.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.580
Yeah, I knew that.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.080
CORRIE DAVIDSON: I
have a questions.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.560
So what book are you
reading right now?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.080
MARINDA ANDERSON: Oh, I'm
reading "The Alchemist."

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.430
I'm slowly reading it.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.080
But yes, I'm reading
that right now.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.975
I'm almost done.

00:37:30.975 --> 00:37:33.360
It's good.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.152
I came late to that trend.

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:38.320
CORRIE DAVIDSON: [INAUDIBLE],,
I think we have a question.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.570
AUDIENCE: Great job, you guys.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.403
Now I feel like I've
got to go see the show.

00:37:41.403 --> 00:37:43.247
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yes!

00:37:43.247 --> 00:37:45.580
AUDIENCE: So this question,
really could be for anybody.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.170
But you mentioned doing ad
libs and being really present.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.900
And I was curious in particular
for Shannon, like, wheelchairs,

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.680
they can break down some times.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.714
And you get equipment
failure, and stuff happens.

00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:01.630
And I thought it was
really cool in that scene

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.050
how you used it for a
really good comic effect,

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.960
like Corrie was saying,
going back and forth.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.790
But do you ever--

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.400
your battery runs out in
the middle of a scene,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.680
or you get a flat tire?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.030
Has that ever happened?

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.930
SHANNON DEVIDO: I am
solid rubber tires.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.030
So I make sure that
doesn't happen.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.260
Well, one thing that
was crazy in the show

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:29.200
is we got a veneer
put onto the stage.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.110
And so my wheels
were crazy squeaky.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.060
And it was so terrible.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.294
I definitely was like
the center of the show.

00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:39.460
TIFFANY VILLARIN: But it
was also our tennis shoes--

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.543
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yeah,
whatever it was, it was bad.

00:38:41.543 --> 00:38:42.790
It was bad news bears.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.180
But that was a little stressful.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.110
But no, my battery
has never died.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.780
I had to get wheelchair repairs
that my insurance wouldn't

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.600
pay for.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.850
But that was a stressful time.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.391
That has nothing to
do with the show.

00:38:56.391 --> 00:38:58.325
I don't know why
I brought that up.

00:38:58.325 --> 00:39:00.455
It's fine now.

00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:01.230
Oh, god.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.770
I hate it.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.850
I hate talking.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.070
I'm so glad I'm an actor.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.574
No, my wheel gets caught on
the stage a bunch of times.

00:39:12.574 --> 00:39:13.990
And I just kind
of push through it

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.325
and pretend it didn't happen.

00:39:15.325 --> 00:39:17.530
That's a great answer
to your question.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.470
I'm so sorry.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.845
I apologize.

00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:21.970
AUDIENCE: I'm sure it will.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.510
Do you ever feel like you
have to educate other people?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.750
Like if you fall out
of your chair, which

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.690
does happen from time to
time, before you realize like,

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.310
you're OK, but
then everyone else

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.140
is going to get freaked out.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.540
And your main job is to
reassure them, this is OK.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.380
This happens.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.000
SHANNON DEVIDO: Oh, wow.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.210
AUDIENCE: You ever had
that kind of feeling

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.793
about that particular
thing happening,

00:39:47.793 --> 00:39:48.929
or other stuff like that?

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:49.720
SHANNON DEVIDO: No.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.440
No.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:56.020
I wear a seat belt. I have seen
people fall out of their chair.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.790
I have never fallen
out of my chair.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.790
Knock on wood somewhere.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.510
Yeah.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:07.681
No, Gregg and I have
talked about this a bunch.

00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:10.614
We were in rehearsals,
and we would allow anyone

00:40:10.614 --> 00:40:12.280
to ask us questions
because you do often

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.740
have to educate because it's
just so many people around.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.860
And we went out to lunch.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.850
And I am Marinda and Sasha we're
talking about how they never

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.000
really noticed how many
stairs there are in the city

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.150
because it's just now
something you realize.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.620
I realize it every day
when I'm in the elevators.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.450
And it's just kind of
that stuff that yes, I

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.390
feel like there is an
educational piece of it.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.600
But it's not
something that I ever

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.610
feel burdened by or
anything like that.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.110
I like having those
conversations, because it's--

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:52.042
Gregg can talk more about that.

00:40:52.042 --> 00:40:57.970
But I'd rather you ask me
than don't and just assume.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.730
Because we all know that phrase.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.170
Am I allowed to
say ask at Google?

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:01.878
Well, I just did.

00:41:01.878 --> 00:41:02.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:03.620
GREGG MOZGALA: No.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.170
But what I think what
you just mentioned is--

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.600
I mean, I'm not a
wheelchair user,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.010
but again, I am constantly
negotiating that relationship.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:10.810
It's like any time
I meet someone new,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.110
we do this sort of strange
social pas de deux,

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.841
where it's like,
I know you see me,

00:41:14.841 --> 00:41:16.090
and you're clocking something.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.080
And should we mention it?

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.454
And I put you at
ease and let you

00:41:18.454 --> 00:41:21.220
know that I'm an actual person
that can talk, and whatever,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.360
and do all these things?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.240
And I think that's just
part of the experience.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.040
But I'm actually fascinated
by that exchange.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.160
And again, that's why I think
theater is a great vehicle

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.390
for this sort of
exploration, because you're--

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.220
we're always in relation to
an audience as disabled people

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.150
and negotiating that.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.410
Theater is an explosion of that
idea, where there's a frame,

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.280
and you can have control over
the story that you're telling.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:57.310
So I mean, that's just a way for
me to wrassle that beast down.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.660
And again, I can choose where
I want to engage and disengage.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.120
And I just happened
to start a company

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.550
where the whole purpose
is to be a platform

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.620
for the conversation.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.110
So at this point in my life,
I may be talking more about it

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:17.790
more than I like or should,
but I think the need is there.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.160
And again, what art
does, what theater

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.460
does in particular is create
a community, as Marinda said.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.361
It creates an
opportunity to discuss.

00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:25.860
Right?

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.000
And I think rather than say,
let's talk about disability,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.820
we're talking about
this particular play,

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.210
where disability and several
other issues are present.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:33.810
You know?

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.930
So if it comes up,
we'll talk about it.

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:39.490
And if not, we'll also
just talk about the play.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:43.170
I'm really interested in that
sort of overlap, that exchange,

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.577
and that synergy.

00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:45.702
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Wonderful.

00:42:45.702 --> 00:42:47.100
I think we have a question here.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.180
Maddie?

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.160
Thank you guys again
so much for coming.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.400
We're all so excited
to have you here.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.860
So you've already answered
this question a little bit.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.200
But I was really excited to ask.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.390
But I wanted to talk again about
using comedy as a storytelling

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.980
device, because the show seems
so funny, while also tackling

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.150
really difficult issues.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.660
I just wanted to ask if there
were any challenges with that,

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.700
or if there is any worry that
the audience may misinterpret

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.340
jokes, or if you
were ever worried

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:25.720
about trivializing anything.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.820
So that's my question.

00:43:33.942 --> 00:43:34.900
GREGG MOZGALA: Marinda?

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.401
Marinda?

00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:36.274
MARINDA ANDERSON: No.

00:43:36.274 --> 00:43:37.540
AUDIENCE: You can just refuse.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:37.810
GREGG MOZGALA: No.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:38.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.734 --> 00:43:41.050
No, like again--

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.050
I think just for myself,
and it was a conversation

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.259
with Mike and Moritz, the
director, and everyone,

00:43:46.259 --> 00:43:47.300
we opened it to the cast.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.530
Like again, we're
hitting on things.

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.860
There's some language that
might be considered offensive

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.360
in this show.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.430
But everybody's fair
game, basically.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.150
And for the comedy
to be successful,

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.820
you really have to lean into it.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.150
You can't shy away from it.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:10.540
You have to be as mean,
or rude, or insensitive

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.890
through the character.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.000
Right?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.310
Because it's a very respectful
ensemble of wonderful people.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.640
But I think in order
for that comedy to work,

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.040
it has to be played seriously
and for all it's worth.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.150
So again, we had to
have those discussions.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:30.410
And I think that everyone on
that stage and in the process

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.990
is game to do that.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:36.150
If someone wasn't, then they
wouldn't be involved in this.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:41.730
I mean, that's intentional,
again, from my point of view,

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.010
to really tackle that.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.939
And we are getting laughs.

00:44:46.939 --> 00:44:47.980
It's a funny, funny play.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.350
And Mike has done
a fantastic job.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.650
And what that does
is bring people in

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.029
and gets people on our side
until the great dramatic--

00:44:55.029 --> 00:44:57.570
TIFFANY VILLARIN: So then we
can punch them in the gut later!

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.970
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah!

00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:59.481
You know?

00:44:59.481 --> 00:45:00.730
But hopefully, it gets people.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:04.080
I mean, again, Ma-Yi had a
benefit night Tuesday night.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.660
And again, we had
this wonderful talk.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.165
This woman really articulated
her whole emotional process

00:45:12.165 --> 00:45:14.190
throughout the play of
being able to laugh,

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.120
and then feeling conflicted.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.120
But it got her thinking,
and it got her thinking

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.550
in a new way, which,
regardless of the subject

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.160
matter, any great
piece of art should do.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.034
That's the desired effect.

00:45:26.034 --> 00:45:26.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.957
SHANNON DEVIDO: Thanks.

00:45:27.957 --> 00:45:30.040
CORRIE DAVIDSON: So back
to a couple of questions.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.070
Again, feel free to approach
the mic if you haven't yet.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.800
What are your
greatest extravagance?

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.300
Like, what is that
thing that you're

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.775
going to splurge on or
treat yourself with?

00:45:40.775 --> 00:45:42.400
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I'm going to Jamaica.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.275
CORRIE DAVIDSON: Yes.

00:45:43.275 --> 00:45:44.050
Well done.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:44.760
Well done.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.230
MARINDA ANDERSON: I
booked it for the 30th.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:51.160
So the day after we close,
I am on a flight to Jamaica.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.310
I'm taking myself for
my birthday because.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.810
GREGG MOZGALA:
When's your birthday?

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.040
MARINDA ANDERSON: July 17.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.406
GREGG MOZGALA: OK.

00:45:58.406 --> 00:45:59.780
MARINDA ANDERSON:
I accept gifts.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.280
Yeah.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.820
GREGG MOZGALA: That's right.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.020
MARINDA ANDERSON: Yes.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.740
Yes.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.480
And so that's my
extravagance right now.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.550
And it's great.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.270
It's great to have
a vacation planned.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.100
I never really do that.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.860
And it's something
to look forward to.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.660
So I recommend.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.578
I'm glad I was able to do that.

00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:18.210

or phrase that you overuse?

so many of them.

say "indeed" a lot, indeed.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.465
Like I say that, just like that.

know if I've heard you--

TIFFANY VILLARIN: Have
you heard me say that?

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.265
SHANNON DEVIDO: No, maybe
you don't do that because I

00:46:37.265 --> 00:46:38.536
have never heard you say it.

00:46:38.536 --> 00:46:39.910

I used to say that.

SHANNON DEVIDO: Just now.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.620

CORRIE DAVIDSON:
Or a word or phrase

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.600
you think other people overuse
that kind of grinds you.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.470
MARINDA ANDERSON:
Oh, I overuse yoss.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.984
I say yoss to everything.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.390

MARINDA ANDERSON:
Oh, well, good.

00:46:56.764 --> 00:46:58.050
That's why I say it.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.910
It is a support.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:59.365
It's affirmation.

00:46:59.365 --> 00:47:00.170
TIFFANY VILLARIN: It is.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.370

So that's why.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.782
And I use it for
everything, so yoss.

yourself the gift of Jamaica.

about to have a kid.

you were a candy bar,

this thing in high school

and having all of the
characters or most

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.690
of the characters as teenagers.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.930
How do you think
that affected the way

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:04.460
that you're telling this story?

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.690
And probably also, do
you think that that

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.550
might overshadow the
message that you're

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:13.660

GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.220
TIFFANY VILLARIN: I think
that what we've found

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.730
and what's come up in
talkbacks is the high school

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.930
aspect about the show.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:30.700
And I feel like we all had
that experience of high school,

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:36.520
and we all harbor traumas that
happened to us in high school.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:42.460
And I imagine, being in
the audience for the show,

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.230
it all just comes
right back as soon

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:47.170
as you see the set, and the
lockers, and the backpacks.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.960
And you're like, oh, I
remember that actually boy,

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.850
and I remember that weird girl.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:55.300
I feel like it actually
puts those of us who've

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:59.680
been through high school back
on that playing field, where

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.390
we remember what the
stakes felt like,

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.280
and what it was like
to be unpopular,

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.310
and to want to be
powerful, and trying

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.620
to find a way to do that.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:13.150
Now, actual high school kids,
I think, who've seen the show,

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:16.690
sometimes I feel like it's
too close to their reality

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.720
in a way, that as
adults, I think

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.950
we have the advantage of getting
to look back at it backwards.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.340
But for them, it's
closer to the bone,

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:31.540
and interesting too in that
way, where it feels potent.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.760
And Anne's storyline
in particular

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.870
is one that deals with--

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.230
no spoiler alerts--
but just deals

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.634
with some serious issues
for teenage girls.

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:45.550
GREGG MOZGALA: Issues
around sex and sexuality

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:46.570
in a very real way.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.680
TIFFANY VILLARIN: And I had
a conversation with a younger

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.600
woman in high school
who saw the show,

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.410
and it was serious for her.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.420
She was like, how did
you prepare for that?

00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.530
How did-- you know?

thanks for reminding me.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.450
This is reality out there.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.180
So yeah.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.710
That's a great question.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.620
GREGG MOZGALA: I
mean, I would love

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.227
to see this play
performed by people

00:52:12.227 --> 00:52:14.310
who are closer to the age,
if not the actual ages.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:15.560
I think there's room for that.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.490
But Mike and I
had-- the playwright

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:19.830
and I had a lot of
conversations back and forth

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.110
initially about who this
play is for and what

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.320
the type of audience is for.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.470
And again, the age range
has been pretty broad.

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.110
But this is what the
version of this play

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.350
is now, for its premiere.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:34.590
And it's based on
who started it.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.750
And I mean, I was far too old
to play it when the show started

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.070
or was first commissioned.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:45.150
But again, I think we agreed
because of Mike's language,

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.800
and people having an
availability and skill to do

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.420
that, we decided to go older.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.830
But there are plenty of
talented younger people

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:56.452
who could certainly play it.

00:52:56.452 --> 00:52:58.160
I think that would be
really interesting.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.510
Now, what's great, this play
will be out in the world.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:03.510
It has been launched.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.010
Right?

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.970
And that would be
up to Mike to decide

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.290
whether, if anyone approaches
him, high school, or college,

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.060
or whatnot, to do that, he
can give his blessing or not.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.840
AUDIENCE: I mean, I'm sure
high school would definitely

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.250
be willing to do this.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:27.440
And I will also say, your story
about the squeaking wheels,

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.560
as a high schooler who did
have to actually carry around

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.610
disability equipment, yeah,
that would probably make

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.200
it a little bit more realistic.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200
SHANNON DEVIDO: [LAUGHS]

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.910
TIFFANY VILLARIN: Oh, you like
the element of the loud wheels.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.150
SHANNON DEVIDO: It
was just very loud,

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.983
and you couldn't hear
anything I was saying.

00:53:43.983 --> 00:53:45.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that is a problem.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.600
SHANNON DEVIDO:
That was very funny.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.070
AUDIENCE: Definite-- that
would definitely help.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.765
In my case, it was visual
impairment equipment.

00:53:52.765 --> 00:53:54.360
It wasn't too in the way.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.997
But it was definitely
a hallmark of me.

00:53:55.997 --> 00:53:56.830
GREGG MOZGALA: Sure.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.250
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yeah, sure.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.880
GREGG MOZGALA: Very good.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.620
SHANNON DEVIDO:
That's really good.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.040
GREGG MOZGALA: Thank you.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.790
CORRIE DAVIDSON:
You have to draw

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.840
that line between total
reality and then achieving

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.945
for the stage or dialogue.

00:54:06.945 --> 00:54:12.110
SHANNON DEVIDO: We're not miked,
so it was a little too loud.

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:14.370
CORRIE DAVIDSON: So we
are actually at time.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.440
I just want to say
thank you guys so

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.300
much for taking the time.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.760
They have a show tonight
at the Public Theater.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.350
I highly encourage you all--

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.220
get tickets.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.210
Go watch the show.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:25.770
GREGG MOZGALA: We're
running through July 29.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:26.290
SHANNON DEVIDO: Yay.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:26.570
GREGG MOZGALA: Yeah.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:27.370
Come check us out.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.190
CORRIE DAVIDSON: It's a really,
really wonderful funny show.

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.029
So thank you, guys.

00:54:31.029 --> 00:54:32.070
GREGG MOZGALA: Thank you.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:32.670
Thank you.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.720
[APPLAUSE]
