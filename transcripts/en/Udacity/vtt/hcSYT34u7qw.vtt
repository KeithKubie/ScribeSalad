00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.440
So, if you think about what we just discussed. Definitely one

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.210
of the causes was the increasing product complexity. Products were becoming more

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.510
and more complex and software was replacing more and more, what

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.860
was before, provided by hardware components.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.160
Slow productivity growth was another problem,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.350
because programmers could not keep up with the additional complexity of

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.720
the software that they had to develop. I would like to say

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.480
there was lack of funding for software engineering research because I'm

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.230
a software engineering researcher, but that was not one of the reasons

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200
for the software crisis. Instead, it was

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.140
the rising demand for software. Again, more

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.060
and more software was being required and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.850
more and more software was replacing hardware.
