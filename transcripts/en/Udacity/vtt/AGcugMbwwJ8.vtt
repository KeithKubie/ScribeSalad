00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.420
When I say scrolling in parallel,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.820
what I'm really talking
about is Parallax Scrolling.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.260
And Parallax Scrolling as in we
have different layers of views

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.700
scrolling at different speeds.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.570
It's one way that we create the illusion
of depth in material, and it's really

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.590
easy to do with Recycler view when
targeting Honeycomb and above devices.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.570
Now our app will continue
to work on Gingerbread,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.720
just without Parallax Scrolling.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.120
Now we're only going to add this
scrolling into our phone landscape view.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.790
And it's easy to do this by
creating a view that can only be

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.240
found in landscape.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.680
Inside of our landscape frag bit main,
we'll rename at bar to parallax bar.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.410
Then inside of our Forecast Fragment
if we find parallax bar and

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.310
we're on at least Honeycombe, add an on
scroll listener to our Recycler view.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.420
The cool thing about recycler
view is that it unlike list view

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.430
actually returns the delta x or
y scroll.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.640
And this is perfect because we can
use this to set translation y to move

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.500
our parallaxview up and down in response
to the scrolling of our Recycler view.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.078
The regular list view does not actually
return you these delta coordinates at

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.960
all, and it's somewhat frustrating.
