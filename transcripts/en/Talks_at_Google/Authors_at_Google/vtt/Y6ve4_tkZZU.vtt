JULIE WISKIRCHEN: Hi everybody.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.380
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from
the Authors at Google team

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.260
in Los Angeles.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.440
And today, we're excited
to welcome Valerie Gordon.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.480
Valerie is a self-taught baker.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.200
And she opened
Valerie Confections

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.660
in Los Angeles'
Silver Lake District

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.430
in 2004 to immediate acclaim.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.530
Today, the company has expanded
to include three locations, as

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.380
well as a tremendous
online retail business.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.240
She's been featured in "Vogue,"
"House and Garden," "Newsweek,"

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.730
"In Style," "USA Today," "Bon
Appetit," "Food and Wine,"

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.065
"The Splendid Table,"
and The Cooking Channel.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.940
And today, she's here
to talk about her brand

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.631
new dessert cookbook,
"Sweet," and she's

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.130
going to teach as one of the
fabulous recipes from the book.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.403
So please join me in
welcoming Valerie Gordon.

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:45.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.120
VALERIE GORDON: I have a really
quick favor to ask everybody.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.320
Can you hold up your
copy of "Sweet"?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.930
I tweetered for the very first
time today, which is huge.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.570
This is going to be my
second tweeter ever.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.960
And you're all
going to be in it.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840
I'm really into this.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.620
OK, wait.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.120
Wait, OK.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.370
I have to press the thing.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.660
Someone had to text
me how to do this.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.740
And then I go, I do
the little quill thing.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.450
And then I'm supposed
to take a picture.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.150
"Sweet" up!

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.260
OK, and then I go like that.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.940
Oh my God.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.851
So cute.

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:23.870
OK, wait, wait.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.520
Hold it up.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.050
Hold it up.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.070
Hold it up.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.700
Go "Sweet."

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.580
Thank you.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.390
And everyone's going
to follow us, right.?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.428
Although I don't
know the handle.

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:36.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:37.885
VALERIE GORDON: OK,
it's @valerieconfctns.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.100
OK, and then I was
told I'm supposed

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.610
to do the geography thing so
people know I'm at Google.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.280
And then I go, OK, and
then I say, go Google.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.420
#gogoogle, right?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.170
OK, #gogoogle.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.080
Tweet.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.979
I did it.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.640
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.040
This is a thrill, I have to say.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.610
As I was telling Julie, when I
saw this visit on my itinerary,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.310
I got nervous.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.270
Because I'm literally
a fan of Google.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.140
And I would not have
been able to write

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.880
this cookbook without Google.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.830
And I can't tell
you how many times,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.930
while I was writing the
manuscript at like 2:00

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.520
in the morning, I
was like, oh God.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.170
How do I convert that?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380
Google helped me through it.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.370
Synonym for delicious.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.704
Synonym for moist.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.120
Where you're just
like, oh my god,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.030
I can't write that
word one more time.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.790
And there's just a
limit to the number

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.450
of times you can
write "moist cake"

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.210
and have it not
become kind of weird.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.980
So thank you.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.330
Thank you to Google.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210
Your offices are amazing.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.596
And this place is
totally inspirational.

00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:05.240
Has anyone here made jam before?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.910
Anyone?

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.970
Once, twice, three times?

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.150
OK, cool.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.910
So, I have a very
straightforward way

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.360
of making jam.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.360
And one my things about making
jam is that all you're doing,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.540
and what you need
to focus on most,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.770
is your main purpose with jam
is to remove water and implement

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.620
sugar.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.160
That's all you're doing.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.720
So this heating
process, all we're doing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.000
is helping the water evaporate.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.860
And we're breaking down
fruit and impregnating

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.010
what is left over with sugar.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.540
That's it.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.490
I am not an advocate of pectin.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.340
I think that pectin creates an
unnatural, overly gelatinous

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.970
texture, and detracts
from the fruit.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.850
We are incredibly lucky
here in Southern California

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.330
to be able to get just the
most gorgeous produce any day

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.040
of the week.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.930
You know, I talk to people
in the Pacific Northwest,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.940
on the east coast, and they're
like, you got what today?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.370
You got blueberries today?

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.520
That's bizarre.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.620
We have squash here.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.120
That's all we have.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.240
So here in sunny
Los Angeles, it's

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.304
like year round you can
make delicious jams.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.790
I also think one of the reasons
why jamming, marmalades,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.090
pickles, all this stuff
has become so popular

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.720
is because of where
produce is at today.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.230
Because we see these
farmers markets

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.640
in every neighborhood
every day of the week.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.580
And we get to take
advantage of it.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.370
So, jam.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.030
Today I'm making what I think
is pretty much the easiest

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.790
kind of jam that you can make.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.250
Anyone can do this.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.170
So all I did was I cut up
five pounds of strawberries,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.000
fresh strawberries.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.470
And my magic ratio
is five pounds

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.180
of fruit to four cups of sugar.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.030
That is a great starting point.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.490
And some of you who've
made jam before may say,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.990
that's a really low
amount of sugar.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.380
That's absolutely correct.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.230
Because jam should taste
like fruit and not sugar.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.900
And I use just enough for
you to safely preserve it.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.430
You know, sugar's like salt.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.690
Once you add it, you
can't take it out.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.220
So it's good to start low
and then slowly increase

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.050
as you're cooking and tasting.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.220
The way I generally
cook jams, the way

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.350
I advise to cook jams in
the book, is to macerate.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.490
Macerate means to let the
fruit sit for a bit of time

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.670
with sugar.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.350
What that does is that actually
reduces your cooking time,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.350
which is a really nice thing.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.930
The first few
times I made jam, I

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.419
had some very experienced
pastry chefs show me how.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.710
And I was just sort of curious.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.470
Like, what's your jam process?

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.180
What's your deal?

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.020
You know what I mean?

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.530
And I was shown some
rather torturous methods

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.150
for jam making, where you
stand over the pot for hours

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.020
and hours and hours.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.510
And this thing's like
splashing in your face.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.040
And I was like,
well, I don't really

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.600
have time to stir a pot
for two hours, personally.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.265
And most people don't.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:19.350
You know what I mean?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.200
It's like that's where
people sort of step away

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.580
from making things
to buying things.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.980
If you macerate fruit, that
will cut down your cooking time.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.240
It actually cuts down
your active time.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.620
And it tends to extract more
of the juices from the fruit.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.670
So while that sugar is
sitting with the fruit,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.870
with the prepared fruit, it
starts to break down the fruit.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.930
The sugars start to
come out of the fruit.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.270
So you get a really
great, full flavor.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.250
From there-- and what
I generally advise

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.580
is to macerate for an hour.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.420
You could also stick it in your
refrigerator for a day or two.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.780
So this can break up the
activity a little bit.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.850
Say you're making
strawberry vanilla bean jam.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.070
Say you're making plum jam.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.070
You're making peach jam.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.720
Whatever it is, say you've
got a half hour in your day.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.460
You can prepare the
fruit, mix it with sugar,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.810
cover it, put it in your
refrigerator for half a day,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.910
for a day.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.130
The next day, you come back.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.380
And then you cook it and
can it, or just cook it

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.290
and store it in
the refrigerator.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.280
I think it makes it just sort of
a more reasonable and realistic

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.150
process for those
of us that work

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.720
and have children
and have lives.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.720
Most people can't just
spend two days making jam

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.960
at their leisure.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.320
But that would be cool, but
most people can't do that.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.860
So right now, all I'm doing,
I have this on a high heat.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.330
And it's always good to
start at a high heat.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.600
We just want to break it down.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.450
We just want to break down the
fruit and get rid of the water.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.320
So we have to bring this
concoction up to boiling.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.960
That's the first
thing that we do.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.360
And you move it a little
bit, but again, you

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.810
don't have to stand
here and work yourself

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.250
into a massive sweat.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.320
Like there's a significant
amount of water in here,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.620
and it'll just start to
boil, almost like soup.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.200
And we just keep an eye on
it, stirring it occasionally.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:19.090
Right now, what I might do
is already take a taste.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.690
You always want to
taste as you cook.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.710
Put it in your mouth.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.340
Or else you have no
idea what you're doing.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.060
Don't wait until the end.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.690
Because if you're
making jam, whatever

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.440
it is that you're making,
don't wait until the end.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.630
Taste as you go,
taste as you go.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.429
And tweak in a way that's
most appealing to your palate.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.704
So that totally is enough sugar.

00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:44.370
So I'm not going to
do anything to that.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.900
I'm just going to totally leave
that alone and add our vanilla

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.400
beans.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.360
So vanilla beans,
these are great.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.740
These are gorgeous pods.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.230
And if you get them,
you want to break down

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.510
the vanilla bean a little bit.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.160
And by rolling it between
your fingers like this--

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.250
you do generally store vanilla
beans in the refrigerator.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.000
Let them come to
room temperature

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.650
before you start
to play with them.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.858
And then you want to roll
them a little bit like this

00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:11.780
to loosen the beans
inside from the pod.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.040
You can scrape the
beans off a lot easier

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.410
that way if you do that.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.660
So the whole thing,
top to bottom,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.230
I'm just rolling it
in my fingertips.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.970
And then you take the
sharp paring knife.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.300
And you just run it down
the center of the bean.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.335
And then you fan it
open, just like this.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.460
And then you want to
scrape out those beans.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.620
It's really, really pretty,
and incredibly aromatic.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.440
So we just scrape that out.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.800
And this whole thing
is going into the pot.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.340
The pod and the beans impart a
really wonderful, warm, sweet,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.640
delicious vanilla bean
flavor to this jam.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.220
And then we stir that in.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.304
If you're a big
fan of vanilla bean

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:08.720
and you're making
this jam, or you

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.320
decide to add vanilla bean to
whatever, and you're macerating

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.850
and you really want to see
a lot of that vanilla bean,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.350
you want to taste a lot of
that vanilla mean, put it

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.550
in a before you macerate.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.090
And that will increase the
amount of vanilla bean flavor.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.160
You can also put a vanilla
bean in a bottle of vodka.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.060
And it does a really
good thing if you

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.005
go in that direction, FYI.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.860
Any questions?

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.800
Any questions on jam making?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.480
On marmalades?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.250
On anything fruity?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.692
Yeah?

00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:49.547
AUDIENCE: Are there any jams
with pectin that you do use?

00:10:49.547 --> 00:10:51.630
VALERIE GORDON: I don't
use any artificial pectin.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.830
My jams are a
little bit, what you

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.400
would call in the
jamming community, loose.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.680
So that means they
move a little bit.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.540
I think that's OK.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.030
Fruit and sugar
move a little bit.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:14.050
What you can do in order
to naturally firm up

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.710
a jam or something like that
is to create a pectin sack.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.690
The way that you create a
pectin sack is by using lemons.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.830
Lemons and apples are
two things that naturally

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.970
hold an enormous
amount of pectin.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.070
And they will help
fruit and sugar gel.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.460
So you can either take
a bit of cheesecloth

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.610
and a few lemon seeds,
and some apple seeds,

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.110
and put them in the cheesecloth,
tie it up real tight,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.710
and put it into the jam pot
while you're making jam.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.700
And that will give
you a stiffer jam.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.250
An easier way to do this
is by using a tea ball.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.680
You can fill a tea
ball with lemon seeds.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.760
And that will help your
jam firm a little bit more.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.060
Just drop it right in.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.830
And the cheesecloth,
if you don't

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.020
tie it quite tight enough,
it could come open.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.960
Then you have lemon seeds
throughout your jam.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.350
And you don't want that.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.400
So as you can see, I'm just
moving this ever so slightly

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.360
around the pot.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.150
The one area you do want to
be careful of when you're

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.870
making jam, marmalade,
is the corner of the pot.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.390
That's where fruit
can tend to stick.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.100
So you want to get
into that corner.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.510
I also tend to use a
heat-proof spatula.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.750
Because you're covering a
greater surface area then

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.170
with a rounded, wooden
spoon, where you're just

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.060
getting that tip of
the spoon, Where here,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.190
I'm getting about 2 and
1/2 inches of pot coverage.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.330
And then I can just
keep it moving.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.730
I also recommend moving
in one direction.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.812
Because then you know that
you're stirring consistently.

00:12:55.812 --> 00:12:58.274
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
use raw sugar instead?

00:12:58.274 --> 00:12:59.940
VALERIE GORDON: You
could use raw sugar.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.246
You absolutely could.

00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:03.090
You could use brown sugar.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.310
You could use some other
sugars that I've played with.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.350
Honey gets tricky.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.180
I find agave syrup to be a
really, really interesting,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.570
natural sweetener.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.730
It is sweeter than sugar.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.420
So you have to play with your
levels a little bit with agave.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.896
And it won't firm up
quite as much in a jam

00:13:25.896 --> 00:13:29.270
as a normal sugar will.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:36.630
Mexican sugars, like all
of those sort of-- they're

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.740
these pyramid-shaped sugars.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.220
Someone else might know
something about that.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.580
But they have this really great,
caramelized, amazing flavor,

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.557
that if your pallet goes
in that direction, do it.

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:50.515
There are a couple of
recipes in the book where

00:13:50.515 --> 00:13:53.010
I blend brown sugar
and white sugar,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.870
just because the flavors
that are being played with,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.240
it brings out a
different kind of nuance.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.580
Again, if you are somebody
who likes citrus flavor,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.850
you can add lemon zest to this.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.960
And you'll get that note coming
out, which is pretty fun.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.680
Alcohol additions are really
nice things to do in jams.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.850
So if you like brandy,
if you like cognac,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.550
if you like any of
those kinds of flavors,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.370
adding those to the end,
think of it as an extract.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:24.870
Right?

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.370
Just like a really
subtle flavoring.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.790
If you like spice, throw
in a cinnamon stick.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.920
Throw in some clove to whatever
fruit you're playing with.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.900
The idea that I'm getting
to here, of course,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.180
is do whatever you want
to do with your jam.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.240
It's your jam.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.180
Have fun with it.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.380
Play with it.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.320
Everyone's got a slightly
different palette.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.300
And just have fun with it.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.940
It's such an easy thing to do.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.250
So easy to do at home.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.240
And then you have these
wonderful, fresh homemade

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.010
condiments that
you can play with.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:14:59.510
Anyone else?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.448
Yeah?

00:15:00.448 --> 00:15:02.793
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
start with fresh fruit,

00:15:02.793 --> 00:15:04.670
or could you use frozen fruit?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.020
VALERIE GORDON: You can
totally use frozen fruit.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.650
Absolutely.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.119
Defrost it and use it.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:10.910
You absolutely can.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.480
The water content will
be a little bit lower.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.440
There are a couple
recipes in the book,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.290
the fig recipes in particular.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.110
Figs have a very, very
low water content.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.990
So in order to cook
something, you need a conduit.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.490
Right?

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.010
The conduit being water.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.330
That is, the carrier of heat
that will help you break down

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.440
the fruit, or whatever
ingredient you're using.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.350
So you might need to add
a little bit of water

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.930
if you're using frozen fruit.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.790
You can also
rehydrate dried fruit.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:47.700
So say you're doing the
white fig, Fuji apple vanilla

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.730
bean jam that's in the book.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.700
And you've got your
gorgeous white figs.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.370
You went out you got a case
of these gorgeous kadota white

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.874
figs and you are ready to go.

00:15:55.874 --> 00:15:57.040
And they're like, oh my God.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.440
I don't have Fuji apples.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.500
But you've got some dried
apples in your cabinet.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.910
Soak those dried
apples in hot water.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.040
And you can hydrate them, and
then cook them in the jam.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.415
Apricots, you can do that too.

00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:15.743
A lot of dried fruits
can be rehydrated.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.380
Anyone else?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.140
See, oh.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.780
This is where we
need the camera.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.070
So this is bubbling up
really, really high right now.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.590
It's sort of-- is right there?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.680
It's starting to
roar a little bit.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.550
And this is where
we need to watch it.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:39.330
Because if it can bubble over--
and that's what we don't want.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.240
We don't want this huge vat
of jam to go bubbling over.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.640
So this is where
I'm watching it.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.500
And I'm just going to
see what plays out here.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.120
But you see, all the
water's just going away.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.750
It's all just going away,
which is pretty neat.

00:16:56.895 --> 00:16:59.370
AUDIENCE: If you're
adding rosemary or basil,

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.340
those kind of herbs,
do you recommend

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.110
dry versus fresh, and then at
what point do you put it in?

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.170
During maceration
or during cooking?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.839
VALERIE GORDON:
I'm a fan of fresh.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:15.700
I just think you're going to
get a fuller-- you will get

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.220
a fresher flavor from a
fresh herb or a fresh fruit.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.390
But again, if you don't
have it, go with dry.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.140
Something like rosemary,
I would be careful with.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.780
Rosemary is potent, as
is a bay leaf, much more

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.930
so than oregano
or basil or thyme.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.640
I would throw that
in in maceration.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.840
That's actually a
really interesting idea.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.650
Yeah, I would throw
that in in maceration.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.494
And then taste it.

00:17:50.494 --> 00:17:52.910
And then you might want to
take it out before you cook it.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.140
There might be enough
of that flavor in there.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.090
And then, just put it
back in in the finish.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:04.700
But if you are including
herbs in jams or any preserve,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.420
you would probably
want to remove it

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.940
before you process it.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.210
Because they will turn black,
which is not that cute.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.060
That doesn't look
quite as delicious.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.380
But like rosemary and pear
would be really, really good.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.090
That would be great.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.800
Anyone else?

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.005
AUDIENCE: So do you
store what you've

00:18:28.005 --> 00:18:32.404
made in the refrigerator,
or do you use water baths?

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.820
VALERIE GORDON: I
do a water bath.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.410
And there are instructions
for the water bath in there.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.340
And you can really use-- I
suggest getting a canning pot.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.560
You can actually use
any pot, any big pot,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.390
to use a water bath.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.840
And that is a way
to preserve it.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.050
The water bath
process, essentially,

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:56.200
after you put hot jam into clean
jars with rubber-sealed lids,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.420
you put it in there.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.010
And then you immerse it in
boiling water for 10 minutes.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:07.120
What that does is that
removes any excess air.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.600
It's sort of that heat pushes
the air out and seals the jar.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.760
And that makes it shelf-stable,
for most jams about 18 months.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.240
You can also just put it into
a jar, or whatever container,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.770
and refrigerate it.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.760
Depending on the amount
of sugar that you use,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.680
you'll be fine with
it in the refrigerator

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.555
anywhere from two
weeks to two months.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.320
[SNEEZE IN AUDIENCE]

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.480
VALERIE GORDON: Bless you.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.930
Bless you.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.460
Anyone else?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.837
Jams and marmalades are also
a really lovely holiday gift.

00:19:43.837 --> 00:19:45.670
Instead of buying
something on the internet,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.253
which there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:50.076
You know you can get a
nice book on the internet.

00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:51.700
But since you're all
at your computers,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.590
but sometimes it's nice
to get active, right?

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.680
It's nice to get active.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.251
So now can people
see what's happening?

00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:00.000
Is there a screen?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.250
No?

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:00.920
OK.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.720
So the bubbling is starting
to come down a little bit now.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.630
And what you'll
see at this point

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.340
is you'll start to
get a slightly darker

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.850
color happening.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.650
So we bubble up, and it all
turns like this white color.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.470
And then as it
comes down, you'll

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.340
start to see this concentrated
red color come out of this.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.130
And that's when you'll
know that most of the water

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.240
has gone away.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.060
And then we're just watching it.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.030
We're stirring.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.690
We're tweaking for flavor.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.640
We're tasting.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.639
Does anyone want to come taste?

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:35.680
Come taste where it's at?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.460
Ooh, shy girl.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.300
She's all, don't call me.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:45.185 --> 00:20:46.310
VALERIE GORDON: Hysterical.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.100
OK, Rosemary.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.090
Will you come taste?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.090
OK, so you're going
to let me know.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.400
Ironically, even though
my book is called "Sweet,"

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.170
I tend toward slightly
lower sugar in things

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.135
than a lot of people who
work in this field do.

00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:04.190
Do you see what's
happening there?

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.270
What's your real name?

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.020
AUDIENCE: Egregia.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.370
VALERIE GORDON: Egregia.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.250
Nice to meet you.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.885
AUDIENCE: I do like
the name Rosemary.

00:21:10.885 --> 00:21:12.010
VALERIE GORDON: Are you OK?

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's so good.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.740
VALERIE GORDON: You're
OK with the sugar level?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.061
VALERIE GORDON: OK, cool.

00:21:15.061 --> 00:21:17.640
Do you see it's getting
a little darker?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.630
Right.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.960
So we're just about
five minutes away.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.250
Oh, here's another thing.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.678
Thank you so much, Egregia.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.780
Way to taste.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.250
That was cool.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.320
OK.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.460
So people like chunky jam, and
some people like smooth jam.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.510
I go a little smoother than
the general population.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:48.990
I really like a really lovely
smooth, almost puree look

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.490
to jams.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.340
A lot of people
like a chunkier jam,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.520
where you can really
see the fruit.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.510
And when you put it on
bread, it's like a terrain.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.040
And they like it a little
bit more rustic, more country

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.510
style, neither is
right or wrong.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.880
Again, go with
whatever you feel like.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.110
If you are someone who
likes a really smooth jam,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.260
at this point I would
switch out to a whisk.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.630
And I would start whisking,
to just really break down

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.420
that fruit as much
as I possibly could,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.360
and remove any fibers from it.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.960
And then, it will
turn into a puree.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.650
So there's a few
jams in this book--

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.000
the black and blue jam
in particular-- you

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.490
just want to like,
whisk, whisk, whisk.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.534
Just to be careful, you do
want to turn off the heat

00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:42.450
while you're whisking.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.100
So you're not like-- the
potential of boiling sugars

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.410
flying in your
face is diminished

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.650
if you turn off the heat.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.345
Another note.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.390
I was told early in
my jam experimentation

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.910
that once you started
cooking, you couldn't really

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.865
turn it off.

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:02.740
You know what I mean?

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.490
You have to stand
there and stir.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.107
Turn it off.

00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:08.690
If you have to go the bathroom,
you need to take a phone call,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.340
turn it off.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.460
Walk away from it.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.440
Nothing happens.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.130
Nothing happens.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.060
I swear to God.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.930
I've done it over and over
and over, and nothing happens.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:26.480
I've gone, returned emails,
come back, same outcome.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.420
I was also told early in
my jam experimentation

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.100
that after you start,
you really can't

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.180
add more sugar, because it'll
crystallize and this and that.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.700
I've totally added more
sugar at any point.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.390
As long as you bring it up to
boiling, the sugar breaks down,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.300
and it all emulsifies
and it's a non-issue.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.350
So don't be scared of jam.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.380
Don't be scared of it.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.150
It's so easy to do.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.400
And this recipe in
particular, so easy to do.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.150
Totally interchangeable, also.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.160
So you could do it
with any kind of berry.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.500
You could do raspberry.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.060
You can do blueberry.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.520
You can do blackberry.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.220
You can do-- we get
golden raspberries here,

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.370
which are amazing.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.910
And they have this sort
of almost stone fruit

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.370
flavor to them.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.240
Gorgeous, gorgeous jam.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.420
Sweet, tart, wonderful.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.130
Berries, again, they're
sort of an easy place

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.150
to start, because
there's so little

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.830
preparation that you have to do.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.140
For most of them, all you
have to do is just rinse

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.220
and throw it in the pot.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.303
That's all you have to do.

00:24:34.303 --> 00:24:36.870
Very, very easy.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.750
And then you can also do
some savory applications

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.540
with jams, which is really nice.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.610
Strawberry vanilla bean jam
is great with goat cheese.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.260
Really, really good with
tart, creamy goat cheese.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.120
Delicious.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.830
Strawberry vanilla bean jam
with ham is really good.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.055
That's another fun little canape
that you can do, definitely.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.700
Doing your own fruit
at the bottom yogurt.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.290
Just get some good yogurt,
put your homemade jam on it.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.580
It's a very satisfying thing.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.420
Feels really nice to do that.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.270
Grapes?

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.380
Absolutely.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.860
Yeah.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.440
Grapes do get a
little bit tedious

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.010
if you get a grape with seeds.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.500
So it is not the easiest
fruit to start with.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.990
And also, like a
Muscat grape, you also

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.940
want to remove the
skin sometimes.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.410
So what you would have
to do with a grape jam

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.375
is sort of crush it.

00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:42.260
You know what I mean?

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.640
Some people like to
do it in a food mill,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.220
and then remove all the extra.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.670
But crushing it, working
through a colander,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.930
something like that.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.740
It's a little bit
more labor intensive.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.050
It could be slightly daunting
to a novice jam maker, I think.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:05.580
But just know that
going into it.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.760
Kyoto grapes do make some of
the most delicious jam ever.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.880
It's a very fleshy grape.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.300
So they have seeds in it,
but it's a really sort of-- I

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.220
mean, the grape
itself is like candy.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.290
[? Hawes ?] Farms that sells
at the Santa Monica Farmers'

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.580
Market has those grapes.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.390
They're also in Hollywood.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.240
Excellent, excellent grape.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.080
Yeah?

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.994
AUDIENCE: So when
you're tasting that,

00:26:30.994 --> 00:26:34.978
does the taste profile change
when you add the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:40.550
VALERIE GORDON: I'm sorry,
what was the question?

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.618
AUDIENCE: So when you
taste it, it's hot.

00:26:43.618 --> 00:26:49.096
Later on when you enjoy it at
temperature or [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:51.187
does the taste profile change?

00:26:51.187 --> 00:26:52.020
VALERIE GORDON: Yes.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.240
I would say, as a rule,
something room temperature,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.470
you have the
fullest flavor with.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.620
Because your tongue, right?

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.150
Your palate is
reacting to whatever

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.200
temperature is happening.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.900
Even though you might not want,
you can take like a custard

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.520
that you're cooking
or something.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.750
You taste more of the flavor
if it's room temperature,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.240
if it's a similar
temperature to your mouth.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.880
Right?

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.810
Because your mouth
isn't adjusting.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:26.240
Jams, likes soup, like a
stock, like most sauces,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.520
the flavor does come
out a little bit more

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.234
after it's sat for a few days.

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:32.733
Absolutely.

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:35.604
AUDIENCE: Now that I'm
more thinking about it,

00:27:35.604 --> 00:27:38.520
you are tasting whether
there is enough sugar,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.436
whether it is too
hard or too smooth.

00:27:41.436 --> 00:27:45.324
Does that actually change
from what you actually

00:27:45.324 --> 00:27:46.845
get after it cools down?

00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:48.220
VALERIE GORDON:
I don't think so.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.760
I know I don't think
that's fairly subtle.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.440
No, I don't think so.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.800
But you will get more of
the ride of the flavor

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.925
when it's room temperature.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.550
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
used chilies in any jams?

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.570
VALERIE GORDON: Totally.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.900
I like spicy Asian food.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:15.000
I go spicy Asian with almost
all of my personal savory eating

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.190
is where I go.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.330
Chili and fruit is a
fun, fun combination.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.220
And then, look at
barbecue sauce.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.740
Right?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.440
Barbecue sauce is a
jam, more or less.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.390
It's a tomato jam that's been
cooked down and cooked down.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.910
And then different spices
and flavorings and sugars,

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.810
molasses, have been added to it.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.660
You can, totally.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.440
Go for it.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.796
Chili and apricot
is a fun combination

00:28:44.796 --> 00:28:46.170
that you wouldn't
really suspect.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.650
Chili, apricot, brown sugar?

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.080
Delicious delicious.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.580
Yeah.

00:28:52.806 --> 00:28:55.014
AUDIENCE: For something like
strawberry or raspberry,

00:28:55.014 --> 00:28:59.960
if you wanted it to be
seedless, [INAUDIBLE] strained?

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.640
VALERIE GORDON: Again, that's
where you sort of walk down

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.370
the road of a tedious project.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.260
Yes, absolutely you can strain.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.770
Harder to strain a strawberry,
you know what I mean?

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.390
And the seeds are
so infinitesimal.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.370
And you'll see when you taste
this in a couple minutes.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.170
It's so minute.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.320
It's so minute.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.010
Raspberries, definitely.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.100
Some people just really
prefer a seedless raspberry.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.090
Your yield will be
much lower for sure,

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.180
because you're getting
the seeds out as well.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.750
Again, you're using like a
really fine mesh strainer.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.432
You have to work the fruit
over that to remove it.

00:29:38.432 --> 00:29:40.390
AUDIENCE: Do you do that
in the beginning, when

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.299
the fruit starts boiling, or?

00:29:42.299 --> 00:29:43.090
VALERIE GORDON: No.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.591
I would cook it
down a little bit.

00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:46.590
Now we're looking at a
totally different process

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.750
of jam making, though.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.710
So I would cook it a little bit
so you break down the fruit.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.250
Let it cool.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.260
Then go over a mesh,
extract the sugar

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.290
and the pulp of the raspberry.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.190
And then continue cooking.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:07.010
But yeah, that's your day.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.300
That's your day.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:08.880
Absolutely.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.020
OK, so now we've got some
pretty nice concentrated fruit

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.010
happening here.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.472
So now we're looking
for doneness.

00:30:18.472 --> 00:30:21.260
So I'm going to pick this up.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.200
This is not quite there yet.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.070
So what I like to
see at this point

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:30.670
is something kind of a little
bit thicker on my spoon.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.710
And this is still just
falling right off.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.670
I want to see something
just like a thicker

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.930
sauce on this spoon
before I stop cooking.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:44.230
So here we've gotten rid of the
majority of our excess water.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.270
And now, we're just
going for texture.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.190
This is done.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.650
You could pull this if you
wanted a really loose jam.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.170
You could pull this now.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.223
You could can it.

00:30:53.223 --> 00:30:54.380
You could serve it up.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.130
It would be absolutely fine.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:01.080
But I do like things just
a little bit thicker,

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.730
not quite as watery.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.710
And I'll show you on
this little plate,

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.740
there are couple of ways that
I outline in the book for you

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.530
to test your jam to
see if it's done.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.260
One is to do what
I just did, which

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.210
is dip a teaspoon
into the pot and just

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.130
see how it falls off the spoon.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.990
Things like plum jam, the
fig jam, stuff like that,

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.760
you'll see just a very clear
texture difference happening.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.280
The other sort of classic way
of doing this-- and you'll read

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.140
about this in all
the old books--

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.780
is putting a couple of
ceramic plates in the freezer.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.117
And then what you want
to see-- and then you

00:31:40.117 --> 00:31:41.950
take one out when you
think it's about done.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.780
You put a little bit
of jam onto that plate.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.600
And then you run your
finger through the jam.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.340
And if the jam stays
separate, it's done.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.760
You're simulating what the jam
will be like when it's cool

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.430
and not 370 degrees.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.000
But I find the more you do this,
if you just start to look at it

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.280
and you see it sort of appearing
as a slightly thickened sauce,

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.100
you're where you want
to be with your texture.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.890
And again, this is
a point of taste.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:17.180
Some people like a really thick
jam so it's almost like a pate.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.650
Just keep cooking it.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.420
Just keep cooking it.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.170
AUDIENCE: How do
you-- so far, you

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.420
were talking about one main
cooking ingredient, the fruit,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.920
and others like this.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.920
Is it some mix of
fruits actually

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.420
to use [INAUDIBLE] there are
some combination out there?

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.021
VALERIE GORDON:
Well, absolutely.

00:32:39.021 --> 00:32:39.520
Absolutely.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.580
I mean, come on.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.150
I mean, I wouldn't brush my
teeth and eat strawberry jam.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.670
There's certain things that like
with any other kind of food.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.580
And this is my general
message about making

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.500
desserts in general at home.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.690
And it's just like
savory cooking.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.570
There's really no
difference to it.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:09.700
So any flavors that you like,
feel free to put together.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.740
And then like when
you go to the market--

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.260
and I just can't encourage
all of you to do that enough,

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.320
if you're into food, if you're
into baking, whatever it is.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.130
Go to the market.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.590
Taste things together.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.930
Smell things together.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.600
And get a sense of what
you like to put together.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.150
One of the most unusual
flavor combinations

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.740
that I do quite frequently
is apricot and basil.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.940
They go so well together, it
is just the most amazing fruit

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.430
and herb combination
across the board.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.480
And I do it in
every configuration.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.770
A basil shortbread with apricot
jam, a basil panna cotta

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.450
with apricot jam.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.470
An apricot galette
with basil cream.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:59.810
It's a really shockingly
delicious flavor combination.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.130
A great role of thumb
with fruit is, what grows

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.140
together goes together.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.880
Things that are in
season at the same time

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.679
and grown in the same climate
generally taste good together.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.920
Apples and grapes?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.909
Same season, beautiful
combination, beautiful.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.510
You'll see it now.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.926
What grows together
goes together.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.010
All right, this looks good.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.100
This looks really good.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.719
So we are going to taste
just a very traditional-- OK.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:38.980
So we see now,
this looks thicker.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.730
I'm hoping you
guys can see this.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.880
And it's sort of cloyed.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.040
It wants to hang out on
the spoon a little bit more

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.360
when it comes down.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:54.455
And it's got this-- it's just
more viscous and less watery.

00:34:54.455 --> 00:34:56.159
So I'm going to turn this off.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.450
One other little
cautionary thing.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.510
When you turn off your jam,
when you go and make it

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:09.430
at home tomorrow, after
you have to turn off

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.180
the fire-- most of us don't have
induction units at home-- when

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.890
you turn off the fire, you
turn off the electric range,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.050
make sure you stir it
a little bit after.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.430
Because that's still
holding the heat.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:23.940
And it's really, really sad
when you burn your pot of jam.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.550
That's kind of a bummer.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.900
You know what I mean?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.870
And what you want to feel on
the bottom of your pot is slick.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.420
And this is one of
the other reasons

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.460
why I love a heat-proof spatula.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.520
And I think I should
get a sponsorship

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.690
with a heat-proof
spatula company,

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.940
is because you can really
feel the pot with it.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.800
You can feel like that
it's nice and smooth.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.820
There's nothing hanging
on to the end of the pot.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.870
Whereas just with
the tip of a spoon,

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.970
it it's hard to get
that same sense.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.790
So what we're
going to enjoy here

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.520
is some bread and butter
and strawberry jam,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.030
which is pretty cute.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.400
Come on up.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.630
So again, this is
a little bit looser

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.370
that it will be after it cools,
because this is pretty hot.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.310
But this is a cute trait.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.010
AUDIENCE: Valerie, where
are your three locations?

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.660
VALERIE GORDON: Our
original location,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.150
that we now call
The Mother Ship,

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.910
it is at 3360 West First Street.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.270
It's between Virgil
and Commonwealth,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.760
two blocks east of Vermont.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.490
That's where we manufacture all
of the chocolate, all the jams,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.620
all of the petit fours we
ship all over the country.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.580
The other two locations,
one is in Echo Park.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.170
That's our tea house and bakery.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.540
And the other one is that the
Grand Central Market downtown,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.370
which is currently
being refurbished.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.430
It's pretty exciting.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.296
Yeah.

00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:53.527
AUDIENCE: It's good.

00:36:53.527 --> 00:36:54.610
VALERIE GORDON: Thank you.

00:36:57.362 --> 00:36:58.070
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.830
VALERIE GORDON: Thank you.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.579
Thanks for coming.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.970
So you'll see it's a
very different experience

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.870
to enjoy this just-cooked
homemade jam than something

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.242
out of a Smuckers jar.

00:37:11.242 --> 00:37:13.200
No offense to Smuckers,
no offense to Smuckers.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.780
Just to give you all a little
bit of history of what I do

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.320
and the company and sort of the
genesis of the book, as Julie

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.620
said, I'm totally self-taught.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.550
I started baking when
I was eight years old.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.537
I never went to culinary school,
and I don't call myself a chef.

00:37:30.537 --> 00:37:32.370
People always say, well,
what do I call you?

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.960
And I say "Valerie."

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.110
Just something about
the word "chef."

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.400
I don't wear a coat.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.770
I wear an apron in the kitchen.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.590
I just cook.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.200
I don't know.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.280
I make things, and
most of them are sweet.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.640
And I hope that they're
pretty and that they're

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.050
delicious and memorable.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.220
Our company, my partner
and I-- my partner in life

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.820
as well as business-- we
started our little concern

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.510
9 and 1/2 years ago from an
apartment in the South Carthay

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.320
area of Los Angeles with
six flavors of toffee.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.766
I'd always made different sort
of confections and cookies

00:38:14.766 --> 00:38:15.640
and things like that.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.480
And primarily, we had done a
lot of this stuff for gifting.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.720
And we decided it was time
to start our own thing.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.780
So it was a very fun
startup, insane situation

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.450
where our second
bedroom was our office.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.560
Our dining room
was curtained off,

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.730
and that's where we did
packaging and ribboning,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.700
and we were storing
our chocolates.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.100
And you all will very
much appreciate this.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.690
In 2004, when we
started the company,

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:48.150
the only way you could place
an order was via fax or phone.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.290
And our order form for
these six flavors of toffee

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.780
was like four pages long.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.720
It had descriptions of each
flavor and the different box

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.670
sizes, and you know,
stuff like that.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.780
We did figure out a way to
take-- and it was like checks.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.090
It was personal checks.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.800
And that was kind of it for
our first holiday season.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.180
We've grown a little bit
since then, thankfully.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.355
And one of the ways that
we've grown is into a bakery.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.380
Julie asked that I
bring some cakes today.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.810
And the cakes that I
have here, I would say

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.740
are the most popular
cakes that we make.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.430
And one of the most interesting
and popular cakes that we make

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.120
is the Blum's
coffee crunch cake,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.660
which I am putting
crunch on right now.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.510
It is a historic cake.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.030
And this is one of
those cakes that

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:54.890
has an enormous amount of
emotional attachment for people

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.490
who grew up with this cake.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.330
There were Blum's Bakeries,
eight different locations,

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.810
in Northern and
Southern California.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:06.020
They were all gone
by the late '70s.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.750
And this is a cake
that I knew as a child.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.840
And it was a celebratory cake.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.550
I was asked to resurrected this
cake by a food editor in 2009.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:25.450
And because she was doing a
story for the Los Angeles Times

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.922
Magazine that, when
you're getting married,

00:40:28.922 --> 00:40:31.130
you should be able to have
any kind of cake you want.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.610
It shouldn't just be a white
cake with white buttercream

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.750
and a couple on top.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.209
Like, if you like
a hummingbird cake,

00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:38.500
you should be able to get that.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.916
If you like a coffee cake, you
should be able to get that.

00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:44.190
And she also was from San
Francisco, originally,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.210
and remembered the Blum's
coffee crunch cake.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.770
And when she said,
can you do this?

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.550
I was like, oh my God.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.460
I know that cake so well.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.260
I've had such an
overwhelming desire

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.590
to have that cake so many times.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.730
So it was sort of a thrill.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.150
And I tested the cake, tested
the cake, tested the cake.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:10.800
I did a lot of internet research
about different interpretations

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.850
of the cake that had
happened over the years.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.230
And after testing about
12 different recipes,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.600
I honed it down and
created my own version

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.980
of the Blum's
coffee crunch cake.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.190
And when this thing was in just
this little picture in the Los

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.240
Angeles Times Magazine,
the number of phone

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.650
calls we received
was amazing, amazing.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.590
And like every 60,
70, 80-year-old person

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.460
would had ever eaten this
cake called, and was like,

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.220
I remember this cake.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.770
I grew up with this cake.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.190
This is the most amazing cake.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.860
And we were flooded.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.430
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.230
This is a thrill, I have to say.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:56.647
[APPLAUSE]
