00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.090
So we've talked about push and pull queues now. But

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.750
what if you just want to do something at regular intervals?

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.670
For example, perform a backup, remove temporary files or send a

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.560
daily report at midnight every day. That's exactly what a Cron

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.980
job does. It's a scheduler. An app engine cron job

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.480
is very similar to a cron job in Unix, if you

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.556
have worked with that. So, cron is a scheduler within app

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:26.860
engine that allows you to specify tasks that are executed regularly.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.870
Cron is perfect to use to perform background tasks, which

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.690
are not directly initiated from user activity. For example, to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.980
run batch or synchronization jobs of different kinds and back

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.780
ups, etc. The cron job is very easy to configure

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.770
and there are two things you need to specify. First

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.390
of all, the URL that should be called. This is

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.220
where you place the code you want to execute and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.490
then you also need to specify the schedule which controls

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.150
when the task URL is called and as with the Queues there is a ten minute

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.710
limit for dynamic instances. If you want more

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.020
time than that, you can use resident instances.
