00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We started this Unit by looking into some fundamental ideas

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of finite elements and computational fluid dynamics.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These are two related and highly application-oriented field

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that of particular use in mechanical engineering.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The toy model of fluid dynamics left to the notion of deterministic chaos--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, but we saw that randomness

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
can be produced virtually out of nothing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then we look into a range of topics from software engineering--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
how can we build modules that can be mixed and matched, how can we reuse software,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and how do we calibrate and test simulations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These questions eventually led us to a little bit of philosophy,

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and now it's time to apply all of these in the final exam.
