BORIS: Welcome, everybody,
to one more Authors

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.210
at Google talk.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.650
Today with us is Seth
Siegel, whose new book,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.580
"Let There Be Water,"
has just been published.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.329
Seth Siegel is a writer,
activist and serial

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.230
entrepreneur.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.670
He's the author of the New
York Times best selling book,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.735
"Let There Be Water,
Israel's Solution

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.100
for a Water-Starved World."

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.969
Siegel's essays on water
and other policy issues

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.260
have appeared in "The New
York Times," the "Wall Street

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.020
Journal," the "Los
Angeles Times,"

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.040
and the leading publications
in Europe and Asia.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.100
Siegel is the co-founder
of several companies,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.300
including Beanstalk, the
world's leading trademark brand

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.660
extension company.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.740
He's a member of the Council
of Foreign Relations.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.940
Siegel is married and
lives in New York City.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.010
This book is a timely book for
us people living in California.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.000
Obviously, there's been a
very dry couple of years.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.450
But I wanted to say one
more thing about the book.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.390
It may sound that it
applies only to water.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.630
I went through the book,
and this book actually

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.980
applies to all sorts
of hard problems

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.870
that societies may face.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.470
And so the techniques
and recipes

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.420
and methodologies that
are presented in the book

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.670
apply well beyond just
the problem of water.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.732
With this, please welcome
Seth Siegel to Google.

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:23.106
SETH SIEGEL: Thank
you very much.

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:27.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.780
Hi.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.260
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.670
I would take a second to
tell you the story of how

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.020
I came to write this book.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.870
Boris, in his kind
introduction, mentioned

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.450
that I'm a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.540
And about three
a half years ago,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.370
I would happen to be
randomly at a session

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.910
there when I learned that
there was a coming global water

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.450
crisis.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.949
And I thought to myself, I'm a
pretty well-informed citizen,

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:54.060
how come I'd never
heard that before?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.386
And I thought it might
be that maybe there

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:57.885
was a gap in my
reading, or maybe it

00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:59.450
was a gap in the media.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.910
But whatever was, I was eager
to find out a little bit more.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.900
I went back to my office.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.190
And since I am here
at Google, I can

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.380
say I went onto Google,
my favorite search tool,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.050
and started-- I won't use
the word inappropriately--

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.730
I started utilizing Google
to find what I could learn

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.630
about the coming water crisis.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.350
And during this presentation
that I sat through,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.210
the speaker was an
interesting fellow.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.980
He was a retired
Air Force general

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.900
who now served in a leading
position in the National

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.860
Intelligence Council
in Washington, DC.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.854
And he had just
completed a project,

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:45.270
which had been
classified and then

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.560
had just been
declassified, that came

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
to conclude that 60% of the
world's land mass and 40

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.470
of our 50 US states would,
by the year 2025-- which now

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.480
is only 10 years away--
would be experiencing

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.194
some degree of water scarcity.

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:05.610
Now, this was before anybody
was thinking about or talking

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.420
about the California drought.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.530
So this was not sort
of uppermost in my mind

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.590
at the time.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.170
What did occur to me, though,
is that if we have a problem

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.340
coming of such
extraordinary scale

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.340
as 60% of the world's land mass
is going to face water scarcity

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.380
and 80% of the United
States were going

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.930
to have water
scarcity issues, it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.780
struck me as essential
that our policy

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.890
makers and concerned citizens
should know about that.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.510
And I thought to
myself, if I don't

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.840
know about this, probably
lots and lots of other people

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.810
who I thought should know
about it don't know about it.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.129
And so of the following
days and weeks,

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.170
I did a couple of things.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.430
I continued utilizing Google as
a search vehicle for-- I love

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.250
this new terminology I'm
using, rather than "-ing"

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.850
at the end of that word.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.500
I found myself
continuing to read more,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.805
but I also found myself
asking well-informed friends

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:01.670
and some public
officials who I regard

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.080
as friends and colleagues.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.500
I started asking them
to explain to what

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.776
degree they understood the
water problems that we had

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.650
that were coming, and
what they understood we

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.330
needed to do to get out of it.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.990
And what I was not so
surprised to discover

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.930
was that the level of
awareness was practically

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.920
at the exact same
level as the level

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.310
that I had just a
few days earlier when

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.940
I heard the exact
same frightening news.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.350
So here's what seems
so strange to me,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.580
that when we have
a water main break,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.457
and it leads the evening
news in our town,

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:36.790
we think about water for a
day, because maybe water gets

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.290
shut off.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.085
Or when E. coli gets
into our water supply,

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.460
and we have to boil everything,
we think about our water.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.360
Or when there's a pronounced
and prolonged drought,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.240
we think about it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.380
But if, in fact, this guy's
presentation was so daunting--

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.880
and I'll get into,
in a moment, some

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.338
of the reasons why
he said we would

00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:55.544
be facing these
problems-- and it

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:59.145
was going to be so prolonged,
why are we not doing more,

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:02.600
and why are we not asking of
our public officials to do more?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.280
So what I learned
in the coming days,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.980
after I began doing
some more research,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.870
was that this is
a serious problem.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.050
It's going to get worse.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.426
It's going to get worse
widely, but that we're not

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.300
in a situation, necessarily,
where it will be

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.320
we're doomed for a "Mad Max,"
if you saw that movie, kind

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.220
of end of days, where
everything will be desert

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.330
and we'll all be
fighting over water.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.560
And the reason why I
came to conclude this

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.900
is that there's a model for
somewhere in the world where

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.410
water actually is well
managed, and that is Israel.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.730
So Israel is 60% desert.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.870
It has about the world's
fastest-growing population.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.790
It's grown tenfold in population
since independence in 1948.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.330
It has among the world's
fastest-growing economies,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.340
growing 70-fold also in
that same time period,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.390
which is just remarkable.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.180
Because generally
speaking, when you

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.250
look to see if a country's
going to have water problems,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.990
you think of a couple
of different metrics.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.230
One is population growth,
two is economic growth.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.070
And in both of
those, Israel should

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.219
be in the red zone of problem.

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:07.760
The third area that
you might look at

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.830
is what is the natural amount
of rain or water that you have.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.970
And Israel, because
of climate change,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.450
had fallen in amount of
annual rainfall by about 50%

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.990
in the years since
1948 until present.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.010
So you put all that
together, and you find out

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.420
that Israel has such
an abundance of water

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.172
that it finds itself
now able to export water

00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:33.130
to its neighbors in the
West Bank, Palestinians

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.754
in the West Bank,
neighbors in Gaza,

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:37.670
and to the Kingdom of
Jordan on the other side

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.430
of the Jordan River.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.031
So it seems almost
incomprehensible

00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:43.280
that they are able to do that.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.290
And then you learn
a little bit more,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.770
you discover that they have
a robust multi-billion dollar

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.890
agricultural export industry.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.220
Now, what is
agriculture, basically?

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.562
It's valuated water.

00:06:55.562 --> 00:06:58.020
We don't think of it in those
terms, but that's what it is.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.300
It's valuated water.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.690
And only a country
that would be so

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.950
comfortable and confident that
its water future was secure

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.720
would think to build a large,
broad-based agricultural

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.225
industry that does more than
just feed their own people.

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.474
And yet, Israel had done that.

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:16.640
So I became curious as to
how and why that happened.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.430
So I want to share
with you a little bit,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.834
and given the interest
by the audience,

00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:22.250
obviously, open
it up to questions

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.500
and have some
conversation as well.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.490
So it starts quite
a long time ago.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.780
What we know is that
not in every case,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.010
but in many cases, what people
want, what people focus on,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.190
is what people will achieve.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.330
And so why has Israel
been a success in water,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.420
where other parts of
the world have failed?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.350
So let me start with a little
bit of historical perspective.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.190
The founding prophet of Israel
was not David Ben-Gurion

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.420
or Chaim Weizmann, the
first President and Prime

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.790
Minister of the country, but
a man named Theodor Herzl.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:01.320
Herzl was a largely assimilated
Jew living in Austria.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.995
He was a novelist, a playwright,
an essayist, and a journalist.

00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:10.240
And he got assigned to
cover the Dreyfus trial

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.410
in the late 1890s
in France, where

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.450
he learned of a French officer
who was railroaded, framed,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.355
and sent off to a terrible
fate because he was Jewish,

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:21.980
a Jewish officer
in the French Army.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.450
And this had a remarkable and
galvanizing effect on Herzl.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.870
He had this epiphany,
this remarkable moment,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.610
where the salvation of the
Jewish people, he said,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.059
would be their own homeland.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.990
And that's where the Zionist
idea, the political idea,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.320
political Zionism begins.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.877
Now what's remarkable
about that--

00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:42.460
and I won't get back
to Herzl further,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.360
but I just want to give you
some context for who he was

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.860
and how important he is in
the consciousness of Israelis

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.400
today.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.410
Herzl writes-- as I
said, he was a novelist--

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.600
Herzl writes a series
of essays and novels

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.390
trying to describe
this new land that he

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.185
envisions some years hence.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:00.920
And he writes a book
called "Altneuland."

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.200
And in this book, in the voice
of one of the main characters,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.010
a protagonist, he has
him say that the heroes

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.670
of the new country will be
the water engineers, which

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.540
I found absolutely remarkable
when doing my research

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.040
and reading.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.900
Why?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.350
Because why would somebody
think, writing in 1902,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.590
that the heroes of a country
that he couldn't even

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.240
imagine when it would be formed
would be the water engineers?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.010
And I'll share
another small insight

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.250
with you as well about this.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.270
And that is that
the other day, I

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.970
had reason to reread
the Nobel Prize

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.540
lecture given by Yitzhak Rabin.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.130
Yitzhak Rabin had been
the highly decorated

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.730
Israeli soldier, he
had been the chief

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.970
of staff of the Israeli
Army during the Six-Day War.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.970
And Rabin, after
his military career,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.350
ends up going into politics,
and on several occasions,

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.225
was elected as Prime
Minister of the country.

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:59.580
He was a hero, much beloved,
and assassinated a few years

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.700
after winning the Nobel Peace
Prize, by a Jewish terrorist.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.220
Rabin, in his Nobel
Prize lecture,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.770
says, I did not mean
to become a soldier.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.520
I did not need to carry a gun.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.200
My plan, when I was a boy, was
to become a water engineer.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.680
So once again, we find
that here are people,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.870
from the earliest days
of the state to the more

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.710
contemporary days of
the state, thinking

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.280
to themselves about how water
plays a part in society.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.830
And so the good news is that
water is not just water.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.140
Water plays a large
role in the economy.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.100
Water plays a role in
society, in the way

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.280
we organize
ourselves, in the way

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.510
we make options and choices of
what's most important and less

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.360
important in our society.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.450
And in the case of
Israel, that exercise

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.460
has been ongoing from the
first days of the state

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.390
through today.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.780
I'll tell you some of the
successes they've had,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.160
but first I'd like to tack
back and tell you a bit more

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.019
about what I learned,
and why we're

00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:57.310
going to a global water crisis.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.435
So you shouldn't think that
I'm some alarmist who's

00:10:59.435 --> 00:11:03.740
out you're just trying to
hawk a book about water.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.980
So there are a handful of macro
reasons why we are on our way

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.620
to a problem, the first of
which, and most obvious,

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.920
is just simply the
numbers-- population.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.440
We are globally, right now,
about 7 billion people.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.920
The UN estimates are that we're
going to 9.6 billion people

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.040
over the next couple of decades.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.602
So if we're already stressed
on our water supplies globally,

00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:33.060
I'm not just speaking about
the US or California right now,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.770
but if we're speaking about
our global water supplies,

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.470
and we're already
stretched-- and I'll

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.560
get into somewhat more so
some of the worst places where

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.727
we are most stretched where
they need it the most.

00:11:42.727 --> 00:11:44.560
If we're already
stretched, how in the world

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.630
are we going to do
it, and provide water

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:52.489
for cleaning, for sanitation,
for health, for food,

00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:53.030
for drinking?

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.696
How in the world are we going to
provide that when we're already

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.700
as stretched as we are?

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.900
And here's the other piece
of news about population.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.540
We're not just growing larger,
we're growing more affluent.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.900
And one of the surest indices of
affluence is water consumption.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.680
And that's not because of
Jacuzzis in your backyard,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.760
or because you take an
extra-long hot shower,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.480
although that surely
adds to the equation.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.230
The problem about
affluence is twofold.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.800
One is diet, and
the other one is

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.570
the key part of your lifestyle.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.750
To be middle class, some of
us may be vegan, some of us

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.830
may be vegetarians, but in
the main, people who are poor

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.600
don't have animal-based
diets, and in the main,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600
people who are affluent do.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.640
Now, this has the larger
implications than just water.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.360
But for example, to
take a pound of corn

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.290
and grow that versus
raising a pound of beef--

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.620
and plenty of people, either
you yourselves or people

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.570
who you know have beef
on a regular basis.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.340
And probably very
few of you just

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.270
have some corn tacos as your
sustenance on a regular basis.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.960
So a pound of corn versus a
pound of beef, a pound of beef

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.820
is 17 times more
water consumptive

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.840
than a pound of corn.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.050
So once again, if a
billion new people

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.770
are going to come middle
class around the world,

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.930
that's a lot of cheeseburgers.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.470
That's a lot of people
having a diet very

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.730
different than their
grandparents and parents had.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.170
And that's going to consume
massive amounts of water that

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.070
currently have not
been identified.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.310
Now the bogey, the
boogieman in all this

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.367
is clearly climate change.

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:27.950
We don't know how
extensive it's going

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.880
to be, we don't have
deep it's going to be,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.970
but we know it's here.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.540
And whether you are a believer
that climate change is

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.557
man-made or not man-made
that's irrelevant to me.

00:13:36.557 --> 00:13:38.390
That's not part of this
conversation, that's

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.848
not part of the
debate, and I don't

00:13:39.848 --> 00:13:42.000
need to get part
into that discussion.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.760
What I do need to say is that
climate change, of course,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.140
is just statistically a reality.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.440
Surface temperatures are
higher in many places,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.360
and even where rainfall
is identical in volume

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.610
to what it has
been historically,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.160
the intervals between
one rain to the next rain

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.770
are now longer.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.012
The soil is harder
when the rain hits.

00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:03.720
It doesn't get absorbed
into the aquifer,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.320
into the underground
storage facilities

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.120
that nature gives us.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.550
And therefore, we lose as
much as 90% of the rainfall

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.160
now because these
intense rainfalls

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.730
come at longer intervals after
the hard pack of the soil.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.240
So climate change
is another factor

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.100
is that rain is
not being absorbed.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.837
It's less rain in
much of the world,

00:14:22.837 --> 00:14:24.920
and the rain is not being
absorbed in the same way

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.370
in much of the world as well.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.700
And then let's talk
about pollution.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.670
We are increasingly and
globally industrialized.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.290
And what does that mean?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.360
It means that in making this
carpet, and making this podium,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.240
and making these chairs,
there's all kinds of chemicals,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.840
and it's all kinds of water
being used in that process.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.265
Now although we have a
very good regulatory regime

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:47.510
here in the United States
with the Clean Water Act,

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.140
inevitably, some
types of chemicals

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.240
end up finding their
ways into our water.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.520
Whether it's the
discharge from pills

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.180
that we all take,
that many of us

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.540
take, whether it's from
hairsprays, or creams,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.790
or soaps, or shampoos that
we have that get washed

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.900
into our water systems,
our water systems

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.890
are increasingly being polluted.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.190
And therefore, water,
large amounts of water,

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.580
are being taken offline.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.200
And if this is not as grave a
problem of the United States,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.700
although it is a problem
in the United States,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.116
while it's not as grave of a
problem in the United States,

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.320
I want to tell you it
is as grave a problem

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.610
as there is in Asia, China,
and India in particular.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.810
We're talking about
billions of people

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.180
who have highly tainted water.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.060
And I'll share just two more
macro things to mention.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.850
One is infrastructure.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.990
To a degree that I'm sure
almost nobody here is aware,

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.400
we lose incomprehensibly large
amounts of water every day

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.760
all over the world,
even here in the US.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.540
So for example, on average,
we lose about 30% of our water

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.129
to leaks and infrastructure
failures here in the US-- 30%.

00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:57.420
So think about what that means.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.060
Water that we pump,
water that we clean,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.670
water that's ready to go into
your home, into your office,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.470
into your factory, whatever it
is, gets lost along the way.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.860
Now here in California,
18%-- one-eight percent--

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.140
of the state electricity bill
goes to the sourcing of water,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.650
the pumping of water,
the cleaning of water,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.600
and the discharge
of water-- 18%.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.690
So 30% of that 18%
is lost, meaning

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.200
that lots of carbon fuels
are emitted, lots of water

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.940
is wasted needlessly,
lots of expenses incurred,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.640
because we have a
failed infrastructure.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.330
And this is the case
all over the world.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.094
We talk a lot about
our crumbling bridges,

00:16:38.094 --> 00:16:39.760
we hear our presidential
candidates talk

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.030
about our crumbling bridges,
and our crumbling roads,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.070
and our national infrastructure.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.100
But we hardly ever hear
anyone talking about

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.110
are crumbling water
infrastructure.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.200
And that needs to change.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.480
We need to make this a higher
priority of our elected

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.000
officials.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.440
And then the final
macro condition

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.900
I'd like to mention to
you all is urbanization,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.480
and why is that relevant.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.560
Around the world,
many people are

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.115
leaving their small villages
and farms and moving to cities.

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:07.400
And cities are growing outward
larger and larger and larger.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.589
And why is that relevant?

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.530
Because what makes up a city?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.359
A city is concrete, and
asphalt, and glass, and metal.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.880
And what is the common
trait of all of those?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.310
Impermeability, water
tightness-- and that's

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.710
good for those of us who
are inside on a rainy day.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.670
We don't want to be living
in a tepee when it rains,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.069
and we're getting
wet every which way.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.130
But the bad news
for our water supply

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.320
is that then there's
an impermeability also

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.730
to the soil below us.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.977
And water gets run off,
and goes to the sea.

00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:41.060
So let me take a few minutes
and talk a little bit

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.190
about what it is that the
solution is to all of this.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.820
And in each and every
case, the lesson is Israel.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.910
Now I want to hasten to add
two very important things.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.300
First of all, not everything
that Israel has done

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.787
is necessarily relevant to
everywhere in the world,

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.245
because Israel is
a small country--

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.880
I have some maps
here, during the Q&amp;A,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.930
maybe I can show
you some details.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.650
Israel is a small country.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.710
So therefore, just
in terms of scale,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.250
it doesn't do what
needs to be done

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.530
in some grand, large places.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.280
And the second
thing I want to say

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.960
is that Israelis are not
supermen and superwomen.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.390
What they are is they're
focused on a matter,

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.600
they think about a lot,
they care about it a lot,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.500
and they have prioritized
this for a very long time.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.000
And because they
have prioritized it

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.333
for a very long time, because
they have dealt with water

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:37.390
scarcity for a very long time,
what this means is that as now

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.690
the world is going into a period
with larger population, more

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.850
affluent population, more
polluted water, climate

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.430
change, less water, less water
flow-- what this means is

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.890
that the world now will have
to face a situation very much

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.570
like what Israel has been facing
since it first started thinking

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.105
about water in the 1930s,
even before it was a state.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.730
Now I'm not going to go into now
the historical reasons and all

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:00.970
that.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.652
We can do this either
in the Q&amp;A and I

00:19:02.652 --> 00:19:05.250
have a chapter in the
book that discusses that.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.900
But I will say that most
of what Israel has done

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.900
is relevant in at least
one very profound way.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.370
And that is the focus
and the planning.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.815
So what Israel
does is, as I said,

00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:17.630
at a very high
level of government,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.380
this is something that
people think about.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.810
In corporate life
in Israel, they

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.200
think about water in a way
that we don't yet here.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.370
We will, but not yet.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.789
But until we do
that, until we have

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:29.330
widespread thinking
about this issue,

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.788
we're not going to
be in a position

00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:33.100
we're going to fix this,
because societies are always

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.819
fighting for scarce resources.

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:36.235
Does the money go
to more schools?

00:19:36.235 --> 00:19:37.310
Does it go to more military?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.434
Does it go to more bridges?

00:19:38.434 --> 00:19:40.030
Does it go to more water?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.394
And we have to influence that.

00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:44.310
I think the most significant
thing that Israel

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.360
has done, aside
from the technology,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.600
which I'll talk about at
some length in a moment,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.622
is that Israel has radically
transformed agriculture.

00:19:53.622 --> 00:19:55.080
When I talk about
this in the book,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.947
I refer to it as
revolutions on the farm.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.530
And I'll talk about
a couple of things

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.390
that Israel has
done in particular.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.550
First thing is,
around the world,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.730
where fields are irrigated-- and
the city dwellers don't think

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.400
about the farm that
much, but we have

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.690
to, because this is
where our water goes.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:15.600
On average, 70% of the globe's
water goes to agriculture.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.600
That's what it is in the United
States-- 70% of our water

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.470
goes to agriculture.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.700
And so we have to think about
what techniques are we using.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.130
Are we smart about our water?

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.962
Are we dumb about our water?

00:20:26.962 --> 00:20:28.670
And I would argue that
a lot of our water

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.850
is really wasted water.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.830
Specifically, the phrase
"flood irrigation," it

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.225
goes back to the dawn of time.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:38.320
It goes back to the Nile River.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.930
And so what was done?

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.440
You build channels, you build
canals, you build trenches,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.222
and you divert river water,
or you divert lake water.

00:20:47.222 --> 00:20:49.430
Or you, if you have enough
technology to have a pump,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.060
actually, you flood
a whole field.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.210
You peg your seeds down, and
you flood the whole field.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.850
And then some
percentage of the water

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.320
finds its way to the roots.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.960
It nourishes the plant, and
then the rest of the water

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.910
either dribbles pointless
into the soil, or more likely,

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.277
evaporates up into the sky.

00:21:06.277 --> 00:21:06.860
And it's lost.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.360
More than half gets lost.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.010
More than 60% of
it's lost, actually.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.870
So Israel invented a system
called drip irrigation.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.150
And what is drip irrigation?

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.070
Just as the name implies, as
flood irrigation implies it,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.160
drip irrigation is a system that
places generally subterranean,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.470
below the soil-- but that would
not be a very good photograph.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.679
So I have a photograph
of one that's on land.

00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:31.970
You can see these little tubes.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.219
You may have seen them maybe
in somebody's garden here

00:21:34.219 --> 00:21:36.530
and there, these little tubes.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.930
And they have very
tiny drippers.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.740
And the drippers drip
at regular intervals

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.440
right at the base of the plant.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.790
And as the water is absorbed
into the plant, and just enough

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.740
is used to nourish the plant.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.282
Now this is such an
effective device.

00:21:52.282 --> 00:21:54.115
And I wasn't planning
on talking about this,

00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.170
but I just want to throw
it out, since I'm here.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.270
One of the great reasons why we
have so much polluted waterways

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.145
in the United States
is because farmers

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:02.900
and the need for ever
greater amount of yield

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.984
are planting on ever
more marginal soil.

00:22:05.984 --> 00:22:08.650
So what they're doing is they're
using more and more fertilizer,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.570
and more and more nutrients
to add to the plant.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.190
Now why is that a problem?

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.090
That's a problem because
when the rains come

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.925
at the end of the season,
the leftover fertilizer,

00:22:18.925 --> 00:22:21.340
the leftover nutrients
get washed away,

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.840
get washed into rivers,
and they remain there.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.280
And that's when you have
these algal blooms that

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.630
become terrible problems.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.120
It's the nitrogen,
it's the fertilizer,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.910
that becomes utilized as
feedstock for the algae.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.675
And it blooms, and it
destroys waterways.

00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:42.640
It kills off fish, kills off
plant life, and so forth.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.200
But these long devices,
these drip irrigators,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.540
are able to grow plants
in a most remarkable way,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.650
because you can turn
to liquid your nitrogen

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.400
and your other fertilizer, and
you can drip very tiny amounts.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.140
You see the soil
here, this is not

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.050
high-quality Midwestern soil.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:09.250
So in Israel, you can actually
grow this in the desert.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.490
And this is a desert picture.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.130
You can see in the
far area the desert.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.190
And you can see in
the near area where

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.660
the desert has been reversed
by use of drip irrigation

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.320
on sandy soil, like beach soil.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.421
It's not soil, it's just sand.

00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:26.670
And what they do is they
have these tiny drippers that

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.530
have water and nutrients.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.800
And this is a way to
turn useless areas

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.341
into valuable
areas for countries

00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.340
around the world at a
time when food security is

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.450
going to become a problem.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.090
So drip irrigation
is one great solution

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.090
to our agricultural problem.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.240
A second solution is
the reuse of sewage.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.620
Israel made a decision
in the early 1950s

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.850
that sewage was too valuable
to simply treat and dump.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.570
So let me tell you
what we do here,

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.330
what we do right here where
we're sitting right now.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.860
Sewage, in case
you don't know what

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.330
it is, is the water
that comes out

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.700
of your shower, your bath,
your sink in your kitchen,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.550
your sink in your bathroom, your
washing machine, your dryer,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.922
and, sorry to say, your toilet.

00:24:10.922 --> 00:24:14.420
It gets flushed, it gets
flooded out of the house,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.660
it reaches a sewage pipe, it
all comes together in one place.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.010
And under the US
Clean Water Act,

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.806
it's treated to an
ultra-high level.

00:24:21.806 --> 00:24:23.180
It's fairly
expensive to do this.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.420
It's treated to an
ultra-high level

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.740
so that you almost could
drink it if you had to.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.074
Wouldn't want to do a lot of
that, but you almost could.

00:24:30.074 --> 00:24:32.531
And then what do we do in the
United States with almost all

00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:33.120
of that water?

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.200
What do we do with
it right here?

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.600
We dump it in the Pacific Ocean.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.840
Why?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.420
It's perfectly
good, usable water.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.020
No one is being asked to put
it into a drinking bottle

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.710
and drink it, but
certainly it's good enough

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.029
to grow cotton with, or
alfalfa, or other crops.

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:52.320
So in Israel, they made the
decision in the early 1950s

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.470
that they were going to
build a parallel plumbing

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.010
system, a national
infrastructure

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.560
separate from their
clean water system,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.120
separate from their sewage
system, that would take

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.870
the water after treatment,
and instead of dumping it

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.880
in the Mediterranean, they
would then relocate it

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.300
to where farms and fields are.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.190
So think about golf
courses that are sucking up

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.390
massive amounts of
fresh, clean water

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.950
at a time when we're
running out of water.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.160
Think about the fact of how
many fields there are that suck

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.770
water out of aquifers.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.520
And we are running
out of aquifer water

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.400
all over the country,
and all over the world,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.720
because we're not
using our sewage

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.000
water in an intelligent way.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.460
Now this sounds
like sort of a-- I

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.876
don't mean it in a funny way--
it's sort of a dry subject.

00:25:36.876 --> 00:25:39.679
But coming to this decision
was a heroic decision.

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.220
Feeling comfortable
with transforming

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.300
your national agriculture
with drip irrigation

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.320
doesn't come easily.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.080
It's a heroic decision.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.230
Heroism, inspiring
stories, are overcoming

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.719
what seems like
insurmountable obstacles.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:55.760
And something that Israel
did, and it's something

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.521
that we can do.

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.020
We can not only
improve our economy,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.780
we can feel good about ourselves
and have inspiring models

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.830
for ourselves as well.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.900
But also, what Israel did
in the world of technology

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.984
is that they made a decision to
fulfill an early Zionist dream.

00:26:13.984 --> 00:26:15.400
The first prime
minister of Israel

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.350
was a man named
David Ben-Gurion.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.080
And he was famous for
expression that we

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.560
will make the desert bloom.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.060
Well, this photograph
on the wall

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.720
shows that they did
make the desert bloom.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.760
But what's also
true is that they

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.370
needed the water to do that.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.520
And Ben-Gurion spoke
repeatedly, speech after speech,

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.865
diary entry after diary entry.

00:26:33.865 --> 00:26:35.420
And I recount some
of them my book,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.930
of how we came to
think about this.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.070
But he didn't do the work.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.240
Inspiring, heroic
engineers did all this,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.560
people who came up with great
ideas, ideas that were thought

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.914
foolish, at first, by many.

00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:49.580
I talk about how many
of the people were

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.880
rejected by their society,
they were laughed at.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.840
And they plowed ahead.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.410
And so desalination was not
entirely invented in Israel,

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.880
but it was largely
invented there.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.210
And we also had lots of
innovations out of Israel.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.060
It's a global phenomenon now,
it's a global industry now.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.400
But much of the greatest
parts are in Israel.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.380
And here I'll show you
Israel's largest of its five

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.780
desalination plants.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.532
Now I want to
challenge the audience.

00:27:17.532 --> 00:27:19.240
And I was told not to
ask anyone to speak

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.070
without a microphone
in front of you,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.195
but I'll repeat the answer.

00:27:21.195 --> 00:27:23.540
Can anyone tell me-- I
know Google people are

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.340
smart people-- so
who can tell me

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.285
what seems to be missing
from this photograph?

00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:29.650
This is a desalination plant.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.347
And I'll give you a key phrase
if no one raises their hand

00:27:32.347 --> 00:27:33.430
in the next second or two.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.150
What's missing?

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:35.650
Daphne?

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.624
Was that Daphne?

00:27:36.624 --> 00:27:38.040
Daphne, what did
you say, the sea?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.050
Yeah, it's a seawater
desalination plant

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.070
that's about a mile
inland from the sea.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.970
So they built a seawater
desalination plant

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.350
where there's no sea around.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.030
Which just goes to show when
there's a will, there's a way.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.040
They thought that the
seashore was too valuable,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.710
and that they didn't
want to use that,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.590
and there was also some
other development in the area

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.010
they couldn't break through.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.710
So they built this
desalination plant.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.050
Now this desalination plant
is the world's most efficient

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.460
desalination plant.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.520
Despite distance from the ocean,
it produces water more cheaply

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.840
than anywhere else in the
world, desalinated water.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.970
It's the healthiest water
you can possibly drink.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.215
It's healthier than water
from a lake or a river.

00:28:16.215 --> 00:28:17.840
It's because it's
already been treated,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.450
it basically needs no treatment.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.809
It's pure water.

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:22.350
If you're a pregnant
woman and you're

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.080
worried about drinking well
water because of nitrogen

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.400
or other things that
can affect your health,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.280
this is the opposite.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.140
This is the best healthy water
as you could possibly drink.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.170
So it's a really a
remarkable thing.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.580
And so today in Israel, if
one could segregate-- now,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.086
this water is merged with
the rest of the fresh water

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:39.710
of the country.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.804
And if one could
merge all together

00:28:43.804 --> 00:28:45.220
the water of the
country, it would

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.069
be over 85% of the household
water of Israel now

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:50.610
comes from desalinated
sources, which

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.950
is a great boost to the
society, and a great boost

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.600
for the health of the country.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.220
So where does Israel's
water come from?

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.060
There's manufactured water,
and there's natural water.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.990
So think about that.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.090
As we go into a time when we may
be facing severe water scarcity

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.110
in a large number
of places, when

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.950
we may want to be thinking about
using our water in a completely

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:16.600
different way, it's good to
know that there's a solution.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.070
And the solution is that you
can manufacture your water.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.080
So here in Israel, about 27%
of its manufactured water

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.620
comes from the seawater.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.940
About 21% of the water
comes from sewage water

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.380
that's treated and then
reused for agriculture.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.234
About 11% of the water
is called brackish water.

00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:36.650
That's another
Israeli idea, which

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.108
is relevant in some parts of
the world, but not everywhere.

00:29:39.108 --> 00:29:41.670
And that is they drill
deep into the desert.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.660
They said to themselves in
the 1950s, if we drill deep

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.920
for oil and gas, why can't
we drill deep for water?

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.890
And so they drilled deep
into the desert sands.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:54.350
They found a large mass of
pockets of ancient aquifers

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.530
way down in the soil,
enclosed caverns

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.114
of brackish water, which
means slightly salty, slightly

00:30:01.114 --> 00:30:01.780
mineral-y water.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.580
And they have to desalinate it.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.310
And then they also have
an industry no longer

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.780
in active use where
they take stormwater.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.231
Now by the way, as
part of that sewage,

00:30:13.231 --> 00:30:15.480
I did mention that they have
a national infrastructure

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.660
that they created.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.940
And it takes about at least
10 years to build that.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.820
Israel has over 200
sewage-treated, now clean water

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.785
reservoirs where they
store the sewage water.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:31.330
Because the water-- sewage
is produced every day

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.120
in about the same
amount, winter or summer.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.079
But farmers tend to need
water more at one time

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:37.203
of the year than the other.

00:30:37.203 --> 00:30:39.545
So you need to have a storage
system all thought out,

00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:41.650
all developed, all nationalized.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:48.190
So in the US, we reuse about 7%
of our water for agriculture.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.270
And in Israel, it's about
85%, 90% of the water

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.870
is used for agriculture.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:58.520
Now what's remarkable is that
if you look at the smaller bar

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.980
chart over here, you see
that the aquifers represent

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.140
about 28% of the water,
and the Sea of Galilee 10%.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.690
So just imagine that just
a couple of decades ago,

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.450
that was all the
water that there was.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.200
And that's all the water that
there is in most of the world.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.340
So is it any surprise that
when, oh, maybe 2/3 of the water

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.300
is now coming from artificial
sources or manufactured sources

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.080
that we now have scarcity
issues everywhere?

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.400
Is any surprise that we're
overdrawing our aquifers?

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.210
Is any surprise
that California was

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.140
close to running out of
its water in its aquifers

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.732
in the San Joaquin Valley,
if it continued at the pace

00:31:34.732 --> 00:31:37.530
that it was going
without any regulation?

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.230
Far from where we're seated
right now, in the High Plains,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.840
there are eight
US states that are

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.330
the breadbasket and the food
basket of the world, that

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.600
grows the oats, the
corn, the wheat, sorghum,

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.326
other plants that are used
for fodder for animals

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:53.000
and for our breads and
our brains for our cereals

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.650
here in the US.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.720
And all over the world,
we all know that there's

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.400
a huge, huge industry.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.340
But we don't think about how
it is that that agriculture

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.246
industry got created.

00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:07.260
In the post World War
II era, the decision

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.340
was made to let the US
agricultural industry become

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.110
a major exporter.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.920
And so millions of new
acres of land were planted.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.210
But we said before,
agriculture is valuated water.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.540
So they needed the water.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.560
And there is a massive,
continental-sized aquifer,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.580
the Ogallala Aquifer, that lays
beneath these eight states,

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.690
from the high in Nebraska, a
little bit to the west in South

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.660
Dakota, a touch of Wyoming,
and then straight down

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.990
to West Texas, if
you can visualize

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.010
that in your mind's eye.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.250
So from 1950 to about
2000, US agriculture

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:49.220
became the world's
savior-- bumper crop year

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.460
after year, endless amounts of
exports, billions and billions

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.460
of dollars of exports.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.666
But was never
discussed, certainly I

00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:58.180
would bet no one
here knows about,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.720
is that the aquifer
underlying all that

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.000
has been pumped drier and drier.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.860
About a third of the aquifer got
pumped out in those 50 years.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.730
From 2000 to 2012,
approximately another third

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.230
of this massive continental
aquifer was pumped out.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.560
Now here's what I
want you to know.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.080
The shortest guess
is that the Ogallala

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.140
Aquifer that I'm talking about
here took 10,000 years to fill.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.410
So in less than a
century, in California,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:33.656
in the San Joaquin Valley,
in less than a century,

00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:38.319
in the Ogallala Aquifer, we
have managed to deplete this.

00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:39.860
Now if we stay on
the current course,

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.250
the US Geological Survey
now says that by the year

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:49.310
2028-- sounds not that far
away, really-- the Ogallala

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.590
Aquifer will be pumped dry.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.690
Then what?

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.129
Now, we don't have to
go down that route.

00:33:56.129 --> 00:33:57.920
We can be thinking
about water differently.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.660
We can come up with technologies
that don't even exist yet.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.180
The technologies that Israel
has created are wonderful.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.700
The technologies that Israel
uses that they didn't create,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.370
but that they use in full
measure, it's wonderful.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.909
But everything that they're
doing, we can learn from.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.480
And we can be doing
the same, and we

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.854
need to be doing the same,
and we must be doing the same.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.627
I started the anecdote
about Theodor Herzl,

00:34:21.627 --> 00:34:24.085
and the heroes of the new land
will be the water engineers.

00:34:24.085 --> 00:34:26.335
And I told you about Yitzhak
Rabin and his Nobel Prize

00:34:26.335 --> 00:34:27.330
speech.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.531
And so I want to just
conclude by saying

00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:31.780
that it's a real pleasure,
it's a real honor, frankly,

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.219
to been invited here
to speak at Google.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.037
And despite the fact
that it's not exactly

00:34:37.037 --> 00:34:39.620
a bus ride to New Jersey to come
from Manhattan to speak here,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.159
the reason I wanted to come is
that probably among the world's

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.614
most brilliant
engineers, and the people

00:34:45.614 --> 00:34:48.639
who can most affect policy may
well be sitting in this room

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.198
right now.

00:34:50.198 --> 00:34:52.239
And so I really wanted to
say the reason I wanted

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.130
to come here was I
wanted to say to you

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.890
all that this is a
problem, this is a crisis,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.150
and this thing that's
not going away.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.260
And so, the extent that we can,
we need to think up solutions.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.860
And we need to make this part
of the national conversation.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.900
I'll pause here.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.640
I'd be glad to answer any
questions that you may have

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.335
and-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:15.975
I have one more
slide I want to do.

00:35:15.975 --> 00:35:17.350
What some of you
may want to know

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.620
is where does that water go.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.680
Similar to what I said
before, is agriculture

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.990
is the biggest user of it,
household use, industry,

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.860
and so forth.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.100
But I will stop here
and be glad to answer

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.290
any questions that anyone
may have about this.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.160
And thank you for
your close attention.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.407
I appreciate it.

00:35:32.407 --> 00:35:36.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.810
AUDIENCE: First of all, thank
you for coming to speak.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.070
That was really,
really informative.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.370
Why does California not
do more desalinization?

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.260
Is it because it's
not economical

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.330
with the current
policies, versus sort of

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.030
free or cheap to
pump groundwater?

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.429
Or is it too far from
the San Joaquin Valley?

00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:57.720
I'm just curious as to why
the economic drivers haven't

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.690
been there.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:05.190
SETH SIEGEL: Yeah, so the
interest group-- the answer

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.300
is that there are
strong interest groups.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.080
And so what ends up happening is
that there's a fight going on,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.830
and has been going for quite
a while, between kind of three

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.470
or four interest groups--
the environmental groups,

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.940
speaking on behalf of the rivers
and the fish, the farmers,

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.740
and the city-dwellers.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.970
And there's also
a legal structure

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.660
throughout most of
the US, but certainly

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.990
in California, which allows
very long processes that

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.920
delay large infrastructure
projects, not just

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.150
water, to go forward.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.540
But that is one of them.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.715
And so the cost structure here
has gotten very, very high

00:36:51.715 --> 00:36:52.590
because of the delay.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.120
So for example,
down in San Diego,

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.490
the same company that built that
inland desalination plant that

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.210
I referenced a few minutes ago
has designed a state-of-the-art

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.490
one in Carlsbad, California,
right near San Diego.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.080
And it will open in November,
I believe, next month.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.940
Now in Israel, a smaller
plant with more output

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.150
took four years to build,
from start to finish.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:26.330
This Carlsbad plant has been
over 10 years in process.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.440
And many of those years
were spent in litigation.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.660
The cost of an Israeli
desalination plant

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.830
is about $400 million, which
is totally amortiz-itable-- I

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.150
had it wrong twice now, so
you know what I'm saying.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:43.190
It could be amortized easily
over the 25-year first life

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.790
of the plant.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.749
And then there's a second
life, about 15 years.

00:37:45.749 --> 00:37:47.664
I don't have to go into
the economic structure

00:37:47.664 --> 00:37:48.790
unless you want me to.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.760
And in California now,
the cost structure

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.251
is such that it's going to
be much harder to recoup.

00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:55.750
Because it's gone
from $400 million,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.790
which is, in Israel, for
building a comparable plant,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.120
to one now in the US,
that plant costing

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.580
about a billion dollars.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.387
So it's a higher cost.

00:38:06.387 --> 00:38:07.220
That's first of all.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.170
Second of all is you
have it exactly right.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.010
Politicians do not
like spending money

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.530
on invisible infrastructure.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.220
So your question sort of have
had a implication of that.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.330
So politicians, mayors,
governors, city councilmen

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.779
and women, they focus very
much on the incentives

00:38:26.779 --> 00:38:27.570
that they're given.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.190
And Boris and I,
before we came here,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.120
were talking about why we need a
different governance structure,

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.040
because we are in a
different world now.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.510
And we are in a different
world in water as well.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.990
So mayors are in office
four years, or eight years,

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.870
or maybe 12 years.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.590
And I told you earlier, it takes
10 to 20 years to build out

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.300
a water infrastructure system.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.335
So a mayor has
almost no incentive,

00:38:49.335 --> 00:38:51.490
from an electoral
point of view, to be

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.620
focusing on what is an expensive
infrastructure, to build it

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.630
out.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.440
He has lots of incentive to
build parks, and schools,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.210
and hospitals, or to cut taxes.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.865
And so therefore,
that's what they do.

00:39:05.865 --> 00:39:08.545
And until citizens
demand that there

00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:12.600
be more water smarts
and more water activity,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.890
it's not going to come.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.450
And finally, in terms of your
question about agriculture,

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.460
it would be a bad
idea-- and I didn't

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.960
make this clear in
my remarks, and I

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.520
should have-- it
would be a bad idea

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.570
to be thinking of
desalinating water

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.820
for the purpose
of growing crops.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.490
Because there are
still water-rich parts

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:33.090
in the world where it's easier
to grow crops with local water,

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.500
natural water, than
using manufactured water.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.140
Manufactured water, as
inexpensive as it has become,

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.420
relatively, is
still-- it's a cost.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.130
And therefore, you want
to, if at all possible,

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.160
not use desalinated
water for agriculture,

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.810
just because of
the cost structure.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.700
Ideally, you use your
desalinated water

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.210
as a way of topping
off your system,

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.854
and not as a way of
being your system.

00:39:57.854 --> 00:40:00.020
Now, we may reach a point,
because of climate change

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.650
and the other macro conditions,
where we have no choice.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.750
Just as we agreed to
spend $4 and $5 a gallon

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.522
for our gas for
our cars, we make

00:40:06.522 --> 00:40:07.980
a decision there's
no other choice,

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.800
there may come to that as well.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.646
But I would argue
that the sooner we

00:40:11.646 --> 00:40:13.520
get started on thinking
these things through,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.228
the sooner we get
started on building out

00:40:15.228 --> 00:40:16.910
our infrastructure,
the sooner we

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.520
get started on thinking about
governance and planning,

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.550
the smarter that will be.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.050
We do know something.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.635
We do know that there's
going to be another drought.

00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:28.010
And then what happens is you
have a couple of rainy days,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.509
you have a rainy season,
and elected officials

00:40:31.509 --> 00:40:33.050
who don't want to
spend money, or who

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.170
don't want to have
new infrastructure,

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.450
or who don't think that we
should build a desalination

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.570
plant because it burns
too much carbon fuel,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.990
or because it adds
salty water back

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:45.710
into the ocean-- I have answers
to that as well, within limits.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.070
It's not that big a problem.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.330
They use that as an excuse
to say well, the, aquifers

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.996
are refilling, so why
should we do this?

00:40:51.996 --> 00:40:56.990
And I think that's an abdication
of very important and necessary

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.730
leadership.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.000
AUDIENCE: Could you
comment on the fact

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.220
that this, for Israel,
like, it may have been

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.290
a strategic way of thinking.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.830
Because obviously, like,
the geography as such

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.020
is one that forces
you to-- if you

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.540
want to have a viable
economy on this land,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.170
you need to think
about the water issue.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.420
Is that something
that helped sort

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:27.870
of bridge the sort
of bipartisanship

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:31.790
that you might see
in, let's say, the US,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:36.630
where one group of politicians
may be supporting the people,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:41.800
and who are holding the water
rights, whereas the other may

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.810
be more progressive in trying
to think about these things.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:51.880
So I guess my question
is how is the support

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.640
on both sides of the
political spectrum in Israel

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.765
for these kind of projects?

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.940
And where does it come from?

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.430
And what would be the lessons
for some of the other parts

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.552
of the world?

00:42:04.552 --> 00:42:05.510
SETH SIEGEL: Thank you.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.670
It's an important question.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.990
And it gives me the
opportunity to actually speak

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.747
of one of the several ways that
our governance is broken here

00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.320
in the United States.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.820
Governance is not just the
elected officials that we have.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.930
Governance is also the way we
choose to conduct and control

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.630
how we manage our water.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.450
So we have hundreds
and thousands

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.880
of different stakeholders
in water here.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.050
And yet in Israel, what
they made the decision to do

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:35.820
was to build out a system,
and to give one single entity

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.725
enormous control.

00:42:36.725 --> 00:42:40.410
It's a technocratic,
apolitical body,

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.660
and they make the decisions.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.070
And here's the remarkable thing.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.620
I interviewed 220
people for the book.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.470
About-- we didn't
get into it at all.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.947
I didn't talk much
about the effect

00:42:49.947 --> 00:42:51.780
that Israel gives water
to the Palestinians.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.260
I wanted to understand
the Palestinian water

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.400
claims and the Israeli
issues back and forth.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.260
So I spent a fair amount of
time meeting with Palestinians,

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.540
and NGO heads, and such
to understand that issue.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.206
And I'm glad to talk
about it, if anyone

00:43:02.206 --> 00:43:04.650
has a question about it.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.570
But what was
interesting was in the,

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.100
call it maybe 190
other people that I

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.710
spoke to, Israeli people,
business executives, government

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:18.145
officials, stakeholders
in different parts

00:43:18.145 --> 00:43:21.550
of the water equation in
Israel, what I was amazed by

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.830
was the fact that not
a single one of them

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.655
suggested that even though
Israel now has privatized

00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:33.740
its economy completely, and even
though Israel now has-- there's

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.000
no state-owned bank, there's
no state-owned airline,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.084
there's no state-owned
telecommunications company.

00:43:38.084 --> 00:43:40.624
All those have been privatized
in the Margaret Thatcher-style

00:43:40.624 --> 00:43:41.240
privatization.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.870
What shocked me was that
not one person I spoke to,

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:48.000
even when I pushed them, not
professors, not economics

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.050
professors, not
bankers, no one I

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:53.210
spoke to in the water
equation told me

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.190
that they thought it
would be a good idea

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.675
to make the free market a larger
part of the water equation.

00:43:58.675 --> 00:44:01.300
And so what we have in the
US is that-- I mean, just

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.690
to give one example
of California--

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:06.680
if you are along a
river, let's say you're

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.780
along the Colorado River, OK?

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.105
And you have bad soil,
mostly sandy soil,

00:44:12.105 --> 00:44:13.870
and you decide you
want to grow cotton.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.953
Which again, no reason any
of us should know this,

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:18.320
but it's a highly
water-consumptive crop.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.130
And you decide you
want to grow cotton.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.880
And you're right along
the Colorado River.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.400
You can, under
current structure,

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.300
take all the water you
want out of the river.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.020
There's no limits whatsoever.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.070
You can flood irrigate your
field to your heart's content.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.550
Now you can't,
then, take the water

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.865
and sell it to somebody else.

00:44:34.865 --> 00:44:36.520
It's public property
in that regard,

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.640
or it's in the flow of property.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.380
But for where you
are along the river,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.910
you take all you want,
as much as you want,

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.890
as often as you want.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.384
That would never fly in Israel.

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.050
What they made the
decision is that they

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:51.650
need to think about what's
in the best interest,

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:55.000
the highest best use of
a society altogether.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.500
Now I want to just take issue
with one part of your question

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.320
now.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.970
And that is the
question about Israel

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.090
had necessity in all this.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.910
And I think that was
not necessarily true.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.860
Israel could have
made the decision,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.400
as Singapore did, that it would
have no agriculture at all.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.025
It could have made
the decision that it

00:45:15.025 --> 00:45:19.820
would import 100% of its food,
of its fruits and vegetables,

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.535
from Europe, or from wherever.

00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:22.910
It could have made
that decision.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.743
Now, there's some
national security reasons.

00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:26.322
Israel is famously isolated.

00:45:26.322 --> 00:45:27.780
And unfortunately,
because of time,

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.280
I didn't have a chance to talk
about what I call in the book

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.090
hydro-diplomacy, and the ways
in which Israel opened the door

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.930
to diplomatic relations
with China and India

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.990
through water technology.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.990
Israel understood China and
India's severe water problems,

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.720
and used water as a
door-opener, which now they

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.220
have robust and
wonderful relations,

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.620
but used it as a door-opener
to have relations those two.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.360
But Israel could have
made other choices.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.380
Israel made a decision
to be a country

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.030
like all other countries,
to have a great agriculture

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.860
sector, to feed
their own people,

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.402
not too feed their
cattle-- they feed

00:46:00.402 --> 00:46:02.193
their cattle and their
chickens with fodder

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:03.320
that's grown elsewhere.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.680
But all the fruits and
vegetables they eat

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.910
are mostly homegrown.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.490
And they made that decision.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.740
And so therefore, they
had to adapt their economy

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.690
and their water
plans accordingly.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.990
Now, just imagine if in
the US, first of all,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.950
imagine that we had a water
system, a water governance

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.570
system, that wasn't
tied to a time that's

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.550
closer to the 19th century, when
there was few people out West,

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.410
when there was abundant
water, when no matter how much

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.280
water that farmer
upstream would take,

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.450
there was still plenty
more for people downstream.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.990
But I didn't finish the story.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.360
What's the problem?

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.720
The problem is by the time
that water gets far west,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.260
by the time it gets
to Los Angeles,

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.750
by the time it gets even
to Nevada, it's a trickle.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.764
So you have Lake Mead
now at historic low.

00:46:49.764 --> 00:46:51.680
You ever seen those
pictures of the Hoover Dam

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.660
with those water lines?

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.740
If not, if I may say, go
to Google and do a search.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.840
It's really quite remarkable.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.570
And so you find
yourself in a situation

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.820
where we have ever less
water, urgently needed,

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.320
because we have a
governance system.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.240
Now, I don't think it's a
problem of one political party

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.882
or the other.

00:47:07.882 --> 00:47:09.340
I think one political
party is more

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.332
given to the free market
than the other, I think.

00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:15.340
But I think it's frankly that
nobody is paying attention

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.630
whatsoever.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.620
It's just off the radar
screen, and that's a problem.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.280
AUDIENCE: So as Boris
mentioned, there

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.680
is perhaps, in the
case of Israel,

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.530
sort of like a nation-state
interest in developing

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.310
this desert.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.800
In the case of making
the analogy to the US,

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.570
where its market-driven
forces that really decide what

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.320
happens, what is
the alternative?

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.640
Where do you see
the future going?

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.280
What are going to
be the incentives?

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.880
We can't just bury our head
in the sand and say, you know,

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.450
it's not a problem.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.720
It will bite us at some point.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.760
SETH SIEGEL: Yeah,
you know, I think--

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.140
look, I'm a great believer in,
as I think everyone here is,

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.190
in democracies.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:12.410
So the problem that democracies
are that crucial decisions get

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:15.620
pushed off for a very long
time, until they become crises.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:20.280
So the premise of your question
implies a smart governance

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.910
system where we
move more rapidly.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.760
And I'm not as
optimistic as you are.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.800
I see, again and
again in our history,

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.680
where we do ultimately address
problems and address them well,

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.780
but we address them late.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.280
And so therefore,
terrible problems

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.779
develop before we get there.

00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:39.570
But I'll tell you what
I would like to see,

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.778
I don't know that I will see.

00:48:40.778 --> 00:48:42.860
First of all, I'd like
to just see immediately,

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:44.390
lots more technology at work.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.840
I'd like to see a different
tax policy so that we

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.390
have incentives for
farmers so that they

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.355
will adopt technology.

00:48:50.355 --> 00:48:51.450
I mean, think about this.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.340
If water is a free
input, why would you

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.110
spend one penny for
technology to save water?

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.402
It makes no sense.

00:48:59.402 --> 00:49:01.360
And I have a story that
is an East Coast story,

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.880
but people always can't quite
believe it, but it's true.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.052
In 1980, in-- well
let me step back.

00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:12.760
New York City gets
its water from a bunch

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.760
of-- from the greater watershed.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.090
It's very healthy, good water.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:18.930
And it comes from these enormous
water pipes that are probably

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.531
about the size, or maybe half
the size of this large room

00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:22.530
that we're in right now.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.970
You could drive a truck
through it, it's so large.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.340
And these are
massive water pipes.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.030
There are two of them
that feed New York.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.930
And in 1980, they discovered
in one of the pipes

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.175
that there was a leak, a
leak in one of the pipes.

00:49:36.175 --> 00:49:38.030
And it wasn't just any leak.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:41.070
It was an unusually large leak.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:46.360
The leak was leaking 35 million
gallons every single day.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.320
It's a lot of water.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.990
So if you were leaking
35 million gallons a day,

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.410
and there was a cost to
that water of $1 a gallon

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.757
or a penny a gallon or
tenth of a penny a gallon,

00:49:56.757 --> 00:49:58.590
what you would probably
do is you'd probably

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.720
pretty quickly do a
cost-benefit analysis and say,

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.320
got to fix the damn leak.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.230
But instead, the
decision was made,

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.355
they knew it was a problem.

00:50:08.355 --> 00:50:10.610
They knew sooner or later
they'd have to fix it.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.950
But the attitude was
infrastructure is expensive,

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.930
and water is free.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.860
So if water is free, why fix it?

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.410
And so now we are
1980, 2000, 2010-- so

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.930
now we are 34
years later, is it?

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:30.830
We're 34, 35 years later-- 35,
2015-- we're 35 years later.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.663
And here I'm going to
tell you where we are.

00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:37.530
35 million gallons a day,
that's a lot of water.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:40.652
Last year, they made
the decision to fix it.

00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:42.360
They have a seven-year
project to fix it.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.151
It's going to cost
about a billion dollars.

00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:47.450
So 41 years after they
discovered a leak,

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:52.220
leaking 35 million gallons
a day, it will be fixed.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.930
Now, that is a big story.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.970
Bring that down to
microcosm to a farmer.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:02.324
As long as water is free, or
functionally free, or highly

00:51:02.324 --> 00:51:03.740
subsidized, as
long as it's highly

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.010
subsidized for
homeowners, we're going

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:07.762
to keep doing silly,
reckless things.

00:51:07.762 --> 00:51:10.095
So one of things that Israel
does, I didn't get a chance

00:51:10.095 --> 00:51:11.990
to talk about
before, is it charges

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.610
a real price for the water.

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.590
But every penny that's
charged goes to a lockbox.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.360
It's used only for water
infrastructure and water

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.385
management.

00:51:21.385 --> 00:51:23.760
What happens in America is
the same mayors I talked about

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.490
before, they have water
fees, they have sewage fees,

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:31.280
it goes into the general pot, it
goes into the general treasury,

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.740
and they don't use
it to fix the water.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.415
And so therefore, they're happy
to be sloppy with their water.

00:51:36.415 --> 00:51:38.890
And that's something
that we can't afford.

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:40.640
Maybe we could afford
it once upon a time,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.660
I'm arguing that we cannot
afford it going forward.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.620
So when do we fix it?

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.220
We fix governance, we
fix our infrastructure,

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.099
we fix our financing
system, we perhaps

00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:52.640
have some eminent domain, when
we say somebody's use of water

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.742
is inappropriate
for the rest of us.

00:51:54.742 --> 00:51:56.950
And we have to start thinking
about this differently.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:00.070
And we have to have our
federal government rethink

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.740
the way it manages water.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.800
Because the management
of water is back

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.340
in a time when there were
different society completely,

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.610
not scarcity issues
looming, and not

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:12.527
the problems that we have today.

00:52:12.527 --> 00:52:13.860
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you so much.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.615
So I want to ask about one thing
you didn't mention much about

00:52:16.615 --> 00:52:18.239
was the terms stormwater
and greywater.

00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:20.720
And I was wondering, do you
think it's practical for us

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.180
to actually separate
out-- I mean,

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.860
like, there are many types
of sewage, in a sense,

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.550
and in a lot of places,
stormwater and sewage

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.930
is all just the same, and all
goes to the same treatment

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.300
plant, and then you end up with
sewage overflowing when there's

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.970
too much rain, and so forth.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.970
Is it practical to
actually develop

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.470
sort of separate systems for
stormwater, for greywater,

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.510
for black water?

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.740
I mean, greywater and
stormwater are easier to treat

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.849
and more reusable.

00:52:45.849 --> 00:52:47.390
Do you think that's
a practical thing

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.510
to do in the United States?

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.320
SETH SIEGEL: The answer is
yes, I think it's doable.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.864
I think it's a question
of prioritization.

00:52:55.864 --> 00:52:58.030
And you have to make a
decision as to where you want

00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:59.880
to spend your water dollars.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.820
I think that probably, there
are possibly better dollars

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.347
to be spent first.

00:53:05.347 --> 00:53:07.430
But I think this is one
of these moments where you

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.300
have to consider all options.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.410
And regionally
speaking, in some places

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.070
where you have lots of rain
that gets lost to the sea,

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.110
is a good place to be
thinking about this.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:20.251
I think storm capture
water is a fabulous idea.

00:53:20.251 --> 00:53:22.500
I agree with you that it's--
it's not as easy to treat

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.708
as you may think, by the way.

00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:26.217
Stormwater raindrops, when
they fall from the sky,

00:53:26.217 --> 00:53:27.050
they're pretty pure.

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.200
But the second
they hit the soil,

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.990
they pick up what's left from
the car, and truck, and bus

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:35.990
exhaust, and they pick up lots
of silt, and lots of sand.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.950
And so by the time they get
into the treatment center,

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:40.110
it's pretty dirty.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:43.720
It's filled with chemicals,
and it's pretty dirty stuff.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.721
But it's a good idea to have
that as part of the mix,

00:53:46.721 --> 00:53:48.220
particularly in
parts of the country

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.590
where you have a significant
amount of seasonal rain.

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:53.590
So you can trap that rain.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:54.610
You can treat that rain.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:57.617
And then you can put
it in large reservoirs

00:53:57.617 --> 00:53:58.825
where it can be useful later.

00:53:58.825 --> 00:54:01.074
And by the way, Israel does
something just like that,

00:54:01.074 --> 00:54:02.740
but they haven't been
doing that as much

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.110
lately, because they made the
decision that it's actually

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:09.860
more cost effective
to take water

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.340
from sewage, because
there's a lot of it,

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.680
and treat that and reuse that.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.410
But they have, as
you saw in my chart,

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:17.950
they have a little
bit of stormwater

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.200
recapture that they use now.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.616
But I think it may make more
sense for parts of the United

00:54:21.616 --> 00:54:24.700
States that have seasonally
high amounts of water, though.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.781
AUDIENCE: That's helpful.

00:54:25.781 --> 00:54:27.530
SETH SIEGEL: One last
word I'd like to say

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:31.820
is that the Middle East is a
famous region for conflict.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.390
And most of what we see about
Israel in the Middle East,

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.070
unfortunately, we
don't get a chance

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.930
to see enough inspiring
stories out of the Middle East.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.200
And there are many
of those as well.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.575
This book, and I know
Google, very kindly,

00:54:45.575 --> 00:54:47.200
is providing copies
for everybody here.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.660
And thank you to
Google for that.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.660
The book is actually, I
think, full of inspiring

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.120
stories of people overcoming
insurmountable obstacles.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.490
And I think that this is one
such story that is one that's

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.450
good for all of us to hear.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.110
And I hope that
this is something

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.090
that people understand it's
not just sort of an engineering

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:10.090
story, but a story that is
applicable to all of our lives,

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.880
and large challenges that we
face in society generally,

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.300
which is sort of
way Boris kindly

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.070
started this whole conversation.

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:21.280
So I think that we're probably
at the end of our hour.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.984
And I thank you
all very, very much

00:55:22.984 --> 00:55:24.150
for your time and attention.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.970
If anybody wants to
linger after we finish,

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:29.085
I'd be glad to standby and
speak with those of you

00:55:29.085 --> 00:55:31.092
who are shy, if any of you are.

00:55:31.092 --> 00:55:31.800
BORIS: Thank you.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.220
Please join me in thanking
Seth for coming to visit.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.770
