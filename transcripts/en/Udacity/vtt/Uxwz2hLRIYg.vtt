There are many ways you could have answered this correctly.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.710
This is just the approach that I took. A warehouse

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.550
app could begin with a warehouse object. It would also

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.690
have an object called items. This would have fields like

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.990
item name, price, description, etcetera. Each record would be an

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.020
individual item. I would create a one to many relationship

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.910
between warehouse and items. Which would let me add a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.800
role of summary field to my warehouse object. It could

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.890
keep track of the total number of items I have.
