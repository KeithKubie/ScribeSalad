00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the next couple of problems we're going to be talking about gravitational potential energy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, we talked quite a bit about potential energy due to gravity before,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but we had a few assumptions when we had that discussion,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Particularly, the fact that we were dealing with small distances.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So up to now, we've been treating acceleration of falling objects as a constant which we call (g)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and for this to be the case, we found that the force of gravity on an object has to be equal to (mg).

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we also found that the potential energy due to gravity is equal to (mgh),

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and it turns out that this equation actually only works well over small distances

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and why is that? Well, we only get this equation based on the assumption

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that acceleration is constant.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the last problems; however, we found that (g) is actually not constant

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and that the force of gravity varies depending on where you are in the earth.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In particular, we found that the force of gravity more generally,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is actually proportional to 1 over the distance away from the center of the earth squared.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The force of gravity actually gets weaker the further away you get

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
from earth and stronger the closer you get.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This assumption that (g) is constant everywhere, and therefore that the potential energy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is this equation, is just not valid when we change our altitude too much.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Describing the gravitational force asf (mg) and the gravitational potential energy as (mgh),

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
works great over small distances especially if we're near the surface of the earth.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But as we change our distance away from the center of the earth,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(g) is no longer constant and these equations no longer become as accurate.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
To figure out an equation for force and potential energy that works at all distances,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
let's start by looking at this relationship we found here. That the force of gravity

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is proportional to 1 over the distance away from the center of the earth squared.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So right now, this is a proportionality but we can always turn proportionalities into equations

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
by adding a constant of proportionality.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I can turn this proportionality into this equation over here with this constant of proportionality

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
which I'm going to call (G), and this (G) here is really to make sure

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the units work out correctly in this problem, so that we can get a force,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
even though we've really got 1 over a distance squared.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
All right, but this doesn't seem quite right either.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We know that the force of gravity actually depends on mass.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And there's no mass in this equation yet, but we have to ask

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
whose mass does this gravitational force depend on?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Well, it should depend on the mass of the object which I've been calling (m),

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and that should depend on a mass of the earth which I'm going to write as (ME).

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let 's add those into our equation.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
All right, so now we've got a slightly more complicated-looking equation

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but it's got all the essentials.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It got this constant of proportionality to make sure our units are right.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It got the mass of both the earth and the mass of the object we're looking at,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the force is proportional to 1 over the distance  between the object

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the center of the earth squared.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And it turns out this equation actually is correct and it has a very special name.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's a much more general way of talking about the gravitational force all throughout the universe,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
not just on earth too.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
All right, so now we can describe the gravitational force at any scales we want.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We don't just have to stay close to the earth's surface

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and we don't have to deal with small distances.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What about the gravitational potential energy more generally?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Well unfortunately, to drive the general potential energy formula,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we need a bit of calculus, so I'm just going to give it to you.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's equal to negative G times mass of the earth times mass of the object over the distance

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
between the object and the center of the earth, no square this time.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So it looks quite a bit like this equation, but that's not that surprising.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
These two equations look quite similar too.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Let's take just a moment to make sure this equation makes sense.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This equation had units of force and to get from this equation to this equation,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we basically multiply by distance to get rid of the square and the denominator.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This must have units of force times distance and force times distance

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is equivalent to units of energy which is great because we're dealing with potential energy.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The units make sense, but what's the deal with this negative sign?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That seems kind of strange, so to see what this negative is doing here in the equation,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
let's consider two points at distances R1 and R2 away from the earth.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We expect the potential energy of 0.2 over here to be greater

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
than the potential energy of 0.1 over here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We saw when we were using (mgh) that as the distance away from the earth increased,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the potential energy increased as well.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So we should expect the same thing to happen here,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
with (mgh) however, the distance away from the earth was in the numerator,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but in this case, the distance away from the earth is in the denominator.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The behavior is actually quite different.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You can imagine that as we get further away from the earth, this value of hour is going to increase

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which will cause the potential energy to decrease which is the opposite

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of what we want to have happened.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We need the negative sign here to make sure that as hour gets larger,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the potential energy gets larger as well and that can only be done by having a negative here.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, I know that's a rather confusing topic, so please feel free to discuss this on the forums.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Okay, now that we know more general formula for gravitational potential energy,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we can do problems relating to the earth and space and at large distances

00:04:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
without having to worry about the air induced by using (mgh).
