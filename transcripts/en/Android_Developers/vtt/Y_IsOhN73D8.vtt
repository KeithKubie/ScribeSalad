00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.640
My name is Howard and I’m from the Philippines.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.400
My company is called Mochibits

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.720
and our game is called “Bounce.io”

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.780
After the bootcamp, we realised a lot of things

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.460
we thought worked in the game, didn’t.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.040
The program boosted our skills as a developer

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.240
by helping us see things from the user’s side better.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.000
We got feedback from mentors

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
on how to think like a user

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.480
and how to observe users better.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.600
One of our games which was having trouble

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.280
getting good reviews and downloads,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.500
basically jumped up to a 4.7 star rating

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.760
after getting some feedback

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.260
of what to do with the game.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.780
Another game got featured and was able to get

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
a good number of downloads and reviews.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920
I would recommend this program

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.020
to other indie developers because

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.340
any indie developer, no matter how good

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
they are at their craft, can still get better.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.960
It’s basically training you never thought you needed.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.400
Nothing could be better than that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.840
for people who want to get better.
