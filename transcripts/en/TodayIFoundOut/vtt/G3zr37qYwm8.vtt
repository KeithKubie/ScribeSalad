00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.230
More Sex = Better Health... and 5 Other Medical
Facts

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.699
1.

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.889
Lyme disease has nothing to do with limes
or limestone, but rather is a bacterial infection.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.900
It is named after a city, Lyme, Connecticut,
where it was first recognized as a distinct

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.900
medical disease.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900
(QF 504)

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
2.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.610
According to a study published in The British
Medical Journal in 1997 that analyzed just

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.820
under 1,000 men from 45-59 years old starting
in 1979, the more frequently a man has sex,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.010
the longer his life expectancy is.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.890
Specifically, men who have sex at least twice
per week were 50% less likely to die during

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
the scope of the study than those who reported
only having sex about once a month.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.829
Of course, it may simply be that healthier
people are likely to have more sex, but that

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.069
isn’t as fun as saying “more sex = longer
life”.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.670
Whatever the case, there does seem to be a
correlation between frequency of sex and life

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.949
expectancy in males.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:54.949
(QF 598)

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:55.949
3.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.559
The small indent, or vertical groove, under
your nose and right above your lips is called

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.870
a “philtrum”, as well as a “medial cleft”.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.780
This same vertical groove can be found in
many different types of mammals between their

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.320
mouths and their nose.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.090
In human males, those on the autistic spectrum
tend to have much broader philtrums than people

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.090
not on the spectrum.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.090
(QF 646)

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.090
4.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.190
In ancient times, the root part of the carrot
plant that we eat today was not typically

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.190
used.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.950
The carrot plant however was highly valued
due to the medicinal value of its seeds and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.950
leaves.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.490
For instance, Mithridates VI, King of Pontius
(around 100BC) had a recipe for counteracting

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.409
certain poisons with the principle ingredient
being carrot seeds.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.979
It has since been proven that this concoction
actually works.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.119
5.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.579
Veins are very close to the surface of skin,
which helps them play a role in heat dissipation.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.090
Due to this closeness to the surface, they
are very visible through the skin.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.610
This near-surface location is largely why
veins often appear blue despite the fact that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.770
the blood running through them is dark red.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.070
Specifically, this is from the way light diffuses
in the skin.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.679
Veins may appear blue from the way subcutaneous
fat absorbs low-frequency light.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.979
This permits only high frequency blue and
violet wavelengths to penetrate through the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.170
skin to the vein, with the other wavelengths
getting filtered off from the pigmentation

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.340
of your skin.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.750
In fact, when skin is removed, such as when
dissecting a cadaver, you’ll see the veins

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.970
and arteries actually are a somewhat similar
color.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.790
People with extremely light skin, such as
an albino, will typically have veins that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.170
show up as dark purple or dark red, more closely
resembling the actual color of the blood running

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:41.510
through 
the veins.
