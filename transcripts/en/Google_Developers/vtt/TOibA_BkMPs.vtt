LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.135
I'm Louis Gray here, with Daniel
Sieberg, my co-host.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: How's
it going, Louis?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.410
How you doing?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.010
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.020
This has been an incredible
two days of jam-packed

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.700
content, pretty much from every

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.710
single product at Google.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.000
It's been a lot of fun
to be part of.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.730
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.320
We're approaching the end of our
live coverage here, but of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.620
course it will live on for
people to watch in many ways.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.460
LOUIS GRAY: It's part
of YouTube.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.190
And speaking--

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: And speaking
of YouTube!

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.560
Oh, what a segue.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.330
LOUIS GRAY: Ah, who knew?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just like
we rehearsed it.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.570
LOUIS GRAY: So you
were doing the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.100
YouTube Sandbox, yesterday.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.940
You went and talked to
a bunch of partners.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.310
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's right.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.350
LOUIS GRAY: We've already
talked about a number of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.400
different products.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.390
Give me an idea of what happened
in the YouTube

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.620
Sandbox yesterday.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260
DANIEL SIEBERG: So the three
partners we talked to-- one

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.550
from Korea called [? Wooa ?]

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.560
Brothers, which actually is
using YouTube in a pretty

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.370
unique way to get folks who go
to a restaurant and want to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.320
share their experience and how
restaurants are using videos.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.460
The second one is a company
called Capella Systems.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.220
And they're offering a lot of
high-end production values for

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.470
producing video and
live stream.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.150
Same goes for Mediastudio.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.460
So those are the three
partners--

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.110
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.099
DANIEL SIEBERG: --and they've
got some really

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.099
cool stuff to showcase.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.354
LOUIS GRAY: Great.

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:06.160
Well, thanks for the intro.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.120
Let's go ahead and
roll that video.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.370
Video.

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:15.010
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.170
-Hi there, I'm Daniel Sieberg,
with Google Developers Live,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.440
here at I/O 2013.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.150
And we're at the YouTube
Sandbox.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.700
You may have heard of YouTube,
world's second largest search

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340
engine, you might even be
watching this video on

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.480
YouTube right now.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.350
And I'm joined by Ikuyo from
the Capella Systems to talk

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.190
about YouTube live streaming,
and how the software, and the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.750
tools, that Capella Systems
makes available to people

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.235
really can add production
value to

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:39.880
what people are doing.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.521
Talk to me about what you make
available to people.

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:41.982
-Yeah.

00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:44.850
So Cambria Live is an all
software and supply solution.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.200
So we integrate it with
YouTube's latest

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.206
API, version three.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:53.150
So from Cambria Live software,
we're able to stream directly

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.136
to YouTube channels.

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:57.094
As you can see on the
[? target, ?]

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:00.650
if you have a YouTube Live
account, you can specify a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.915
YouTube Live channel where
you want to stream to.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:05.196
As you can see, that Cambria
Live can take

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:06.663
multiple camera inputs.

00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:10.086
So right now, we're capturing
from our own PTIZ camera, and

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:12.531
importing directly to
YouTube channel.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.998
So here, we're showing
a Cambria

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:16.450
Live Property function.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.800
So we are showing-- we can
choose a different background,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.430
as you can see.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.210
Go and change the [INAUDIBLE]
image.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.500
You can also select the video
footage to change to a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.480
different background.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.750
We are using a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.950
picture-in-picture for this function.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.120
So now that we see a lot of
shift towards IT-based

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.640
broadcasting.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.910
So with the availability of
high-speed internet, and then

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.390
also open platform like YouTube
Live, anyone can do a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.710
very high quality
broadcasting.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.660
And Cambria Live allows users to
do that with just a simple

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.265
use of software.

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:52.175
-So you have an entire control
room, essentially, right here

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:55.110
on your computer, and more,
really, even more ability to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.000
do those kinds of things.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.010
Who are some of the folks that
you're working with?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.562
Who really has an interest in
this type of technology?

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:02.890
-So we work a lot with live
events producers.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.930
So any sports events.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.390
Also, we have a lot of
broadcasting customers who's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.660
doing a lot live streaming
to YouTube Live.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.205
Or to their own Wowza or
other BBFS servers.

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:16.670
-And what's it been like
working with the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.800
YouTube team, so far?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.730
-It's been great.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.780
It allows us to reach out
to more customers.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.040
Not just broadcasters, but
customers like the sports, or

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.020
corporate, who's wanting to do
streaming but not necessarily

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.820
have a in-depth broadcasting
experience.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.360
Cambria Live is very
easy to use.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.450
Streaming to YouTube Live
platform, they're able to

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.991
reach out to more viewers, from
anywhere to anyone in the

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.302
world, so that's great.

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:48.590
-And just quickly, what is the
future of this technology?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.340
Where do you see this heading,
down the road?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.880
-I think that this is a new type
of broadcasting workflow.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.810
We are definitely seeing a lot
of shift from traditional

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.220
broadcasting workflow, to more
like an IT-based broadcasting.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.680
So I think that more and more
professional content holders,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.140
or event producers, are going
to use this platform.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.910
All very software-based
solutions, streaming to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.840
YouTube platform.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.180
-Cool.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.440
Great.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.320
Thank you so much.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.009
And thank you to our gentleman
over there.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.479
Thank you.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.459
-Our model.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.949
-Thanks very much.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.439
-Thank you.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.689
-All right.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.530
All right, moving right along
now to [? Wooa ?]

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.960
Brothers, and I'm joined
by Dave from [? Wooa ?]

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.350
Brothers.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.710
Now, [? Wooa ?]

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.440
Brothers is Korean.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.390
Tell me what it means?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.070
-It means "wow" or "elegant"
in Korean.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.500
-Excellent.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.920
Now let's talk about what it
does for folks in particular,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.990
ties into restaurants, and how
people can upload their own

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.260
experiences at a restaurant
to YouTube.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.220
And then restaurants
can also push their

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.480
own content to YouTube.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.663
So walk me through
a demo, here.

00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:55.430
-OK.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.290
So we show all the nearby
restaurant.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.540
First, you select your
category of the food.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.610
As far as I know, you
like chicken.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.140
-I would love some chicken right
now, I haven't eaten

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.425
lunch.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.935
-So chicken restaurant around
here, Moscone Center.

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:12.680
You go through the list, see
what you like, click on the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.940
restaurant information page.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.840
And on here, you can check out
the introductory video about

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.610
the restaurant.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.710
-So they've posted this video.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.630
-The owner posts it
up on the app.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.305
-And it could be showing some
dishes, or a chef, whatever it

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:27.490
is.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.200
-Yes.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.525
-OK.

00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:31.765
-And underneath that, you can
also check out the user review

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:34.680
made by video, as well.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.756
And if you like, you can upload
your own reviews on the

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.750
app as well.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.850
-So this allows you to use the
camera in your device--

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.680
-Yes.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.465
---to do a review.

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:46.370
Even while you're at
the restaurant.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.210
-Exactly.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.630
Yeah.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.280
So Give A Rating, Text,
Picture, or Video.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.200
Record like that.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.670
-OK.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.608
-So that's that.

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:04.120
-So it's very social way, and
visual way, obviously.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.190
People like to share their
experiences with food and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.770
their favorite restaurants.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.030
-Exactly.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.020
It's a lot more richer than
just a text and photos.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.350
-OK.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.510
So tell me, then, how
this all ties into

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.680
ordering food, as well.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.540
-So we have two different ways
of ordering food through our

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.710
app, which is direct calling--

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.100
this is a direct call
to the restaurant.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.840
Or you can complete your payment
on app, as well.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.990
We call it [SPEAKING KOREAN].

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.240
So click on that.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.640
Select the food you like.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.180
-Yeah, I'm still craving
chicken.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.880
-Excellent choice.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.770
-Yep.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.660
-Put it in a cart.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.996
And you're ready to check out.

00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:48.246
Continue.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.790
And special requests--

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.510
we're just going to say Google
I/O for the sake of the event.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.550
-OK.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.240
So this would all be sent to
the restaurant itself.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.060
They're going to get this--

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.420
-Yes.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.820
---this order coming
in to them.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.250
-Yes.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.240
It would be on the receipt.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.490
-On the receipt.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.740
OK.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.715
-And then put your points.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.550
Continue.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.600
-OK.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.990
-Simple as that.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.580
And succeeded.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.130
And restaurant owner will
see that the order--

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.980
-It just popped right in.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.230
---arrived in.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.890
Let's go process the order.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.510
I received your order, and then
I decide how long does it

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.510
take to complete the order, like
30 minutes, 40 minutes,

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.480
50 minutes.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.210
-OK.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.240
-I'll just say 30 minutes.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.380
-And then the text message will
go straight to the user,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.056
say your delivery will be on
it's way in 30 minutes.

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:51.042
-Great.

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.292
-And on here--

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.667
here's your receipt, with the
Google I/O and a QR code where

00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:00.330
you can download our app.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.790
-Now I just want the chicken.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.710
-We made these badges for all
different food names in

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.755
Korean, since real food are
not allowed in most

00:08:10.755 --> 00:08:11.190
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.550
-Sure, sure.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.530
-Just pick one, anything.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.200
-OK, I'll take that one.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.880
-That's chicken.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.215
Perfect choice.

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:14.550
-All right.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.450
Thank you so much.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.446
I appreciate it.

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:16.944
All right.

00:08:16.944 --> 00:08:18.194
Thanks.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.101
And we wrap up by talking
to Media Studios.

00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:28.506
And I'm joined now by Morgan,
from Media Studios.

00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:30.911
Co-founder of Media Studios.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:35.256
So talk to me about the
collaborative video production

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:38.710
that you can do with Media
Studios, but also connecting

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.010
people around a particular
project.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.230
-Sure, absolutely.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.510
So the goal of mediastudio
really, is to facilitate media

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.896
production.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:49.050
The goal is to bring
Hollywood-quality production

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.536
to the YouTube ecosystem.

00:08:50.536 --> 00:08:54.161
So we've done that by bringing
talent and connecting with the

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:56.750
workflow management
system and tools.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.420
So it what makes it very easy
for anyone to come, find

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.350
people, or do the
work themselves.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.880
So here are a couple of tools
that we've developed.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.210
This is the subtitling tool.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.580
So if you don't have a script,
the first part is you have to

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.510
create a script with
time codes.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.460
So we extract the waveform from
the video, and make it

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.050
very easy through automation
to create your sync points,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.520
where all of the subtitles or
closed captions would occur.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.955
So this analyzes the waveform
and it would create the in and

00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:25.590
out points automatically, where
someone can then go in

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.744
and transcribe their text.

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:31.153
Once you have the text, you can
assign it to a translator

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.614
through the marketplace.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.808
So in this case, imagine
you would want to

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:36.704
have Spanish subtitles.

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:40.496
What we've done here is we've
integrated the auto Google

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:43.900
Translate API, where you can
just click a button, get an

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.745
automated translation.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:47.445
If you like it, with one click,
you can use it, or you

00:09:47.445 --> 00:09:50.812
can go in and actually make
modifications to it.

00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:53.140
Since it's all connected, you
can actually monitor the

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.305
workflow through the Mediastudio
platform.

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.928
Another tool we've developed
is a rotoscoping visual

00:09:58.928 --> 00:10:02.510
effects platform, where it
allows you to identify objects

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.640
you want to manipulate, either
remove, change the color.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.877
So in this case, I run a
rotoscoping algorithm which

00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:10.122
has identified by rows.

00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:13.608
I can then segment it out of the
picture, and then go and

00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:19.246
apply certain filters to it,
such as changing the colors on

00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:22.650
the fly, so it makes it very
easy to change and enhance

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.620
your video through
the platform.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.140
The goal is-- we have native
apps, but also to have

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.068
third-party apps, and create a
script-to-screen web-based

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:32.020
workflow for media production.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.728
-And this is post-production
we're talking about, as

00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:35.436
opposed to something
happening live--

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:36.412
-That's right.

00:10:36.412 --> 00:10:37.390
-Yeah, OK.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.264
And if somebody wants to get
help on a project they're

00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:43.047
working on, they can actually
come to Media Studios and find

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:44.030
the right people to help
them with that?

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.470
-Absolutely.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.830
You could start on your own,
and if you need help, just

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.242
basically post a job-- or
actually, run a filter on the

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:51.870
type of expertise you're
looking for.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.685
We've recommended creators from
all over the world will

00:10:54.685 --> 00:10:55.500
be presented to you.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.575
-And working within a certain
budget, time frame?

00:10:57.575 --> 00:10:59.590
-You can set the budget and
actually have people actually

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.950
propose their offers on
that specific project.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.420
-OK.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.495
And just quickly, what was the
experience like, working with

00:11:05.495 --> 00:11:06.920
the YouTube team
on all of this?

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.860
-They've been very,
very supportive.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.290
[INAUDIBLE] and Jeremy
have been terrific.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.350
And they're really helping to
get this out through their

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.690
community.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.810
-All right, cool.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.580
All right, thank you so much.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.230
-Thank you.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.740
-That's going to do it for the
YouTube Sandbox tour, here on

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:29.613
Google Developers Live
at I/O 2013, and cut.

00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:31.060
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.110
LOUIS GRAY: Very cool stuff.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.000
I mean, thanks a lot, Daniel,
for taking the time to go

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.460
through all those.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.320
I mean, it wasn't just YouTube
who you talked to.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.290
You talked with G+ guys,
Drive, and Maps.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.640
What was the summary of your
experience talking all these

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.230
partners interacting with
Google services?

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.960
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think the
consistent message was just

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.910
that the experience they had
with the development team was

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.820
rated very highly
in every case.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.740
Which--

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.590
I know that they're here at
this event, at our event,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.710
essentially, and maybe they feel
compelled to say that.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.260
But I got a sense that they
were totally genuine--

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.450
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: --about
everything that they were

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.150
saying about these
relationships, which is

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.430
critically important when
you're working with

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.600
developers.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.660
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.480
That's something
you have to do.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.010
If you're a developer, you want
to make sure that the

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.000
people who you're talking to
will give you the information

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.700
at the right time.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.060
That the APIs that you're
working on will still be

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.420
there, in six months.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.120
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.720
And you get the kind of feedback
that continues to

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.520
iterate and make applications
and the platforms great.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.730
Now, you'll notice, for those of
you watching at home, it's

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.320
gotten a little quieter here.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.790
We're coming up at the end of
our programming on day two,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.370
and it's the final time that
we'll be live streaming from

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.760
GDL at I/O. It wasn't too long
ago, a couple hours actually,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.170
you should have seen it
when Bradley was here.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.620
It was just--

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.010
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
right, it was packed.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.670
LOUIS GRAY: It felt like 1,000
people right behind us.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.060
We were keeping them off the
rope, which was really fun.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.910
We're really wanting to make it
known that we're doing GDL

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.090
really year-round.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.680
GDL at I/O has been
a lot of fun.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.420
It's been a pleasure to stand
next to you and do a lot of

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.480
this stuff.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.880
But we're kicking off incredible
content when we

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.980
head back to all of our
respective offices, be you in

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.530
New York, or Mountain View,
London, Sydney, we're

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:00.060
broadcasting around the world at
developers.google.com/live.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.820
There's hundreds of thousands
of people subscribed to

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.210
YouTube at Google Developers.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.860
We hope you're one of them.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.390
If you haven't done it already,
that's the best way

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.070
to really get the updates
coming in.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.630
DANIEL SIEBERG: And we should
say that the content from

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.050
everything that we've talked
about today, all of these

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.910
segments, will live in some
form through the GDL site.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.460
LOUIS GRAY: Not only will they
be on Google Developers Live,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.860
every single video is going to
be Google Developers Live,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.650
including all of the stream
sessions for I/O and those

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.020
that were just recorded.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.840
And so there are hundreds of
sessions that took place at

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.410
I/O over the last couple
of days which

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.630
were not yet streamed.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.340
And so we're going to take
those, take them from YouTube,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.600
put them on Google Developers
Live, and make that really the

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.110
clearinghouse for all of I/O
and all of the developer

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.190
content that we can
get to you.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.240
And help you do all the learning
that you need to do,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.565
and all the training
that you do, and

00:13:45.565 --> 00:13:47.330
have access to Googlers.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.150
It's really been an incredible
opportunity to have that kind

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.100
of transparency that I really
enjoy about Google.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.270
You mentioned that developers
need to be able to trust in

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.300
the code, and they need to be
able to trust in the company.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.670
And I think that's something
that was a big deal, even out

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.750
of yesterday's keynote,
like we talked about.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.750
Absolutely.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.430
So, I know there's still one
more day left, but could you

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.660
pick a highlight?

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.920
Narrow it down to one--

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.910
LOUIS GRAY: Well, for me, the
highlight has really been

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.420
having that kind of transparency
and being able to

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.570
talk to the Google executives
that make it happen.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.590
I mean, we really started
off with a bang.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.270
Not just with a three and a half
hour keynote, who we did

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.320
we get right after that?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.230
It was Megan Smith, Vice
President of Google[x].

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.020
She's thinking about things and
seeing things every day

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.490
that you and I, and most people
here and not here,

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.660
could only dream about.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.360
DANIEL SIEBERG: The
moon shots.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.345
LOUIS GRAY: The moon shots.

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:33.490
I mean, even for some of us
who live really close to

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.920
Google and see it, the
announcement of self-driving

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.040
cars, we're like, is
that even real?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.890
We hear about Glasses, it got
written up in the "New York

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.710
Times", we're like,
is that even real?

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.750
I would love to keep feeling
like that, is that even real?

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.520
And I think we get spoiled here
at Google because we have

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.240
access to so many brilliant
people, so much scale, and so

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.960
much dedication to
really making the

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.310
world a better place.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.350
Not just a better place to make
money, but a better place

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.710
to really have technology
that impacts everyone.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.590
And it becomes a conversation
here, where you get the

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.020
developers who can listen to all
of those folks at Google

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.280
and share all of their wisdom,
and then you get the Google

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.860
folks who can listen to the
development community in this

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.500
way that takes it off just
being connected to the

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.050
internet with emails, and
that kind of thing.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.070
But actually face-to-face
meetings, and--

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.860
LOUIS GRAY: That's
an important--

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: All of that's
still so important.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.900
LOUIS GRAY: I've talked about
that from day one.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.850
Google I/O is an incredible
place for the thousands of

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.940
developers to see us
face-to-face, to engage with

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.280
us, to ask us questions.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.810
Even Larry Page did
a Q&amp;A, yesterday.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.770
So we do want to hear.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.150
This isn't just empty.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.700
And Google Developers
Live is intended

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.440
especially to do that.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.960
And so, when we're broadcasting
out of smaller

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.820
studios in Mountain View,
smaller studios in Delhi, and

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.040
Milan, and all these places
where our people are

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.930
advocating on your behalf as
developers to make incredible

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.830
apps for our users.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.610
It is about that type of
transparency and engagement.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.490
And even for those people who
can't join us live, we always

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.690
want to make sure those
videos are available

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.420
for you go and get.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.950
And so it's really exciting to
have that Developers Live

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.950
site, where you go in and
go to the archives.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.550
And if you're someone who's
deep into Chrome, you can

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.180
watch every Chrome event ever.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.650
You can learn how to write your
first Drive app in C++,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.150
or JavaScript, or .Net,
or whatever is

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.100
your language of choice.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.970
And that's a really important
thing for me.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.180
What really stuck out for you?

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.540
You got 30 seconds.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: 30
seconds or less.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.650
I'm a little impartial to GEOBE,
and I feel like I've

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.440
attached to that world.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.780
So for me, the chance to now
talk about the new Google

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.120
Maps, which internally we've had
a chance to see for quite

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.670
a while, and now that this
is available and

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.230
out there for people.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.840
It's just really exciting,
and I think that

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.030
there's so much potential.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.300
LOUIS GRAY: And again, it goes
to moon shots and scale.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.410
What has happened with Street
View, and Earth, and mapping

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.840
the entire globe?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.530
It's just a really
incredible thing.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.610
So thank you very much for
the thousands, and

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.350
thousands, of people--

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.870
DANIEL SIEBERG: Wherever you are
in the world, speaking of

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.600
Maps, all over the world.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.990
LOUIS GRAY: And thank you again
for joining me on GDL at

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.040
I/O and for all the people on
the production side who helped

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.610
make this happen.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.070
We've had an incredible
run of events.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:56.960
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, we should
say there are a lot of

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.940
folks behind the camera here--

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.230
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: --who've
helped us out.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.050
LOUIS GRAY: So definitely
check us out.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.580
Developers.google.com/live,
we hope to see you there.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.830
Talk to you soon.
