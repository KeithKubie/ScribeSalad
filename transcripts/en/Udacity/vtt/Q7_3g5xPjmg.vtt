00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.296
Here are the solutions. Nice work if you got even half of these right. Now some

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:09.560
of these might have been tricky, like the second one or even this last one.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.228
Let's walk through each of these to see how they're done. To find f plus g of

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:20.512
1, we need to add the outputs of f of 1 and g of 1 together. To find f of 1 we

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:25.744
take x and set it equal to 1 for this function. So, if we plug in a 1 here and

00:00:25.744 --> 00:00:32.865
here in for x, then we'll get an output of positive 1. Next we need to find g

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:40.426
of 1. To find g of 1 we let x equal 1 for this function. So, we'll have 3 times

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:46.320
1 minus 5, which equals negative 2. We have f of 1 equal to 1 and g of 1 equal

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.914
to negative 2. So, we just add these two outputs together to get a final output

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:57.364
of negative 1. To find the second one, f minus g of 1, we'll take the output

00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:02.200
from g of 1, negative 2, and we'll subtract that from the output f of 1, which

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.410
equals 1. So notice I'll have 1 here minus negative 2. When we subtract a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:18.996
negative, we really add. So we'll have 1 plus 2 which equals positive 3. This

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:24.546
is our output for f minus g of 1. For f times g of 1, we'll simply multiply

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:32.200
these two outputs together. So, 1 times negative 2 equals negative 2. Now to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.470
find f divided by g of 2, we want to find f of 2 and divided it by g of 2. To

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.554
find f of 2 we plug in 2 in for x. This would give us an output of 2. 2 squared

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:52.564
equals 4, minus 4 is 0 plus 2 is 2. And for g of 2 we'll let the input x equal

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:58.684
positive 2, which means we'll get an output of positive 1. We'll have 6 minus 5

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:03.932
which equals 1. Now we're ready to do our division, this is f of 2 and this is

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:13.122
g of 2. We have 2 divided by 1 which equals 2. And finally to find f plus g of

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:19.160
x, we'll simply add these two functions together. So, combining the like terms

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.320
of x, we'll get one x and combining our constant terms we'll have negative 3.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.920
So, the overall function is x squared plus x minus 3, f plus g of x.
