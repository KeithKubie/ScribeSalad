[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:07.760
SPEAKER: We have a very
special treat today.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.170
We have Alaka Wali in
here to talk to us.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.970
Alaka is a curator
of North American

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.150
anthropology at our
very own Field Museum.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.860
She is also the
founding director

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.890
of the Center of Cultural
Understanding and Change,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.470
which was founded in 1995.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.410
Her research focuses on the
relationship between art

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.080
and the capacity for social
resilience, so something

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.970
that we really care
about here at Google.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.790
And today she'll
be talking to us

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.190
about the repurposing of
century-old collection

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.240
to tell modern stories.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.116
So please join me in welcoming
Alaka Wali today to talk.

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:48.008
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:50.690
ALAKA WALI: Thank you.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.300
Well, if you all ever
need an anthropologist,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.270
I'm ready to be
hired here at Google.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.720
What a wonderful place.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.200
What a great building.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.070
We got a great tour with Joe.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.390
And I'm really happy to be
here to talk with all of you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.080
about the Field
Museum's newer projects.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.210
I've been there
for about 20 years.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.180
I should tell you that I'm not
your standard curator type.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.820
I don't know if you all have
stereotyped notions of what

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.690
a curator is, but I'm not that.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm an applied anthropologist.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.010
I've always, in my
whole career, been

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.840
interested in how we can use
anthropology to solve problems,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.210
especially pressing problems
that face people today.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.250
I work both here--

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.560
I do urban anthropology--

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.800
and I also work in
the Amazon, working

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.760
with indigenous communities
around issues of,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.420
how we can engage people
to better conserve

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.490
the forests in which they live.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.460
And here in Chicago, we
work with communities

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.870
in all of the different
neighborhoods around Chicago

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.260
as well in thinking about,
again, their place here.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.710
Then how to make a better
quality of life that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.200
includes caring for
our environment,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.320
but also what it takes to
make a better quality of life.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.540
So that's part of what I've
been doing at the Field Museum,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.180
but I'm also the person since
2010 who's taken care of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.870
or been responsible for our
North American anthropology

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.310
collections.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.150
And so that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.630
When I came to the
museum, there was really

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.990
a sense at the
museum that we needed

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.730
to do more than just exhibits
of dinosaurs and mummies.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.990
We love our dinosaurs.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.640
We love our mummies.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.240
But we have a lot more to
offer than just dinosaurs

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.900
and mummies.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080
And so we really want
to begin to think

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
about, how can we
use our collections?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.780
How can we make them relevant to
today, to contemporary issues?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.130
So that's what I've kind of been
thinking about and working on

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.910
since I became the curator
of this collection, the North

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.770
American collection.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.990
So that's what I'm going
to talk to you about.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.960
And then hopefully we'll
just have a dialogue

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200
as well about some of that,
or about any of the other work

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.090
we do at the Field Museum.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.660
So the Field Museum, it's this
century-plus-old institution

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.950
in Chicago.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.370
It's actually the fourth
largest natural history

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.390
museum in the world in terms
of the size of our collections.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.410
We have over 30 million
between the specimens,

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.090
the natural history specimens,
and over a million artifacts

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.310
in the anthropology collection.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.180
So we are a world class
institution, if you will.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.390
And so we do have all
of these collections.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.000
Here's Stanley Field
Hall with the--

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.070
you can just see Sue in the
back there, our elephant.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.210
So it's a classic Greek,
evocative of the temple

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.650
of the museum kind
of institution.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.130
And we have these
amazing collections

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.270
at the Field Museum.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.290
I'm just going to focus on the
anthropology collections that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.180
speak to the heritage
of the world in terms

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.870
of who we are as human beings.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.610
Who are we as human beings?

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.080
What do we do?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.610
What have we done?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.190
So those two objects
I just showed you

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.500
were from the North
American collection.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.010
This is a sword and
shield from Africa.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.890
This is an amazing
sort of armor,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.710
sort of vest also from Africa.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.410
This is from South America.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.450
And these are our
bronze sculptures

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.970
that I'm going to talk
about in a minute.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.350
So we have this
amazing collection.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.340
Every single object, I think,
in our anthropology collection--

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.860
some of them are
not as beautiful.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.660
I gave you some
beauty shots there.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.920
But some of them are
not that beautiful,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.230
but they're still amazing for
the stories they can tell.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.220
And the problem is
that the stories

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.350
we had been telling in the
old halls in the old museum

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.480
have been problematic stories.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.070
And some of our halls--

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.060
like this one is the North
American Indian Hall--

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.480
still look like they're stuck
in the 1930s or 1900s even,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.390
image of what a natural history
museum should look like.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.230
And so that's a problem
because science changes.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.850
And we're a scientific
institution.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.510
And if we're going to
tell relevant stories,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.840
we have to keep up to
date with both the way

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.620
we talk about and
represent culture

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.010
and what we know about
human social behavior.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.100
And we have to be able to
do it in a compelling way.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.690
So that's the kind of
problem that's confronting us

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.380
right now, is we think about
how to transform the museum

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.080
and how to repurpose
our collections.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.340
Because they are so amazing,
they can tell powerful stories.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.700
So how do we do that?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.900
How do we make them tell?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.490
How do we get them to tell
the stories that they're

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.260
capable of telling?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.970
So today I want to talk to you
about three different examples

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.600
of how we're starting to
think about repurposing

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.880
the collections to tell
contemporary stories

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.010
and talk about the
Malvina Hoffman

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.580
sculptures, the bronzes.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.760
Talk about collaborating
with contemporary artists.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.200
And then talk about our native
North America collection.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.690
So the Malvina
Hoffman sculptures,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.010
this is a new exhibit that
we just opened in January.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.330
It will be in its current
location for about another two

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.380
years, or a year and a half.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.610
So please come see it.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.680
And this is an exhibition that
uses these bronze sculptures.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.330
There's 104 of them that
were made by an artist named

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.650
Malvina Hoffman.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.110
She was a student of Rodin.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.790
And she was commissioned
by the Field Museum

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:53.400
to make these sculptures for
the 1933 Century of Progress

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.700
World's Fair, that was following
the big World's Fair in 1893,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.110
was the next big World's
Fair that Chicago hosted.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:12.530
And the Field Museum
directors and the curators

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.550
wanted to have a big
splash at that fair.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.940
And so they decided to
open two new exhibitions.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.480
One was a hall of
evolution, and the other one

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.020
was going to be called
the Races of Mankind.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.890
And what they wanted was
to show what at that time

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.570
was considered state of
the art thinking about race

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.400
and the way in which we can
categorize human beings.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.140
But rather than just have
an exhibit that basically

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.830
looks like this, they decided--

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.620
and they had been for a
while, the Field Museum

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.120
directors and curators,
had been using artists

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.220
in making the dioramas.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.730
I think many of you might be
familiar with the dioramas.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.190
A lot of those dioramas,
the backgrounds

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.590
are made by famous local artists
here in Chicago of that time.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.020
So they were familiar
with using art

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.960
to convey scientific
information.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.720
And in the case of
this Races of Mankind,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.120
they decided to go all out
and work with Malvina Hoffman.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.150
But the message of
the exhibition was--

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.140
if you think about what
the thinking around race

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.780
was in the 1930s,
that was kind of

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.110
like the height of the
eugenicist movement in both

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.070
the United States and then
reverberating back to Europe,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.220
and think about Hitler.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.840
Where did he get his ideas?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.120
A lot of his ideas
were influenced

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.960
by scientists, or
so-called scientists,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.920
who were promoting this
eugenicist view of race

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.320
and racial typologising.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:12.030
And the fundamental underlying
assumption of the typologising

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:18.180
is that we humans can be divided
into these categories called

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.740
races based solely
on the way we look,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.920
so our phenotypic variation.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.670
And to sort of like
say, OK, well--

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.040
and then the great
debate was around,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.560
well, where do you
make these lines of who

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.870
fits into what category?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.020
And so some scientists
of that time

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.830
argue that there were these
four broad categories.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.060
There was the negroid, the
mongoloid, the caucasoid,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.350
and then the Native
American or indigenous type.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.220
Some said three types.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.500
But then other scientists,
such as the ones

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.630
at the Field
Museum, said there's

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.680
a lot more physical variation.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.740
So we have more types.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.090
And so in this exhibition
that they created,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:11.460
they want it to show the
varieties of human typologies

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.210
that they saw.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:17.700
And basically, their typology
was based on geography.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.090
So here is a map
that was produced out

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.220
of that exhibition.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.110
And you can sort of see-- can
you see that it's color coded?

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.520
Different types belong in
different parts of the world.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.350
It's not based on science.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.610
It's based on an ideology
rather than a science.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:45.510
So the ideology that underlies
this way of thinking about

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.570
physical variation
among humans is

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:55.410
that these differences
matter, and that in addition

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.250
to sort of drawing a
line between how we look,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.310
the categories of
race, those categories

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.530
correspond to
differences in behavior.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.370
That's what's so pernicious
about this kind of what

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.190
we call scientific racism.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.000
Because it was the association
of behavior with the way

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.020
you look.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.150
So folks who had thick
lips and big noses

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.240
were immediately
characterized as behaving

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.120
in a way that was
inferior to folks

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:34.740
who had fine Greek noses and
aquiline features, if you will.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.910
So that kind of thinking
about the association

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.720
between behavior
and looks is what

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.870
has been the insidiousness of
race and racial typologising.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:13:02.030
So by 1969, the thinking around
race among anthropologists,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.750
and I think among scientists
in general for the most part,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.310
had changed because of the
revolution with the DNA

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.600
discoveries.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.190
And so once people started
doing genetic analysis of human

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.250
variation, as you
all probably know,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:24.200
what we found is that you
cannot categorize people

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.360
into subcategories.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.320
We're all one species.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.370
We're all homo sapiens sapiens.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.880
There isn't a way in
which you can say, well,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.330
hair type and nose
shape and lips all

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.810
correspond to make this type
different from that type.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.710
Genetically, that's
a bunch of nonsense.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:50.870
And so knowing
that, the curators

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.550
of the 1960s at the
Field Museum decided

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:02.330
that the exhibition Races of
Mankind should be de-installed.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:08.560
There was also, by that
time, as you probably know--

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.110
probably didn't live
through that time,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.600
looking at all of you--

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.040
there was in the 1960s, with
the Civil Rights Movement

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.910
in this country, and with
independence movements

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.130
globally, there was
a kind of a sense

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:33.500
of protest against the whole
issues around race and racism.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.870
The anti-racist work was
starting to build in that time.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.200
And the idea that you
could depict people

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.580
into these kinds of typologies
had become pretty offensive.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.510
And actually, this map, if
I can go back for a second,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.437
this was a map made
with our sculptures.

00:14:52.437 --> 00:14:53.770
Can you see the sculptures here?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.978
These are all the sculptures.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.590
I'm going to show you
better photos in a minute.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.490
This was made by
Hammond, the map company,

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.470
and used in schools
around the country.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.470
So it's very widely distributed.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.390
And this African American poet--

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.800
Amiri Baraka, or LeRoi
Jones, he was known--

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.150
saw the map, wrote a letter
to the Field Museum, and said,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.760
you should cease
and desist in using

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.970
this kind of racist material.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.060
And so the Field Museum was
getting a lot of pressure

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.070
around the exhibition,
although it

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.720
was a very popular exhibition
because people really

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.370
loved the sculptures.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.350
So if you come to the museum
and see them, you'll see why.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:46.840
The sculptures themselves
have a very compelling quality

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.580
to them.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:54.530
They're-- Malvina Hoffman as
a student of Rodin knew how

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.790
to sculpt in bronze.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.150
In fact, the original
idea of the curators

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.270
was that these
figures of the races

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.370
would all be plaster casts.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.600
And she convinced them that they
should be these bronze statues.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.500
And she was in love with
the human form as well.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.360
So her sculptures are
all of beautiful people.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.730
Look at this guy.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.110
I mean, you know.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.630
And even when they depict
what seems so exotic to us,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.250
people have this quality of
dignity in her sculptures.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.580
And so the sculptures
have remained popular.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.430
And when I came to
the Field Museum,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.230
I fell in love with
the sculptures.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.520
Even though I knew about
the kind of problematic past

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.230
of the exhibition and the
scientific or pseudoscientific

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.280
thinking that had
informed that exhibition,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.050
I couldn't see how we would
just relegate those sculptures

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.640
to the closet or
de-accession them.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.490
Because they've had
such a relationship

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.950
to the history of the
museum, and because they're

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.430
so compelling.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:15.050
So we were thinking about, how
do we tell this story again?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.349
How do we bring the
sculptures out of the closet

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.910
and tell a modern story?

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.800
And we also wanted
to honor Malvina,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.180
one of the very
few women sculptors

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.990
of her time who did this
massive amount of work.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.900
She made 104 of these
bronzes in three years.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.220
And she traveled the world.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.680
She was in India.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.820
She went there to sculpt
people from living examples.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.000
It's a long story.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.250
I'm not going to go into it.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.380
But it's amazing, her story.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.070
So we didn't want to
just ignore the value

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.450
of these compelling,
beautiful sculptures.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.850
We wanted to use them.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.890
So we have now made
a new exhibition

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.370
that is called
Looking at Ourselves,

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.940
Rethinking the Sculptures
of Malvina Hoffman.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.980
And in that exhibit, we now
talk about what we know today

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:16.850
about race and racism and
how the thinking around race

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.030
has continued to
persist and continues

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.800
to impact our lives today.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.970
So here what you see here
are some of the busts

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.290
that she made.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.080
And with the busts,
we talk about what

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.530
is wrong with the
way that we have

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.300
learned to think about race.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.860
And the problem is, as much as I
can say to you that there is no

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.040
such thing as race
biologically--

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.230
it doesn't make
sense, et cetera--

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.760
it's so ingrained in the way
we think about each other.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.750
It's so ingrained in how we
judge each other physically,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.790
phenotypically, if you will.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.510
So it's really
hard to get people

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:05.890
to stop thinking about it in the
way that we've been kind of--

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.410
we've absorbed into the
way we think about race.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.930
And so we're hoping that
in connecting these 1933

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.360
sculptures to
Black Lives Matter,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.200
we can start to think
about that deep hold

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.020
that the ideology
of race has on us,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.900
has continued to
have this insidious

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.890
effect on the structure
of our societies.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.000
And as much as we would like to
think that the concept is dead,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.320
it's not dead.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.940
And its consequences live on.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.470
So that's one part
of the exhibit.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.140
That's one way that we're trying
to think about, how do you--

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.740
because the sculptures are
so inviting, so compelling,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.000
how can we use them to
tell this newer story?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.510
And then these are
these full figure

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.640
bronzes that she also made.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.270
So she made busts, and she
made these full figure bronzes.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.710
And what's so cool about
these is that she didn't just

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:13.190
make sort of the
racial typology things

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.480
that the curators wanted.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.230
And in fact, she was arguing
with the curators all the time.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.910
She made people.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.510
And in her notes,
she kept records

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.330
with her husband of
who these people were.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.080
And so we have the stories
of some of these individuals.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.820
And in many cases--

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.620
in almost all cases--

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.810
she put some cultural
markers on them.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.180
And whether it was in the
clothes they're wearing

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.160
or their adornment or the
things they're doing--

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.210
can you see this guy
is climbing a tree?

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.590
This is southern India.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.900
He's a toddy palm.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.760
He's getting toddy hot-- which
is a syrup from the toddy palm.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.780
And there's video
footage from her travels.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:08.140
So it's all a really very,
very deep collection.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.710
And the stories of these
people are really amazing.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:18.880
This guy here on the surfboard
is Sargent Kahanamoku.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.610
And he and his
family were the ones

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:26.400
who were responsible for
the popularity of surfing

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.890
in the 1950s.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:33.520
His brother Duke
traveled to California

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.970
and was really important in
terms of popularizing surfing.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.530
People are not what they seem.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.020
So the guy in the middle
in the kind of yoga

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.570
pose, she made him
pose like that.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:52.100
He was a Cambridge
scholar that she

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.540
met in England or
Paris and generally

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.580
a very dapper dresser.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.580
So there's a lot of
problematics to this collection.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.010
But I think we can
tell a good story.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.050
And with the full
figure stories,

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.250
we try to tell the story
of how our behavior isn't

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.810
defined by how we look.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:16.330
That you cannot associate
behavior with the way you look.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:22.270
So folks who look a certain way,
think of all the stereotypes

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.100
you know.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.675
I like to use the example
of the blond bimbo.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:34.360
Blond women are often
characterized as dumb.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.537
So we know that's
not true, right?

00:22:37.537 --> 00:22:39.370
I mean, I don't have
to go into the obvious.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.440
But people who look like this--

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.280
these are the San people from
the Kalahari Desert, often

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.920
characterized as our
Stone Age ancestors,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.300
as the people who are the most
primitive of the primitive.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.550
Well, these people
have a history.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.460
The San were, in
fact, for a long time,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.110
they were agricultural folks.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.190
They had cattle.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.620
And then they were
pushed off their lands.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.110
They end up in the
Kalahari Desert.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.320
They figure out how to live
in the Kalahari Desert.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.130
They figure out that to
live in the Kalahari Desert,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.100
you actually can
live pretty well.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.850
And what their life is like
today in the Kalahari Desert

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.780
before they were
colonized and pushed again

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.970
under reservations--

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.760
they were, by hunting
and gathering nuts,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.190
they had enough food to live.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:43.370
And they only had to work
maybe two hours a day, if that.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.550
And their time is
their own to set.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.960
And so they have all this
time where they tell stories.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.490
They dance.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.420
They have a rich
life, cultural life.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.210
Like you guys at Google.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.250
Because you don't have to
work all the time either.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.140
No, I'm just kidding.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.430
You can set your
own time, right?

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.920
So in a way, people realize
the wisdom of this lifestyle

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.460
that the San have.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.570
And when anthropologists
started telling this story

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.830
about the Kalahari San and
that they're not so primitive

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.220
as we like to think, I don't
think people believed us

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.240
for a long time.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.290
And then people did actual
nutritional studies and so on

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.180
and found that that was true.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.250
And then there's a third
part of the exhibit

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.710
where we talk about
Malvina's story,

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.300
and how she had the courage
to stand up to the curators

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.920
and to use her art.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.860
So her art really
subverts the narrative

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:54.740
that the curators wanted
to tell about human beings

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.570
and our physical variation.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.210
And in the end, the
sculptures, because of the way

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.570
she made them into
portraits of real people,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.640
and because they're
so compelling,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.990
we can bring them out.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.590
We can tell this
new story with them

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:15.800
and confront the problematic way
in which they were used before.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.500
Talk about that, not hide that.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.750
But also then say,
what do we do today?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.820
What do we know today?

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.345
And how do we think about
race and racism today?

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.470
So that's one way we
repurposed the collection.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:41.610
Then I became the curator of
this North American collection.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.090
And by chance, I
happened to meet

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.350
Maria Pinto, who's a fashion
designer right here in Chicago.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.850
She is known because
she designed dresses

00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:00.390
for Michelle Obama back in
the day and for Oprah Winfrey

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.630
and so on.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.470
And I thought it
would be fun to have

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.560
her come and look
at our collection

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.490
and think about what--

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.480
see what she saw in the
collection as an artist.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.230
And so we took her
into the collections.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.850
And I thought she
was going to be

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.260
interested in these
kinds of things.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.460
We have these
beautiful silk kimonos.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.710
To me, that's what fashion
is kind of stereotypically--

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.370
I didn't know anything
about fashion.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.240
And it turns out she wasn't.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.970
She liked them.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.100
But that's not what
she was interested in.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.160
She was more interested
in things like this

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.870
that we had in our collection.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.730
This is a mask from Brazil.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.760
And what interested
her was the way

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.070
that people around the world
used materials and used

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.170
natural materials in these
super innovative ways to create,

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:09.810
and how careful
they were to craft,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.190
how much attention they paid
to the actual stitching.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.160
Because she's a very
detail-oriented person.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.470
And she's really
interested in her clothes.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.270
So I'm wearing a Maria
Pinto, just because I

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.980
have to talk this evening.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.660
But I think the camera
man noticed, right?

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.840
Immediately noticed
that it has this collar.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.560
She's interested in
not just the look

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.330
of things, but in
how they're made,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.260
and the materials that are used.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.450
So she became very
excited by these things.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.225
And she ended up--

00:27:48.225 --> 00:27:52.380
she had to choose 25 out
of the hundreds of objects

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.920
that she saw to put
in her exhibition.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.920
And what we've been
doing is we asked

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.620
her to choose her own designs,
clothing that she had made,

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.410
to put in with our collections.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.810
And to sort of bring
that perspective

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:14.850
of an artist aesthetic to
looking at our collection.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.180
So it's a way of bringing
out our collections

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.380
and letting people see them
through the eyes of an artist,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.560
rather than through
the curatorial eye.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.850
And then actually stopping
to look and see, what is this

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.510
made of?

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:38.580
And isn't it-- would you wear
this today, the Inuit raincoat?

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.220
It looks so modern, right?

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.210
It looks like something
you could wear today.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.380
And it has this kind of
appeal that's enduring.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:53.080
And her own designs,
that kind of translucency

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.640
that you see in the Inuit
raincoat or coat made out

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.280
of seal intestine, is
something that she had been--

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.400
she wasn't directly inspired
to make that by this,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.357
but there's a resonance there.

00:29:09.357 --> 00:29:11.980
AUDIENCE: So the coat--
when is the coat from?

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:17.030
ALAKA WALI: The coat is from
probably the late 19th century.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.300
AUDIENCE: How was
it made out of seal?

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.450
ALAKA WALI: It's made
out of seal intestine.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.470
Yeah, waterproof, right?

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.070
You know, here's the thing.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.570
People-- yes, everything
is functional.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:36.910
So when people make stuff, they
want to make it functional.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.550
But there's always-- in
our collections, what

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.130
you begin to see--
and this is what

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.300
has been so powerful for me--
is this aesthetic element

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.800
to everything people make.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.270
To make it functional,
they didn't

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.390
have to trim it with
these beautiful--

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.040
right?

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.800
They didn't have to do that.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.900
Or seams or kind of pay
attention to any of that.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.310
So think about what that
says about human creativity

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:14.890
and why people want to have
aesthetic things around them

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.950
all the time.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.970
And what have we lost if
we don't pay attention

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.810
to that sense of aesthetics?

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.450
That's the art and
social resilience

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.230
thing that I'm working on.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.710
So here's another example.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.280
And what was fun about
doing this exhibition was,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.810
in addition to just putting
the objects with her designs,

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.870
we told the stories
of how they were made.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.990
And we didn't put
labels because I

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.220
didn't want to have
her instillation marred

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.010
by didactic label copy.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:57.190
So instead, we did
that on a touch screen.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.410
And so you could touch
each one of these,

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.810
including her garments.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.750
And you could see the
story about that piece

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.870
and what we knew about it.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:12.700
And then sort of in that same
vein, but now more recently,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.250
I've been working with
Native American artists

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:20.830
because we have about 75,000
objects from native North

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.990
America as anthropology objects.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.380
If we look at our
archeology collections,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:32.060
there's over 250,000 from
native North America.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.800
And so it's a really
daunting responsibility

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.210
to think about, how do you use--

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.680
how do you bring
that out responsibly

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.890
and in a way that
respects native voice?

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.620
Because at this
point, I think we

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.540
at the Field Museum
feel that just having

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.530
a sort of curatorial
voice telling the story,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:06.250
it's not as rich, and it's not
as accurate even, as including

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.740
the voice of the
people whose heritage

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.170
this collection represents.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.050
So again, the question
I was faced with

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.270
was, well, which people?

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.770
And who?

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:22.300
So I have selected
to work with artists

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.590
from the native community.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.630
And today, native North
American contemporary artists,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.710
that scene is booming.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.230
It's exploding.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:37.000
There's so much rich work that
native artists are producing

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.900
right now.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.210
So there's like
no end to what we

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.780
can do working with
Native American artists.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.400
And again, it's their
unique perspective.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.990
It's not a community or
a collective perspective,

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.800
but it is collective and
individual at the same time.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.360
And so the first one we work
with was Bunky Echo Hawk.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.080
He's a Pawnee artist.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.120
The reason I got
interested in him

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.540
was because I found
out that he was asked

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.580
by Nike to design Nike wear.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.880
They have a line called
M7, which is specifically

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.730
for Native American
athletes or people

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.160
of Native American heritage.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.400
It's a really cool
seventh generation thing.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.370
And they actually asked native
artists to design the line.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:34.120
So he was one of the first
to do that with them.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.340
And so he came.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.450
And like Maria Pinto, he
was selecting objects.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.050
He chose objects pretty
much from the Pawnee,

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.080
and then his mom is
from from Yakima peoples

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.060
in Washington state.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.970
And this guy, he's not
even 40 yet, I don't think.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:02.330
And his father is a very
famous native rights lawyer,

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.590
Walter Echo Hawk.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:11.989
But Bunky knows so much about
Pawnee cultural heritage.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.500
And so he was looking at the
objects in our collection

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.810
and telling us,
oh, this is this,

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.469
and this is what that means.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:24.590
And so we learned a tremendous
amount from working with him.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:30.290
And then in his case, again,
he does painting on acrylic,

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.320
using acrylic on canvas.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.590
And he selected I
think about 20 objects

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.290
and paired them with his work.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.429
And here can you
see that the paint--

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:48.260
he was inspired to make this
painting, out with the old,

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.060
in with the new.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.620
I love that, because
when he saw this dress,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.590
which is in our collection--
and that's probably late--

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.360
this is a Ghost Dance dress,
from the time of the Ghost

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.640
Dance, late 19th century.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.080
And then see these?

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.200
These are buffalo horn spoons,
that the actual ones also

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.960
were in the exhibit.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.160
These are-- he fell in
love with these spoons made

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.660
of buffalo horn.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.180
Look at how-- that's
what I was saying.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.800
You It's just a spoon.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.700
But look at how beautiful it
is, how well crafted it is.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.200
And he was like,
thinking-- and he

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:37.350
says, think about what it meant
to eat with a spoon like that.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.150
How would your food taste?

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.170
How would you think about
who you are, having made

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.800
and knowing who
made such a spoon?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.660
And then think about what
we eat with today, plastic.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.460
Or even if we're
using stainless steel.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.320
It doesn't have that power.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.830
It doesn't tell you
something about yourself,

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:07.860
when you don't have that
same kind of aesthetic

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.560
to the quality of
your everyday life.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.300
And so for me, that was
a very powerful moment.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.490
And that painting is powerful
because he's basically saying,

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.690
are we throwing out the
old in favor of the new?

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.090
And what does that
mean when we do that?

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.900
And here's another one.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.490
This is a very popular painting.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.610
You can go on his
website and get

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:36.840
prints of this one, the
Yoda in the headgear.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.720
It's called "If
Yoda was an Indian."

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.220
And Bunky came to the
opening of the exhibit,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.580
and all these kids saw
him and immediately wanted

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.580
to have their photo
taken with him.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.860
And it was wonderful
kind of a moment there.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.440
So now, right now
at the Field Museum,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.660
we have two new exhibitions
that are just opened October 29.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.750
And they're two
contemporary native artists.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.690
One is Ronda Holy Bear.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.120
She's a Lakota artist.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.030
And the other is Chris Pappan.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.050
And he is a Chicago
urban Indian,

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:25.020
but he's enrolled in the Kanza
tribe out in Oklahoma now.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.540
They used to be Kansas.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.050
And that's where the name
for the state comes from.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.970
And he's also part Osage.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.960
And so Rhonda does this
incredible bead work.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.350
She taught herself how
to bead and to carve.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.320
And Chris is a
ledger artist, which

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.490
is a narrative tradition
that comes from the Plains

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.870
Indians, where there was always
a long tradition of drawing

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.440
on hide or rock art
among the Plains Indians.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.460
And then when they became
confined to reservations

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.250
or imprisoned on forts
in the late 19th century,

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.160
they got access to paper.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.680
And they were making
these paper drawings

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.620
on paper called ledger art.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.520
Often it was ledger books.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.230
And so he calls himself a
21st century ledger artist.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.040
He's reviving that tradition.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.860
Here's Rhonda with the people
who gave us the initial--

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.560
they live in Chicago.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.470
Some of her figures, some
of her older figures.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:35.160
And then her story
is really cool

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.740
because she grew
up here in Chicago

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.400
and used to come to the
Field Museum all the time

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.040
and was inspired
by the collections

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.780
to start making her
figures, her dolls.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.340
And did a lot of research
in our collection

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.990
so that she could make
accurate representations of--

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.140
you have to come see the
exhibit because her work is

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.500
pretty spectacular.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.050
And again, some of
our-- you can see

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.740
where some of her
inspiration comes from.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.740
Look at these.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.430
This is 1893.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.850
And with Chris, we did
something really different.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.470
This is Chris.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:18.850
This is his drawing that we
purchased for the museum.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.220
And we purchased this one too.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.710
I showed you that
old hall, right?

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.450
Remember I showed
you in the beginning

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:29.350
with the mannequins and
the faceless mannequins?

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.410
That hall is the
hall that is the last

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.210
of the permanent
halls that has never

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.300
been changed since the 1950s.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.890
And we are about to begin the
process of redoing that hall.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.690
We want to-- we're in the hunt
for money to redo the hall

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.830
and rethink how
we're going to do it.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.720
But in the meantime,
we thought, why not

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.070
have Chris's exhibition be
an intervention in that hall?

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.790
Why not have him
comment through his art

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.170
on the representation
of native peoples

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.700
from this moment in our past?

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.960
And you don't have to say a lot.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.940
When you see his--

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.310
these are kind of
reproductions of his work.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.880
And then he made these
especially as decals

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.400
to put on the cases.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.710
You don't have to say a lot.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.030
For people to stop and look
and see things differently.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:35.560
And I don't know if you
can see this back here.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.850
This is a drawing he
did of a powwow chair.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:45.370
And there's a collection for
Mark, like a fake catalog card

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.220
here.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.330
So he's got a really
great sense of humor.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.270
And there's a lot
of his drawings

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.630
that have this kind
of wry sense of humor,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.350
as well as these
interventions on the cases.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.500
And then he got excited
to do this with us

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.160
so he was inspired
to do something

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.790
he'd never done before, which
is to make a multimedia piece.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.560
So that's on that screen
in the middle of the hall,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.490
is this piece that
he did with two

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:24.700
of his collaborators, Adam Sings
in the Timber and Santiago X.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:31.090
Adam is a film videographer, and
then Santiago X is a musician.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:41.660
And so they came together, and
they found a 1894 Thomas Edison

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.780
silent film, one of
the very first films

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:50.630
that Edison ever made
was of native peoples.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.100
He's calling it "The
Buffalo Dance," which

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.160
he found these people
in the Wild West Show,

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.220
a Buffalo Bill show.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.722
And he got them to a studio,
and he made this silent film.

00:42:02.722 --> 00:42:04.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:14.130
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:21.770
So Chris is commenting on
these old representations

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.920
of native peoples,
both in our hall

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:30.990
and in the way Americans have
thought about native peoples.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.524
And they start deliberately
distorting the film.

00:42:34.524 --> 00:42:36.190
I don't know if we're
going to see that.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:41.090
But also superimposing these
images from contemporary times

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.490
to say, native peoples
are still here.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.869
Native peoples are thriving.

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:47.910
They haven't disappeared.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.920
Year They're not some
relic of your imagination,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.470
some distortion version
of what they are today.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.940
And so I think--

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.280
and here is the last
scene in the film.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.130
It's also [INAUDIBLE]
of the current protest

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.090
right now that's
going on in North

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.790
Dakota against the pipeline,
the Dakota Access Pipeline.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.460
How many of you are familiar
with what's going on there?

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.460
Yeah.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.460
Good.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.960
That's good.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.940
And so I think--

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.280
I hope I've been
able to show you

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.200
that you can repurpose the past.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.995
You can use our
incredible collections

00:43:38.995 --> 00:43:42.780
to tell stories that
are relevant today

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.950
that concern all of us.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.681
Nothing can be more important
than thinking about race,

00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:49.180
right?

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.970
It affects all of us today.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.780
We have to think about it.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.860
How do we do it?

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.516
What is our job in our museum
to help people think about it?

00:43:58.516 --> 00:44:02.920
Native peoples are here with us.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.130
They have a lot to
teach us about what

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.050
we should value in life.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.440
Why should we value
water over oil?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.270
That's what that
protest was about.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.470
So I think listening
to them, thinking

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.320
about what they
have created for us,

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.411
why is it important to
make stuff beautiful?

00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:26.630
Why is that important
for human beings

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.760
to make things beautiful?

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.700
Listening to that,
thinking about that,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:39.160
is a great part of how we
can begin to bring people

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.872
into dialogue with
each other and

00:44:41.872 --> 00:44:43.800
with our amazing collections.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.100
So thank you, and
thanks to our staff.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.900
