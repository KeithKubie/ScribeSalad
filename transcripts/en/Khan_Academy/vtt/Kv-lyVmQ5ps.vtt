00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:02.833
- [Instructor] In previous
videos, we started talking about

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:04.842
the idea of transformations.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.618
In particular, we talked
about rigid transformations.

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:11.586
So for example, you can shift something.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:14.303
This would be a translation.

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:17.000
So the thing that I'm moving
around is a translation

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.007
of our original triangle.

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:20.648
You could have a rotation.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:25.299
So that thing that I
translated, I am now rotating it

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:27.832
as you see right over there.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:28.995
And you can also have a reflection.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.705
The tool that I'm using doesn't
make reflection too easy.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:35.155
But that's essentially
flipping it over a line.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.412
But what we're going to
talk about in this video

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.206
is a non-rigid transformation.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.541
And what makes something
a rigid transformation

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.580
is that lengths between
points are reserved.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.657
But in a non-rigid transformation,

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.380
those lengths do not need to be preserved.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.252
So for example, this rotated
and translated triangle

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.718
that I'm moving around right
here, in fact I'm continuing

00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:58.848
to translate it as I talk.

00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:00.474
I can dilate it.

00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:02.738
And one way to think about
dilation is that we're just

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.940
scaling it down or scaling it up.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.178
So for example, here,
I am scaling it down.

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:09.567
That is a dilation.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.095
Or I can scale it up.

00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:14.863
This is also a dilation or even going off

00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:16.552
of the graph paper.

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:18.420
So the whole point
here's just to appreciate

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.749
that we don't just have
the rigid transformations,

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.693
we can have other types
of transformations,

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:25.803
and a dilation is one
of them in your toolkit

00:01:25.803 --> 00:01:28.150
that you will often see,
especially when you get introduced

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.650
to the idea of transformation.
