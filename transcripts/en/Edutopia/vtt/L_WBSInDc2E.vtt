00:00:01.206 --> 00:00:03.586
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Hi, mom, welcome
to my Student-Led Conference.

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.126
First, I'm going to tell
you about my goals.

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:12.786
&gt;&gt;The conferences here are different.

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:18.096
Most schools, the teachers talk to
the parent, but in our school here,

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.216
Wildwood, the students
talk to the parents.

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:23.226
We actually get to tell our
parents what we're doing.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.966
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: I think the greatest impact

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:29.616
that I see is them taking
ownership of their growth process.

00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:32.466
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Pretty much
it just changes everything

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.366
about parent-teacher conferences.

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:36.936
They get to see all your work
and everything that you're doing.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.476
And actually get to learn a few
things about what you're doing.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:39.746
So.

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:41.066
&gt;&gt;At the beginning of the universe,

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.296
creation of stars, creation
of the earth.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:47.366
We mapped that onto a
football field as a timeline.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:47.433
&gt;&gt;Rita: Wow.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.266
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: I think student
ownership of learning,

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.346
and what that means is students
being able to say, "This is who I am

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:56.126
as a learner, this is what I'm learning,
this is why it's important to me,"

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:59.556
you're building that sense of relevance
and connection to the curriculum,

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.026
sense of relevance and connection
to each other, to the teacher,

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:04.936
and to the broader work
of the community.

00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:07.956
To actually make student
ownership a reality

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:09.716
in the school is very challenging.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:13.126
So what we did is we just started
very small, and we just said,

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:15.596
"Just figure out how students are
going to have a little more presence

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.256
at the conference," and I
think just creating that sense

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.216
that the student is the center of
the conference, so the student gets

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.136
to be the one that facilitates
that conference.

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.776
&gt;&gt;Maddy: And here's the table
of contents for my binder.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.486
So first, there's an introductory
letter, to introduce you

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:32.356
to thee Student Conference,
and what I'd be talking about.

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:35.686
Look at that.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.036
&gt;&gt;Brigid: It's not about us.

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:39.706
It's the kids' turn to
conference with the parents.

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:40.826
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: It's their turn to shine.

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:43.826
We provide enough resources for them,

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:47.666
so that when they lead the
conference, they feel confident.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:52.666
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Well, this year we wrote an
essay, to know what we're going to say

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.766
to our parents, and not
just keep pausing.

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.316
&gt;&gt;Now I will tell you my
strengths and then my weaknesses.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:00.496
My strengths are math.

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:04.306
So, for example, this is exponents.

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:08.316
And this is long division.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:12.546
&gt;&gt;Maddy: During the quarter, you really
have to like work on each assignment,

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.076
'cause you know you're
going to like want

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:16.756
to tell your parents something about it.

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:22.266
&gt;&gt;Brigid: There's a lot of pre-work
that's done before conferences happen.

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:27.156
The kids have got to practice, and
you also have to really let them think

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:29.746
about what they want
to be in their binder.

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:34.176
It's a combination of things that
they chose, and things that we chose.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.156
&gt;&gt;Maddy: So when I was
preparing my binder, you know,

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.736
the whole time I was thinking,
"Oh, I can tell my mom

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.586
like all the new things I learned."

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:44.296
&gt;&gt;Probably my favorite thing is this.

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:48.176
We like found three things for each
document, and disconnected them.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:52.366
&gt;&gt;The purpose of the student led
conference is to who her where I was at,

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.276
where I am at, and where
I want to be at.

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:59.206
&gt;&gt;So, for Quarter 2, I want to get
better at like literary devices

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:03.646
and analytical paragraphs, and to better
on the vocabulary tests that we have.

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.556
So like you could help
me study for those.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.116
&gt;&gt;I really got to show my mom
like the work that I was proud of.

00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:11.806
And I also included some work
that I kind of struggled with.

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:14.066
&gt;&gt;And then here's a vocabulary test.

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:16.696
I was very confused on this one.

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:19.636
&gt;&gt;While I'm doing the work, and
towards the end of the quarter,

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:23.956
I'm like kind of looking at like how
I'm doing, because I know that I'll have

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:26.006
to talk about, not just
the teacher, but I will.

00:03:26.696 --> 00:03:28.336
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: It gets people
used to be able

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.956
to like review their
work, like a reflection.

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:32.686
&gt;&gt;Brigid: Reflection is
part of our school culture.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:34.736
You know, as teachers
we're expected to reflect.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:38.456
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: I'm going to
need to work on these traits.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:42.516
So, the first take, it would
be like raising my hand more.

00:03:42.516 --> 00:03:45.046
Or like going into activities
where I wouldn't feel

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:47.416
like comfortable, like my comfort zone.

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:49.186
Like working in groups, kind of.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:50.826
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: That's a good reflection.

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:51.226
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Yeah.

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:55.816
&gt;&gt;Rita: What Jonathan was able to
showcase, makes me so proud of him.

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:58.606
He also have a good grasp
of what he's learning.

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.846
And that depth is what I
really was able to get today.

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:05.346
And I couldn't have got
from him at home.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:05.986
&gt;&gt;Good job.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:06.246
&gt;&gt;Teachers: Good job.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:06.746
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Yeah, thank you.

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:10.736
&gt;&gt;Brigid: It helps parents to see
their kids in a different light, too.

00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:12.746
This is what my child is as a student.

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:15.526
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Like you can see like
the little details of how I draw.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.396
&gt;&gt;Christine: Through Student-Led
Conferences and through the reflection,

00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:24.276
and emphasis on applying what you
know, and articulating what you know,

00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:29.206
and sharing what you know, it's been
really cool to see the expression

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:31.466
of what someone's learned
about themselves.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:34.916
&gt;&gt;Maddy: Loving events and people in
my life have helped me become who I am.

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:39.446
No matter how many things change
in the future, I'll still be me.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:39.976
&gt;&gt;Christine: I hope so.

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:40.496
Good job.

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:41.796
&gt;&gt;Maddy: Thanks!
