Speaker 1:          00:05          All right. So there does seem to me to be a rebirth of a defense of free speech starting again on the left. Possibly. I see a little southern happening. I did Jonathan Haidt heterodox and some of the other organizations you're involved in in fire. There is this group of people kind of making a comeback on the left. I'm not so sure it can hold, I hope it can hold. Um, but what do you make of how this sort of bounces back where sometimes free speech is something that the left holds more deer. Sometimes it's finding the right holes, more deer and it kind of switches as the decades go by

Speaker 2:          00:37          perspective. And I'm not far be it for me to pull out the age card, but I think a sign a few more decades than you have. And, and that it's been a constant, that was very well summed up by Nav handoff from you would have loved, I don't know if you've ever crossed paths with him. Um, but he was a great free speech, stalwart and he wrote a book whose title really says it all freedom of speech for me. But not for the how the left and right. Relentlessly sensory each other. And he wrote that decades ago. But it's always been true that most people being human believe in free speech in general. But yeah, those ideas that they hate or despise or think are dangerous should be the exception. Let's go back to Skokie. Where ACL, you members, even 15% of these die hard stalwart ACL you members.

Speaker 2:          01:33          I'm not surprised that the one exception they want to make is for speech. That's Dan and grading, civil liberties and human rights. But I had a friend who was the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship and she put it so well, she said, Nadine, everyone has his or her Skokie. So at particular times, I can tell you for every year I can tell you this was the one exception or maybe more than one exception that liberals wanted to make. And this is the one that can serve as wanting to make. And I would say in general, you know, like, um, uh, let's amend the constitution so that it is a crime to burn the American flag that has been supported by many, if not most conservatives and by a lot of liberals as well. Uh, that and there's not been, I think that is the single most hated expression in my lifetime because no other expression has led to a constitutional amendment coming within a hair's breadth of being ratified more than two thirds of the Senate. I'm sorry, of the House approved. It came within one vote short of two thirds of the Senate and more than three fourths of the states. So all of it.

Speaker 1:          02:52          That's not my long. When was that? Maybe that was mid nineties. Yeah, something around there. Wow. That's incredible actually if you think about it. Yeah. Where, where do you think Trump kind of fits into the general discussion? Cause I see, look, it seems to me that there is obviously some sort of authoritarian bent to him. That being said, we're not being, people are, as far as I know people are being jailed because of free speech at the moment. Do you think our institutions let, let's say that his worst critics, he's, uh, we're write about whatever they think about him. Do you think our institutions at this point are strong enough to ward off that kind of threat? And we don't even have to make about Trump specifically, but if there was truly like a real authoritarian in office, do you think that the, the way our balance of powers in our separation of powers works?

Speaker 2:          03:38          And again, I would have to say, you know, Trump has certainly, um, done a lot of saber rattling on free speech issues and you know, said that flag burners should be deported. But let us not forget that Barack Obama was responsible for, uh, the most stringent enforcement of the espionage act and you know, press pressing criminal charges against more whistleblowers than all pre or prior administrations they added together. So, uh, again, a pox on both your houses. So far the courts have been a wonderful bull work. The flag burning example is, is a really good one. It was a a two supreme court decisions joined by both conservatives and liberals on the court that struck down under the first amendment laws that criminalized desecrating the American flag while the Supreme Court doesn't have quite the last word, a constitutional amendment could overturn it. But I have great confidence that this court would continue to uphold what has been called the bedrock principle of freedom of speech. And that is viewpoint neutrality. I summarized it earlier that the mere fact that the viewpoint is hated, whether it be flag burning or whether it be racist speech, that is never a justification for censorship. Again, they unanimously endorsed that last summer in a hate speech case.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Yeah. It looks slightly shift for a second. So when you were the head of the Acl, you, what are the political pressures that you're under that maybe the average person wouldn't know from the, from the headlines, like involvement with Po, you know, politicians with lobbyists, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          05:22          So at the ACL you was at his, and I was personally involved in, in lobbying and testifying. I still do, uh, testify before Congress occasionally. Uh, and I would say to me it was a very privileged position because we did not have to be directly concerned about partisan political pressures. We could simply make alliances and work with anybody that we thought could support an issue that, uh, advanced our cause, even if we disagreed with on other issues. And I remember, uh, to me it was a great source of pleasure. I remember on one piece of legislation testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the chair was Orrin Hatch and the ranking a minor minority member was Ted Kennedy and they were both supporting the same pro civil liberties position. And I was testifying together with the head of the National Association of evangelicalism and the head of the Mormon church. And despite all of the differences on so many other issues, the fact that we could make common concern that was on principles of religious liberty and freedom of thought and freedom of belief, that's what I feel is deteriorating a little bit.

Speaker 2:          06:45          Uh, so last year I testified a couple of times on campus free speech issues and the bipartisanship had really worn down even though the theme was freedom of speech on campus. And even though the chair of the committee who was Lamar Alexander Republican and Patty Murray, the ranking member Democrat, they were both really solid and great on the issue. But the other members of the committee just used it as opportunities to trot out their own ideas of which free speech, uh, was bad and should be suppressed. So some of the Republicans were saying taking a knee by athletes should be punished. And some of the Democrats were really saying Trump is violating free speech and there's too much political grandstanding. Right. And that's why for as critical as I am for the left, I don't want free speech to become, I don't want it to be a political issue in the first place.

Speaker 2:          07:40          I don't want it to be that the right, which at the moment I see more tolerance related to diversity of ideas. I don't want that to be the home. I want there to be a balance. Otherwise, we're just going to end up in that, maybe be a little bit skeptical, but I think that people tend to be result oriented and that, uh, on the right, there may be much more support for freedom of speech on campus because they see that it's views on the right that are being squelched. Now, in fairness, I'll give you a counter example. Many years ago during this first surge of political correctness on campus, Mitch Mcconnell, um, well let me, let me, let me put it backwards. Um, it was Henry Hyde, I'm sorry, a conservative Catholic from Illinois who was completely on the opposite side of the Aclu on abortion and gay rights.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Um, he really was so strong on campus free speech that he sponsored a bill that would have required all private universities to respect the same free speech rights that public universities are required to observe under the constitution. Many people don't know this, but the constitution only applies to government, including state universities, but not private university. How did you guys feel about, well, we totally supported the ledges. Again, that would be a difference. We train libertarians and civil libertarian, my libertarian friends would say, you know, keep the government out of it. Let the private institutions decide. And there were exemptions for religious institutions. But basically I think that's where I would fall on this. So sell me, sell me your way. It's a very interesting debate and I can understand, but the person, and you know, I've had this discussion with my dear friends at the Cato Institute for many, many years now.

Speaker 2:          09:28          What's the difference between a classical liberal or libertarian and civil libertarian? Uh, I think that we are less opposed to government regulation when it is in the service of regulating very powerful private sector actors that for all practical purposes, the way we were talking about civil society earlier can exercise coercive power that stifles people's liberty. So, so what if you, uh, you know, a few, if we did not have the 1964 civil rights act than even the most powerful large landlord, employer, corporation, private university or etc, would be able to discriminate on the basis of race or gender under federal law, they still can on the basis of sexual orientation. I would view that as something that could and should be remedied through passing a statute, making that illegal. Hmm. So usually report into, well I think, well first of all, I agree with you, your basic premise here, just at the idea level, it's a great place for a rich conversation.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Yeah. The idea that the government would be coming in and telling private schools, even though I understand what you're saying, that they would have to adhere to these codes even if I, it being the first amendment. Yeah. I don't necessarily think of private schools should have to do that. I just think that ultimately the market would just, you'd either decide you want to go there or don't want to go there. This one, this one's definitely a tough one. It's an interesting one and I definitely can see the other side and I certainly would insist on some exemptions. Uh, certainly for religious schools. I think military schools were also exempted. But then I want to give you another example of a Republican that I worked with, Mitch Mcconnell, uh, worked very closely with the Aclu in opposing, and many people are going to be surprised to hear this.

Speaker 2:          11:27          Um, the McCain fine gold law, a campaign, so-called campaign finance, the ACL, Ooh, very, you know, we are the ones who argued Buckley versus Valeo and arguing that the ability to spend money in order to promote a message is protected free speech. And it should be protected even when speech is engaged in by people who are organized into a group and including if they're organized in the form of a corporation or a union or not for profit corporation. So some liberals are really distressed by that position and I think it's absolutely the correct one anyway.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Um, what, what do you say to those? Those liberals are the lefties who do get more upset about that in general, that you're just going to allow corporations to endlessly pour money in the system and manipulate the system. And that's it.

Speaker 2:          12:21          Well, the track again, what is the lesser of two evils? Would I rather have the government telling corporations such as the Acl, you and planned parenthood and the Sierra Club, you name your favorite left wing, so called cause. And it is organized in corporate form and the HCLU under that law was it would have been a crime to go on the airwaves and by name call on people who are running for federal office and say, you know, repeal the Patriot Act. Uh, because arguing for issues over the broadcast airwaves was a crime under that water and spending your own money to advance your own issue oriented message. So I think people are shocked when they hear what the law actually did and are persuaded that in at least some applications that went too far. Well, McConnell became such a supporter of free speech as a result of working on this issue that he actually changed his position on the flag burning amendment. He had been a big proponent of it and as having seen how important freedom of speech was, including for what to liberals is a very controversial form of speech, namely spending money in the political process. Um, he said, well, you know, I've got to stick to principles here and, um, we should not amend the constitution to outlaw another controversial expression. So I thought that was a really wonderful idea of not just being result oriented toward your own ideological concerns, but seeing their overarching principle and following it.

Speaker 1:          14:07          It's almost like if you actually have the debate, you might change people's mind and be surprised to your, your ally suddenly, or is there any country that is protecting these rights? Uh, better than we are known for as screwy as our system may be.

Speaker 2:          14:21          No. Uh, well let me make eye on sexual expression that United States is a much more repressive than a European, uh, some many European countries. But like in what regard? You mean with what can be seen in magazines? There's living, yeah, so we still have a, I mean, not only sexual expression, but four letter words. I mean, thank goodness we're not rod casting because I still get bleeped even when I tried it. Yeah. Say whatever want here. All seven of them. And, and, and one of them appears, and I'm not even sure if this was one of these seven, but fuck the draft was upheld as of in a very important free speech case. It that by the United States Supreme Court. And it is a case that has ramifications for hate speech as well. But I cannot describe the facts of that case on radio or TV.

Speaker 2:          15:18          And you know, that's laughable in other countries and we still have anti obscenity. Well, I mean, let's not forget that the Brouhaha about the, the wardrobe malfunction at Superbowl, I mean, it's, so we're much more puritanical, but when it comes to political expression, there's no country that gives as much protection as we do, including for hateful, racist speech and misogynistic speech, including four diff defamation, you know, uh, defamatory falsehoods about public officials and public figures. And that's why, uh, there are so many libel lawsuits that are brought in the UK against what would be clearly protected speech in this country. But you do believe in our libel laws here. Uh, yes, I, you know, I, I'm sure I would want to trim them back a little bit, but on the whole were quite protective. So if it's a matter of public concern or public official or public figure, you get quite a bit of leeway.

Speaker 2:          16:24          You can't be held culpable unless you have acted intentionally or recklessly. And I think that's correct. And one of the things, they're pretty specific. Yeah. One of the things that Trump wanted to do as he said, was to reform the libel laws to make it easier for a public official to, to collect damages. And you know, a lot of people say, oh, come on to dean Britain and Germany and France and Canada and Australia. You know, it's not as if they are to tell a Tarion authoritarian countries. But if you read the examples in my book of the kinds of speech that are being punished, even with imprisonment, even with a criminal fines, and that's the tip of the iceberg because for every punishment there is, there are countless numbers of, of self censorship incidents. It would really make your skin crawl. I give examples, no matter what your ideology is, you should find something in there that you would say, oh my goodness, I can't believe it. So, you know, uh, France, a couple of years ago, criminally convicted, they had of a gay rights organization for calling the head of an anti gay rights organization homophobe that was considered to be hate speech. Now, fortunately she wasn't sentenced to prison, but she was subject to a very stiff, fine, $3,500. Uh, and, and, and then you think, what are the ripple

Speaker 2:          17:50          effects of, of that?

Speaker 1:          17:51          Yeah. Have you guys track this case with, uh, the comedian in the UK who had the dog? Oh yeah. Salute. Yes. Then I mean, again, like it's like all right. He, at first he was making a joke.

Speaker 2:          18:04          There's no, there's no exception for humor or satire. Uh, when the new online hate speech laws went into effect in Germany on January 1st, uh, the first person convicted or charged under it was one of the leaders of a right wing party. Not surprisingly, but the very, and then maybe the first two that were charged were from that party. But the very next one was a satirical magazine that was making fun of their statements, mocking them, ridiculing and, and, and, and these laws by being so subjective, can't make the fine distinctions between humorous satire and straightforward advocacy.

Speaker 1:          18:43          Yeah. So my audience knows I'm not big on this. The globalist ideas here, or even the UN I think is mostly a farce at this point. But do we need some sort of Internet bill of rights? I mean, this is a new phrase that seems to be popping up over the last year or so that will uniformly protect people in other country from beer for their ability to say things that are uncomfortable online and be able to tweet things, uh, that, you know, you can't say in Germany, but you can say in the United States,

Speaker 2:          19:11          I think we have to do that on a country by country basis. And I am pleased that there are advocates in other countries that really strongly support freedom of speech, including for hate speech. And I keep putting that in air quotes because it, as I say to that person, and you're at the University of New Hampshire, no, there really is no such thing. And by the way, there a lot of what they said to you, some people would consider to be hate speech too. So that's another argument that you could have made.

Speaker 1:          19:42          Do you realize that's my one regret is at one point when she said to me, I said something about losing Holocaust, uh, family members from the hot guys on both sides. And then later she said they're rolling in their graves over what I'm saying. I mean, try to think like this, if we're really, if we're really gauging the offense meter. Yeah, I assure you there was nothing that I said in those two hours that was more wildly offensive than that. But do I want her jailed because of that? I mean, okay.

Speaker 2:          20:08          Yeah. So I, I really was heartened at how much support there is for the American approach. We were, were often, uh, attacked as being American exceptionalists and it wouldn't bother me if we were the only ones in the, in the world that we're defending our free speech principles as long as that is the right thing to do. But it's interesting that other people having seen, despite the good intentions of sensorium was elsewhere, how they are leading to results that no thinking person should accept and handing over to these online. So here we get to this question again, and I'll put it this way, Dave, what's the lesser of two evils to allow these private, uh, agglomerations of power, uh, Internet companies decide, pick and choose whose speech is allowed and who's not, and enforcing their own concepts of hate speech or pornography or permissible or impermissible nudity to pick just a few examples that they enforce.

Speaker 2:          21:13          Would I rather have them have that enormous power or would I rather have the government say, no, we're gonna check your power to restrict other people's free speech rights? And, and to me, that's a very difficult issue. So that's the, okay, so that's exactly where we were before with the universities. That's where I would say ultimately right now are for, I don't know how many k a Internet companies we have, let's say Comcast. Um, I'm spectrum from their role one. Yeah. You're thinking of the net neutrality issue and I'm thinking of the social media that, you know, the Facebooks and the twitters having these armies of enforcer saying that's hate speech weren't going to take it down. Right. So I guess what I would say is that if there were certain Internet companies that were saying, all right, well we're not going to allow pornography on our pipes or we're not going to allow this type of speaker that was each, I would still prefer that you as the consumer would have more choice than, than the government saying, we have to enforce all these things.

Speaker 2:          22:11          He's way totally. But because of the, because of the Internet, now I know this is a unique situation related to free speech. That's a little, I mean in my ideal world, I'm completely with you. The question is, and I'm not an economist, my husband is, and he tells me that it's very complicated. Have some of them amassed so much power that we should use antitrust type tools to prevent them for it because that, that they are denying us choice through their market power. Right? So this is, there's a great conversation to be had there. This is where my friends had Prager university who I agree with on all sorts of stuff. They were suing Google Youtube over restrictions to their videos, which I was in for because I don't want the antitrust stuff to be in because to me that, that then means you just create a zillion other problems down the road.

Speaker 2:          22:57          But that's a great place for a free speech person and an economist and probably, uh, uh, technology guide all sit down and work this stuff out without choking each other. There was a re to me, really frightening story in the New York Times a few weeks ago featuring, uh, Facebook's deletion center. That's what it was actually called, this huge building in Berlin where they had literally hundreds of people that are looking at individual posts and deciding, should this be deleted? It should it not be deleted. And it was um, you know, and the examples, you, you realize how inevitably subjective it is. Ultimately they took down when they took down this, this, um, comment that was posted by the politician, she was calling certain Muslim men rapists. And the question was, was she referring to the particular Muslim immigrants who were in fact convicted rapists? There was a horrible incident on New Year's Eve a couple of years ago, in which case one would hope that would be protected speech cause she's describing something factual or was she perhaps insinuating that all Muslim men are rapists? Which would not be a generalization that I would find objectionable, but, and, but it would be illegal under German law and the official, you know, these people, it's their whole job to make these decisions. They couldn't agree between themselves. And so of course, if you're not sure which way it goes and you're facing a 50 million euro, fine. If the German government says it is hate speech while guess what? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:37          What do you, what do you think right now is our biggest censorship threat? Where do you think is is coming on the horizon?

Speaker 2:          24:44          I am going to be very general because it's been the same answer I've had throughout my decades of activism, which is lack of public understanding and awareness of what the first amendment is, what it does, protect, what it does, not protect what the rationales are. I truly believe that the more people understand both what the principles are and how we have evolved at toward those principles, through historic experience, that people will be supportive.

Speaker 1:          25:18          So I'm curious, during the whole NFL kneeling thing, I've made a couple of videos about it and obviously we talked about it on the show, but I basically was saying, look, this is free speech working. The president said what? He said, now, I would certainly prefer that the president not call people sons of bitches, right? But he's entitled to free speech. He didn't try to enact a law to stop him, so he spoke. The players could then deal or not Neil. So they were able to do what they wanted. The owners could then, you know, find the players or not. So they got to do what they wanted. The fans could say, I'm going to buy jerseys and attend games or I'm not [inaudible] so everyone speech, actually everyone speech and action was protected. You might have some consequences for it. But to me it was a great example of the whole thing working messy but working. Do you think that is

Speaker 2:          26:07          fair estimation? Totally agree with that. And I had quite similar analysis myself to the disappointment of people who did not realize that the NFL as a private entity has its own rights, including its own free speech rights. And I thought it was interesting that some of the owners said they would allow their players, uh, to express their, their protests.

Speaker 1:          26:29          He's in that case though, is Trump getting it as close to where it could be an issue for the ACL, you or other similar organizations as he can without directly calling for a law because there is some other, I don't even know what that is, but there's something else happening there. When you,

Speaker 2:          26:45          he's calling, he were threatening if he were threatening to pass a law. And he did that in one other context. I think he threatened that there should be some f an FCC license should be taken away from some broadcasts or that comes much closer to the line and the principal, Dave, you're exactly right. He does not give up his free speech rights by virtue of being a government official. But if he is speaking in official capacity, um, and threatening some adverse consequences that could be seen as an abridgment of free speech under which would violate the first amendment. Exactly. Yeah. So in the past, I think the closest supreme court case we have is where a government commission wrote a letter that threatened that it would take some action and even though it wasn't starting a prosecution or it wasn't an order to seize the expression, the court said, you know, it was a very functional, practical concept. It would a reasonable person feel deterred in pursuing their free speech after they hear this communication. And again, reasonable people can disagree about what the answer to that is. But that's the question we should put in evaluating whether Trump has crossed the line or not.

Speaker 1:          28:04          So one of the things that I saw when the NFL released its new standard now for next season where the players are allowed to stay in the locker room or not. And again, everyone's choice will, will or will not have consequences. I saw a lot of people that were saying, well clearly the government involved, you know, interfered behind the scenes. Now I know there's no, I know you don't suspect you don't have some sort of insight or knowledge on something like that. That's where there would be a problem though if they were really, you know, behind the scenes meetings where they were saying you're going to institute this new policy and that's it. But beyond that, but short of having that information, everything kind of works.

Speaker 2:          28:39          Yeah. Um, there, there's another analogy I can think of, which is where the government has threatened certain businesses that if you don't adopt a voluntary, uh, restriction on speech, then we're going to pass legislation. So, for example, the movie rating system or a sound recording rating systems that we think these labels are stigmatizing and therefore suppressing certain expression. Uh, I think there's a very strong argument that the only reason this so called voluntary system, uh, was put in place in both businesses is because they knew that if they didn't do it, the government was going to legislate it. Uh, but even that, the Supreme Court never held that that was a illegal censorship.

Speaker 1:          29:27          Yeah. All right, well we can't talk free speech for an hour and not mention the cake. We got to talk about the gay cake. Tell me your thoughts on the gay k.

Speaker 2:          29:36          Okay. It's, uh, I, first of all, I think it involves not expression, which I would define quite broadly. And again, let me talk about the, the, the standard here. Reasonable people can disagree how the standard applies to the facts of the case. Um, so the court has said, and I think this is correct, that something comes, some expression comes or arguable expression comes within the ambit of the First Amendment if it is intended to and can reasonably perceived as conveying a message, at least a general message. So that's the question you would ask about the cake. I think there's at least a plausible argument that the cake is satisfied that standard. Uh, in addition to expression, there's the question of religious liberty, right? Which I defend very strongly, even more strongly than the Supreme Court, which has a quite narrow definition now. Uh, but I think people should not be coerced generally to do something that violates their deeply held religious or conscientious beliefs.

Speaker 2:          30:42          That's only one side of the equation though, because neither free, no speech nor religious freedom is absolute. And in general, uh, the court has said, and I think this is right, that government can restrict those freedoms if it can show that there is a countervailing interests of such compelling importance that can only be advanced by restricting the expression or the belief. Uh, and the countervailing interest is of course the dignity. And equality of a, in this case, gay people, but in past cases, it's been African Americans or women because people have cited who are in business, have a cer asserted religious justifications for not serving members of racial minorities or not treating women equally. And,

Speaker 1:          31:37          but to be clear, that's not what was happening here because they could have walked in and bought any cake off the shelf. A black person, interracial couple could have walked in and bought any cake off the shelf. This was about the specific, uh, act that was going to be paint, you know, painted or whatever they do on the case.

Speaker 2:          31:55          Right. You know, it's interesting. I, uh, and there's another, um, another free speech principle that's involved here, which is that government may not compel somebody to proclaim a certain message that they don't believe in any more than it may stop somebody from conveying a message that they, that they do believe in. Um, so I would say I, I'm, I'm very, I think they're very strong concerns on both sides. So I'm very sympathetic because, let me finish out the other argument. Um, of course, if you are in independent artists that is, you know, only taking assignments on commission, whether it be to paint a portrait landscape or to decorate a cake in a very elaborate way, that's one thing. But if you are doing business with the general public and basically holding yourself out as what the law would call a public accommodation, we're open to all comers, then you may not discriminate on certain bases such as race, religion.

Speaker 2:          33:00          And I think even though you still can, as a matter of federal law, under State Law, uh, in that state and, and, and others, you cannot do that on the basis of sexual orientation. And so I think that very strong countervailing equality principle, I think should, should dominate in this analysis. You actually weren't thrilled with this decision. Well, I was, I was in the sense that there were so many ways that the court could have gone wrong. So many issues. They said that it was, I thought the best thing they could do was to be very narrow. And I actually, if I were writing a brief in the case, that's what I would do too. Because all of these principles are so important. I deeply care about freedom of expression, including the freedom not to be compelled to affirm a message that that violates your beliefs, whether they're religious or conscientious, doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          33:54          Um, but I also deeply believe in equality in the public sphere and the facts were murky. So I think, you know, as I think what happened in past situations with a race and gender, I think, you know, once things, once the immediate resistance died down to uh, the 1964 civil rights act, um, that it sort of worked its way out in a way that is maximally respective respectful of all the competing rights. So I think it's very good to avoid really broad brush holdings that might have unanticipated adverse consequences for other factual situations. That's an interesting take because I saw some people saying, well, they're just sort of kicking this down the road now. But basically you're saying in a weird way, that's the way a functional society works at times. I think, you know, the court sets them general goalposts and then as time goes by, the controversy may die down.

Speaker 2:          34:58          People may figure out how they can live their own lives in ways that they're not going to be bothered by, by the government and not being treated disrespectfully. One of the things that I really liked about the um, uh, opinion in that case and uh, it's so contrasting to what's happening in the European countries that I discuss in my book is that the court talked very strongly about equality and neutrality in many different, sorry, in many different contexts. So not only that you should be treated with equal dignity regardless of who you are, but also regardless of what you believe. So the fact that the court was respectful, both of the equal dignity of the gay couple and have the equal dignity of their religious beliefs and the free speech rights of the baker. I really liked that. I'm, one of the things that bothers me very much about what a is often paraded as diversity on campus is that it only looks at one dimension. It looks at demographic diversity in terms of who you are, but not in terms of of what you believe. And in these European countries that are enforcing hate speech laws, you see them going both ways depending on who's in power. So certain religious beliefs are being punished and criminalize as hate speech if they run against what is a dominant secular orthodoxy in those societies. Uh, whereas in other communities, a certain criticism of religion is treated as hate speech and criminalized when it's the religious, uh, belief that is held by those in dominant power.

Speaker 1:          36:48          I think the main takeaway here is that freedom is messy, but we're doing a pretty decent job of it here. Well, thanks to those who keep agitating, right? Eternal vigilance. There you go. Well, it's been a pleasure chatting with you and for more on a dean, check out her new book, hate why we should resist it with free speech, not censorship. And we're going to link to it right down below.

Speaker 3:          37:17          Yeah.
