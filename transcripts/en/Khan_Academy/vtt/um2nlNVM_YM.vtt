00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:03.020
We want to figure out how
many balloons we have here.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.720
And obviously, we
could just count these.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.190
But now, we have other
ways of thinking about it,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.648
especially because
they're arranged

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:12.030
in this nice array, this
nice grid pattern here.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.830
And the reason why it's
useful to not just always have

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.180
to count it, but to be able
to use little multiplication

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.260
with the number of rows
and the number of columns

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.094
is that you might
run into things

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:22.510
and you will run
into things where

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.340
it's very hard to count each
of the objects individually,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.250
but it might be a little
bit easier to count the rows

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.940
and to count the columns.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.229
So for example,
right over here, we

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.900
see that we have
1, 2, 3, 4 rows.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:47.230
And we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 columns.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.950
So you could view this
4 as an array of objects

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.300
where we have 4 rows.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.570
Let me write that down.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.975
We have 4 rows and
we have 7 columns.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.420
And you might already
remember that we

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.130
can calculate the
total number of objects

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.420
by multiplying the rows
times the columns-- 4 rows

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.320
times 7 columns.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.340
Now, why does this work?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.850
Why will this give us the
actual number of objects?

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.760
Well, we could view
this-- we have 4 rows.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.730
So we have 4 groups of things.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.764
And how many things are
in each of those rows?

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:30.930
Well, the number of columns.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
We have 7 things in each of
those 4 rows-- so 4 groups

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.250
of 7.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.000
Or you could view it
the other way around.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.630
You could view that
each column is a group.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.700
So then you have 7 groups.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.651
And how many objects
do you have in each?

00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:47.150
Well, that's what
the rows tell you.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.250
You have 4 things in
each of those columns.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.759
And we already know that
both of these quantities

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300
are going to find the exact same
number, the number of things

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.890
that we have right over here.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.780
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.592
4 times 7 is equal to 7 times 4.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:06.050
And there's a bunch
of ways that we

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.510
can calculate
either one of these.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.680
We can skip count by 4.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:19.027
We say 4 times 4, 8,
12, 16, 20, 24, 28.

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:19.610
And let's see.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.901
Let me make sure that that's 7.

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:26.490
So 4 times 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7-- so we get 28.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.640
We could just calculate that
there are 28 objects here.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.580
And likewise, we
could skip count by 7.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.300
So we could go 7-- 7 times 2
is 14, times 3 is 21, times 4

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.870
is 28, just adding
seven every time.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.416
And so we could get
28 the other way.

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:45.790
Let's do that in
that same color.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.327
We could get 28 the other way.

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:51.660
But if you had a situation
where you didn't know-- where

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.250
you either didn't want
to do these techniques

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.890
or it had been hard
to do these techniques

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.550
or you didn't know what 4 times
7 was off the top of your head,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.110
which you should know at
some point in the very, very

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.030
near future.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.030
Is there any way to break
this down to something

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.520
that maybe you do know or maybe
that's a little bit easier

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.820
to compute?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.420
Well, you could
realize that 7 columns

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690
is the same thing as 5
columns and then 2 columns.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.370
So you could view 7
columns as 5 columns--

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.470
so this is 5 columns right
over here-- plus 2 columns.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:40.740
So that's just like
saying that 4 times 7

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.390
is the same thing
as 4 times 5 plus 2.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.450
And all I do is I replace
the seven with a 5 plus 2.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.540
7 has been replaced
with a 5 plus 2.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.370
Now, why is this interesting?

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.200
Well, now, I can break this
up into two separate arrays.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.760
So I could say,
well, look, there's

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.590
the array that has 4 rows and
2 columns right over here.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.649
And then there's the array that
has 4 rows and 5 columns right

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.380
over here.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.079
So how many objects
are in this one,

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.150
in the yellow one
right over here?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.680
Well, there's 4 times 5 objects.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.955
So there's 4 times 5
objects in the yellow grid

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:37.360
or yellow array.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.930
And how many in this
orange-ish looking thing?

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.050
Well, there's going
to be 4 times 2.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.310
And if we take the sum
of the 4 times the 5

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.580
and the 4 times the 2,
what are we going to get?

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.800
Well, we're going to
get the 4 times the 7.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.680
We're going to get the
4 times the 5 plus 2.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.649
So if we take sum
of these things--

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.440
and we want to do the
multiplication first,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.189
so I'll just put a
parentheses around that

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.440
to emphasize that--
this is going

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.490
to be the same thing as
these things up here.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.870
And so you might say, oh,
well, I know what 4 times 5 is.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.330
4 times 5 is 20.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.680
4 times 2 is 8.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.360
20 plus 8 is 28.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.460
And you might say,
OK, Sal, I get it.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.830
4 times 7 is 28, which is the
same thing as 4 times 5 plus 2.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.170
And I see that that's the same
thing as 4 times 5 plus 4 times

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.670
2.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.003
And actually, this is called
the distributive property--

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:47.200
that 4 times 5 plus 2 is
the same thing as 4 times 5

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.190
plus 4 times 2.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.472
But I could just do one
of these first techniques

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:53.180
you talked about.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.560
Why is this
distributive property

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.310
that you just showed me
useful for computing or doing

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.040
multiplication problems?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.210
Well, let me give you a
slightly more difficult one.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:20.850
Let's imagine you wanted
to multiply 6 times 36.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.580
Actually, I don't need to
write that parentheses.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.020
So how could you do this?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.850
Well, you could decompose
36 into two products

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.410
or into two numbers
where it's easier

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.800
to find the product
of that and 6.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.620
So for example 36, is the
same thing as 30 plus 6.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.118
So this is going to be
equal to 6 times 30 plus 6.

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:50.900
And what's this going to be?

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.650
Well, we just saw.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.990
6 times these two things
added together first,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:07.300
this is going to be equal to
6 times 30 plus 6 times 6.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:20.750
Notice, we distributed the
6-- 6 times 30 plus 6 times 6.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.520
Now, why is this useful?

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.410
Why was this useful at all?

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.160
I'm going to put
parentheses to emphasize.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.490
We're going to do the
multiplication first.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.700
In general, when you see
multiplication and addition

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.359
in a row like this,
or division, you

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:34.650
want to do your multiplication
and division first, then

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.710
do your addition
and subtraction.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.690
So what's 6 times 30?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.200
Well, this is
easier to calculate.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.410
6 times 3, we know to be 18.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.220
So 6 times 30 is
going to be 180.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.140
And 6 times 6-- well, we
know that's going to be 36.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.200
So this is going
to be 180 plus 36.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.390
And what's that going to be?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.790
180 plus 36-- well,
0 plus 6 is 6.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.950
8 plus 3 is 11.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.880
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.390
So you just figured out that
6 times 36 is equal to 216.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.115
And what we just did with
the distributive property,

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:14.740
this is actually
going to be how you're

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.040
going to multiply all sorts
of larger numbers, way larger

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.340
than what we just saw.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.620
So the distributive property,
which hopefully you're

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.850
pretty convinced by, based
on how we broke things up,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.750
is a super useful
thing as you want

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.429
to compute larger
and larger numbers.

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:30.470
And you're going to find
it even more useful when

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.870
you go even further in
your mathematical career.
