you<00:11:58.690><c> know</c><00:11:58.810><c> you</c><00:11:58.870><c> can't</c><00:11:59.140><c> can't</c><00:11:59.890><c> can't</c><00:12:00.070><c> do</c><00:12:00.400><c> too</c>

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
bad but i think again the key thing that
keep<00:12:03.070><c> idea</c><00:12:03.700><c> behind</c><00:12:04.030><c> mark</c><00:12:04.510><c> was</c><00:12:04.900><c> this</c><00:12:05.410><c> notion</c>

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
keep idea behind mark was this notion
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.830 align:start position:0%

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:04.690 align:start position:0%
fact that it's running and it was cool
 

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.130 align:start position:0%
fact that it's running and it was cool
it<00:13:04.750><c> look</c><00:13:05.170><c> really</c><00:13:05.440><c> interesting</c><00:13:06.030><c> again</c><00:13:07.140><c> that's</c>

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.140 align:start position:0%
it look really interesting again that's
 

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
it look really interesting again that's
more<00:13:08.620><c> like</c><00:13:08.680><c> 1986</c><00:13:09.670><c> this</c><00:13:10.630><c> is</c><00:13:10.900><c> mock</c><00:13:11.170><c> running</c><00:13:11.500><c> on</c><00:13:11.620><c> a</c>

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:11.650 align:start position:0%
more like 1986 this is mock running on a

more like 1986 this is mock running on a

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:27.850 align:start position:0%
it pops up here this is mock running on
 

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.870 align:start position:0%
it pops up here this is mock running on
a<00:13:28.330><c> Macintosh</c><00:13:29.190><c> back</c><00:13:30.190><c> this</c><00:13:30.550><c> would</c><00:13:30.700><c> probably</c>

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
a Macintosh back this would probably
 

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.460 align:start position:0%
a Macintosh back this would probably
been<00:13:31.300><c> about</c><00:13:32.100><c> 1988</c>

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:33.470 align:start position:0%
been about 1988
 

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.410 align:start position:0%
been about 1988
I'm<00:13:34.010><c> guessing</c><00:13:34.490><c> 1987</c><00:13:35.500><c> and</c><00:13:37.120><c> again</c><00:13:38.120><c> what</c><00:13:38.300><c> was</c>

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:38.420 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing 1987 and again what was
 

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.330 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing 1987 and again what was
interesting<00:13:38.660><c> about</c><00:13:38.960><c> this</c><00:13:39.320><c> was</c><00:13:39.620><c> just</c><00:13:39.980><c> that</c><00:13:40.190><c> we</c>

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:40.340 align:start position:0%
interesting about this was just that we
 

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.970 align:start position:0%
interesting about this was just that we
could<00:13:40.580><c> do</c><00:13:40.790><c> it</c><00:13:40.940><c> and</c><00:13:41.120><c> that</c><00:13:41.180><c> we</c><00:13:42.170><c> were</c><00:13:42.440><c> able</c><00:13:42.620><c> then</c>

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:42.980 align:start position:0%
could do it and that we were able then
 

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
could do it and that we were able then
to<00:13:43.010><c> layer</c><00:13:43.460><c> the</c><00:13:43.760><c> entire</c><00:13:44.120><c> Mac</c><00:13:44.480><c> OS</c><00:13:45.200><c> operating</c>

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.540 align:start position:0%
show that it actually worked it actually
 

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.750 align:start position:0%
show that it actually worked it actually
worked<00:14:14.720><c> pretty</c><00:14:14.810><c> well</c><00:14:15.190><c> then</c><00:14:16.190><c> in</c><00:14:16.310><c> fact</c><00:14:16.490><c> this</c><00:14:16.730><c> is</c>

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
worked pretty well then in fact this is
