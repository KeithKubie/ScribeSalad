In the first video
on Social Security,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.340
I keep talking about how the
tax that you pay for Social

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.189
Security is called the FICA tax.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.410
What I want to do in
this video is, one,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.310
let you know what FICA actually
stands for, and then think

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.470
a little bit about how it
is actually calculated.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.740
So first, what
does it stand for?

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.368
Literally, it just stands for
Federal Insurance Contributions

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:25.867
Act.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.830
That's the acronym.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.200
And so it'd be FICA,
and then some people

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.060
will call it FICA tax.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.290
And this isn't just to
support Social Security,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.590
or to be technically correct,
to support the old age

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.630
survivors and
disability insurance.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.770
Part of FICA tax is for that,
and part is for Medicare.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.070
And so to make things
clear, the part

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.770
that is Social Security,
or what we associate

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.836
as Social Security, which
is really the OASDI--

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:57.710
did I get that right?

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.540
OASDI.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.450
So part of it is
for Social Security,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.600
and then that part is
12.4% of the gross salary.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.300
But half of this is paid
for by the employer,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.356
half is paid by the employee.

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:14.980
And we'll do a
calculation in a second.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.050
So 6.2% and 6.2%.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.460
The part that's paid
by the employer, that's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.730
part of the payroll tax,
stuff that the employer

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.690
pays above and beyond
the gross income

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.190
that they're giving
to the employee.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.940
And we'll do that
calculation in a second.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
The other thing that FICA
tax is used for is Medicare.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.030
And this is for a total amount
of 2.9% of an employee's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.940
gross salary, or 1.45% from the
employer as part of the payroll

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.330
tax and 1.45% from the employee.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.910
And if you add
these two things up,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.880
you get 15.3% total FICA tax.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
15.3% where, once again, half
is paid by the employer and half

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.007
is paid by the employee.

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.590
Now, let's just do a calculation
so that it makes a little bit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.110
more tangible sense
of what I'm even

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.170
talking about with
this FICA tax.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.470
So let's imagine that
you make $100,000 a year.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.690
And it's a nice number,
because it makes the math easy.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.997
Then your employer--
employer, employee,

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:19.080
let me write it like this.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530
Employer, employee.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.160
So for Social
Security, your employer

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.340
will contribute 6.2% of this.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.810
So above and beyond paying
the $100,000 gross salary,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.930
they will also pay
6.2%, or $6,200.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.250
And the employee
will also pay $6,200.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.540
And that will be deducted
from their paycheck,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.400
so what they get will
be net of the $6,200.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.030
And then for Medicare--
let me do that in pink.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.940
Then for Medicare,
the employer will

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.980
contribute $1,450,
once again above

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.860
and beyond the gross
salary of $100,000.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.490
And the employee will pay $1,450
out of their gross salary.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.680
So the total amount that
is paid by the employer

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.790
is $7,650 in payroll tax
for this one employee.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.690
And the total amount
by the employee

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.070
is the exact same
amount, $7,650.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.050
So just to be clear, if you
wanted to hire an employee

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.230
and pay them $100,000
in gross salary,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.820
you actually would have to set
aside $100,000 and the $7,650.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.460
So the employer-- the
total that the employer's

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:46.070
paying-- or let me just
think of it this way.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.240
The total that the
employer has to set aside,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.130
if you include the
salary, is going

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.460
to be $107,650 so they
can cover the gross salary

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.150
plus this payroll tax over here.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.790
The net that the
employee is getting--

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.020
and actually, this
isn't even the net.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.630
I shouldn't even
call it the net.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.380
The employee, after
paying FICA taxes,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.084
is going to be the
$100,000 minus the $7,650.

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:21.750
But I won't even write
that number down.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.625
I mean, what is that?

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:28.600
That's $92,350,
because that's before

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.560
paying just the
traditional federal income

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.690
tax and the traditional
state income taxes.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.480
So that's going to cut
it down a good bit.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.355
So the employee's going
to take home probably

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:38.920
on the order of
$60,000 to $70,000,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.671
so above and beyond
this thing right here.

00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:42.628
So even though the
employer's paying this much,

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.060
the employee's
getting a lot less

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.860
in terms of what they
get to take home.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.710
Now, one thing that
I think that is worth

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.950
mentioning is unlike
traditional federal income

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.390
tax-- and traditional
federal income tax

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.390
the first several 10s of
thousands of dollars you make

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.150
are not taxed.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.340
And then as you go
up the brackets,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.210
each incremental dollar, as you
enter one bracket or another,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.380
you start to pay a higher
percentage on those.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.540
The FICA tax is
actually very different.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.440
Some people would even call
it a regressive income tax.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.330
And that's because
you only pay the FICA

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.440
tax on the first
$106,000-- or at least this

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.850
is the numbers in 2011.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.500
You only paid on
the first $106,800.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.420
So someone who makes $200,000
will pay the same FICA tax

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.486
as someone who makes $106,800.

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:33.360
So you only pay on the
percentage below that.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.740
And the reason why is that
the person making the $200,000

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.920
will get the exact
same benefits, as well,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.500
as the person who pays $106,800.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.100
And this number, essentially,
they try to index it roughly

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.990
to inflation.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.650
So it will go up over time.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.477
But to some degree, someone
who makes, let's say-- well,

00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:55.060
someone who makes
below this threshold

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.190
is going to pay this percentage.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.602
Between them and
their employers,

00:05:58.602 --> 00:06:00.810
they're going to pay this
percentage of their income.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.430
Well, someone who makes
much more than this

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.760
will actually pay a smaller
percentage of their income,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.100
but they'll end up
getting the same benefits.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.570
And so that's one reason why
it's considered regressive,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.330
is that as you make
more money, you're

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.830
actually paying a
smaller percentage

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.020
of your income on FICA tax.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.880
And the other reason why
it's considered regressive

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.360
is actually on the benefit
side, because obviously someone

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.000
who-- if you have two people
receiving Social Security

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.270
benefits-- so you have
this person-- so this

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.820
is when they turn 65.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.470
Let me put it this way.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.790
So let's say that
you have two people.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.770
They work their whole lives.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.590
And let's say they
both retire at 65,

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.060
although that retirement
age is increasing.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.780
It's slowly being indexed up.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.540
And then they retire.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.601
It's known that the wealthier
people or wealthier--

00:06:45.601 --> 00:06:47.850
and there's also demographics
based on race and things

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.620
like that.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.100
But it's known that wealthier
people actually live longer,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.980
so they actually get benefits
for a longer period of time.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.020
So they're actually able to
get their benefits for longer.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.850
So it depends where
you fall into it.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.050
Likely that even though
there's this cap,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.920
someone higher up the
income chain also probably

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.500
did pay more into it.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.280
But they're also
getting a bigger check

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.450
for paying more into it.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.970
The check that
you eventually get

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.610
is based, to some degree,
on what level of FICA tax

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.290
you were paying.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.520
And they're very
well likely to be

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.730
able to collect these payments
for longer than someone who

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.500
maybe doesn't have quite the
same, I guess, quality of life

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.990
and doesn't actually
live as long.
