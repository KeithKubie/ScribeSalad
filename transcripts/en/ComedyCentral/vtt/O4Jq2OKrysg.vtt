I'd like to have a word with
the birthday boy.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.637 align:end position:100%
Can you young men
go away, please?

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.406 align:end position:100%
[whistles]
Thanks.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.175 align:end position:100%
What did you just wish for when
you blew out the candles?

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.277 align:start position:0%
Nah, I don't think
you're gonna like it.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.279 align:end position:100%
Whatever you wished for,
whatever it was,

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.315 align:end position:100%
I am going to make that wish
come true.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:18.217
(Forrest voice-over)
Eric was understandably hesitant

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.386
to share a secret wish,

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.222
but to make it come true,
I'd have to know what it was.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.458
- What I wished for...
- Yeah?

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start position:0%
was for mom and me
to move back to L.A...

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:22% position:78%
Well...

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.031 align:start position:0%
And to move in with
Joe Dale Jr.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.201 align:start position:0%
Can you really make
that wish come true?

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.569
(Forrest voice-over)
Could I?

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.404
I did not know,

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.540
but this review meant
I would have to try.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.108 align:start size:66% position:34%
That's what you want?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.309 align:end position:100%
You don't want a go-kart
or anything like that?

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:44.644 align:start position:0%
Joe says he has five go-karts
at his house.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.145 align:end position:100%
Oh,
Joe's got five go-karts.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:47.413
Oh, my God.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:48.514
(Forrest voice-over)
This was a devastating,

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.850
punishing, miserable request.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.820
I came here prepared to
build a go-kart,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.189
which would have been
hard enough.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.723
Instead, I would have to try
and convince

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.659
to former love of my life

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.561
to move in with a jerk.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.097 align:start position:0%
[sighs]

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start position:0%
Wow, I was just thinking
about Joe in there.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.734 align:start position:0%
He's fantastic.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.369 size:78% position:39%
What a--what a great guy.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:12.338 align:end position:100%
Yeah, he is great.
I-I really like him.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.439
- Yeah. You do, huh?
- Yeah.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.141 align:start position:0%
So do I.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.442 align:end position:100%
I didn't know if
it was gonna be hard for you

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.311 align:end position:100%
and I was even gonna tell you
beforehand,

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.681 align:end position:100%
but you were out getting shot
or whatever.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.649
- Did you know this?
- What?

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:24.850 align:end position:100%
Okay, so whatever, he's sweet,
he's funny, he's handsome.

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:27.753 align:end position:100%
He's handsome, of course,
but he loves Agatha Christie.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start size:53% position:47%
How cool is that?

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.492
- Unbelievably cool.
- Yeah.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.160
(Forrest voice-over)
Incredibly enough,

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.263
my wise and thoughtful ex-wife
was genuinely smitten

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:40.466
with a man who is capable
of craving a MILF.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.635
But she was still too sensible
to pick up and move

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.737
without an invitation.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.440
For that, I would need to
convince my betrayer.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.376
You guys are basically like my
favorite couple I've ever seen.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.511 align:start size:50% position:50%
I like her, man.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.212 align:end position:100%
Ever since
I started dating her,

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.348 align:end position:100%
whenever I get a little
something on the side,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.483 size:84% position:58%
I feel pretty bad about it.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.253 size:84% position:42%
Did you say that you have
already cheated on Suzanne?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.755 align:end position:100%
Yeah, but I'm gonna
try not to.

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.624 align:start position:0%
Yeah, yeah.
No, that would be great.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.093
(Forrest voice-over)
Joe did not strike me
as a family man,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.128
but I could not give up.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.264 align:start position:0%
You should ask her
to move in with you.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.566 align:start size:66% position:34%
Mm, I gotta tell you.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.636 align:start position:0%
I like to throw
freaky parties, you know?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.738 size:78% position:39%
Like, good-looking women
at the house in the pool.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.373 align:end position:100%
Yeah, I'm glad
you're saying that,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.575 align:start position:0%
because that's how
these guys are as well.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:24.310 align:start position:0%
They love to throw down

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.413 align:end position:100%
with good-look--
good-looking women in the pool.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.483 align:end position:100%
It'll just be the same old
Joe Dale Jr.,

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:33.052 align:end position:100%
just with a loving partner
to come home to

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.620 align:end position:100%
and a little guy
hanging around

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.289 align:end position:100%
who just thinks
the world of you.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.456
- Whoo!
- I can tell you,

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.824 align:start size:66% position:34%
I had that, you know.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.427 align:end position:100%
You could really
literally just

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.497 align:end position:100%
walk down there
and go get it.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.433 align:start position:0%
Cheers, man.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.468 align:start position:0%
Who's ready to play?

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.437
(Forrest voice-over)
I had tried my best
to make a wish come true,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.707
but I doubted that a shallow man
like Joe Dale Jr.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.776
would make this sort of
commitment to a woman

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.511
no matter how great she is.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.447
[dramatic music]

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.717
But a week later, I got the call
that Suzanne and Eric

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.119
were moving in with him
in Los Angeles.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.221
- I got it. I got it.
- Are you sure?

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:09.488 align:start position:0%
I got it. I got it. Oh!

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.623
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got it.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.358
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.160
(Forrest voice-over)
I had fulfilled my son's wish,

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.096
and aside from
the truly awful feelings

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.198
associated with
delivering my family

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.667
into the hands of
a habitually unfaithful fraud,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.303
I can report that
it was satisfying

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:27.039
to see the wish recipient
so happy.

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.075 align:start position:0%
Dad.
What are you doing here?

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.143 align:start size:81% position:19%
Suzanne invited me to stay

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
in one of Joe Dale Jr.'s
guesthouses.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.349 align:start position:0%
Sleeping on the floor
in your office

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.551 align:start position:0%
is just doing a number
on my back.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.487 align:end position:100%
Yeah, Dad, I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.389 align:start position:0%
He's got a pool, son.
