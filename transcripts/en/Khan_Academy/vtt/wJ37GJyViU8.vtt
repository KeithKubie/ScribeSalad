00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.830
This is the video for
the measuring angles

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.630
module because, clearly, at the
time that I'm doing this video,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.950
there is no video for the
measuring angles module.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.330
And this is a
pretty neat module.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.799
This was made by Omar Rizwan,
one of our amazing high school

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.340
interns that we had
this past summer.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.970
This is the summer of 2011.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.540
And what it really is, is
it makes you measure angles.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.310
And he made this really
cool protractor tool here

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.020
so that you actually
use this protractor

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.680
to measure the angles there.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.965
And so the trick here is you
would actually measure it

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:31.080
the way you would
measure any angle using

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840
an actual physical protractor.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.250
You'd want to put the center
of the protractor right

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.710
at the vertex of where
the two lines intersect.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.460
You can view it as the
vertex of the angle.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.060
And then you'd want
to rotate it so

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.160
that, preferably, this edge,
this edge at 0 degrees,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.480
is at one of these sides.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.010
So let's do it so that
this edge right over here

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.890
is right along this line.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.070
So let me rotate it.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.260
So then-- I've got to rotate
it a little bit further, maybe

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.810
one more.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.519
No, that's too far.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.370
So that looks about right.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.110
And then if you
look at it this way,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.734
you can see that the angle-- and
I don't have my Pen tool here.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.220
I'm just using my
regular web browser--

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.680
if you look at the
angle here, you

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.390
see that the other line
goes to 130 degrees.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.050
So this angle that we
need to measure here

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.340
is 130 degrees, assuming
you can read sideways.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.800
So that is 130 degrees.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.407
Let me check my answer.

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:30.490
Very good, I got it right.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.930
It would have been
embarrassing if I didn't.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.060
Let's do the next question.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
I'll do a couple of
examples like this.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.510
So once again, let us put the
center of the protractor right

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.330
at the vertex right over there.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.460
And let's get this
0 degrees side

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.050
to be on one of these sides
so that this angle will

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.820
be within the protractor.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.400
So let me rotate it this way.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.120
And this really is pretty cool
what Omar did with this module.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.450
So let's see.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.490
Let's do it one more time.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.650
That's too far.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.350
And so that looks about right.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.500
And then you can see that
the angle right over here,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.240
if we look at where the
other line points to,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.860
it is 40 degrees.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.910
Check answer-- very good.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.320
Let's do another one.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.995
This is fun.

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:20.870
So let's get our protractor
right over there.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.120
And you don't always have
to do it in that same order.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.615
You could rotate it first
so that the 0 degrees is--

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:27.740
and what you want to do is
you want to rotate the 0

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.240
degrees to one of the sides
so that the angle is still

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.200
within the protractor.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.120
So let's rotate it around.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.746
So if you did it like
that-- so you don't always

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.120
have to do it in
that same order.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.891
Although I think it's
easier to rotate it

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.640
when you have the
center of the protractor

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.260
at the vertex of the angle.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.130
So we have to rotate
it a little bit more.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.400
So 0 degrees is this line.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.250
And then as we go
further and further up,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.660
I guess, since this
is on its side,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.654
it looks like this other
line gets us to 150 degrees.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:59.070
And hopefully you're noticing
that the higher the degrees,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.560
the more open this angle is.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.250
And so this one right
over here is 150 degrees.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.790
And so let's do that-- 150.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's do one more.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.970
Now let me show
you what not to do.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.600
So what not to do
is-- so you could

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.460
put the center right over there.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.150
And you might say,
OK, let me make

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.720
the 0 go right over on
this side, right over here.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.590
So if you did that, notice
your angle would not

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.660
be within the protractor.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.800
So you won't be
able to measure it.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.300
And what you're attempting to
do is measure this outer angle

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.150
over here, which is
an angle, but that's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.740
not the angle that this question
is asking us to measure.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.020
This little arc over
here is telling us

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.220
that that's the angle
that we need to measure.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.810
So that arc has to be
within the protractor.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.620
So let's rotate this
protractor a little bit more.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.810
I overdid it.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.850
And so this looks like
this is 0 degrees,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.770
and then this right
over here is 60 degrees.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.180
60 degrees-- we got
that one right, too.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.980
So hopefully that helps
you with this module.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.290
It's kind of fun.
