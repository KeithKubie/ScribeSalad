00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:38.080
[Remix of the Gravity Falls Intro]

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.520
Okie dokie. Uh...
Dorothy vs Alice.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.080
"Oh dear. l don't think we're 
in G-rating anymore, Toto."

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.500
[stabbing sounds and screaming]

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.900
Very nice, very nice.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.460
Star Wars vs Star Trek.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.280
"Geordi..."

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.240
"I am your father."

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.880
"Oh..."

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.260
"So, you're a black guy?"

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.620
"No!"

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780
"Where on Earth would you get an idea like that?"

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.080
Ash...

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.940
"Pikachu, I choose you!"

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.700
"PIKA!"

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.980
vs Ash.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.180
[chainsaw motor roaring]

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.640
[screaming]

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.780
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.760
[Pikachu squealing in pain]

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.100
Versus battles are everywhere now.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.600
At least...in terms of talking about movies.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.000
Grantedt, here were certainly a few
 in the old days with monster films.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.100
But for years, even when audiences demanded a crossover, it almost never happened

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.520
But nowadays? Producers are finally waking up and using their copyrights wiser--

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.640
Well. For the most part.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.640
--and getting versus battles we always wanted to see...

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.680
Even if sometimes we wish we didn't see them.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.880
So, this NostalgiaWeen l'm trying to
see if l can cash in on the next big fad.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.980
Oh, suck it up!

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.480
[sobbing]

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.760
Pokemon Go fuck yourself.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.820
[cries louder]

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.300
If you're wondering where a lot of this started in recent years, you can make the very real argument

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.580
that it was possibly Freddy vs Jason.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.420
[music]

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.540
Like many franchises, these 
started off from groundbreaking starts,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.020
and deteriorated to ground-burying corpses. *badum tsssh*

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.540
Or... in this case the same thing.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.020
Friday the 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street were horror classics of the 80's that were given so many sequels they became literally comical.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.020
I'm still shocked the poster for Jason Takes Manhattan doesn't look like this.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.720
They got so silly and crowd-pandering that audiences demanded the ultimate crowd-pandering.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.020
After that.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.080
After that too.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.100
Christ, these movies...

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.760
It was bringing them together!

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.760
After years of begging, they finally made it happen.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.820
And who better to take charge of these two classic monsters than the director of Chucky's comeback

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.220
And of course the warm up bad Last Airbender movie?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.100
Let's wrap up NostalgiaWeen with 
one of the biggest horror crossovers ever.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.300
Good guess.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.980
Freddy Vs. Jason.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.420
It opens with Freddy Kruger remembering the good ol' days of the bad ol' days.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.380
"The Springwood Slasher.
That's what they called me."

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.660
"I remember also looking 20 years younger, but my memory's weird that way."

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.180
The parents burn him alive after the justice system lets him go

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.640
and he talks to the audience about what became of him.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.500
"When I was alive...I might have been a little naughty."

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.200
"But after they killed me...I became something much, much, worse."

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.360
"Sequels. Weird...Power-Glove promoting sequels."

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.340
But he brings up that, somehow, 
people have forgotten about him

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.780
and he can't exist if people aren't afraid.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.200
"Being dead wasn't a problem, but being forgotten?! Now that's a bitch!"

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.840
"I've become Basic Instinct 2..."

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.080
"Yeah, that was a thing--

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.620
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT!"

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.280
So, he uses what's left of his power to bring Jason back to make people remember him,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.060
as we're given this pretty classic horror film set-up.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.840
Woman: "Is that you?" [giggles]

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.540
Okay, now this is something I want to introduce to the younger viewers in the audience.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.120
[clears throat]

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.720
This is what they used to call a "Rated R" film.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.280
I know you think the most extreme films go up to PG-13, but there was a day when movies went up to R.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.100
They were called "the Non-Pussy Years," which ironically had a lot more pussy.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.500
Once in a while, there are films that dare to venture into that realm,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.520
but as long as Hollywood thinks 13 is the only demographic that exists, they are but whispers...

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.980
This Elizabeth Banks prototype is, of course, attacked by the resurrected Jason, causing her to hide.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.340
Woman: [pants]

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.860
Nostalgia Critic: 
"Oh, thank god, I thought this tree was a person."

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.800
"I'm...pretty dumb."

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.300
[thud]

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.420
But it turns out, it's just a dream by 
Krueger, who looks like his mother,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.000
who convinces Jason to kill the kids on Elm Street.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.700
Jason's Mother: "The children have been very bad on Elm Street. Make them remember what fear tastes like!"

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.740
Krueger: [laughs evilly]

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.280
Nostalgia Critic: "But, wait...Shouldn't I be on a space station in the future?"

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.620
"And shouldn't you be aware that 
you're a fictional character in a movie?"

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.940
"Quiet or I'll tell the guy who did the 
Last Witch Hunter to give you another reboot!"

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.320
"They're really doing that?"

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.740
"Yeah, sorry, dude..."

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.520
We then cut to a house in 2003 where...

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.240
These characters are inside, playing 
Fuck, Marry, Kill with the Three Stooges...

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.820
[sarcasm] Clearly, someone understands the female teenage mind here.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.700
Kia: "Which one had the super bad toupÃ©e here? This is stupid, y'all!"

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.580
Lori: "Oh, come on!"

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.800
"Is this what we're doin' all night? Cuz, y'all, this is really stank."

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.340
[sighs] Let me guess, she sounds 
like that throughout the entire movie?

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.360
"Drop kick, yo ass."

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.700
"Frou-Frou dogs that keeps humping,"

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.220
"This big ol...come on, get real!"

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.320
"Let's go shake our ass to the dance floor!"

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.160
Mmhmm, and, uh...who wrote this film again?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.860
[ding]

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.420
[sighs heavily] You know...white people, can we just not...white people today?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.560
It's exhausting sometimes, I need a break from us!

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.900
Maybe some of this forced 
exposition will help balance things out.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.320
"No one's ever gonna live up to the 
fuzzy memory of your first love, Lori."

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.600
"You were fucking 14!"

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.580
"Yeah, I know we were young, 
but what Will and I had was real..."

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.240
"Didn't Mr. Real just drop-kick yo ass 
without so much as a goodbye handshake?"

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.960
Christ! Why don't you just pause it and 
show her stats like a video game character?!

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.200
It's much easier to take than 
the "natural human dialogue".

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.880
Kia: "I mean, Lori, you've barely gone out--!

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.460
Lori: "Since what? Since my mom died?"

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.240
Nostalgia Critic: "Or since I realized that itrepresents my broken family character arc."

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.060
"Did I randomly mention that I majored 
in spraying gas barrels and lighting torches?"

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.120
"I hope THAT in no way plays into anything!"

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.020
So, while they all try to figure out which Nickelodeon TV movie they're dressed for,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.340
two of them take their sexcapades 
upstairs where Jason is waiting.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.100
Trey: [screams and groans in pain]

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.980
[loud thud]

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.660
[thump]

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.680
Trey: [Screams]

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.460
[snickers] Okay, I'll give this movie credit.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.480
Murder by bed sandwich is not something I see very often.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.760
[screaming]

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.340
Nostalgia Critic: "Quick! Let's go out in the rain where our clothes can get tighter!"

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.420
"You kids need some assistance?"

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.520
"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK?!"

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.900
The cops think it's more than a coincidence that a murder happened at this house on Elm Street,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.100
But they know even saying Krueger's 
name can give him more power.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.120
"It's gotta be Freddy Krueger--"

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.620
"Hey!"

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.100
"Don't even say that son of a bitch's name out loud."

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.260
"We just took care of our Beetlejuice, 
Voldemort and Candyman problem,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.640
when will people learn names are bad!?"

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.040
They question Lori at the station while the boy hitting on her swears revenge on whoever killed his friend.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.560
"Imma take him out myself, Trey."

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.620
"I swear to God."

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.640
But the deep-fried Sandman comes in to make things worse.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.960
[screams]

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.880
[yells]

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.960
"I'm okay...I'm alright."

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.820
[snickers]

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.540
Well, that was a natural thing to say.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.760
"I'm okay...I'm alright."

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.460
"I just thought I'd calmly alert the audience of that. I'm okay, I'm alright."

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.520
But he seems to catch the same talking to the crowd virus.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.580
"Not strong enough yet..."

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.580
"Well, I will be soon enough."

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.420
"That effect did look pretty lame."

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.600
"I think Link's pixelated shadow would 
have gotten a bigger scare than that."

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.960
"Well, EXCUUUSE me, Princess!"

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.520
But Jason finishes what he started as he cuts off his dad's head so smoothly that it hops off his neck when light touched.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.720
[spring sound]

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.360
Christ! I think Barbie's plastic head is harder to take off!

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.660
[gasps]

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.740
"Oh, but I swore to God that I was going to take out the killer--eh, never mind."

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.240
Talk of the murders reach a mental institution on the acronyms-attempting-to-be-clever news

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.860
where Lori's old boyfriend, Will, played 
by Jason Ritter, watches in horror.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.780
"Come on! Turn it back on, man!"

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.780
"I never ask for anything, just 
turn on the fucking TV, please!"

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.460
"Grunkle Stan is on another killing spree!"

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.340
It's okay, I got a ton of them in my Dipper joke book.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.540
Will and his friend break out of the institution though, to warn Lori and prove they're not crazy...

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.240
...in the most crazy way possible.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.840
Mark: [singing] "One, two, Freddy's coming for you..."

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.920
"Cuz that's when he comes for you, in your dreams."

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.600
"He came back, back for revenge in our nightmares!"

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.120
"I'm Mark, by the way. I'm a friend of Will's, real sweet guy--

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.360
YOU'RE GONNA DIE!"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.260
Will finally shows himself by 
appearing on the other side of the hallway,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.960
Guess...Mark was his opening act?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.880
But she passes out, resulting in her recovering in the nurse's office, where I guess...friends can wait.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.720
[whimpers]

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.600
"Got your nose!"

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.960
[screams]

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.920
"And some shitty CGI!"

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.180
[gasps]

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.980
Nostalgia Critic: "Oh, thank God! 
I just dreamed our effects were that bad!"

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.880
So, Will and Mark go to see what 
they can figure out about Krueger,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.500
but it looks like all the information is not available.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.480
Or...actually it is, they just literally black it all out.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.260
That wouldn't cause any suspicion.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.560
"Uh, excuse me, I noticed everything in this history book about World War ll was blacked out?"

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.740
"Well, that's because it didn't happen."

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.980
"Oh, okay. I totally accept that."

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.580
"Uh, but what about this part where Osama Bin Laden is crossed out in crayon and the World Trade Center is put back where it was?"

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.840
"Oh, that also didn't happen."

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.360
"Got it! Oh, I'm learning a lot today!"

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.700
"Oh, uh, what about this guy and his VP

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.160
claiming they didn't say all these famously recorded things, you didn't block that out."

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.400
"Oh, we don't have to. People just 
believe that one for some reason."

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.900
"Oh."

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.060
"He did sacrifice a lot."

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.260
"He did. He did."

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.780
But Will, strangely enough, 
has a hard time believing all this.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.040
"They never told us about Freddy because that's how they decided to beat him."

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.660
"They locked up all the kids who made contact with him so they wouldn't infect the others."

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.160
"That's crazy!"

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.900
"That's why I broke out! To warn Lori 
about this crazy thing I don't believe in!

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.500
What am I doing again?"

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.380
Insert early 2000 blurry cam film 
makers thought would be cool.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.000
[background rave music]

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.620
"WHOOA, how come I can't focus on anything? AVANT-GARDE!"

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.840
As everyone partakes in a cornfield rave.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.540
[loud techno music plays]

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.640
"Man, this party's awesome! I especially love the crucifying kids over there!"

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.160
Meanwhile, one of the nerdy kids tries 
hitting on Lori but Kia tells him to buzz off.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.960
"You tear me down to make yourself feel better because you really hate yourself,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.680
which is kind of pathetic when you actually stop and think about it, assuming, of course, you can think."

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.560
Nostalgia Critic: "Well, I don't know about you, but that drew me closer to him."

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.400
Kia: "Come on, come on! Let's dance!"

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.440
"Come on, Benjamin! Let's go!"

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.480
"I really dug all that stuff about you saying I'm pathetic. You really know all the lines!"

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.020
Will finds Lori though and approaches her.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.920
They seem though to have a hard 
time figuring out what's going on.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.780
"Police have been acting really 
weird like they know something and--."

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.960
"Where was your dad?"

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.200
"What is going on, Will?"

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.680
"Look, four years ago I thought I--."

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.940
Kia: "Oh, enough of this bullshit talk! Let's go shake our ass to the dance floor!"

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.700
"Come on!"

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.960
[sputtering]

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.160
Screw murder, man! Dance! It's all about the dancing!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.820
Haven't you learned that getting our priorities straight has never been a priority?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.760
So, Freddy tries to go after a passed-out girl in her dreams,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.980
--funny...because being drunk stops REM sleep--

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.780
but Jason kills her in the real 
world before he can get to her.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.420
"She's mine!"

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.840
"Mine!"

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.960
"MINE!"

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.760
"It's like an intern eating the last doughnut at work."

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.760
"RUDE!"

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.480
Some other teens see Jason and light him on fire, but that just makes him mad.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.420
[terrified screaming]

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.500
I got nothin' to say. This is awesome.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.420
[screaming]

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.320
The teens escape just in time for Will to reveal a big secret.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.320
"The reason I was sent to Weston...is because I saw your dad kill your mom."

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.600
"Will, my mom died in a car accident..."

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.200
"She stabbed herself repeatedly while driving."

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.180
Yeah, I'm not even kidding.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.880
He talks about how he sees her get stabbed several times yet the official cause is "car accident."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.440
How does anyone believe these half-assed cover ups?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.940
Sylvester hiccuping yellow feathers would have a better cover up than you!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.020
"You can't trust him, Lori! Whatever you do, don't go home with him!"

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.080
Lori's Father: "See? You didn't understand! You still don't! You were confused!"

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.040
Lori: "Stop it! Both of you, stop it!"

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.620
Nostalgia Critic: "Both of us? I'm being choked! What am I supposed to stop, breathing?"
