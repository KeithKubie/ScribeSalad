00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.868
- [Narrator] For my next bite,
I'll take some of this bread

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.990
break off a piece of a
kebab and then I'm gonna add

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.823
in some of these onions and sumac.

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:16.115
This is one of those pieces of meat

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.806
that deserves a moment of silence.

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:21.139
(pop music)

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.982
Good morning everyone it's Marc Wiens with

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:28.832
migrationology.com in Istanbul, Turkey.

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:29.910
Good morning Ying.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.423
- Good morning.

00:00:31.423 --> 00:00:32.693
- It is

00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:34.267
a beautiful day outside.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.913
The buses are running.

00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:37.884
The streets are not deserted.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:39.460
It is still pretty quiet.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.825
But it is a completely different scenario

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.562
from 24 hours ago.

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:45.218
So we're gonna make a move

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:47.575
and go have breakfast.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:48.632
Do you want it over?

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.299
- Yeah.
- [Marc] Okay, thank you.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.535
We are on our way to a (mumbling)

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:55.927
to a breakfast restaurant.

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:58.260
(pop music)

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.213
Okay.

00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:09.927
That was a very short
ride, about five minutes

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:12.537
and we got dropped off in (mumbling).

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:14.963
This is an amazing
little neighborhood area

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:17.401
with narrow lanes, lots
and lots of restaurants

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.712
and cafes.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.054
And, we were here the
other day in the evening,

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:23.894
and it was busy and packed.

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:26.605
This morning it is quiet and peaceful.

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.684
I'm so glad we decided to
come out for breakfast today.

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:32.710
I did not want to leave
Istanbul without having another

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.604
Turkish breakfast, and today
is our last full day here

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:37.893
tomorrow we leave in
the middle of the day.

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:40.218
I want to give a shout
out to Tuba from both

00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:42.241
fruityhub.tv, and also

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.658
IstanbulFood.com.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.828
She recommended this
place for breakfast, so

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:49.993
I'm really glad that we
had a chance to come here

00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:51.952
and that they are open this morning.

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:55.091
And I just ordered
another Turkish breakfast.

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.424
Okay, thank you.

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:02.973
Whoa, that's a huge dog.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:07.088
The other day

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:08.826
when I had Turkish
breakfast, I ordered the

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.602
(foreign language), which
is the scrambled eggs.

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:13.143
But today I went for more
of the fried egg version.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:15.480
And I saw braised beef on the menu

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.219
and I couldn't resist.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.031
It came to our table and
it was just sizzling away.

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.521
You could see the butter
and the fat boiling

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.452
and bubbling over.

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:26.890
And the whole egg was
kind of like pulsating

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.348
and it almost looked like a heartbeat.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.916
And then there's some braised beef on top.

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:34.750
And then there's a sprinkle
of, I think, chili flakes

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.353
and maybe zatar, or some kind of herb

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:38.593
sprinkled on top.

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:41.852
And, that looks like a wonderful egg dish.

00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:43.660
Break off a piece

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.087
and I want to dig right
into the middle where that,

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:48.537
where all that spice is.

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:49.370
Ohhh, yes.

00:02:51.027 --> 00:02:53.445
Oh, and I love how the
egg is just cooked like

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:55.535
half way cooked, so it remains raw.

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:57.702
And almost like gravy-ish.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:02:59.589
Okay.

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.589
Beef, oh look at that wonderfulness.

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:09.942
Oh yeah.

00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:14.676
Wow, that's good.

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:16.281
I think there's some
cheese in there, is there

00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:17.521
cheese in there too?

00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:18.862
That's like

00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:19.779
melty eggs.

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:22.461
Like, half liquid

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.005
and half cooked.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.115
And then

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:28.907
it's salty, the beef is really tender.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.971
And you've got that hint of like a

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.824
an herb, I think thyme flavor.

00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:35.653
I think I may have been
mistaken on my first bite,

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.147
I don't think there's
actually cheese in there

00:03:37.147 --> 00:03:39.676
but I think that cheese
flavor might almost come

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.998
from the yolk and the butter.

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:45.189
That is so wonderfully good,
mixed within this egg dish.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.439
One more bite before I proceed onwards.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.011
That is a, a hearty egg dish.

00:03:58.011 --> 00:03:59.738
And this is another very
common thing that you'll find

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.036
for Turkish breakfast,

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:02.511
it is clotted cream

00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.321
with honey on top.

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:08.154
And, so you kind of get
a combination of both.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:13.606
Wow.

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.272
Yeah.

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.649
That is quite a contrast
from the salty eggs.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.342
But that sweet honey

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.413
and then just that really

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:24.200
it's almost like whipped
cream, but just condensed

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.426
into a buttery consistency.

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.843
This one is the white cheese.

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.384
And I think I'll eat that with an olive.

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:41.865
Mmm.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.865
Just a sensational trio.

00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:48.105
- [Ying] What's that?

00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:48.938
- Is that a cat?

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:50.917
- [Ying] Yeah.
- That just licked my leg.

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:52.157
- [Ying] (mumbling)
- Where did it go?

00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:55.184
As I was taking that sip a tea a cat just

00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:58.263
came up and licked my
jeans, I think. (laughs)

00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.512
And then it disappeared.

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:02.123
I have a slice of tomato.

00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:03.505
Oh, and I think there's
a little bit of olive oil

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:04.338
down here.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:07.366
Mmm.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.341
Tomatoes are so good in Turkey.

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.774
I'm gonna add this chili to
the eggs, put that in there.

00:05:13.774 --> 00:05:16.192
Break off a nice piece of bread.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:18.009
And I'm gonna make this bite count.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.312
I'm gonna make it a nice and big bite.

00:05:21.312 --> 00:05:22.723
Ohh, this egg dish

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.694
is just impressively good though.

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.299
Ohhh, look at that.

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.466
Okay. (laughs)

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:29.825
There's like half an egg yolk in here.

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:31.573
Chilies, and braised beef.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:33.989
One more thing to add to
this bite before I take it.

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.010
Gotta hit that with some pepper.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.543
Oh yes.

00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:39.534
And I may as well pepper my whole eggs

00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:40.867
while I'm at it.

00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:54.621
That is amazing.

00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:57.210
That was another amazing
Turkish breakfast.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.779
And this is the type of
ambiance and the hip place

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.745
that you just, you don't even
want to move after you eat.

00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:04.554
You just want to sit
here and relax and enjoy

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:07.161
the ambiance, the street,

00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.078
the other cafes around.

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:12.771
This is an awesome, awesome place.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.104
(pop music)

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:20.184
Beşiktaş is such a cool neighborhood.

00:06:20.184 --> 00:06:23.862
I'm loving just walking
around the narrow streets.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.230
There's so many restaurants and cafes.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.457
There are markets.

00:06:27.457 --> 00:06:28.608
There's street food.

00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:31.074
Great places to just sit and hang out.,

00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:32.449
or to people watch.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.782
(pop music)

00:06:37.424 --> 00:06:39.680
(foreign language)

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.566
- [Marc] Thank you.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.841
We're on our way walking to the Bosphorus

00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.304
and we're gonna take the boat.

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:46.885
But I decided to get a quick simit.

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:49.282
This is something you will see everywhere

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.867
walking around Istanbul.

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:53.894
This is one of the most
popular snacks on the go,

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:55.101
or light meals.

00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.860
It's available throughout the day.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.705
It's kind of similar, in
appearance, to a bagel.

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:01.928
It is a circular shaped piece of bread.

00:07:01.928 --> 00:07:04.862
And this one is topped with
sesame seeds, and yeah,

00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:07.108
literally everywhere you go in Istanbul

00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:10.441
you will see carts set up selling simit.

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:14.412
Yeah.

00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:16.861
It's just plain

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:20.580
but the, what I like about
it is the sesame seeds.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.026
The sesame seeds give it
that extra flavor and touch.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.826
The texture is a little bit chewy.

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:26.634
And, a little bit dry.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:28.967
(pop music)

00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.316
We made it to Beşiktaş
Pier and we're gonna take

00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:37.663
the boat across the
Bosphorus to Istanbul today.

00:07:37.663 --> 00:07:39.996
(pop music)

00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:45.709
Thank you.

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:48.042
(pop music)

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:00.936
Istanbul is the only city in the world

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:03.589
that is divided between two continents.

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:06.157
Or, can I say, straddled
between two continents

00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:07.571
with the Bosphorus Strait.

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.399
And so we've been on the
European side for our

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.656
entire trip so far.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:13.164
And yesterday, I had
planned to go and spend

00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:15.686
the entire day on the
Asian side of Istanbul.

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.807
When things didn't turn
out quite so planned.

00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:19.891
But that is okay.

00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:21.509
This morning we are on the boat now

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.397
and we are heading to Asia.

00:08:23.397 --> 00:08:25.369
Across the Bosphorus Strait.

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:28.730
We're on a boat that's gonna
take us to (foreign language).

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.063
(pop music)

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.095
Welcome to the Asian side of Istanbul.

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:17.876
And we are gonna walk around this area.

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:20.672
It was exactly one week ago today

00:09:20.672 --> 00:09:23.557
that we were in Mumbai,
and we took that ferry

00:09:23.557 --> 00:09:24.885
to the island.

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:28.190
This was a completely
different ferry experience

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.532
from in India.

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:30.771
Both amazing.

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.742
I will link that video below

00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:35.239
if you haven't already seen it.

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:36.417
Ahhh.

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:39.415
This is a very nice and
very peaceful neighborhood.

00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:41.324
We are now walking down the street

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:44.047
and on our way to Kadikoy Market.

00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:46.547
(world music)

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:07.239
Oh Ying, this is what I
want to eat, this fish here.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.476
We made it to Kadikoy Market.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:12.370
And we are in the fresh market section.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.393
It's a little bit quiet
today, because it's Sunday

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:16.384
and I read that some shops don't open.

00:10:16.384 --> 00:10:19.298
But it's still a wonderful
market, an open air market.

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:22.714
Lots and lots of colorful
vegetables and fruits.

00:10:22.714 --> 00:10:25.222
There are lots of olives and fish.

00:10:25.222 --> 00:10:26.532
The fresh fish.

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:27.852
Oh, look at all this produce

00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:30.037
and these wonderful fruits.

00:10:30.037 --> 00:10:32.719
Look at all those cherries.

00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.261
And then if you walk

00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:35.758
a little bit up the hill a little bit,

00:10:35.758 --> 00:10:38.357
you come to lots and lots of clothes shops

00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:40.277
and cafes, and restaurants.

00:10:40.277 --> 00:10:41.670
Can I have one kilo?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.503
- [Man] Okay.

00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:43.640
- [Marc] Of cherries.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.282
- [Man] (mumbling)

00:10:46.282 --> 00:10:47.865
- [Marc] Thank you.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.406
Ying and I have been
loving the cherries so far

00:10:52.406 --> 00:10:53.869
since being in Istanbul.

00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:56.307
Just the other day we
bought a kilo of cherries

00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:57.315
which we finished.

00:10:57.315 --> 00:10:59.354
So we saw the cherries here and had to get

00:10:59.354 --> 00:11:01.104
another kilo of them.

00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:04.218
Look at these beauties.

00:11:08.924 --> 00:11:09.757
Mmm.

00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:11.972
They're so juicy.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.055
And so plump.

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:15.726
Hello, thank you.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.237
There's so many different
types of pickles in here

00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:21.919
and many different chili
pastes, as well, and olives.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.452
- Pickle juice?
- [Marc] Yeah, pickle juice.

00:11:23.452 --> 00:11:24.285
Yes, okay.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.914
I think just one.
- One.

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:28.081
- [Marc] Yeah.

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:32.493
Thank you.

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:35.114
I saw this in a TV show about Istanbul.

00:11:35.114 --> 00:11:36.524
Drinking pickle juice.

00:11:36.524 --> 00:11:38.577
And so I was just walking
through this market

00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:39.796
I saw this pickle shop.

00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:42.631
I came inside and asked
him for some pickle juice.

00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:46.131
And he just gave me a cup of pickle juice.

00:11:49.884 --> 00:11:51.316
Oh, wow.

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:53.847
Yeah, that is straight up pickle juice.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.447
That is sour and salty.

00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:57.280
Hooo.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.138
That will wake you up in the morning.

00:11:59.138 --> 00:12:00.638
I kind of like it.

00:12:03.232 --> 00:12:04.065
Ho.

00:12:04.065 --> 00:12:04.898
Thank you.

00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:08.342
Don't let the color of this fool you.

00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:11.675
Although it looks like grapefruit juice.

00:12:14.265 --> 00:12:16.257
It is absolutely nothing

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:18.564
like grapefruit juice.

00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:19.661
Ho, that's like

00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.661
that tastes very like

00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.704
kind of cleansing and like

00:12:23.704 --> 00:12:25.188
energy filled though, because you've got

00:12:25.188 --> 00:12:26.741
all those salts in there.

00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:28.317
The sourness.

00:12:28.317 --> 00:12:29.625
It's like a

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:32.708
a powerful concentrated energy drink.

00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:38.017
Ha.

00:12:38.017 --> 00:12:40.211
I think I got my sodiums in for the day

00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:42.751
just from that one cup of pickle juice.

00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:45.453
But I won't deny, I enjoyed that.

00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:47.786
(pop music)

00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:00.271
(mumbling)

00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:06.142
Sardine grilled, scorpion fried.

00:13:06.142 --> 00:13:08.392
(mumbling)

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.366
- [Marc] Hamsi grilled.

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:12.626
- [Man] Okay.
- [Marc] Hamsi grilled

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:13.709
and also the.

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:15.499
Ying (foreign language)

00:13:15.499 --> 00:13:16.727
We walked through the market

00:13:16.727 --> 00:13:17.865
that was very enjoyable.

00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:19.482
And then we came across the street

00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:21.055
to a different neighborhood.

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:23.545
And we are now sitting
down at a restaurant

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:25.748
called Balikci Lokantasi.

00:13:25.748 --> 00:13:28.876
And this restaurant
specializes in seafood.

00:13:28.876 --> 00:13:29.945
After walking through the market

00:13:29.945 --> 00:13:32.261
and seeing that selection of seafood

00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:33.988
I wanted to eat seafood so badly,

00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:35.776
so we're at the restaurant now.

00:13:35.776 --> 00:13:38.641
And I ordered some anchovies.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:41.567
To begin with, we have this
beautiful plate of salad.

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:43.404
There is parsley on here, there's lettuce,

00:13:43.404 --> 00:13:45.209
there's cucumbers and carrots and tomatoes

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:48.637
and, I'm gonna squeeze on the lemon.

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:52.220
Just let me start with
a bite of the salad.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.793
Mmm.

00:13:58.268 --> 00:14:00.421
There's arugula down there too.

00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:02.148
Oh, that's nice.

00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:05.420
I absolutely love the
rocket, or the arugula.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.250
It just, it gives salad an extra flavor

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.583
that is so good.

00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.803
Wow, that smells incredibly good.

00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:21.734
This is a dish that I really wanted to try

00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:22.901
at this restaurant.

00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:24.599
There are cubes of fish

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:27.410
and it came in this, I think it's a clay

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.371
a clay little vessel.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.365
It came just bubbling over.

00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:33.812
The aroma of this is
incredible, you can smell

00:14:33.812 --> 00:14:35.083
all those onions.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.029
You can smell like an herb,
maybe some thyme in there.

00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:41.524
And there are tomatoes
in here, there's chilis.

00:14:41.524 --> 00:14:44.537
Wow, this is just amazingly

00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:46.235
amazingly smelling.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:48.003
Oh, there's even some mushrooms in here.

00:14:48.003 --> 00:14:52.170
Okay, I'm just gonna take
a straight up bite first.

00:14:54.952 --> 00:14:55.785
Mm-hmm.

00:15:00.887 --> 00:15:02.470
That is really hot.

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:06.822
And incredibly good.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.237
That's almost like lava,
down there. (laughs)

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:12.091
But that is wow, that's unbelievable.

00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:13.412
Oh, that's so good.

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.490
It's salty.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.157
It's, I think that's

00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:18.592
is that all butter?

00:15:18.592 --> 00:15:19.731
Let me just see.

00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.426
I think that might all be oil, or butter.

00:15:22.426 --> 00:15:25.796
But it just provides an
immense amount of flavor.

00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:27.879
You can taste the, maybe a little bit of

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.454
black pepper in there.

00:15:29.454 --> 00:15:32.439
You can taste the herb in there.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:34.706
The tomatoes, the caramelized onions.

00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:37.002
The onions are a little bit sweet.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.029
Wow.

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:39.095
That is remarkable.

00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:39.928
I think

00:15:39.928 --> 00:15:41.980
it would be good with a
little squeeze of lemon.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.165
And the fish itself is also really good.

00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:45.180
It's

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.238
very soft.

00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:47.483
But not

00:15:47.483 --> 00:15:49.001
like starchy or mushy.

00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:50.301
That is superb.

00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:51.134
Get some bread

00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:53.903
go ahead and dip into
that butter and the fish.

00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:55.236
With that lemon.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.055
And those onions.

00:15:58.055 --> 00:16:00.055
Those onions are insane.

00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:08.744
Okay.

00:16:08.744 --> 00:16:11.579
This is one of the best dishes
so far I've had in Turkey.

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:13.772
And also, the other dish that I was

00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:16.017
really looking forward to, and I'm glad

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.394
I have a chance to try
it in Turkey is hamsi,

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.950
which are anchovies.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.960
And I got the grilled version.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.900
Looks like they kind of
butterfly cut the anchovies.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.854
And maybe there's a very light breading

00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:27.764
or batter on them, before being fried.

00:16:27.764 --> 00:16:29.247
Or these are grilled, yeah.

00:16:29.247 --> 00:16:30.698
And then they sprinkle
them with some chili

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:34.782
and some, I think it's
an herb, or maybe zatar.

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:37.361
And, I'm just gonna try
one of these guys first.

00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:39.528
Put this down on my plate.

00:16:50.032 --> 00:16:51.657
Oh yeah.

00:16:51.657 --> 00:16:54.583
Anchovies are a beautiful thing.

00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.903
Mmm.

00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:59.784
Has just a very faint bitter taste to it.

00:16:59.784 --> 00:17:02.127
But then they're really
soft, really tender.

00:17:02.127 --> 00:17:05.948
They have a little bit
of a crispy exterior.

00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:10.115
And then just a very light
finish with that herb and chili.

00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:14.532
Anchovies are a wonderful
thing from the sea.

00:17:14.532 --> 00:17:16.548
They also dished us this side plate

00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:18.231
and I think this is the

00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.223
maybe this is roasted chilies in tomatoes,

00:17:20.223 --> 00:17:21.427
I'm not totally sure.

00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:23.401
And then, I'm not sure what that is.

00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.636
I'll try this thing, which I'm not sure of

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:27.053
what it is first.

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:33.694
It doesn't really have a smell at all.

00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:34.982
Ohh.

00:17:34.982 --> 00:17:36.272
I think that's eggplant.

00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:37.249
Roasted eggplant.

00:17:37.249 --> 00:17:39.625
And then this one, I've had
it a number of times already

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:42.146
so far being in Turkey.

00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:43.813
And it is marvelous.

00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:51.480
I think it is red chili.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.873
It's a little bit sour.

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:54.711
And there's like a, I
think it's a really nice

00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:55.961
parsley flavor.

00:17:57.798 --> 00:17:59.964
I'm honestly not sure if this is oil,

00:17:59.964 --> 00:18:02.035
like olive oil, or butter.

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:03.195
But it is so good.

00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.930
Now I'm just trying to
fish out all of the rest

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.556
of those herbs and onions.

00:18:06.556 --> 00:18:08.889
And also the garlic in here.

00:18:12.703 --> 00:18:13.780
That's so good.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.146
This was one of my
favorite dishes so far this

00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:18.148
entire trip to Istanbul.

00:18:18.148 --> 00:18:19.498
Wow, that was good.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.305
I just paid, and we were about to leave

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:24.081
but then they gave us a
cup of tea and some dessert

00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:26.641
to try, so that is very kind of him.

00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.458
I don't know the name of this, but I think

00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:30.651
I've had versions of it.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.614
I think it's semolina.

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:34.319
And then served with bananas.

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:36.239
Let me taste a bit of this

00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:37.406
with a banana.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.133
Mmm.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:44.265
Yeah, I think that is semolina.

00:18:44.265 --> 00:18:46.518
It has a grainy texture.

00:18:46.518 --> 00:18:48.389
A little bit of a honey like sweetness.

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:50.941
And with that banana, it
actually accompanies it

00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:51.774
very well.

00:18:51.774 --> 00:18:54.679
If you eat that together,
it's almost like banana bread.

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:56.429
In a different shape.

00:18:58.357 --> 00:18:59.433
Ahhh.

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:00.571
Oh yeah.

00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:02.934
Always good to finish a meal with tea.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.456
That was an amazingly good meal.

00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:07.854
The staff and the owner and the waiters,

00:19:07.854 --> 00:19:10.220
they're all really nice
at that restaurant.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.075
And it's in kind of a really quiet street.

00:19:13.075 --> 00:19:15.817
Very close to Kadikoy Market.

00:19:15.817 --> 00:19:17.931
I found that restaurant
just by doing a quick

00:19:17.931 --> 00:19:20.042
Foursquare search in this area.

00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:23.193
And I wanted to find
somewhere that served hamsi

00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:25.498
which are those anchovies.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.176
The anchovies were good.

00:19:27.176 --> 00:19:29.553
But that black sea salmon

00:19:29.553 --> 00:19:32.011
turned out to be the
absolute winner, one of the

00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:34.185
best dishes, maybe the
best dish I've had so far

00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:35.677
in Istanbul.

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:37.070
That was amazing.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.403
(pop music)

00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:51.516
We're getting back on the boat

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:53.106
heading back to the other side

00:19:53.106 --> 00:19:54.570
back to Europe.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.903
(pop music)

00:20:19.847 --> 00:20:22.396
And I'm not really sure
why, but both times we took

00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:24.410
the boat, it was free,
there was no charge.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.462
I'm not sure if it's just today

00:20:26.462 --> 00:20:28.328
or if we got on the free boat.

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.607
I don't know, but it was free, both times.

00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:33.886
We decided to take a
little stroll up the hill.

00:20:33.886 --> 00:20:37.058
We're now in the vicinity of Galata Tower.

00:20:37.058 --> 00:20:39.789
(world music)

00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:42.654
We have come to the base of Istakal Street

00:20:42.654 --> 00:20:44.819
and there's one thing we just got to do.

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:47.083
I'm gonna pass the camera to Ying

00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:49.471
and I'm gonna be the victim.

00:20:49.471 --> 00:20:51.971
(world music)

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:58.919
You want vanilla or chocolate?

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:01.031
- Vanilla, chocolate, lemon.

00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:02.381
- [Ying] Vanilla.

00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:03.462
- Vanilla please.

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:04.669
- Vanilla please.

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:06.836
(singing)

00:21:29.883 --> 00:21:34.050
- He's so fast, I don't
even know what's happening.

00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:40.858
(foreign language)

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.227
(singing)

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.988
(laughing)

00:21:50.464 --> 00:21:52.631
(singing)

00:21:55.722 --> 00:21:57.972
(laughing)

00:21:58.911 --> 00:21:59.744
- Taste.

00:22:04.927 --> 00:22:05.760
- Mmm.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.483
- Taste.
- I think I got it now.

00:22:09.483 --> 00:22:10.399
(laughing)

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:12.866
I'm not totally sure,
but I think I've got it.

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:15.832
Even though you see the
ice cream man dishing

00:22:15.832 --> 00:22:18.474
out the ice cream and
playing with their customers

00:22:18.474 --> 00:22:21.400
when you're actually the victim of it

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.582
(laughs) you really don't
even know what's happening.

00:22:23.582 --> 00:22:25.165
They're so fast.

00:22:25.165 --> 00:22:26.488
And, it's pretty awesome.

00:22:26.488 --> 00:22:28.142
It's such a sticky ice cream.

00:22:28.142 --> 00:22:29.933
I got a few licks of ice cream

00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:31.506
when we was dishing it out to me.

00:22:31.506 --> 00:22:33.712
But let me taste it really now.

00:22:33.712 --> 00:22:36.629
(drumming)
Oh yeah.

00:22:37.652 --> 00:22:39.088
Mmm.

00:22:39.088 --> 00:22:41.298
Yeah, it's such a sticky
ice cream, it's almost like

00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:43.715
it has some elasticity to it.

00:22:44.692 --> 00:22:46.859
(singing)

00:22:49.484 --> 00:22:50.999
Whoa.

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:54.749
Yeah, it's so sticky,
it's like dough almost.

00:22:55.704 --> 00:22:56.537
Wow.

00:22:58.028 --> 00:23:00.111
(laughs)

00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:02.702
- Yay.

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:07.467
(kissing)

00:23:07.467 --> 00:23:09.550
(laughs)

00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:15.272
- (laughs) Thank you.

00:23:16.872 --> 00:23:19.248
Thank you.
- [Marc] Thank you.

00:23:19.248 --> 00:23:21.078
Every time I'm walking past

00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:23.444
and I see somebody orders
ice cream like that

00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:25.194
you always see them getting played with.

00:23:25.194 --> 00:23:27.823
And so you think you know
exactly what they're gonna do,

00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:29.866
but they fool you every single time.

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:30.964
(laughs)

00:23:30.964 --> 00:23:32.385
(foreign language)

00:23:32.385 --> 00:23:33.524
How's the ice cream?

00:23:33.524 --> 00:23:34.702
- Ay, it's good.

00:23:34.702 --> 00:23:36.214
- Yeah, it's a really sticky ice cream.

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:37.860
It almost has like a

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.797
a mozzarella cheese, but
we got the vanilla flavor.

00:23:40.797 --> 00:23:43.386
It's almost a mozzarella cheese flavor.

00:23:43.386 --> 00:23:45.734
And a little bit of an
elasticity, as well.

00:23:45.734 --> 00:23:47.267
Or some serious
elasticity, that's how they

00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:49.270
can play with it so much.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.098
(pop music)

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:56.084
This is the restaurant we
are looking for right here.

00:23:56.084 --> 00:23:56.917
Hello.

00:23:56.917 --> 00:23:58.625
- Are you Marc?
- [Marc] Yes.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:23:59.458
- How are you?

00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:00.383
- [Marc] How are you?

00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:01.510
- Fine, thank you.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.912
- [Marc] Did David?

00:24:02.912 --> 00:24:03.939
- Yeah.
- [Marc] Send you a message?

00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:04.780
- He send me a message.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.736
- [Marc] Okay. (laughs)

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:06.599
- And also some pictures.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:08.517
- [Marc] Okay.

00:24:08.517 --> 00:24:09.350
- This way.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.449
- Thank you very much.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:11.964
Hello.

00:24:11.964 --> 00:24:14.574
Oh yes, he said this is the best

00:24:14.574 --> 00:24:15.804
for the kabob.

00:24:15.804 --> 00:24:18.137
(pop music)

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:39.787
I am sitting here

00:24:39.787 --> 00:24:42.644
bar side, watching him grill the meat.

00:24:42.644 --> 00:24:45.963
And the smoke coming off
the aroma of that meat

00:24:45.963 --> 00:24:49.052
and just the expertise
of how he is grilling it

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:50.210
is incredible.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.850
For the kabob, he mixed the
minced meat with the spices

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.148
right there before he
put it onto the sword.

00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:56.723
And then he put it onto the sword

00:24:56.723 --> 00:24:59.385
and then stuck it straight
onto the hot charcoal.

00:24:59.385 --> 00:25:01.121
This is an incredible experience.

00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:04.079
This restaurant is
called Zubeyir Ocakbasi.

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:08.163
And this is a style of
kabob and a style of grill

00:25:08.163 --> 00:25:11.036
where they have, it's
right, the grill is right

00:25:11.036 --> 00:25:12.357
in the center of the restaurant.

00:25:12.357 --> 00:25:14.217
And then there's this like metal chimney

00:25:14.217 --> 00:25:15.924
which goes up through the roof.

00:25:15.924 --> 00:25:17.924
And that is the centerpiece
of the restaurant

00:25:17.924 --> 00:25:19.924
and that's where all the meat goes down.

00:25:19.924 --> 00:25:21.703
That's where all the meat is grilled.

00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:24.802
And that, it's almost like
a vacuum, it just sucks

00:25:24.802 --> 00:25:27.513
up all this smoke, and
just, it's incredible.

00:25:27.513 --> 00:25:30.317
It keeps the fire so stoked and so hot

00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:31.760
as it grills the meat.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.255
We got a lamb kabob.

00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:34.453
We got some chicken.

00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:36.323
We're gonna get some lamb chops, as well.

00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:38.810
And then also he roasted
some chilies and tomatoes.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.695
Look at that, you can actually still see

00:25:41.695 --> 00:25:44.003
all of the spices mixed in.

00:25:44.003 --> 00:25:45.953
There's maybe that's some parsley.

00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:48.281
You can see the little
chili flakes in there.

00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:49.987
I have to begin with a kabob.

00:25:49.987 --> 00:25:53.998
And I am just gonna go
pure meat on this bite.

00:25:53.998 --> 00:25:54.986
Wow.

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.518
Look at how tender that is.

00:25:56.518 --> 00:25:58.306
Oh, it's so tender, it
actually just falls apart

00:25:58.306 --> 00:26:00.074
in your fork.

00:26:00.074 --> 00:26:00.907
Oh wow.

00:26:11.614 --> 00:26:12.864
Oh my goodness.

00:26:15.014 --> 00:26:16.181
That's absurd.

00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:20.480
Oh, that is

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.874
that is unbelievably flavorful.

00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.253
Oh, it's salty.

00:26:25.253 --> 00:26:28.506
You can taste the lamb
flavor and the lamb fat.

00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:31.952
Oh, and that like extra smokey fire

00:26:31.952 --> 00:26:34.552
it just gives it like this incredible

00:26:34.552 --> 00:26:38.350
like depth of smoke embedded
into the minced meat.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.891
I have had kabobs before, but I have never

00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:42.566
had a kabob like that.

00:26:42.566 --> 00:26:46.483
For my next bite, I'll
take some of this bread.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.557
And then break off a piece of a kabob.

00:26:52.581 --> 00:26:54.015
It's so tender.

00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:57.064
And it definitely has a
high fat content in there

00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:59.665
because it is so just packed with flavor

00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:01.299
and juicy.

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:03.696
And then I'm gonna add
in some of these onions

00:27:03.696 --> 00:27:04.529
and sumac.

00:27:17.146 --> 00:27:18.914
That is meat sensation.

00:27:18.914 --> 00:27:21.271
Next I'm gonna try this eggplant salad.

00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.333
Roasted eggplant.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:23.769
I'll take some of that bread.

00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:27.019
And just scoop, scoop a bit of this up.

00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:31.052
Mmm.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.085
That is fantastic too.

00:27:35.085 --> 00:27:36.502
Extremely creamy.

00:27:37.606 --> 00:27:39.636
And I think there is some
chilies in there, too.

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:41.913
I think that's, could that all be parsley?

00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:43.945
And then tomatoes.

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.778
Ah, this is beautiful.

00:27:50.415 --> 00:27:52.262
I think that's a balsamic

00:27:52.262 --> 00:27:54.179
and olive oil dressing.

00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:57.961
But really like densely flavorful.

00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.606
And then, diced up tomatoes.

00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:02.138
And I think that's parsley.

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:04.393
I'm gonna move a chili, one of these

00:28:04.393 --> 00:28:06.232
roasted chilies over my plate.

00:28:06.232 --> 00:28:07.513
Oh.

00:28:07.513 --> 00:28:10.846
And also one of these scorched tomatoes.

00:28:12.593 --> 00:28:14.259
Open up this.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:19.045
I really love these fire-roasted
chilies and tomatoes.

00:28:19.045 --> 00:28:22.462
I just got to have a piece of that chili.

00:28:25.506 --> 00:28:27.463
That fire-roasted flavor

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:29.252
they're soft on the inside

00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:33.337
and have that skin, that like burned skin.

00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:35.837
Oh, that's very like crackery.

00:28:38.132 --> 00:28:38.965
Mmm.

00:28:38.965 --> 00:28:40.521
Yeah, that's like a

00:28:40.521 --> 00:28:41.938
a very paper thin

00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:44.898
almost cracker like crispy.

00:28:44.898 --> 00:28:46.970
And then I think it's topped with

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.465
dried chili flakes.

00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:50.070
Or maybe a chili paste.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.237
And some kind of herb, maybe
either parsley or cilantro.

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.689
This restaurant is known for their kabobs

00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:01.781
but I think they are most well known for

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:03.161
their lamb chops.

00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:05.662
So the lamb chops have arrived

00:29:05.662 --> 00:29:09.073
and these are fresh off the
grill, just moments ago.

00:29:09.073 --> 00:29:11.383
Oh these are, I can't wait.

00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:12.466
I can't wait.

00:29:15.729 --> 00:29:16.562
Ohh yes.

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:22.234
Oh, look at that, get a
close up of this interior.

00:29:30.651 --> 00:29:31.484
Oh yeah.

00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:34.105
That is remarkable.

00:29:35.886 --> 00:29:36.719
Wow.

00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:41.147
That is impressively good.

00:29:41.147 --> 00:29:42.721
Oh, I don't even barely
know how to describe it,

00:29:42.721 --> 00:29:43.804
it's, oh wow.

00:29:44.915 --> 00:29:46.613
You can taste the pastures.

00:29:46.613 --> 00:29:48.065
You can taste the pastures.

00:29:48.065 --> 00:29:50.686
Maybe with some onions on this next bite.

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:51.701
Set this down.

00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:54.334
And I think that is a little layer of fat

00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:55.834
on the edge there.

00:29:58.284 --> 00:29:59.910
And I will

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.063
these are some, it's definitely

00:30:02.063 --> 00:30:04.005
expertly grilled and seasoned.

00:30:04.005 --> 00:30:05.272
But at the same time,

00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:08.272
this is some very good quality lamb.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:14.715
Yeah.

00:30:14.715 --> 00:30:16.236
Wow.

00:30:16.236 --> 00:30:17.069
That is a

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:22.938
a very a lamb chop that
you'll never forget.

00:30:22.938 --> 00:30:24.717
This is Ying's position.

00:30:24.717 --> 00:30:28.536
Ying being (mumbling).

00:30:28.536 --> 00:30:30.133
(foreign language)

00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:31.718
Ending our meal with some watermelon

00:30:31.718 --> 00:30:33.801
and maybe honeydew melon.

00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:39.844
Mmm.

00:30:39.844 --> 00:30:41.775
Nothing like juicy sweet watermelon.

00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:44.355
After such a a meaty, salty,

00:30:44.355 --> 00:30:45.688
marvelous feast.

00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:51.008
That was not only

00:30:51.008 --> 00:30:54.553
one of the more incredible
meat meals that I've had,

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:58.851
that was just an
unbelievable meal experience.

00:30:58.851 --> 00:31:02.122
That food was so good, that
kabob and those lamb chops

00:31:02.122 --> 00:31:04.705
just, mind blowingly delicious.

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:08.400
Special thank you to
Ali, who took care of us

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.833
in that restaurant.

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:10.940
That was fantastic.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.267
And also to Mr. David Dudi,

00:31:13.267 --> 00:31:16.812
Nama, and Honuman, thank you
all for your recommendation.

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:20.796
That was just another just
outrageously good meal.

00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:22.088
in Istanbul.

00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:23.429
And actually today,

00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:27.269
we have had three
back-to-back amazing meals.

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:28.761
This has just been a,

00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.424
this is actually our
final day, tomorrow we are

00:31:30.424 --> 00:31:32.450
going to the airport and
we are leaving Istanbul.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.283
So it is

00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:37.130
it was just an absolute joyful

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.631
last full day in Istanbul.

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:42.324
And I'm gonna, Istanbul.

00:31:42.324 --> 00:31:43.775
(shouting)

00:31:43.775 --> 00:31:45.949
(laughs)

00:31:45.949 --> 00:31:49.687
Some great people and so
much good food in Istanbul.

00:31:49.687 --> 00:31:52.226
